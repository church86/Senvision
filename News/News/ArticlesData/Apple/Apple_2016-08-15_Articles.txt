PREGNANCY BABY TODDLER BIG KID TEEN EDUCATION SPED KIDS WELLNESS FAMILY LIFE CELEBRITY MOMS Daddy iPhone 7 News Update: Dual-Camera System, Pressure-Sensitive Home Button and Waterproof Features Now Leaked By Abbie Kraft, Parent Herald August 15, 01:14 pm TAG iphone, iPhone 7 iPhone 7 will soon make its way into the markets and consumers are eager to know what Apple has in store for them. Several speculations emerged wherein it was stated that the iPhone 7 is designed to be waterproof with dual camera and a pressure sensitive home button. Advertisement Apple is set to release iPhone 7 next month, and Bloomberg revealed that it designed with a pressure sensitive home button and a dual camera. Another major changed that is set for the new iPhone 7 is said to be the removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack which is said to bother consumers. iPhone 7 specs speculations first emerged this June wherein it was mentioned that the new button for the upcoming iPhone will not easily click down once pressed. The new home button will, however, have a haptic feedback, which will provide a haptic feedback giving the sensation of a real click for the consumers. iPhone 7's dual camera is said to be one of the phone's most awaited feature. The camera for iPhone 7 is said to produce a better color production on a single image. A source from Bloomberg who was able to use the prototype mentioned that the image's brightness and low lighting conditions is definitely something iPhone fans could look forward to. The camera will also feature better zoom due to its dual camera sensors. The Verge then added that the smaller version of the iPhone 7 which is only 4.7 inches won't come with the dual camera feature, the unit will have a more advanced feature compared to the latter models. Fans are looking forward to Apple's latest iPhone release, but there are those who expressed their dismay over the headphone jack. It was mentioned that iPhone 7 would no longer have the standard analog jack as Apple is planning to use Bluetooth speakers instead. The removal of the analog jack will pave the way for the phone's second speaker. © 2016 ParentHerald.com All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

Related iPhone 7 release date and pre-order date leaked iPhone 7 to be unveiled Sept. 7 ahead of Sept. 16 release date iPhone 7 preview: Everything Apple will announce next week Video 5 Weirdest iOS Keyboards Apple's highly anticipated iPhone 7 may be coming to stores a little bit later than initially anticipated. If you recall, reputed leaker Evan Blass published a tweet last month indicating Apple's next-gen iPhone was slated to hit store shelves on Friday, Sept. 16. This rumor was seemingly bolstered when Bloomberg indicated that Apple was planning a special media event for Wednesday, Sept. 7. But now comes word via 9to5Mac that Apple's iPhone 7 might arrive a bit later in the month. According to a leaked memo purporting to come from an official AT&T retail document, AT&T has two days pinned down for special merchandising resets: Sept. 9 and Sept. 23. While certainly not conclusive and admittedly speculative, this tends to suggest that pre-orders for the iPhone 7 may in fact begin on Sept. 9, with shipments finally arriving two weeks later on Sept. 23. While a two-week lag time between pre-orders and a new iPhone hitting store shelves may seem a bit long, recall that the window between the iPhone 6s opening up for pre-order and going on sale was 13 days. That being the case, a 14-day stretch isn't unheard of. As to why Apple would release the iPhone 7 so late into September is anybody's guess. Indeed, given how iPhone sales have experienced a bit of a lull over the past few months, one would assume Apple would want to get the device out and in as many hands as soon as possible. Release date speculation aside, the iPhone 7 is said to feature a similar design to what we've seen with Apple's iPhone 6 and 6s models. Some notable tweaks we can expect to see on Apple's next-gen iPhone is the complete removal of the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack and a stationary home button that vibrates when pressed, thereby providing the illusion that the home button is mechanical. With Sept. 7 fast approaching, we can expect an influx of more iPhone 7 leaks in the weeks, if not days, ahead.

Before you know it, the iPhone 7 will arrive. But will Apple's new phone offer enough to get you to upgrade? We're getting a clear picture of what to expect from the next iPhone — including when it will arrive. And so far the rumors have left us feeling a little underwhelmed, with the reported features sounding more like modest improvements over Apple's current smartphone lineup and not the overhaul we've come to expect every other year. In fact, many Apple watchers are suggesting that a more substantial update is in the works for 2017. RELATED: Why Do Apple Releases Generate So Much Buzz? Until then, though, here's what appears to be on tap for the iPhone 7. A Mid-September Release A prominent leaker of phone news says the iPhone will hit retail shelves on Sept. 16. That would be about 10 days after Apple is expected to hold an early September press event to unveil the new Phone. No Headphone Jack Leaked photos and videos all but confirm the iPhone 7 will go without the 3.5mm headphone jack, opting for a slimmer design that requires Lightning-compatible headphones. Dual Cameras for the iPhone Plus More leaks have revealed a dual-lens setup for the larger iPhone Plus, while the iPhone 7 is expected to have a larger lens than what you're used to with the iPhone 6s. Potentially Another iPhone At least one leaked photo depicts a third model that will appear alongside the existing iPhone and iPhone Plus this fall. Dubbed the iPhone Pro, this version would offer improved cameras, a massive amount of storage and a Smart Connector for attaching to accessories and charging devices; others suggest that Apple will stick with two iPhones and that the iPhone Pro is really just the iPhone 7 Plus. A Pressure-Sensitive Home Button Just as the screens on the latest iPhone respond to different presses thanks to Apple's 3-D Touch feature, the iPhone 7's home button will reportedly respond to pressure and provide haptic feedback when you press it. 32GB of Storage According to multiple reports, Apple seems to have realized what the rest of the world has long since concluded — that 16GB is too little capacity for today's smartphones. Built Tougher The iPhone's expected to become more durable, matching the waterproof features Samsung added to its flagship phones. Here's a deeper look at the features currently rumored for the iPhone 7 — and everything we want from Apple's new phone. The iPhone Debuts Sept. 7 The Sept. 7 date comes from a Bloomberg report detailing changes expected for an upcoming MacBook Pro update. But that date isn't exactly out of left field: Apple has held iPhone launch events on Sept. 9 for two years running, so Sept. 7 would be keeping with Apple's usual time frame. RELATED: Apple App Could Turn Strangers into Walking ATMs Expect the iPhone 7 to arrive roughly 10 days later. According to Evan Blass, a leaker of phone news with a good track record of getting rumors right, the iPhone will hit retail shelves on Sept. 16. That's a little earlier than when iPhones normally arrive after an Apple event. Last year, the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus arrived in stores on Sept. 25. But with Samsung already having taken the wraps off the Galaxy Note 7 and other phone announcements expected at the IFA trade show in Berlin in early September, Apple could feel the need to get the new iPhones in users' hands sooner rather than later. No More Headphone Jack What once looked like a far-fetched rumor when Japan's Mac Otakara first reported it now seems pretty much a certainty: The iPhone 7 won't have a 3.5mm headphone jack. Instead, users will plug in headphones through the phone's Lightning port, either with the help of an adapter or with headphones built specifically for the new iPhone. The Wall Street Journal cited sources confirming the headphone jack as a goner, and CAD renders allegedly of the new phone posted on French site NowhereElse.fr depict an iPhone without a 3.5mm jack. Need more evidence? This TechnoBuffalo video shows off a dummy iPhone 7 that only features a Lightning port. Weibo/iappsnews A Dual Camera for the iPhone Plus With the Galaxy S7 overtaking the iPhone as the best phone camera, Apple likely wants to re-establish the iPhone as the top camera smartphone. If reports are right, the company is turning to a dual-camera system to pull that off — at least for some of the new phones. Well-known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo at KGI securities said earlier this year that the iPhone 7 Plus would feature rear cameras with two different lenses to collect more image data. KGI also speculated that the 5.5-inch phone will come with an optical zoom to add 2-3x magnification, as well as optical image stabilization. More leaked photos posted on NowhereElse.fr claim to show the dual-camera setup on the iPhone Plus, as does a leaked photo, allegedly from a presentation by Apple manufacturing partner Foxconn, from the Chinese site MyDrivers. RELATED: Self-aware iPhone Adjusts Based on Locale KGI believes the new camera setup will integrate with LinX camera technology that Apple acquired last year, which would use the data from both cameras to create much higher-quality photos. LinX is an Israeli company that Apple bought last year, which specializes in creating high-definition images out of smaller multi-lens configurations, according to Apple Insider. The two-camera setup is not a new idea for smartphones. The LG G5, for example, uses two cameras that allow you to shoot both regular photos and wide-angle shots with the same phone. The Huawei P9also has two cameras, in this case both backed by Leica, where one camera captures info in monochrome and the other focuses on color. The result is supposed to be an image with the pixel size equivalent of 1.76 microns, which is impressive. The new iPhones are expected to keep the same 12-megapixel sharpness. As for the lens on the iPhone 7, it's likely to be a single lens, but it will be much bigger than the one on the iPhone 6s. Leaked images of the iPhone 7 show a physically larger lens surrounded by a prominent bump. A Third iPhone The working assumption with the iPhone 7 release is that Apple will stick with its current lineup: a 4.7-inch iPhone and a 5.5-inch Plus model. But some leaked photos suggest a third iPhone called the iPhone Pro could be in the works. Photos from NowhereElse.fr support this rumor, where an iPhone appears alongside two models labeled the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7. The iPhone Pro sports a dual-lens camera on its back and a Smart Connect like the one you'd find on an iPad Pro. An earlier image on on the Chinese social networking site Weibo also showed a Smart Connector port on the back of an alleged iPhone. (The Smart Connector could also be featured on the iPhone 7 Plus, should Apple stick to its two-phone lineup.) RELATED: iPhone 7 Will Have the Screen You Want If it exists, an iPhone Pro figures to have a pro-sized price tag. PocketNow spotted pricing chatter on Weibo that suggests a base model iPhone Pro could cost around $850 once you figure in currency conversion and export fees. That's a hefty premium that will require some standout features to get people interested in buying a pro-level phone. However, it may well be that Apple sticks with two iPhone models and that the features slated for the iPhone Pro really just wind up in the iPhone 7 Plus, as Apple looks to distinguish the Plus model from the 4.7-inch iPhone. Home Button Leads Design Changes Apple added pressure-sensitivity to the iPhone's display with the 3-D Touch feature iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. It could pull off the same trick with the iPhone 7's home button, according to a Bloomberg report. Rather than depress, the revamped home button would be able to detect different levels of pressure and provide haptic feedback. Being able to tell the difference between a tap and a hard press could mean new ways of interacting with your iPhone — think of what 3-D Touch's peak and press features let you do on the current iPhone models. It also lowers the risk that the home button could stop clicking if it's damaged by dust or lint. NowhereElse.fr As for other design changes, look for more of the same from the current iPhone lineup. Leaked photos on the Italian site Macitynet suggest the new models will sport the same colors as the current iPhone lineup — gold, rose gold, space gray and silver. That doesn't necessarily preclude other colors from emerging closer to the iPhone's fall release, though. The latest video from TechnoBuffalo suggests the iPhone 7 will look a lot like the iPhone 6s, from its size and shape to its physical home button. Sketches on NowhereElse.fr show the iPhone 7 will have the same 138.3mm height and 67.12mm width as Apple's latest phone. The sketch makes no mention of depth, however, so it's hard to tell whether or not the iPhone 7 will be significantly thinner than the 6s. From the looks of leaked photos and videos, whether on TechnoBuffalo or NowhereElse.Fr, look for the antenna bands to be subtler on the iPhone 7, curving around the top and bottom edges of the phone. MacRumors had originally reported that the plastic antenna bands seen on the 6 and 6s will not be present, giving the iPhone 7 a sleeker look. More Storage on the Base Model The days of having to cram your photos, music and other files into the iPhone's 16GB capacity — or paying up for a model with more storage space — could come to an end with the iPhone 7. When word of the iPhone Pro leaked, it contained another tidbit of information about Apple's fall iPhone lineup: Apple is reportedly boosting the starting amount of storage on the iPhone to 32GB. The Wall Street Journal confirmed those plans, citing a source familiar with Apple's iPhone roadmap. TechnoBuffalo's iPhone 7 video says higher-end models of the iPhone 7 could offer 256GB of storage. All that squares with earlier reports: As noted by 9to5Mac, IHS Technology analyst Kevin Wang has found supply chain evidence that the next iPhone will come with at least 32GB of storage, meaningApple will finally ditch the 16GB iPhone. That will be a welcome addition as 32GB is pretty much the standard for flagship phones these days. Wireless Charging for iPhone? Apple could introduce a new way to charge a future iPhone. The Verge did some digging and found that Apple has ramped up hiring of employees who specialize in wireless charging, including two recent hires from charging startup uBeam. That would square with a Bloomberg report that Apple is looking for ways to wirelessly charge your iPhone from a distance, without having to use a charging mat. Of course, that Bloomberg report speculated such a feature wouldn't be ready into 2017. However, the leaked photo posted on MyDrivers that depicts a dual-lens camera on the iPhone 7 Plus also lists wireless charging as one of the features on Apple's high-end phone. That photo is allegedly from a presentation at Foxconn, which would build the next iPhone, if that lends any weight to the rumor. A More Durable iPhone Water and iPhones haven't mixed, but that could change with the iPhone 7. TrendForce is expecting the new phones to be waterproof, which would match a similar feature that Samsung currently touts for its Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. Certainly, the removal of a headphone port from the next iPhone would simplify waterproofing the device considerably. The MyDriver photo that mentions wireless charging as an iPhone 7 Plus feature also claims that the phone will be dust- and water-resistant for what it's worth. And TechnoBuffalo's iPhone 7 video shows the phone sitting by trickling water, suggesting some water resistance. As for what you could do with a waterproof iPhone, Patently Apple spotted a patent awarded to Apple for a system that lets you take photos underwater. Other Improvements Some of the iPhone 7's improvements are fairly easy to predict. You can probably expect the new iPhone to feature an A10 processor since Apple routinely upgrades the CPU in its phones with each new release. And Digitimes reports that Intel will supply half of the LTE chips for the iPhone 7. Battery life also figures to improve. According to Slashgear, the iPhone 7 could pack a battery with 7.04 watt-hours of power, which would be a big step up from the iPhone 6s Plus' 7.01 watt-hours. The iPhone 6s has 6.51 watt-hours of juice. Both of the latest iPhones trail the field when it comes to endurance. The iPhone 6s lasted just 6 hours and 46 minutes on the Tom's Guide Battery Test, which involves continuous web surfing over 4G LTE, compared to the 8:43 for the Galaxy S7. The iPhone 6s Plus lasted a longer 8:43, but that's no match for the S7 Edge (10:09). The 2017 iPhone Yes, that's right — the iPhone 7 isn't out yet, and we're already talking about the phone coming after that. Yet another research note from KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo forecasts a major overhaul of the iPhone's case slated for next year. According to 9to5Mac's summary of Kuo's note, Apple plans to switch to an all-glass enclosure for the iPhone in 2017. Analyst Mark Moskowitz of Barclays wrote earlier this year that supply chain checks suggested no "must-have form factor changes," according to a report in Fortune. Likewise, the Wall Street Journal's report on the disappearing headphone jack in the iPhone 7 suggests that Apple is holding off on major changes to the iPhone until next year, which coincidentally marks the device's 10th anniversary." All of this could signal a move away from Apple's traditional approach to releasing a major iPhone update one year, followed by a more modest update the following year. Nikkei Asian Review reports that Apple is planning on extending the iPhone's product cycle, meaning the phone maker would go longer between major iPhone updates, a move the publication says reflects a maturing smartphone market where there are fewer earth-shattering enhancements to make. Looking Forward: What We Want The iPhone 6s is Apple's most impressive smartphone yet, with game-changing 3-D touch functionality, fast performance and fun camera features. Still, there's plenty of room for improvement. We hope that reports of Apple upping the storage on its starting model to 32GB turn out to be true. A measly 16GB of space is no longer acceptable for a smartphone — especially now that the iPhone can shoot 4K video. We'd also hope that TechnoBuffalo is right about a 256GB option added to the lineup, as opposed to the 128GB on the top end right now. It also may be time for Apple to embrace sharper screens. The displays on the iPhone 6s (1344 x 750) and iPhone 6s Plus (1920 x 1080) are impressively vibrant, but are starting to show their limitations now that quad-HD (2560 x 1440) comes standard on many Android flagships. Apple would also do well to up its game in the battery department. The iPhone 6s Plus lasted over 8 hours on our battery test — that's enough to get through a workday, but isn't nearly as impressive as the colossal 12-plus hours of juice we got out of Google's Nexus 6P. Lastly, the iPhone 7 could benefit by taking a few cues from the newly released iPad Pro, even if those features only wind up on the rumored iPhone Pro. The addition of multitasking and stylus support could help Apple's smartphone go head-to-head with devices such as the Galaxy Note 5, and would establish the iPhone 7 as a device for power users and mainstream fans alike.

The latest bit of information touts significantly faster charging capabilities for the device.  ( The Malignant | Twitter ) Advertisement Rumors about the upcoming iPhone 7 are pouring strong as the device is expected to come out at the start of September, and a new element recently surfaced. Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus could sport enhanced charging speeds, according to tipster The Malignant, who published the finding in a tweet. #Apple according to the source (导航i世界) seems #iphone7 will support #fastcharge at least 5V2A pic.twitter.com/Lu0AqnVHud — The Malignant (@the_malignant) August 14, 2016 The tipster speculates that the latest installment in the iPhone family will come with "at least" 5-volt 2-amp charging. In order to back the data on something, the user posted an image comparison of logic boards belonging to an iPhone 6s and an iPhone 7. The existing iPhone handsets come with a 1A/5W charger, but for those who want to see them charging faster, a 2.1A/12W iPad adapter is the go-to solution. If The Malignant's tip holds true, the iPhone 7 could sport an even higher charging speed than the one found in the iPad charging adapter. Most users agree that the main problem present in Apple's iPhone models is that the battery life is lackluster. Comparing iPhones with rival flagships, battery life constantly falls behind, showing that Apple is behind the pack in terms of optimizing power management in its smartphones. This is why rumors about the iPhone 7's improved charging have been around for a while, as fans hope that the OEM will address the "wall-hugging" issue. However, seeing how the tidbit of info does not come from a reliable source, we recommend taking it with a grain of salt until official confirmation arrives. The Malignant does have a history of sharing rumors and information that first leak on Chinese social networking sites, mainly Weibo, with some of them being legitimate. What we know from more trustworthy sources is that the new iPhone will feature small design modifications, such as the relocation of antenna bands at the top and bottom edges of the device instead of running across its back. The headphone jack, or rather its absence, has been making headlines for a while now, as the removal of the 3.5mm classic headphone jack could have dire implications on the types of files users are able to play on their phones. Technical specs-wise, the iPhone 7 is said to carry 2 GB of RAM, while the larger variant, the iPhone 7 Plus, was spotted on Geekbench packing 3 GB of RAM. Additionally, a more powerful CPU is rumored to back the processing power of the devices, but details are scarce.

 The Chinese answer to Apple is falling apart Rob Price Aug. 16, 2016, 5:37 AM 99,245 facebook linkedin twitter email print Lei Jun, the chairman and CEO of Xiaomi Technology and the chairman of Kingsoft Corp., seen before the 2nd plenary session of the National People's Congress on March 9 in Beijing. Etienne Oliveau/Getty Images The "Apple of China" is in serious trouble. Sales in China of smartphones from Xiaomi, a once red-hot Chinese hardware startup touted as the country's answer to Apple, fell by a whopping 38% in the second quarter of 2016 year-on-year, according to new data from the research firm IDC. Xiaomi did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Xiaomi's phones are not yet available in Western markets, but the company has developed a buzzy reputation in the tech press. The company launched in 2010, and it enjoyed meteoric growth: By the end of 2014 it was the world's most valuable technology startup, with a private valuation of more than $46 billion. (It has since been dethroned of that title by Uber.) Specialising in cheap, high-quality smartphones, it had grown off the back of an unusually passionate fan base, which it was careful to cultivate. It liberally borrowed from Apple's playbook, including charismatic CEO keynote speeches. There is also a booming market in China for smartphones. The company set an ambitious target for 2015: Sell 100 million smartphones. But by July, as sales began to slow, it started to become clear that it just wouldn't happen. It ultimately sold "over 70 million," according to a company representative. Some of Xiaomi's phones are very similar to Apple's, and Apple design guru Jony Ive has even accused the company of "theft," a charge it denies. REUTERS/Jason Lee Earlier this year, Fortune reported that Xiaomi's revenue's barely grew in 2015. It pulled in 78 billion yuan, or $11.9 billion, for the year, up 5% on 74.3 billion yuan ($11.3 billion) in 2014 but well short of its 100-billion-yuan target for the year. The latest figures from IDC now suggest that Xiaomi isn't just standing still: It's actually in free fall. Xiaomi sold an estimated 10.5 million smartphones in China in the second quarter of this year, down from 17.1 million a year prior. That's a drop of 38.4%. At the same time, its rivals Oppo and Vivo have skyrocketed, enjoying year-on-year growth rates of 124.1% and 74.7%. IDC (Also interesting: Apple is struggling in China as well, with shipments down 31.7% year-on-year — selling 8.6 million devices last quarter, compared to 12.6 million in Q2 of 2015.) It’s worth noting that Xiaomi sells other products — as varied as water purifiers and hoverboards. But smartphones still make up the lion's share of the company's bottom line, with just 5% of its revenues in 2015 coming from other products, according to Fortune . So what's behind Xiaomi's implosion? A slowing in growth, at least, was inevitable. In previous years the company was perfectly positioned to take advantage of the rapid growth in China's smartphone market. This has now dropped off, though the Chinese market is still growing, 4.6% year-on-year in Q2. IDC points to a failure of marketing as the cause. Xiaomi previously spent very little on marketing and was proud of it, relying on word of mouth and user hype to spread word of its products. But this tactic is no longer viable as Vivo and Oppo are spending heavily, including using "brand ambassadors" to promote their smartphones. Without any concrete ways to differentiate its products, Xiaomi has been forced to follow suit. "In the past, Xiaomi started the trend of selling its phones online and other vendors soon followed suit and created their own online brand. After vendors witnessed OPPO's success with its R9, they also started riding on the trend of hiring celebrity endorsers to represent their brand and appeal more to the young crowd," IDC analyst Xiaohan Tay said. "Hiring celebrity endorsers may help increase numbers in the short term, but this alone may not be sufficient to drive numbers in the long run. As there is very little differentiation across products to warrant significant brand loyalty, vendors must constantly think out of the box to get people hyped up about their products." Xiaomi was once the head of the pack. Now it's playing catch-up — and losing.

On Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook committed to a future groundbreaking during his second visit to the country in the past four months. Work could begin in the next few weeks. Cook told Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, one of China’s most senior officials, that construction on the Asia-Pacific research center would start in earnest this fall, and that new center “would be built by the end of the year.” Cook’s announcement appears to be spurred in part by recent comments by the head of China’s industry and technology regulator. In May, he told Cook that he “hoped Apple could deepen its cooperation with the country in research and development” and “stressed information security,” Reuters reported. Related: Apple refused to hand over its source code to China It’s the most recent in a series of strategic investments Apple has made in Chinese businesses. In May, the Cupertino, California-based company announced a $1 billion stock buy in ridesharing app Didi Chuxing — an investment that analysts intimate was politically motivated. The move strengthened Didi, a Beijing, China-based company, against encroaching U.S. competitors. In early August, Uber said it would cease operations of its Chinese subsidiary, UberChina, in return for a one-fifth stake in the ridesharing app. Apple’s dealings with the Chinese government have been fraught with turmoil, to put it lightly. In 2013, China’s state-controlled media slammed the company’s warranty policy, claiming that Apple provided secondhand phones and recycled components to customers in the country. In 2014, following revelations that the U.S. National Security Agency surveilled Chinese leaders, China Central TV described the iPhone as a “national security concern.” Earlier this year, Chinese government regulators blocked access to Apple’s iBooks and iMovies within the country — reportedly out of concern of “security threats.” And in June, China’s Beijing-based Intellectual Property Office found that Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on an exterior design patent by Chinese company Shenzhen Baili. Related: Does this phone look like the iPhone 6? Chinese authorities say yes But the company’s relationship with the government may be on the mend. Cook apologized following the allegations of warranty fraud, publishing an open letter that promised to implement an “improved level of repair service” and a “clearer and more concise” policy. And a series of meetings in May between Cook and “senior government and Communist Party leaders” was described as “productive” by a Reuters source. It’s a balancing act for both parties. Apple’s Chinese manufacturing operations are “directly or indirectly responsible for tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs,” according to eWeek. Apple, meanwhile, is desperate to turn sales around in a market ripe with revenue potential. While sales of the iPhone in China decreased by a third during the company’s past fiscal quarter, market research firm IDC reports that homegrown vendors Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo saw a collective gain of 47 percent. That said, the Chinese smartphone market is experiencing what Cook called “economic softness” in a recent earnings call. The Greater China region, which includes China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, last year experienced the slowest growth in a quarter century. If the trend continues, Apple’s push in the country may well prove to be a race against time.

This is one of the reasons why high-end smartphones have taken a beating in China. According to the second quarter smartphone shipment data released by International Data Corporation (IDC) on Monday, Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo dominate the top three positions in China. All three brands together have a 47 percent share of the Chinese market. The latest figures show that Huawei has passed Oppo and Xiaomi to take top spot. Xiaomi's second quarter shipment took a 38.4 percent dip year-on-year, shipping 10.5 million smartphones in the quarter (giving it a market share of 9.5 percent), down from 17.1 million in the same period last year (when it had a 11.9 percent share). This fall has pushed Xiaomi to the fourth position behind Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo.According to the research, the success of Huawei and Oppo can be credited to focus marketing messages on key attributes like the Leica lens for Huawei and fast-charging technology for Oppo. Huawei shipped 19.1 million smartphones in China in Q2 2016, giving it a market share of 17.2 percent - a 15.2 percent rise year-on-year. Oppo on the other hand shipped 18 million units, giving it a 16.2 percent share - a growth of 124.1 percent year-on-year. Finally, Vivo shipped 14.7 million units, with a 13.2 percent market share - a growth of 74.7 percent year on year. Xiaomi and Apple round off the top five, with the remaining vendors occupying 36.1 percent of the market, and shipping 40.2 million smartphones in Q2 this year. Apple shipped 8.6 million smartphones in the period according to IDC's data, giving it a 7.8 percent market share. The IDC report notes the Chinese smartphone market is tending towards consolidation, with the top three vendors occupying 45 percent of the market in Q1 2016, and 43 percent in 2015. The quality, design, marketing and pricing of these local smartphones have managed to pull down heavyweights like Apple and Samsung as well. Apple saw a decline in shipments in China by 32 percent in the second quarter, dropping the brand to fifth position. This only spells bad news for the Cupertino-based giant as its global shipments are set to take a fall in 2016, according to a report by Canalys. "The launch of the iPhone 6 saw Apple's shipments in Greater China skyrocket, but the company has struggled to maintain this momentum. The iPhone 6s had a lacklustre reception in comparison and the iPhone SE is unlikely to make a big difference to Apple's fortunes in the region this year. Local players have improved product quality and offer much better value for money. Huawei, Oppo and Vivo offer products with better specifications at significantly lower price points. The iPhones lack features such as waterproofing and wireless charging. Apple needs to catch up with the competition if it wants to compete," Canalys Research Analyst Jessie Ding said on Monday. The most recent example for Huawei's success is seen in the P9, which has been receiving a lot of favourable reviews. The Huawei P9 (which is expected to launch in India on August 17) is the company's high-end smartphone, the highlight of the device being the dual-lens camera made in partnership with Leica.Seeing as how volatile the smartphone market is in China, it remains to see how long Huawei can maintain its position at the top with Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi close at its heels.

Yesterday it was the darling of the new fashion-conscious, social media aware, young Technorati of China, with its Apple-inspired smartphones, laptops, tablets, and, well, practically every other Apple product. Today it is losing favour and, more importantly, domestic market share. Industry research firm IDC provides the facts in its latest report, which shows that the top three smartphone vendors collectively accounted for 47 per cent of the China smartphone market in the second quarter of 2016. In 2015 and Q1 this year, the top three smartphone vendors for that period had a market share of 43 per cent and 45 per cent respectively, showing that the market continues to consolidate further as the share of the top three vendors continue to increase. Unfortunately for Xiaomi, the top three vendors are Huawei, OPPO and vivo. Xiaomi has to make do with fourth place and a 9.5 per cent market share – after suffering a huge 38.4 per cent decrease in share year-on-year. That’s right, in Q2 2015, Xiaomi was top of the pile in first place with a commanding 16.1 per cent market share shipping 17.1 million smartphones. Fast forward a year and sales were down to just 10.5 million. Ouch; that’s almost (but not quite) as bad as Apple’s declining share. “The success of Huawei, OPPO, and vivo in the market can be attributed to their concerted effort to build their brand and aggressive marketing to attract the consumers, along with the focus on product differentiation,” said Xiaohan Tay, Senior Market Analyst, Client Devices Research, IDC Asia/Pacific. “In the past, Xiaomi started the trend of selling its phones online and other vendors soon followed suit and created their own online brand. After vendors witnessed OPPO’s success with its R9, they also started riding on the trend of hiring celebrity endorsers to represent their brand and appeal more to the young crowd.” Indeed, the shift of sales is down, in no small part, to the role of advertising. Xiaomi won big in the past with its focus on offline channels and manufactured demand, and this approach has been copied by OPPO and vivo. But celebrity endorsements are now the flavour of the month, with even the more conservative and technology-focused Huawei getting in on the act. This also signals a shift away from extremely low-cost social marketing to much more expensive paid advertising and sponsorship. “Hiring celebrity endorsers may help increase numbers in the short-term, but this alone may not be sufficient to drive numbers in the long run,” added Tay. “As there is very little differentiation across products to warrant significant brand loyalty, vendors must constantly think out of the box to get people hyped up about their products.” Xiaomi certainly has crawl out of that box of theirs and experience some blue sky thinking (as the marketing people love to say). It faces huge and perhaps unsurmountable problems in selling its current generation of smartphones in Europe and the US, so is heavily reliant upon its domestic market to support its operations. Remember though, for all its Apple love and Steve Jobs tribute keynotes, this is a young company (it only launched in 2010) that still has much to learn. The question is whether or not it can build on its phenomenal early success, when it was worth in excess of $46 billion, and become a long-term leading player in this market. Discovering its own identity would be a big help – being the poor man’s Apple was only ever going to take it so far. For now though, it needs to seriously lower its growth sights and remove the Jobs-inspired reality distortion field. It wanted to sell 100 million smartphones last year – it ended up reaching just 70 million. Consequently, its revenue for the year flat-lined, according to reports, at an estimated $11.9 billion. Those pundits looking for the next mega-brand from Asia may need to take a closer look at OPPO (with its 124 per cent annual China market growth) and vivo (with a healthy 75 per cent growth, and not under-estimate the sizeable backing enjoyed by this year’s market leader Huawei – which is already enjoying considerable success in overseas markets. When Xiaomi decided to mimic Apple and its iPhones, it most likely never thought it would also copy its fall in market share… that really is true love.

On Tuesday, the search giant released Duo, its new video calling app. Google designed Duo to be like FaceTime — easy to use. As with Apple’s app, users can simply tap on a friend’s name from their address book and connect. “Video calling is the next best thing to being with someone in person, but too often it can be a frustrating or complicated experience,” Justin Uberti, a principal software engineer, wrote on Google’s company blog site. “Duo takes the complexity out of video calling, so that you can be together in the moment wherever you are.” Duo has one big advantage over FaceTime — it allow Android users to place video calls to iPhone owners and vice versa. FaceTime only works on Apple devices. Google also added a cool feature not present in FaceTime to Duo. Dubbed Knock Knock, it offers a kind of preview of the video call. Knock Knock allows the recipient of a call to see a live view of the person placing the call to get a sense not only of who is calling but why. And Duo has a simpler initial view than FaceTime. Where FaceTime’s home screen offers a list of contacts users have recently called, Duo show users a view of themselves and a big “video call” button. If users tap on that button, they’ll see a list of friends who they can call on the app. If they’ve placed calls recently, they’ll also see thumbnail pictures of the friends they’ve contacted on the homescreen. Those pictures act as buttons that allow them to make a quick follow-up video call. But in general, the app works much like FaceTime. Like Apple’s app, it’s only used for calling; users can’t send text messages through it. As with FaceTime interactions, Duo encrypts calls made through it, so users don’t have to worry about someone spying on their conversations. And as with FaceTime, Duo automatically identifies people in users’ address books who can be reached through the app. On Tuesday, I did a quick test of Duo, which Google announced in May at its annual developer conference. It worked mostly as advertised. My wife was able to easily place a call from her iPhone to mine using the app. I was able to return her call quickly by simply tapping on a thumbnail picture button on the Duo home screen. The video was generally smooth, although there was a hiccup in it. The app is supposed to be able to keep a video call going even if your phone switches from a WiFi to a cellular network. But while talking with my daughter, the video of me cut out when I turned off my WiFi radio. I was able to see her, but she could only hear me. My video resumed when I turned my WiFi radio back on. Google is no stranger to video calling. Users of Google Talk could place video calls on their PCs eight years ago. Google Hangouts, which the company launched three years ago, allows users to connect on PCs and mobile devices and can be used for video conferences involving multiple people. And users of Google’s Android operating system have numerous choices for video calling apps, including Skype, Facebook Messenger, and WeChat. Cell providers Verizon and T-Mobile also offer video calling features for Android phones. But until now, Android users haven’t had something as easy and ubiquitous to use for video chats as FaceTime. While Hangouts comes pre-installed on most devices, it’s a much more complicated app that can be difficult to use. With Skype, Facebook and other apps, users can typically only place video calls to people who are using the same app. And in some cases users have to know a person’s often idiosyncratic log-on name to connect. And the cell phone video services generally allow users to place video calls only to other users who have certain phones that are connected to the same cellular network. While Duo may be aimed at FaceTime, I’m not convinced it’s going to convince iPhone users to switch to Android. But if it gets enough of a following, it could make it easier for iPhone users to at least consider making the move. Still, FaceTime, which debuted with Apple’s iPhone 4 back in 2010, retains some advantages over Duo. Apple offers it for Mac computers, while Duo isn’t available for the Mac or Windows PC’s. FaceTime allows users to place audio-only calls, while Duo is focused on video ones. And FaceTime users can connect to people even if they don’t know their phone number; FaceTime also recognizes their email address. Photo: Google Duo.

Apple today has inked a new deal with one of the most popular music labels, Cash Money Records. The co-founder of the label, Birdman, posted on Instagram confirming the deal, sharing a picture of himself with Apple Music executive Larry Jackson. “It’s official…Cash Money makes a power move with Apple Music,” Birdman’s Instagram post said. Cash Money Records, for those unfamiliar, houses some of the top artists in rap and all of music right now, including Drake, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Tyga, Birdman, and others. Former Cash Money artists include Busta Rhymes, DJ Khaled, Bow Wow, and others. Since Apple Music’s launch, Apple has had a strong relationship with Drake, who was on-stage during the Apple Music unveil keynote and reportedly inked his own $19 million deal with Apple earlier this year. As part of that deal, Drake’s recent “Views” album was an Apple Music exclusive for two weeks. Additionally, Drake has hosted a show on Apple’s always-on Beats 1 radio service. Cash Money Records, however, has had a rocky few years. Lil Wayne has accused the company and Birdman of not paying artists promptly and mismanaging talent. Wayne has also accused Birdman of stifling creativity and not allowing artists to release music on time. Nevertheless, the deal with Apple could help Cash Money solve some of its problems. Young Money Entertainment – the imprint of Cash Money that houses Tyga, Drake, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, and others – has put out eleven number 1 albums in the United States and should Apple be able to get exclusive rights to future offerings, it would have a strong advantage over services like Spotify. Interestingly, however, Lil Wayne is believed to be a part-owner of Tidal (via MBW). Part of the deal likely hinges upon Apple offering Cash Money artists free promotion both in iTunes and on Apple Music, something it has done in the past for various exclusive offerings, including Taylor Swift’s tour documentary. Beyond exclusive streaming rights, the partnership could see Apple and Cash Money working together to co-produce video content. It’s been reported in the past that Apple has worked directly with artists on music videos, while Eddy Cue himself has explained that the company is looking for exclusive content opportunities when they complement existing products. Over recent weeks, Apple has gained exclusive rights to a pair of big upcoming releases: Britney Spears’ “Glory” and Frank Ocean’s “Boys Don’t Cry.” Even if Cash Money’s reputation has become slightly tainted over the past two years, this deal is big for Apple. Apple is likely hoping that its money and talent will breathe new life into Cash Money and its artists. http://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/apple-music-signs-game-changing-label-deal-cash-money-records/ @thelarryjackson @applemusic #Biggathenlife #lifestyle A photo posted by Birdman5star (@birdman5star) on Aug 16, 2016 at 2:46pm PDT Guides Apple Music: Apple's streaming music service View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Birdman and his label have signed a deal with Apple Music, joining a roster of artists who are already in exclusive deals with the tech titan, according to Billboard. Birdman teased the news on Instagram over the weekend, posing for a photo next to Apple Music’s Larry Jackson. “It’s official,” he wrote in a since-deleted caption. “Cash Money makes a power move with Apple Music.” That “power move” will likely include an exclusivity guarantee, marking the first time a label has entered an exclusive deal with Apple as opposed to individual artists. Jackson posted the same picture on his account, jokingly saying he signed a deal with Cash Money as an R&B singer. “Check one off of the bucket list,” he wrote. “Signed as an R&B crooner to Ca$h Money yesterday. My life is oh so complete now…Welcome to the fam @birdman5star. Tough negotiator. Much respeck.” Check one off of the bucket list ✔️.. Signed as an R&B crooner to Ca$h Money yesterday.

It’s also unclear how this will affect Cash Money’s star-studded roster. Lil Wayne is still at odds with his longtime label and mentor Baby. Meanwhile, he and Nicki Minaj both have ties to Jay Z’s TIDAL. Elsewhere, Drake has his own deal with Apple Music that’s been quite lucrative for the 6 God. Besides Drake, Chance the Rapper, DJ Khaled, Travis Scott, and Future are among the artists who’ve signed exclusive deals with Apple Music.

Cook made the pledge during a trip to China, at least his second in four months, as demand for Apple's iPhones has plummeted in the world's second-largest economy and the government remains wary about foreign technology. Apple's new research and development centre will be built by the end of the year, Cook told Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, one of China's most senior officials, according to CCTV, the official Chinese state broadcaster. The center will unite Apple's engineering and operations teams in China and is also intended to deepen the company's ties to partners and universities, it said in a statement. Apple's announcement came after the head of China's industry and technology regulator in May told Cook he hoped Apple could deepen its cooperation with the country in research and development and stressed information security. Sales in Greater China, once touted as Apple's next growth engine, decreased by one-third in its fiscal third quarter, after having more than doubled a year earlier. The results did not include inventory drawdowns as retailers sold phones in stock faster than new supply coming from Apple, meaning that demand was not as weak as it seemed. China's slowing economy is stocking concerns about Apple's prospects there. The company's online stores for iBooks and movies closed in the country after Beijing in March imposed strict curbs on online publishing, particularly for foreign firms. Apple has lost intellectual property battles in China and faces anti-U.S. sentiment from consumers there. Before Cook's charm offensive in Beijing in May, Apple announced a $1 billion deal with ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing, a move many experts saw as an attempt to curry favour with Beijing. Other technology firms, including Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc, have pledged investments in China, often with mixed results.

In fact, he’s remained pretty involved in tech, and his latest product, the Obi Worldphone MV1, has just launched in the U.K. after first being announced six months ago at Mobile World Congress. The new phone is powered by Android, has a 5-inch display, and is designed to compete with other low-cost smartphones out there, especially considering its 99 pound price tag (about $129). In other words, the Worldphone MV1 is not an iPhone-killer designed to go up against Sculley’s old employer. Related: Former Apple CEO John Sculley launches two low-cost Android smartphones Apart from the display, the phone features a 1.3 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 212 processor, 16GB of storage with a MicroSD card slot to expand upon that storage, 2GB of RAM, an 8MP rear-facing camera, and a 2MP front-facing camera. It also offers a 2,500mAh battery. The best thing about this phone, however, isn’t the specs — it’s the price. At a tiny 99 pounds, this is one of the better deals out there. It boasts specs comparable to the super low-cost Moto E, even beating out the Moto E in some areas, such as in the processor — the Moto E’s processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 200, and is coupled with 1GB of RAM, compared to the Worldphone’s 2GB. Of course, it’s important to note that the phone has been available in Asia, the Middle East, and South America for some time now, and it will likely be available in other parts of Europe in the near future. There’s no word yet on the phone’s availability in the U.S. though. If you’re interested in getting the super low-cost Obi Worldphone MV1 for yourself and you live in an area where the device is available, you can buy it from the company’s website.

CHEN Duo, Google's video-calling app, is an alternative to Apple's FaceTime Aug. 16: Google and Apple have battled each other for years for primacy over mobile users. Apple has proferred its superior devices, like the iPhone. Google has fought back with its Android operating system and a series of mobile apps that are more flexible and compatible with a broader set of devices than Apple's apps. Today, Google underscored that strategy with the release of its latest mobile app: Duo, a video-calling app that is a direct alternative to Apple's FaceTime. The app fits squarely into Google's playbook in mobile. Over the last few years, Google has increasingly offered its important software and internet services, including Google Maps, Google Photos and Google Docs, to iPhone customers. All those apps were compelling alternatives to Apple's proprietary apps, like Apple Maps, Photos and Notes, because they work on a wider variety of devices, including Macs, Windows PCs, Android devices and iPhones. Duo is no exception. People can only use FaceTime to call others who have Apple devices. But Duo lets you place video calls between Android and iPhone users, and sizeably increases the universe of people with whom you can hold a video conversation. "You shouldn't have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are," Google said in a statement, in a veiled jab at Apple. "It's no wonder that nearly half of US adults never make video calls on mobile." All this feeds into Google's strategy to attract iPhone users over to Android. Google's apps generally work better on Android devices than on iPhones, so the more that people get hooked on Google's core apps, the less incentive there is to stay loyal to Apple. Nick Fox, Google's head of communication products, said the top priority with Duo was to build a great product and to increase the use of video calling among Android users. But he added that making Android more attractive to iPhone owners was a secondary motive. He said that Duo's appeal was that it was simple to use, fast and more widely accessible. "Our view is video calling should work for everybody," he said. "If you can only call half the people you know, that's very limiting." Apple does not profess to be worried by Google's moves. When the iPhone maker reported falling sales last month, Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, repeatedly highlighted that the rate at which people were switching from Android-based devices to iPhones was the highest the company had seen. "Our year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we've seen in any nine-month period," Cook said in the call. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond Cook's comments. I decided to test Duo to see how the new app plays into the debate about whether iPhone users should consider switching to Android devices. After trying an early copy of Duo and comparing it side by side with FaceTime, I found that Duo was just as intuitive and fun to use as FaceTime, but that it was too early to tell which service was more reliable. First, a little context about Duo and where it fits into the universe of Google apps. The Silicon Valley company announced in May at its annual developer conference that Duo would be coming. The app is solely dedicated to video chats between two people, the company said, to make video calling simpler to access. This is not the first time Google has provided video calling. Google started offering mobile video calling several years ago inside its Hangouts app, which also includes messaging and voice-calling capabilities. The video-calling feature in Hangouts will remain intact. Crystal Dahlen, a Google spokeswoman, said the name Duo conveyed that the app was designed for one-to-one video calling on mobile devices, in contrast to Hangouts, which lets groups of people make video calls over mobile devices and computers.

Thousands of people have shown up to hear about Apple's latest updates. Credit: David Paul Morris / Bloomberg / Getty Images Not content with its devices already living in our pockets, on our wrists, and on our desktops, Apple is seemingly at work on a completely different sort of mobile device: an electric car. Tesla CEO Elon Musk calls Apple’s electric car project an “open secret.” In keeping with the company’s grand tradition of hush-hush product development, there are only whispers about what Apple’s take on mobility will be like. While any sort of product release to this end is still several years away, it’s a fine time to be entering the automotive industry, with U.S. car sales hitting record numbers last year. Whatever Apple’s finished product is actually like, here’s what we know and have heard about the Apple car so far. It is codenamed Project Titan, and a car could be out in five years. Can you hang on until 2021? Celebrated Apple analyst Gene Munster says we’ll have Apple cars on the road within five years. Start saving now. There are reportedly 1,000 employees working on the Apple car. Since it was kicked off in 2014, Project Titan has involved the work of some 1,000 engineers, some of which formerly worked at Tesla. In fact, enough engineers have left Tesla to work for the iPhone manufacturer that Elon Musk has called Apple “the Tesla graveyard.”  Apple owns a variety of URLs pertaining to its car. Check out the reports on apple.car, apple.auto, and apple.cars — they are of course registered to the famous Cupertino technology firm. These sites are broken for now, but they certainly seem like the type of web property to set up if one were going to sell cars. The car could be in development at three different Apple installations around the world. The speculation is that Project Titan hardware is coming together at labs in Vienna, Austria, Berlin, Germany, and Sunnyvale, California. There’s even speculation that it’s being built in Cork, Ireland. Apple has inquired about using a driverless car test track. It’s called GoMentum, and it’s the same automobile-testing station in California where Google and Tesla perfect driverless car features. It seems like any car with futuristic self-driving capabilities comes through this facility. Its state-of-the-art battery will come from an unnamed South Korean partner. Due to top-secret business practices, we don’t get to know the name of the South Korean company Apple is working with on car batteries, but we do get to know that its hollow-centered lithium ion battery design will have significantly expanded capacity. In practical terms, an electric car will be able to go farther on it per charge. Apple has had a hard time finding a company to manufacture its car design. After getting nos from BMW and Daimler, Apple is rumored to be working with vehicle firm Magna, based in Vienna. Senior Vice President of Technologies Bob Mansfield is in charge of Project Titan. Appointed to lead the car project in July, Mansfield is Apple’s head of hardware development and was formerly in charge of the company’s Macs and iPads. We predict lots of smooth, rounded edges here.

Keep your cool by learning the ins and outs of Apple's various repair and support options. By Erik Eckel | August 16, 2016, 2:19 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Apple No one enjoys navigating service repairs. The fact is doubly true for the tech industry, which has earned its reputation for making return merchandise authorization (RMA) and service repair processes nightmare-invoking experiences. Apple does what it can to ease customers' pain and simplify the process—you just need to know how to navigate it. So, the next time your Apple device—whether it's a Mac, iPad, iPhone, or Watch—requires a repair or support, follow these tips to make the experience as smooth as possible. SEE: Apple replacement and extension programs offer businesses some relief First, you should check to determine whether the product is covered by an Apple warranty or extended AppleCare coverage by entering the device's serial number on Apple's Service and Support Coverage webpage.

Confirm an iOS device's serial number by pressing Settings, tapping General, tapping About, and reviewing the information in the Serial Number section. Apple Watch serial numbers are engraved on the back of the device; a Watch's serial number can also be accessed by pressing the watch's crown inward, tapping Settings, selecting General, and tapping About. After entering a valid serial number and providing the corresponding CAPTCHA information within the Apple Service and Support Coverage page, Apple presents purchase data, telephone technical support status, and repair and service coverage status for the device. The displayed support and service coverage information also confirms whether the device is covered by AppleCare, which extends complementary technical support and hardware warranty coverage for the device (Figure A). For good measure, you can also check eligibility for participating in Apple Exchange and Repair Extension Programs. Figure A Apple's service and support information displays repair coverage status, among other information, within a webpage. Apple customers needing to schedule a repair can use the provided Set Up A Repair link, circled. Image: Erik Eckel/TechRepublic Service and Support Coverage information for a specific device also includes links for contacting Apple support and setting up a repair. When clicking Set Up A Repair, Apple directs users to a page presenting several topics. For a MacBook Air, the page includes icons for Startup- or Power-related problems, hardware issues, and other items. You can also request repair and services from Apple's Support page, which provides specific selections for Macs, iPads, iPhones, Watches, Apple TVs, and more. Apple describes the repair options available to its customers. Repair requests can also be generated from the Apple Repair webpage, which also lists the repair options available to Apple customers. Apple notes equipment can be returned for repair or service to authorized Apple Repair centers, users can visit an Apple Authorized Service Provider or customers can make a reservation with an Apple Store Genius.

The patent seemed out of place for an electric car, and it turns out that’s the case because the law firm handling patents for Apple says it was accidentally assigned to the wrong company thanks to a clerical error. typographic error gave Apple a military vehicle patent The Morrison and Foerster law firm filed a Request for Certification of Correction on August 9th stating Apple was unintentionally named as the patent assignee due to a “typographical error.” The patent actually belongs to military vehicle maker BAE Systems, which makes much more sense. Yesterday’s patent assignment was seen as more proof Apple is working on a car. The patent spurred discussions about how articulated joints fit into Apple’s vehicle plans, and was even a topic we discussed on our Daily Observations podcast. We speculated Apple could be looking at mass transit vehicles like busses, was obfuscating their real intentions, or simply patented an idea that came up during the car design process. In other words, there wasn’t an obvious use for the patent—and now we know why. Apple’s electric car development program is still unconfirmed, leaving it open to rumor and speculation. TMO’s sources say the company is serious about its car, dubbed Project Titan. Bob Mansfield, Apple’s go-to guy for secret projects and engineering wizard, was recently put in charge of Project Titan—a sign the company is serious about getting into the automotive market. Mr. Mansfield has been working as a behind the scenes figure at Apple for the past few years, and has a reputation for bringing products to market, or killing them if he thinks they’re a dead end. Since Apple isn’t going to be a contractor for military vehicles, the big question is how do you get from Apple Inc to BEA Systems with a typographical error? Morrison and Foerster very likely have a computerized template system for generating the patent filing forms for their many clients. There’s probably shortcut codes assigned to each client, and the codes for Apple and BAE Systems are just close enough that someone accidentally typed the wrong one. Patently Apple noted the patent application was filed in July 2015, which left plenty of time to notice and correct the error. Either no one was paying attention, or the law firm felt it was or faster to correct the error after the patent was granted. Either way, we won’t be seeing any Apple Tanks on the battle field.

I explored some of the issues myself last year in: “What Would Happen if a Future Apple Autonomous Car Made a Very Bad Decision?” There I addressed, to first order, some of the liability and political issues. Going forward, the specific details of a moral decision about life and death decisions presents a difficult problem that involves quantifying then instantiating into software logic for these important decisions. It would be nice for society to have more time to ponder, but the pace of technology leaves us precious little time for that. In what follows, I’ll look at the research then toy with a variation of Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics in order to pose the Big Question. First off, I should emphasize that this is a subject that is being scrutinized more and more. Research is being done, thousands of automotive engineers at the major car companies plus Google, Tesla, and likely Apple are working on the problem. And it’s fascinating. Other entities are looking into the morality issues surrounding autonomous vehicles. I would think that state and federal government, the insurance companies, and the U.S. Society of Automotive Engineers are pondering the issues. And so some fanciful notions that I present later are simply to get more discussion going. Here are some current, candidate mechanism for developing autonomous vehicle morality. 1. Prescribed Morality There are several ways to attack this problem. One, perhaps the most traditional and obvious way, is to create a set of man-made rules. The problem with that is that different people have a different point of view, and there may be reasons to believe there is no practical resolution that fits all. In 1942, the distinguished scientist, a Ph.D. in biochemistry and science fiction writer, Dr. Isaac Asimov ginned up the Three Laws of Robotics. My perception has been that the original motivation was to simply support his sci-fi writing. Later, the real prospect of actual robots in this century has cast his laws from the realm of fiction to serious conversation for 21st century robot developers. Alas, that was 3/4 century ago, and we have new tools at our disposal as well as new ways of handling technical issues. What seemed simple and decisive then may not apply today. Also, deference to the wisdom of a few experts is not as popular nowadays, and yet there may still be valuable insights to harvest. 2. Crowd Sourcing One of the ways modern researchers are attacking this issue is to conduct situational experiments with a large number of people in order to understand, in a statistically valid way, the most prevalent moral values of human drivers. That can product interesting results. For example, in this article at Scientific American: “Driverless Cars Will Face Moral Dilemmas,” the following result was cited. Most of the 1,928 research participants in the Science report indicated that they believed vehicles should be programmed to crash into something rather than run over pedestrians, even if that meant killing the vehicle’s passengers. Yet many of the same study participants balked at the idea of buying such a vehicle, preferring to ride in a driverless car that prioritizes their own safety above that of pedestrians. Humans don’t always crystalize their values in consistent ways. More on that later. Along that line, an article at the MIT Technology Review is entitled “Why Self-Driving Cars Must Be Programmed to Kill.” That seems callous, but it’s an emerging fact. The question is, “Who and under what circumstances?” 3. Morality Engines A third related avenue is to build AI agents that are able to, by exposure to a great number of test case human scenarios, learn to build an ethical foundation and then exercise it. See: “When should driverless cars kill their own passengers?” To quote: The Machine is comprised of a series of ethical dilemmas, most of them making me feel uneasy when answering them. For example, what do you do when a driverless car without passengers either has to drive into a stoplight-flaunting dog or an abiding criminal? One of the virtues (or drawbacks, depending on one’s point of view) of a morality engine is that the decisions an autonomous vehicle makes can only be traced back only to software. That helps to absolve a car maker’s employees from direct liability when it comes life and death decisions by machine. That certainly seems to be an emerging trend in technology. The benefit is obvious. If a morality engine makes the right decision, by human standards, 99,995 times out of 100,000, the case for extreme damages due to systematic failure causing death is weak. Technology and society can move forward. Very likely, the evolution of autonomous car morality will be a mixture of methods #2 and #3 above. It’s a technique that both reflects the values of people polled and instantiates that morality into an AI agent that does the best possible job. Even so, I am going to go out on a limb, for the sake of exploration and discussion, and propose a starting point for method #1. I’m doing this because the best way to start a discussion is to built a straw man.

Can’t see the trucking industry getting on board with this due to union issues as well as insurance and safety issues for another 10 to 15 years at least. Not sure how you came up with a 5 year time plan. Way too ambitious of a time plan. August 10, 2016 at 6:46 EST PM nehawalia August 11, 2016 Good Topic……. August 11, 2016 at 4:42 EST AM Jamie August 11, 2016 I don’t know how many times this needs to be said, but I guess it bears repeating because engineers seem to either keep forgetting or fail to grasp the concept all together: morality is derivative of human compassion and it is not a faculty of logic. AI will never be in possession of ‘morality’, just its facsimile. *Anything* that it does will be the result of programming by us, at least at the root level, autonomy is a misnomer (something the silicon valley hype train excels at). So the answer to this question is a resounding no. By its very nature (which is math-based and therefore logic based) software will never be capable of ‘morality’, only what we tell it morality is (and yes, human beings are capable of spontaneous compassion in spite of their ‘programming’, software never will be capable of spontinaety, period). Look no further than collateral damage from drone strikes for evidence, and those are by and large still mostly human controlled. It’s science fiction, folks, and it would be the epitome of stupid to think otherwise. August 11, 2016 at 9:17 EST AM Lee Dronick August 11, 2016 Spot on Jamie! August 11, 2016 at 9:39 EST AM gnasher729 August 11, 2016 Your’e looking at the problem from the complete wrong angle. There is no matter of morality here. There are some people _talking_ very loudly about moral problems, and for some reason they get a lot of attention, but looking at the problem this way is wrong. The first law and only law of a self driving car is: Avoid hitting things. That’s it. To implement the first law of driving, the self driving car isn’t allowed to drink and drive, and it’s not allowed to drive blindly, and it isn’t allowed to go into tricky situations at high speed. You may say that hitting a lamp post and hitting a child are different things, but as long as you avoid hitting them you are fine and no distinction is needed. Now collisions will not be totally avoidable, because the self driving car is surrounded by idiots. Every driver knows the feeling 🙂 By driving carefully, the self driving car will avoid situations where it causes damage. It may react better in situations where a human driver just thinks “oh shit oh shit oh shit what am I doing now” – I’ve had situations like that, and I suppose a self driving car would know at all times what’s left, right and behind and would often be able to take evasive action that I couldn’t. Now accepting that collisions are not totally avoidable, we can add a rule: “When hitting things, minimise the damage. Damage is calculated from speed, whether the thing looks human, and whether the thing looks big and hard”. If done right, a self driving car will never get into a situation where “morality” would come into play. If it does: The highway code (or whatever it’s called in the USA) doesn’t mention morality. The rules that I learned: Don’t hit people. Don’t put people into danger. Watch out for elderly people and children. That’s all humans need to know, no morals needed. That’s all that a self driving car is needed. August 11, 2016 at 10:04 EST AM daemon August 11, 2016 Morally speaking, the only moral death is the one you choose for yourself that saves the lives of those with you. Machines aren’t alive and thus cannot make a moral choice of death. All machine choices that end in death are by definition immoral. August 11, 2016 at 12:55 EST PM John Creamer August 11, 2016 I keep seeing articles positing moral choices for automated vehicles, but they miss the point. We would no more program a vehicle to make such choices than we would teach drivers to. We don’t tell teenagers in Driver’s Ed to hit one pedestrian in order to avoid a group of three. We teach teenagers to drive responsibly in order to avoid such dilemmas. Automated systems need to be (and in practice are) designed to operate within safe boundaries or not to operate at all. The whole challenge is in determining the conditions under which the system can function safely. Tesla’s mistake was in designing a system that requires human supervision without designing into the system a mechanism to ensure that the driver was always paying attention. This is why we have regulations that set minimum performance requirements for safety. August 11, 2016 at 1:08 EST PM bleddy August 11, 2016 @gnasher729: I agree with your like of thinking. Much is said of the “morality” of the machines and worry that it will be less than that of a human driver. We all see (nearly everyday) human drivers operate their current machines in arguably immoral ways. Speeding, sudden lane changes, ad nausium. The vast majority of us really try to do the best we can when driving but as humans, when faced with the time constrained choice of “who do I hit?” are unlikely to make a substatially better choice than a machine following yours or some other set of rules. I quibble with the order of your set of rules, however. (This is where we get into societal norms) I would move rule 1 to position 2 or even 3. The passengers are responsible for choosing to go by way of car (autonomous or otherwise ). I think they bear the primary responsibility for initiating the journey and should bear the greater risk.

The company expertly demonstrated the foolhardy nature of backdoors even existing by accidentally leaking a so-called “golden key.” That key will allow anyone to bypass Microsoft’s Secure Boot protections, rendering them moot. Golden Key Website A “secure golden key” is precisely what the FBI is demanding Apple and other companies provide. The agency wants to be able to access encrypted systems—which are increasingly common place—in the pursuit of its law enforcement duties. In addition to trying to get U.S. courts to force Apple to create software that bypasses its encryption, the FBI has argued companies like Apple could create a backdoor that only they have access to. This, we are assured, would be an excellent compromise that protects privacy and facilitates legitimate law enforcement needs. Reality The argument by encryption experts is that a backdoor available to one is available to all. Backdoors provide a target for authoritarian regimes and other foreign governments, as well as terrorists and other criminal organizations. Worse—and this argument has been understood for decades—even if a backdoor isn’t compromised, its legitimate owners can mishandle it, misuse it, or let it out. Microsoft apparently decided it would play the patsy and demonstrate exactly that. Everyone who doesn’t own a Windows device “protected” by Secure Boot should thank the company. Everyone who does should get rid of it and buy something from Apple. For technical details on the key and how it works, check out Ars Technica‘s excellent writeup. The keys were originally uncovered in March and published this week to what Ars called “a funky website.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit 4 Comments Add a comment geoduck August 11, 2016 But the FBI will just answer “But that’s not relevant. Trust us, ours will be secure.” August 11, 2016 at 7:17 EST PM Paul Goodwin August 11, 2016 Nobody was ever supposed to be able to get my cell phone number.

I’m disappointed but not surprised that this story has not gained more traction in mainstream media (that I’ve seen, at any rate), and attribute this to a combination of tech pundits not appreciating its gravity, and the unprecedentedly noisy distraction of the US campaign season commingled with the Olympics. Easy for a tech story like this, despite its glaring relevance to recent headline events, to be drowned out in this cacophony. Two things should happen at MS. First, they should sack whomever it was who suggested they make this golden key in the first place. Second, they should then sack the poor sod who released it into the wild. If these are the same person, then they should either black list him in perpetuity or recommend him highly to a competitor, depending on how Machiavellian they wish to be. While I remain impressed overall with the job that Nadella is doing at MS, this is a morality tale of Homeric proportions. I only hope that sagacious heads in security agencies worldwide comprehend the lessons of this Odyssey. If nothing else, MS have given Apple and the tech community live ammunition in their fight against this folly. August 12, 2016 at 1:32 EST PM pricemi115 August 20, 2016 Hey Bryan: Just getting back from vacation and catching up on all my podcasts. I was listening to TMO Daily Observations 2016-08-11 and windering if/when you will post a retraction/clarification to this. As I understand it, this was a very mis-reported issue and there was no key leaked/released…..actually there is no key at all. The issue is that in a recent version of Win10, the secure boot mechanism was enhanced, mostly if not exclusively, for developers to test new components to be eventually incorporated into the secure boot system. Unfortunately, however, due to the nature of secure boot, the enhancement was unknown to the older version and the team reporting the vulnerability found a way to sneak new (unverified) components past the secure boot protection. Steve Gibson, @GRC, has a very detailed explanation of this issue in Security Now episode #573. The link to the show notes is below and the discussion of this issue starts on page #4. https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-573.pdf August 20, 2016 at 10:11 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

I don’t comment much, but read you guys frequently and enjoy the podcasts quite a bit. 🙂 Now that that’s out of the way. Could Bryan and John please point out to me when Apple started shipping OSX on the iPad? This, IMO, is the point of the “what is a computer” commercial. Apple is not selling a toaster/fridge until they sell a Surface like device aka a tablet that runs an OS designed for a mouse. I am the market that Apple was aiming that commercial at, except I replaced my MacBook Air with an iPad Pro as soon as I could get my hands on one. I use it as my “computer”. But, for teaching, its better than a MacBook because of the pencil, in conjunction with presenting things in class. I think Microsoft, and John and Bryan, unfortunately missed the point of the Apple ad. That’s still apples fault, though, for not making the point clearly enough. I don’t see flailing for a correct vision for the iPad, but an evolution of the ipads capabilities that made it suitable for me to replace my Mac.

The facility will be a first for Apple in China, and will be another way to help Apple shore up its presence in the country. Apple to open R&D facility in China Mr. Cook told China’s Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli about Apple’s commitment during a trip to the country this week, and was announced by state-run news, according to Reuters. Apple isn’t offering up any other details, like how big the facility will be, its location, or what its research teams will be working on. China has friendship issues with foreign companies, including Apple. The iPhone and Mac maker has been a scapegoat for political frustration with the United States, and earlier this year the government blocked the iTunes Movies store and the iBooks Store. Apple is also facing declining sales in the country as last year’s explosive growth turns into this year’s downward slide. Considering China could become Apple’s single largest market, that’s a trend the company wants to reverse. This marks Mr. Cook’s second trip to China in the past four months, and more a likely to follow. China is a big market, and Apple wants as much of it as it can get. Grabbing a bigger market share means Apple needs to better understand China’s market and wipe away its “outsider” appearance—something the R&D center can help accomplish along with the company’s 36 retail stores. Since Apple isn’t interested in caving to any country’s demands for weakened privacy or security, the company needs to find other ways to endear itself to the government and its people. New jobs, a local presence, and a commitment to the region’s economy can go a long way towards making that happen. For Apple, this is about crafting as big a win for itself as possible. Opening the China R&D center helps Apple learn more about what it takes to be successful in the country, the facility could help boost the company’s local image, and more top talent joins the Apple team. The real test will be to see the new R&D center helps Apple reverse its downward slide in China.

In a much talked-about interview with Rick Tetzeli (Becoming Steve Jobs) for Fast Company, Mr. Cook hinted that Apple wants to make a big play in health care. He also said, “Our strategy is to help you in every part of your life that we can.” Tim Cook and the World Apple in Health Care It’s a wonderful interview that includes comments and information from senior vice presidents Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi. I strongly recommend you read it in full. But it’s Mr. Cook’s thoughts on the bigger picture that grabbed my attention. Let’s start with the bit about health care, which is buried near the end of the piece: As we’re saying our goodbyes, Cook and I stumble into discussing health care, and he perks up again. “We’ve gotten into the health arena and we started looking at wellness, that took us to pulling a string to thinking about research, pulling that string a little further took us to some patient-care stuff, and that pulled a string that’s taking us into some other stuff,” he says. “When you look at most of the solutions, whether it’s devices, or things coming up out of Big Pharma, first and foremost, they are done to get the reimbursement [from an insurance provider]. Not thinking about what helps the patient. So if you don’t care about reimbursement, which we have the privilege of doing, that may even make the smartphone market look small.” There’s a lot there, but Mr. Cook speaks in what I call Cook Code, or as Mr. Tetzeli put it, “Then Cook makes another one of his points that can get lost if you don’t understand the care he takes with every word.” We already knew that Apple was interested in wellness and health from Apple Watch and HealthKit. What Mr. Cook is telling us now is that we ain’t seen nothing yet. Rick Tetzeli noted that health care is a US$9 trillion business around the world. More importantly, it’s an industry ripe for disruption. Mr. Cook speaks directly to that with his simple comment about thinking differently about how you make your money. I have no idea what Apple is thinking for this space, but I can’t wait to see it. Everything, That’s All But even that isn’t the end of Mr. Cook’s ambitions for Apple, because apparently the company’s leadership wants to be our everything. Firstly, Eddy Cue quipped, “We want to be there from when you wake up till when you decide to go to sleep.” Not to be outdone, Mr. Cook added, “Our strategy is to help you in every part of your life that we can, whether you’re sitting in the living room, on your desktop, on your phone, or in your car.” These are both bold statements that hint Apple has far more than a car up its corporate sleeve. Tim Cook has said repeatedly and often that Apple has new ideas and products it is working on. Apple doubters and members of the Church of Apple’s Doom ignore such statements or don’t understand Apple. But these new comments are the strongest statements about what’s coming we’ve seen in a long time. Shares of $AAPL closed higher Monday at $108.37 per share, a gain of $0.89 (+0.83%), on light volume of 28 million shares trading hands. Other tidbits in the interview include the revelation that the OS X/macOS and iOS beta programs were started because of the flawed 2012 Maps rollout. *In the interest of full disclosure, the author holds a tiny, almost insignificant share in AAPL stock that was not an influence in the creation of this article.

As long as they don't bring the money home, they can avoid paying Uncle Sam. According to a study last year by the Citizens for Tax Justice, nearly three out of four companies in the Fortune 500, or at least 358 companies, use tax havens. As of 2015, these companies were holding about $2.2 trillion in offshore accounts. The Citizens for Tax Justice report estimated that if that money were to be brought home to the United States, it would generate more than $620 billion in tax revenue. That's more than enough to cover every bit of the $600 billion the U.S. Department of Defense spent in fiscal year 2015. Related: Donald Trump Outlines His Top Priority Economic Policies And while the use of tax havens is common among multinational corporations, the bulk of the money held in them belongs to just 30 companies. This 6% slice of the Fortune 500 has squirreled away $1.4 trillion in foreign-earned profits – 65% of the Fortune 500 total. Take a look at this chart from cost information website Howmuch.net: You'll recognize a lot of the names here, starting with the company at the top – Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL). Apple's $181.1 billion in foreign-held cash would result in a $59.2 billion tax bill if all of it were brought home. These days Apple generates about 63% of its profits from overseas operations. To avoid that nasty tax bill, the tech giant funnels most of those foreign earnings to its Ireland-based subsidiaries, where they can sit untaxed indefinitely. Ireland is one of the world's favorite tax havens because of its low 12.5% corporate tax rate and laws that make it easy to pay even less. Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz recently characterized Apple's arrangement, and those of other tax haven aristocrats, as a "fraud" in an appearance last month on Bloomberg TV. That didn't sit well with Apple CEO Tim Cook. In a recent Washington Post interview, Cook defended the use of tax havens. But he also made a suggestion that would do away with them… Why Tax Havens Aren't the Real Problem Join the conversation.

Not content with its devices already living in our pockets, on our wrists, and on our desktops, Apple is seemingly at work on a completely different sort of mobile device: an electric car. Tesla CEO Elon Musk calls Apple’s electric car project an “open secret.” In keeping with the company’s grand tradition of hush-hush product development, there are only whispers about what Apple’s take on mobility will be like. While any sort of product release to this end is still several years away, it’s a fine time to be entering the automotive industry, with U.S. car sales hitting record numbers last year. Whatever Apple’s finished product is actually like, here’s what we know and have heard about the Apple car so far. It is codenamed Project Titan, and a car could be out in five years. Can you hang on until 2021? Celebrated Apple analyst Gene Munster says we’ll have Apple cars on the road within five years. Start saving now. There are reportedly 1,000 employees working on the Apple car. Since it was kicked off in 2014, Project Titan has involved the work of some 1,000 engineers, some of which formerly worked at Tesla. In fact, enough engineers have left Tesla to work for the iPhone manufacturer that Elon Musk has called Apple “the Tesla graveyard.”  Apple owns a variety of URLs pertaining to its car. Check out the reports on apple.car, apple.auto, and apple.cars — they are of course registered to the famous Cupertino technology firm. These sites are broken for now, but they certainly seem like the type of web property to set up if one were going to sell cars. The car could be in development at three different Apple installations around the world. The speculation is that Project Titan hardware is coming together at labs in Vienna, Austria, Berlin, Germany, and Sunnyvale, California. There’s even speculation that it’s being built in Cork, Ireland. Apple has inquired about using a driverless car test track. It’s called GoMentum, and it’s the same automobile-testing station in California where Google and Tesla perfect driverless car features. It seems like any car with futuristic self-driving capabilities comes through this facility. Its state-of-the-art battery will come from an unnamed South Korean partner. Due to top-secret business practices, we don’t get to know the name of the South Korean company Apple is working with on car batteries, but we do get to know that its hollow-centered lithium ion battery design will have significantly expanded capacity. In practical terms, an electric car will be able to go farther on it per charge. Apple has had a hard time finding a company to manufacture its car design. After getting nos from BMW and Daimler, Apple is rumored to be working with vehicle firm Magna, based in Vienna. Senior Vice President of Technologies Bob Mansfield is in charge of Project Titan. Appointed to lead the car project in July, Mansfield is Apple’s head of hardware development and was formerly in charge of the company’s Macs and iPads. We predict lots of smooth, rounded edges here.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple I can’t wait to see Apple’s silly explanation for the iPhone 7’s camera Chris Smith BGR NewsAugust 16, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share I am an iPhone user, and I think the iPhone 7 will be the best smartphone for iOS fans come this fall. Apple’s next-gen smartphones may have the same “old” design, but everything else is getting a lot better. However, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus won’t be identical, and I already wrote that Apple might make me buy an iPhone I don’t want this year, as the iPhone 7 Plus might be the worst thing about the iPhone 7. With all that in mind, I can’t wait so see Apple’s silly explanation for the huge difference between the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch new iPhones. DON’T MISS: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 review For the first time in three generations, the two new iPhones coming out this fall won’t offer the same set of features. Differences caused by size, including the bigger screen, higher resolution, and a larger battery, won’t be the only things making the iPhone 7 Plus the better option. This year’s iPhone 7 Plus will have a hot dual-lens camera capable of some amazing features according to some reports. Rumors also say the iPhone 7 Plus will have more RAM than the iPhone 7, exactly because of that camera's requirements. Meanwhile, the iPhone 7 will get its camera upgrade, hardware-wise, but it won’t be a copy of the dual-lens shooter found on its sibling. Thus, Apple is practically telling buyers who favor the smaller form factor that they can’t get the same awesome experience that the dual-lens will have to offer. The camera is one of the iPhone's best features, and it's likely that some buyers will not appreciate having to choose between two different next-gen camera experiences. Imagine for a second the backlash if Samsung would have equipped different cameras in the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. Even Google's Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X share the same specs when it comes to the primary camera. Make no mistake, Apple will likely explain all the hot innovations around that dual-lens camera on stage, during the iPhone 7 announcement event. After all, it’s the first time the iPhone is getting such a camera. And Apple will also highlight the iPhone 7’s camera, which should offer an excellent performance as well. But it may not tell us right away why it chose to equip different camera hardware in these two handsets. I can understand the ugly antenna lines on the back of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. They’re necessary evils meant to prevent future Antennagates — and I’d take ugly antenna lines any day over antenna problems. I can also understand why Apple opted for a protruding camera on both iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s generation, a compromise between its desire to ship great cameras in a thin body. By the way, remember when Apple tried to pretend the camera bump wasn't there? I can also understand why Apple stuck it out with 16GB as the entry-level storage tier — Apple likes money is one answer. But Apple would tell us that 16GB is enough for more users. Finally, I definitely understand why the headphone jack has to go. And I don’t mind losing it one bit. But I’ll have a tough time coming to terms with the fact that the same camera inside the iPhone 7 Plus can’t make it into the iPhone 7. Apple could say that the dual-lens camera is rather bulky, and imply that design concerns convinced it not to go forward with such plans on the iPhone 7. Apple could say that a dual-lens camera assembly takes up too much internal space as well, and impact battery life on the iPhone 7, which already has a smaller battery than the phablet. And that might be very well true. If only someone thought about making the iPhone just a bit thicker... Apple could also say that supply and/or cost concerns is what convinced it to go with this camera setup for the iPhone 7 series. After all, early reports did say that there might not be enough dual-lens supply to equip all the iPhone 7 Plus versions. One other plausible explanation concerns pricing. Dual-lens cameras are probably more expensive. Putting more RAM inside the iPhone is also more expensive. The same goes for extra storage. And Apple likes its high iPhone prices and its high iPhone margins. Given that more people buy 4.7-inch iPhones than 5.5-inch models, Apple would want to keep manufacturing costs as low as possible for one more year, especially considering that analysts expect Apple to sell fewer iPhones this year. Read More And Apple could even go ahead and say that it simply doesn’t care about what people want in a phone and that it keeps skating towards where the puck is heading. But I bet you a rare Pokemon that Apple won’t be that forthcoming about its camera choices in the iPhone 7, and that when it does, it’ll have a silly explanation for it that might not deliver the whole truth. UPDATE: Readers point out there is a camera difference between the iPhone 6/6S and iPhone 6/6S Plus that I have not mentioned. That's optical image stabilization (OIS) support on the phablets. That's true, but that's still not such a big difference, one that I mentioned before, at least compared to the camera changes coming to the iPhone 7 series.

September is right around the corner and, in turn, we’re just a few short weeks away from Apple taking the wraps off of the company’s next-gen iPhone. With a rumored special event set to take place on September 7, rumor has it that the iPhone 7 will be on store shelves in just about a month, on September 16 to be exact. As you’ve undoubtedly heard by now, the iPhone 7 will likely do away with the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack, a controversial design decision to say the least. Consequently, there has been an avalanche of speculation regarding what Apple plans to implement instead. Sure, we know that Lightning-based headphones will be an option, but it remains to be seen how Apple plans to sell customers on the idea of abandoning a port technology that has been around for decades on end. What’s more, it remains to be seen if Apple will use the iPhone 7 release as a jumping off point to try and transition us to world where wireless headphones are the standard. DON’T MISS: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 review While many tech observers have lambasted Apple for abandoning a port as universal and reliable as the headphone jack, others have taken the position that Apple should be lauded for ushering in its vision of a world devoid of clunky and tangle-prone wires. To this point, reputed industry observer Tim Bajarin recently opined in PC Mag that Apple’s “gamble” in removing the headphone jack will ultimately “force the rest of the industry in a new direction”, similar to how Apple’s design decisions in the past have influenced the industry at large. I suspect this is the case with the audio jack. Dropping it could drive the industry closer to the overall vision of wireless headsets, charging, and communications. I myself have not used a wired headset for two years. When I go for my walks, I use a Bose Bluetooth over-the-ears wireless headset. When taking calls on my iPhone, I use an in-ear Bluetooth headset. In my car, my iPhone connects to the wireless system in the car’s audio system. I have dozens of wired headsets and earphones that still have a 3.5mm audio jack, but all are sitting idle in drawers around the house and office. This utopian world where iPhone users casually transition through various Bluetooth headphones, all without a wired pair of headphones in sight, certainly sounds compelling on the surface. In reality, though, the mobile industry is nowhere ready for a Bluetooth-only world. We’re not even close. The problem with takes like this is that they completely ignore large segments of the population who can’t afford an endless number of wireless solutions. Even if we ignore the technical frustrations that sometimes accompany Bluetooth headsets, it’s worth pointing out Bluetooth headsets aren’t exactly cheap. A quick Google search for over the ear Bluetooth headsets from Bose — the kind Bajarin favors — reveals that such products are far from cheap. A quick search on Google yielded the following results. What’s more, looking through CNET’s list of the best wireless Bluetooth headphones of 2016, nearly 70% of all the entries are for headphones that retail anywhere from $279 to $420. In contrast, you can pick up a pair of solid wired headphones for as little as $15-$20. Apple has always catered to those with more disposable income, but the iPhone 7 may be taking things too far. Of course, wired Lightning headphones will be an option, but let’s be honest, not everyone is a fan of Apple branded headphones. Personally, I’ve never seen a pair of Apple headphones capable of staying in my ear for more than 10 minutes without enduring a little bit of pain. Having said all that, I believe Apple would be downright stupid not to ship an adapter with each iPhone 7 sold. John Gruber of Daring Fireball, however, takes an opposing viewpoint. I don’t think they’ll ship this adapter in the box, so I’m betting options 2 and 4 are out. If they ship it in the box, the implied message is that a 3.5mm headphone port is something every iPhone should have, which is contrary to the decision to remove the port from the device itself. If they’re eliminating the port, they’re saying most people should not need it. If most people shouldn’t need it, there’s no reason to ship the adapter with every iPhone. I’m hoping they sell it separately for $19. I worry they will sell it separately for an exorbitant $29, like they do with the 30-pin to Lightning dongle. Why is $19 okay but $29 all of a sudden becomes exorbitant? From my vantage point, forcing users to purchase an adapter in order to use the headphones they already own — whether they be $15 Sony headphones or $450 Bose headphones — would be, as some in the media have quipped, incredibly “user hostile.” People within the tech industry can sometimes tend to have blinders on, and all of the adoration being heaped upon Bluetooth headsets as an elegant solution ignores the economic reality that not everyone can or is willing to shell out a minimum of 4x-5x more money for headphones. On another note, it’s no secret that iPhone sales need a boost in the arm and Apple would be downright stupid to do anything that would potentially risk convincing users not to upgrade. Thankfully, the guessing game surrounding Apple’s iPhone 7 won’t have to rage on much longer. Again, we can expect Tim Cook and co. to unveil the device at a special event unofficially scheduled for September 7.

Try active manager Fidelity, instead The likes of Carl Icahn and George Soros may run a lot of money, but the Boston-based fund giant manages a lot more Aug 16, 2016 @ 12:44 pm By John Waggoner + Zoom Your clients may be showing you stock ideas from hedge fund managers such as Carl Icahn (Allergan!) and George Soros (Barrick Gold!). They run a lot of money. But Mr. Icahn and Mr. Soros are pikers compared with some of the biggest mutual fund companies. Fidelity Investments, for example, runs about $1.4 trillion in long-term assets. What are they buying these days? According to Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund and ETF research at S&P Global Market Intelligence, Fidelity is heavy on technology, which accounts for about 23% of its assets. Among the Boston behemoth's favorites: • Activision Blizzard (ATVI). Fidelity's share count of the home entertainment software stock rose 93% in the second quarter. • American Tower (AMT), a specialty REIT that owns and operates wireless towers. Fidelity increased its share count 20%. • Tesla Motors (TSLA), the electric car manufacturer, was another Fido favorite. Fidelity's share count also jumped 20% in the second quarter. But not all tech is in favor at Fidelity. Its overall stake in Apple (AAPL) fell 6.9%, to 128 million shares, in the second quarter. Fidelity has been reducing its Apple exposure for four quarters, Mr. Rosenbluth said. Archrival Microsoft's (MSF) share count at Fidelity tumbled 20%, to 122 million shares. Fidelity's stake in Amazon (AMZN) also fell a modest 1.6%. But it wasn't all tech at Fidelity. The company boosted its holdings of Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) 48%, to 21 million shares. But it trimmed its share count of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) by 18%, to 37 million shares, and cut United Health Care 3.8%, to 58 million shares. What stands out about Fidelity's moves are its interest in growth companies — Activision Blizzard in tech and Vertex in health care, versus Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). (Both of the latter companies remain among Fidelity's largest holdings). It's not always terribly illuminating to look at other fund companies' stock holdings. You won't learn much from Vanguard's top pick, said Dan Wiener, editor of The Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors. “Their indexing assets are so huge, it doesn't tell you anything,” Mr. Wiener said. “So their biggest holding is Apple? Thanks for telling me.” But it's worthwhile looking at the top holdings and movements – among an active manager such as Fidelity in first quarter, said Jim Lowell, editor of The Fidelity Investor. “In the main, knowing what Fidelity's top 20 or top 50 positions firm wide was – and now is, can set the stage for perceiving a trend among managers,” Mr. Lowell said. Even looking at Fidelity's largest holdings can tell you what management has the greatest interest in. The four largest positions are, in descending order: Alphabet (GOOG), Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN). The most surprising part about Fidelity's top 20 holdings: iShares ETFs at No. 5: “Quarterly regulatory filings don't require firms to break out their ETF holdings by individual ETFs,” Mr. Lowell said. “But they do require the underlying funds to report in order for the firm to summarize their assets in ETFs. The fact that iShares ETFs represent the ninth largest position in Fidelity's stock lineup tells me that Fidelity's active managers are using ETFs as a source of liquidity in their portfolio &mdash: a more elegant way to stay fully invested since the managers don't have to worry about holding aside cash to meet redemptions.” 0 Comments What do you think?

Berkshire owned 15.23 million Apple shares worth $1.46 billion as of June 30, up from 9.81 million shares as of March 31, according to a regulatory filing from Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate. The filing also said Berkshire cut its stake in Walmart Stores, the world’s largest retailer, by 27 per cent to about 40.23 million shares from 55.24 million. Walmart has been in Berkshire’s portfolio for more than a decade. It was unclear whether Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, are investing in Apple. Berkshire owned more than $133 billion of equities as of June 30. Buffett is typically responsible for larger investments such as Walmart, while his deputies handle smaller investments. “They have more of a trading orientation than Buffett, and may view Apple as attractive because the stock appears cheap or may have a catalyst later this year,” Jim Shanahan, an equity analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. “If Warren Buffett is buying a stock, he’s probably not going to sell it, or at least not sell for a very long time.” Berkshire also owns roughly 90 businesses including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Duracell batteries, and Fruit of the Loom underwear. It also paid $32.1 billion in January for aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, Buffett’s largest purchase. Share prices often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur, including the 3.7 per cent one-day boost that Apple got in May after Berkshire unexpectedly revealed it had taken a stake. Berkshire revealed its higher Apple stake on the same day George Soros’ firm Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors said they dissolved their own Apple stakes. Icahn in April said he had sold his entire Apple stake, citing concerns about China’s policies regarding the company. He later said he would reinvest in Apple if his concerns ebbed. Monday’s Berkshire filing also disclosed other portfolio changes, among them lower stakes in farm equipment maker Deere & Co and Canadian oil and gas company Suncor Energy, and a higher stake in John Malone’s telecommunications company Liberty Global. It also reflected Berkshire’s more than 14 per cent stake in oil refiner Phillips 66. Shanahan said he believes Berkshire has been shedding Walmart shares at least in part to buy Phillips 66. He has a “buy” rating on Berkshire. Berkshire’s filing showed that food company Kraft Heinz was the company’s largest equity investment as of June 30, at $28.81 billion, followed by Wells Fargo & Co.

Demand for Apple's phones has plummeted in China, and the government maintains a wary attitude towards foreign technology. This is at least the CEO's second trip to the country in four months. Apple's new research and development centre will be built by the end of the year, Cook told Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, one of China's most senior officials, according to the official Chinese state broadcaster. The pledge comes after the head of China's industry and technology regulator in May told Cook he hoped Apple could deepen its cooperation with the country in research & development and stressed information security. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sales in Greater China, once touted as Apple's next growth engine, decreased by a third in its most recent quarterly results, after having more than doubled a year earlier. Not only is a slowdown of the world's second-largest economy stoking concerns, but the company's stores for books and movies also went dark in China earlier this year. Apple has also lost intellectual property battles and faced anti-US sentiment from consumers. Before Cook's charm offensive in Beijing in May, Apple announced a $1-billion deal with ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing, a move many experts saw as an attempt to curry favour with Beijing. Other tech firms have in the past pledged investment in China while facing difficulties in the country, including Microsoft and Qualcomm, but often with mixed results.

The Cash Money CEO announced the "power move" on his Instagram, posting a picture of himself with Apple Music head of content Larry Jackson, who confirmed the signing in an Instagram post of his own.  "Welcome to the fam @birdman5star," Jackson wrote on Instagram, tagging the Cash Money mogul. "Tough negotiator. Much respeck."   Check one off of the bucket list ✔️.. Signed as an R&B crooner to Ca$h Money yesterday. My life is oh so complete now. ------ Welcome to the fam @birdman5star. Tough negotiator. Much respeck. ✊-- A photo posted by Larry Jackson (@thelarryjackson) on Aug 14, 2016 at 10:23am PDT As of press time, there are no other details about what, exactly, this deal might entail, but it raises a few interesting questions for the label, which boasts Lil Wayne, Drake and Nicki Minaj as its marquee artists. For one, there's Drake's own deal with Apple, which has manifested itself in two exclusive album releases, the music video for "Hotline Bling" and a sponsorship deal for his current Summer Sixteen Tour alongside Future. Then there's Wayne, currently embroiled in two separate lawsuits -- one against Cash Money, one against distributor Universal Music Group -- that have held up his ability to release music, and his status as one of 20 artist-owners of Jay Z's streaming service Tidal (as is Nicki Minaj), which would seemingly put him at odds with any Apple deal. Update (8:34 p.m.): Two additional sources confirm to Billboard that the Apple deal is for a one-off documentary film about Birdman and Cash Money Records and does not affect the other deals with Cash Money artists, including Nicki and Wayne with Tidal and Drake with Apple. The original story continues below. Streaming's Ad Boom: Will the Millions Spent By Apple, Spotify, Pandora and YouTube Help Decide Who's No. 1? And finally there's the implications that would exist for Cash Money's distribution deal with UMG/Republic Records. This deal would be Apple Music's first with a full label, having previously struck direct deals with individual artists such as DJ Khaled, Future and Chance the Rapper, among others, for various types of exclusives and promotions. Cash Money's relationship with Universal goes back to 1998, when the company struck an unprecedented $30 million distribution deal with the major, turning the regional rap imprint into an international brand overnight. How Chance the Rapper Turned Down Leading Labels, Then Teamed With Apple Music Regardless of the terms, it seems to be another step by Apple Music to lock down as many exclusive releases as possible. Birdman announced recently that he has two new projects on the way: his final solo album, Ms. Gladys, and another label compilation from his Rich Gang cohorts called The Lifestyle 2. And with Apple Music expanding its television, film and advertising offerings of late, there are several mediums within which a deal could exist. The story was first reported by Music Business Worldwide, and Birdman has since changed his Instagram caption to a link to that publication's story. Reps for all parties did not immediately respond to Billboard's requests for comment.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Inside Apple's ultra modern World Trade Center store by Hope King   @lisahopeking August 17, 2016: 8:49 AM ET Inside Apple's new World Trade Center store Apple's newest New York City retail store, which opened its doors Tuesday, is an ultra modern visual extravaganza. Located on two levels of the World Trade Center Transportation hub -- inside the "Oculus" shopping area -- the store sits across from the fashion brand COS and near a John Varvatos and Boss Hugo Boss. This is Apple's seventh Manhattan location, its tenth across the boroughs of New York and 485th globally. For its latest location, Apple didn't go too far in trying to fit in with its futuristic Oculus surroundings, but it did mimic the flow of the surrounding architecture. The company, for example, designed its interior beams and display tables to line up with the transportation hub's curved beams. The ceiling on the second level of the store is also curved to extend the shape of Oculus' wing design. Customers stream into Apple's 485th retail location at the WTC Transportation Hub. Apple occupies two floors inside the World Trade Center Transportation Hub. The interior of the shop looks about the same as most other Apple locations, but also features a huge video wall complete with a sitting area called the "Forum", where people can tinker around with their new products and learn how to use them. An area called "The Forum" provides seating for customers in front of a video wall. There's also a wall called the "Avenue," a play on the concept of walking along a city block and window shopping. Each "window" in the Avenue section, which changes each season, displays products people can test out for themselves. The Avenue, where customers can try new products that change seasonally. The last time Apple launched a store in Manhattan was June 2015 on the Upper East Side. For that location, the company restored a 1920s-era bank, complete with the same Italian marble flooring as the original. Earlier this year, Apple opened its first Brooklyn location in Williamsburg. Related: Inside Apple's new ritzy Manhattan store Westfield, the developer of the Oculus shopping center, celebrated dozens of other store openings on Tuesday, which marked the official grand opening of its newest retail center. There's a slight tilt to the ceiling on the second floor. The $3.9 billion structure was designed to look like a flying dove by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. The World Trade Center Transportation hub connects dozens of different subway lines, including the PATH system, which runs between New York City and New Jersey. Inside the WTC Transportation Hub Hundreds of thousands of commuters and visitors pass through the center every day, according to Westfield.

Join Today Already a member? Login Search Billionaires And Apple Stock: Why George Soros Sold, And Warren Buffett Bought, AAPL August 16, 2016, 04:13:38 PM EDT By Billionaire's Portfolio Shutterstock photo Yesterday was the deadline for all big investors to submit, to the SEC, a public snapshot of their portfolios for the quarter ended June 30th. On that note, as we’ve discussed, this information is covered hot and heavy by the media.  You often see headlines like these (these are actual headlines from yesterday): “Activist hedge fund ValueAct takes about 2 percent stake in Morgan Stanley” or “George Soros sells off Apple stake during the second quarter.” On the above stories, if you own Morgan Stanley should you feel good about it?  Conversely, if you own Apple (AAPL), should you be worried?  The heavy coverage of the topic both online and on television implies "yes" to both, which likely gets the average investor stirring.  But there's never context given as to whether or not the information is meaningful, and there's never evidence given as to what the results tend to be for those that follow.  The reason is, it requires a lot of hard work, experience, ingenuity and proprietary research to draw any conclusions from the information.  For perspective, these Q2 filings show positioning just five days after the UK voted to leave the European Union.  And this event was broadly speculated to be a crushing blow the global markets and the global economy.  As you recall, we made the case that it was over-exaggerated and could actually be good for markets and the economy by invoking some much needed fiscal stimulus. Still, it's safe to assume the UK event had considerable influence on the holdings of the world's biggest investors. Global markets swung violently on the news back in June.  Remember, between June 23rd and June 27th, the S&P 500 fell as much as 5.7%.  It made it all back the subsequent four days. So given the timing of the portfolio snapshot with the Brexit fears, let's talk about Apple, the most widely held stock in the world and the largest constituent in the market cap weighted S&P 500.  The headlines were scrolling fast and furious on Apple yesterday, following the filings from billionaire investors David Einhorn, George Soros and Chase Coleman – all of which sold Apple shares in the quarter. Now, it’s important to understand that these funds can trade Apple with virtual anonymity between quarters.  The stock is too large for anyone one investor to take a 5% “activist” stake, which would trigger the requirement of a 13D filing with the SEC, which would require updated filings (or amendments) within 10 days of any change in the position size (sell one share, you have to report it). On that note, let’s start some perspective on Einhorn’s Apple stake:  Going into the second quarter Einhorn's biggest position, by far, was Apple.  He had 15% of his fund in the stock (a huge position).  It would only make since that he would trim the position and neutralize some risk into an uncertain macro event.  In fact, in his second quarter letter, Einhorn brags that they have done a good job of “trading” Apple (i.e. managing the downside). Still, as of the end of Q2, Apple was a very large position, at 12% of his fund. What about the tech investing genius billionaire Chase Coleman?  Coleman had 9% of his $7 billion fund (long public equities) in Apple going into the second quarter.  By the end, he had cut it by 75%.  Again, playing defense into Brexit. Apple stock is 16% higher than it traded on June 30.  Coleman may very well have put the full position back on since the June 30 snapshot (likely). George Soros?  First, we should note that Soros is the world's best global macro investor. He's an agile investor that will load up on a theme and just as quickly reverse course and position for another probable outcome.  For a career, Soros' bread has been buttered betting on the unexpected outcome.  That's where the big wins come.  Brexit was unexpected, thus his trimming of Apple, the stock with the biggest contribution to his view on a slide in the S&P 500. And then we have arguably the greatest investor of all-time, Warren Buffett.  While others ran from Apple, Buffett increased his stake by more than 55%.  Why?  Buffett has made his living for more than 50 years buying good companies when everyone else is selling.  As he says, “be greedy when others are fearful.” That's a sliver of perspective on the popular 13F filings of the past few days.  As I said yesterday, the presence of a big investor in a stock is rarely valuable information.  Only a small percentage of those reporting investors have the powerful combination of size, influence and portfolio concentration to make their presence alone a potential catalyst for change in a company/and a repricing of the stock.

Currently, it’s unclear how Apple is aggregating those lyrics, whether it be from other lyric websites or from record labels and artists directly. Nevertheless, a new job listing discovered by MBW suggests that Apple is looking to expand its team of “lyrics curators” with a new manager. According to the job listing, the manager would work out of Apple’s main campus, working with a team to improve Apple’s lyric offerings. Specifically, Apple asks that applicants have a “passion for technology and a will to question the current workflows with the mindset to improve tools and processes,” as well as “general understanding, love, and ideally, experience in writing lyrics.” The manager would be responsible for leading a “team of lyrics curators” and “possessing an excellent writing skills, music knowledge, and attention to detail.” Finally, all applicants must have at least five years of experience. We’re looking for a manager to lead a team of lyrics curators with excellent writing skills, music knowledge, and attention to detail. Passion for technology and a will to question the current workflows with the mindset to improve tools and processes. General understanding, love, and ideally, experience in writing lyrics. It’s unclear exactly what would be asked of this lyrics manager and how their efforts would ultimately affect the end experience for iOS 10 users. Following the introduction of iOS 10, however, we speculated that lyric annotation support, similar to that of popular website Genius, could be something Apple might bring to its own lyrics integration. This would be more likely if Apple is transcribing lyrics in-house. If Apple is indeed simply scraping lyrics from other lyric websites, though, this position could simply refer to someone leading a team of curators who are responsible for nothing more than scraping content. Would you be interested in Genius-like lyric annotation support? Let us know in the comments!

This talk was also where Apple had introduced its first security bounty program. This year has been a major year in security for Apple. From being taken to court over iOS encryption methods in the well-documented San Bernardino case, to initiating a requirement for HTTPS connections in all apps in the App Store, it’s easy to see that security is at the forefront of their discussions. Although bugs and vulnerabilities still exist, Apple seeks to resolve them as quickly as possible. Not too long ago, Apple’s iOS 9.3.3 saw a vulnerability being exploited allowing users to jailbreak their devices. Though many jailbreakers openly accept these exploits as a potential to run iOS in the manner they decide, Apple still looks at them for what they are: vulnerabilities in their software which should not exist. Not too long after Pangu released their jailbreaking tool, Apple introduced iOS 9.3.4 closing the exploitation in the IOMobileFrameBuffer. Exploits in the software like this are the ones Apple looks to close to better ensure security for their customers, and one Apple brought up frequently during the San Bernardino court cases. They believed if they did introduce and disclose a way to circumvent the encryption on the iOS device, it could then be used in ways they never imagined. This didn’t stop the FBI from pursuing other avenues where they reportedly paid less than $1 million for the exact exploit they needed. Apple’s introduction of their first security bounty program may have been as a direct result as to what happened with the FBI court case. Apple is much more willing to pay someone who discovers the vulnerability first, versus having it potentially fall into whatever they may consider the “wrong hands”. According to the ‘Behind the Scenes of iOS Security’ talk, Apple’s vulnerability payouts range from $25,000 to $200,000 — all seemingly much less than the rumored “less than $1 million” figure heard before.

An Inside Look at the Apple Watch’s Development→ Linked By John Voorhees Fast Company spoke to Bob Messerschmidt, who worked on the heart rate sensor for the Apple Watch after his startup was acquired by Apple in 2010, about the lessons he learned during his time at Apple. Some of the most interesting bits were Messerschmidt’s description of how designers and engineers interact on a product like the Apple Watch: One great example is [when] I went to a meeting and said I’m going to put sensors in the watch but I’m going to put them down here (he points to the underside of the Apple Watch band he’s wearing) because I can get a more accurate reading on the bottom of the wrist than I can get on the top of the wrist. They (the Industrial Design group) said very quickly that "that’s not the design trend; that’s not the fashion trend. We want to have interchangeable bands so we don’t want to have any sensors in the band." Like many before him, Messerschmidt was also impressed by Apple’s focus on products over technology: At Apple I learned that design and user experience is everything when it comes to consumer products. It’s not so much the technology. It’s the design of the product that creates that sense of happiness in the user. If you look at products like the iPhone or the iPad there aren’t too many totally new technologies included in those products. The real elegance and differentiation doesn’t have a lot to do with the technology idea itself; it’s about the packaging and the value add it gives to people. Those big (new technology) ideas generally happen elsewhere, and they happen earlier. Messerschmidt’s interview is particularly notable because it's not often we get a perspective on the interplay between Jony Ive's design team and Apple's engineers.

(Photo: Apple) SAN FRANCISCO — Apple’s diving share of the key Chinese smartphone market can be explained in three words: cheap local rivals. And it’s not the only major manufacturer to suffer. A new report from IDC showed China-based Xiaomi’s sales crashed even harder in the second quarter. Apple’s smartphone sales in the June quarter (8.6 million shipments) plummeted 32% from a year ago, dropping it to No. 5 in the market from No. 3, IDC said Tuesday. The iPhone SE, introduced earlier this year, misfired because Chinese consumers prefer larger screen-sized phones, IDC said. Things were worse for Xiaomi, the Chinese start-up once touted as the country's answer to Apple. Its sales dove 38% to 10.5 million, knocking it off its top-ranked perch to No. 4. Chinese phone makers Huawei, OPPO and vivo – lower-cost alternatives to Apple – made significant inroads at the expense of the Cupertino, Calif.-based company. They now rank 1-2-3 in China, based on total shipments for the quarter. Huawei sold 19.1 million smartphones in the quarter, followed by OPPO (18 million) and vivo (14.7 million), IDC said. Aggressive consumer marketing and a “focus on product differentiation” loomed large in their success, Xiaohan Tay, an analyst at IDC Asia/Pacific, said in a statement. OPPO, for instance, highlighted its fast-charge technology and Huawei touted its camera. It’s been tough sledding for China in Apple. Iphone sales in the world’s most-populous country were for years a pivotal reason for Apple’s smartphone success worldwide, until recently making it Apple’s second-largest market. But a tepid economy and intense competition contributed to a 33% plunge in quarterly revenue, to $8 billion, pushing the region's contribution behind Europe's. The recent plight of the iPhone — whose sales have declined the last two quarters — has prompted Apple to explore other ways of pumping up revenue in China. On Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook, visiting China for at least the second time in four months, said the company will build its first Asia-Pacific R&D center in China, according to the official Chinese state broadcaster. Apple could not immediately be reached for comment. Meanwhile, Apple's recent $1 billion investment in Didi, known as the Uber of China, proved shrewd when Didi said it would buy and merge Uber’s Chinese operations. Apple could also reverse, or slow its slide, in China with a new iPhone, expected to be announced next month.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Aug 16, 2016 at 3:39PM Image source: Motley Fool. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported earnings for the quarter ended in June, which is the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 for the company, on July 26. The stock has gained nearly 13% since then, rising from $96.7 per share to nearly $109.3 as of the time of this writing. In terms of market capitalization, this means that Apple has added approximately $68 billion to its market value after reporting earnings. This impressive performance over a relatively short period of time cannot be attributed to one single factor. However, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in the post-earnings conference call that demand for the iPhone SE outperformed expectations, and the device is particularly successful at attracting new customers to the Apple ecosystem. This is clearly good news for investors in Apple, and arguably one of the main reasons the stock is doing so well. What Apple's CEO wants you to know Apple launched its iPhone SE model in March, and the 4-inch device is considerably cheaper than previous iPhone models. The iPhone SE has a starting price of $399 without a two-year contract. (As a reference, the iPhone 6s starts at $649.)  Apple devices are typically much more expensive than products from the competition, and this can be a major disadvantage for the company in competitive terms. This is especially relevant in emerging markets, where income levels are much lower than in the U.S. and the carrier subsidy business model is not as prevelant The iPhone SE substantially reduces Apple's pricing disadvantage in smartphones, so it could be a powerful move to attract new customers to the Apple ecosystem. In fact, that's one of the main reasons Apple launched the product in the first place. According to Tim Cook, demand for the iPhone SE exceeded supply during the June quarter. The company managed to balance demand and supply in September, and this bodes well in terms of sales going forward. Importantly, the iPhone SE is bringing in plenty of new customers to Apple, when it comes to both first-time smartphone buyers and switchers from other platforms. Cook provided a lot of detail on the launch of the iPhone SE: We had a very successful global launch of iPhone SE and demand outstripped supply throughout the quarter. We brought on additional capacity and were able to achieve supply-demand balance as we entered the September quarter. At its launch, we said that the addition of the iPhone SE to the iPhone lineup placed us in a better position to meet the needs of customers who love a four-inch phone and to attract even more customers into our ecosystem. In both cases, that strategy is working. Our initial sales data tells us that the iPhone SE is popular in both developed and emerging markets and the percentage of iPhone SE sales going to customers who are new to iPhone is greater than we've seen in the first weeks of availability for other iPhones launched in the last several years. Overall, we added millions of first-time smartphone buyers in the June quarter and switchers accounted for the highest percentage of quarterly iPhone sales we've ever measured. In absolute terms, our year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we've seen in any nine-month period, and our active installed base of iPhones is up strong double digits year-over-year. What this means for investors in Apple The iPhone 6 was an extraordinary success for Apple in 2015. Many customers were eagerly awaiting a iPhone model with a larger screen size, and the iPhone 6 was a game changer in that area. During fiscal year 2015, Apple sold over 231 million iPhones, an impressive increase of 37% versus fiscal 2014. Most customers don't upgrade their iPhones every year, so massive sales in 2015 represent quite a challenge for Apple in 2016. To put the numbers in perspective, the company sold 40.4 million iPhone units in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, which is a 15% increase versus the same period in 2014, but still down by 15% versus the third quarter in fiscal 2015. Data source: SEC filings. The fact that the iPhone SE is attracting new customers to the Apple ecosystem shows that Apple can gain ground versus lower-priced competitors, reducing the company's dependency on renewal sales. Besides, Apple users are typically very loyal to the brand, so chances are that a considerable share of these new iPhone buyers will continue being Apple customers in the future. In a nutshell, the iPhone SE is not only selling better than expected, but it's also attracting lots of new customers to Apple's famously sticky ecosystem of products, services, and applications. This has strong positive implications for investors in Apple going forward.  Andrés Cardenal owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

The Apple Store is relocating on the Country Club Plaza and will be the first tenant to open in the new Plaza 211 building, formerly Halls Plaza. In an email, Apple said it plans a 10 a.m. opening Saturday at 227 Nichols Road. Apple officials couldn’t be reached for comment, but Plaza officials confirmed the new Apple location. &nbsp; Halls Plaza closed in August 2014 and consolidated with its Crown Center store. Its Plaza building, at 211 Nichols Road, was scheduled to be renovated and reopen in fall 2015 as Plaza 211 with several retailers and possibly a two-story restaurant on the east corner. Earlier this year, Apple applied for a work permit for a space in the building, but an Apple spokeswoman said the company had not made an announcement for that site. Apple opened in its current space at 4712 Broadway in September 2004.

Share Tweet Share Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ Editorials-Editorials+ The idea that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in computing is pretty well established at this point. All major software companies around have said as much and we've seen the visions of big guns like Google, Microsoft and Facebook for the future of AI. Apple, however, has been a little more hesitant about making big proclamations about AI until now.  In an interview with the Washington Post, Cook made it clear that he understands the value of AI and also made it clear that he sees Apple as being a major player in terms of AI. When I saw the interview, I had to read it a few times to make sure I had read it correctly, because the idea of Apple as a major player in AI is completely incompatible with the privacy-focused version of Apple that Tim Cook has built.  At its most basic level, AI is a way to glean novel and interesting information from the huge amounts of data that we all generate constantly. Given this, it makes perfect sense that a company like Google -- whose stated goal is to organize the world's data, and a company built on gathering as much data about you as possible -- would make a big push into AI. Apple has consistently placed itself as the antithesis of that idea.  Privacy vs AI Apple's reputation is built on privacy. Cook has boasted time and again about how Apple either doesn't gather your data or doesn't gather it without multiple notifications and opt-in messages. Cook's Apple was even poised and ready to take on the FBI in order to protect user privacy. This idea of privacy cannot exist in a world of AI.  Apple is obviously going to try. It showed off Differential Privacy at WWDC as a way to collect data on users while still respecting privacy and this will work to a certain extent but in very limited ways. Differential Privacy will allow Apple to use some AI to make general keyboard predictions and autocorrections better and maybe even general predictions in terms of navigation for Apple Maps. But, that's the real issue -- anonymized data can only lead to general predictions.  The best promises of AI and the most exciting things we've seen for AI come from hyper-individual recommendations and learning. At Google I/O, the promise of Allo was to be able to instantly suggest relevant information or allow for searches based on what you had typed. The only way this would be possible is by allowing Google servers access to read that data (although Google will instantly delete the chat records). If you turn on the privacy focused end-to-end encrypted Incognito mode of Allo, those special features disappear.  At its best, AI can take data including your preferences, location, interests, habits, and history, mix in those same findings from others and offer you something that is either unexpected and interesting or helpful and timely, while being automated and seamless. At its best, AI churns through the huge amounts of data we create -- intentionally and unintentionally -- to find patterns that make every process easier, faster, and filled with added value.  Tim Cook may want Apple to be a part of that revolution, but Apple will be handicapped in the AI race as long as the company stands by its identity as the anti-Google that holds up user privacy by not gathering all of that data. Cook can certainly pivot and take Apple down the path of data gathering and AI, but that will be a hard sell to the hundreds of millions who have bought iPhones under the promise that their data was private even from the eyes of Apple.  Featured stories   LG V20 camera tips and tricks   When will my phone get Android 7.0 Nougat?   Best high-end Samsung smartphones you can get right now (November 2016)   iPhone 7 Plus vs $1600 camera: which takes better portraits?   Nokia's return to smartphones confirmed for 2017   Bezelless Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8?

Well-Manicured-Man (Posts: 342; Member since: 16 Jun 2015) I challenge this view. Artificial intelligence is about data interpretation and data presentation to the user but it doesn't mean that AI needs to know everything about you and it does not mean that Apple needs to have access to this data neither. Google wants to have access to this data because they want to make money out of you this way. Firstly, a good artificial intelligence delivers exactly what you ask her to do. For example showing certain information in a well structured way from the internet to the user. Secondly, of course this AI can gather data about you but it is not necessary that Apple has to know this data. What would be the value add if Apple knew this data? Why would this make the AI better? Privacy and AI do not exclude each other. posted on 17 Aug 2016, 01:12 2 Reply 11. Leo_MC (Posts: 1666; Member since: 02 Dec 2011) Exactly my opinion. Making a rudimentary comparison, think about fingerprint scanner in iPhones: the data is stored locally without acces from anywhere; the same could be true for other data: it could be stored locally or in an encrypted iCloud (where no one - not even Apple - except AI, has access). posted on 17 Aug 2016, 04:46 1 Reply 12. shahrooz (Posts: 763; Member since: 17 Sep 2013) " it doesn't mean that AI needs to know everything about you and it does not mean that Apple needs to have access to this data neither" that's why it won't be as good as other AIs. the more it knows, the better it works. "AI can gather data about you but it is not necessary that Apple has to know this data." google claims the same but apple mocks it, is it gonna be okay when they do this?

Finalflash (Posts: 3169; Member since: 23 Jul 2013) I honestly don't know what Cook is smoking there. They're going to be absolutely worthless in AI. Under Tim Cook, there is no uniform direction for Apple or its various products. All he cares about is money and margins, which under him have been amazing, but so far the products have been meh and the sales and goodwill from Jobs' time are pretty much sustaining Apple and their growth. Once again, he claims that AI is their focus, but until Google showed their efforts at Deep Learning at IO (which was an amazing/scary demo), they weren't even talking about AI at a high level. So it seems to be more a "me too" reaction like MS last decade rather than their own inspiration (which is Apple as of late). They tried to buy their way into unique hardware advantages like sapphire and failed miserably. They're going to try that again with AI and probably have the same results. They just got around to opening up Siri to become useful, until now it was and still is sub-par. They have a "focus" on privacy but want to be huge players in AI, which is pretty much half assing it. They will apparently deliver something with the iPhone 7 that we "need" and cannot live without, but it isn't hardware because this year's iPhone is turning out to be the worst release yet. They're trying to flog the iPad "Pro" (and its 10 000 variants), with a keyboard, that makes it more bulky than a Macbook as a solution for the replacement of that Macbook. Haven't updated their laptops in years so they can push their most idiotic fans into buying the higher margin iPad "Pro" most likely. Haven't touched their Mac Pro for years but apparently they're focused on the Pro market. What is Apple under Tim Cook other than a headless chicken/cash milking machine? Once their cow (iPhone) dries up and their iFans wisen up (no where to go but up), will they be able to sustain their BS? posted on 16 Aug 2016, 16:39 3 Reply 3. kiko007 (Posts: 3074; Member since: 17 Feb 2016) Techie would be proud :D. posted on 16 Aug 2016, 16:49 0 Reply 5.

TechieXP1969 (Posts: 10535; Member since: 25 Sep 2013) Proud of what. I'm not familiar with Google IO that he spoke of. But I had plan to research why Tim Cook talked about AI, when PA first posted it. I won't comment on Apples hardware because I share some of his sentiments. I don't know ow what Apple is doing. First Cook says the next iPhone is going ro have thibgs you never thought you could be without, which I assets are software improvements, b3cause so far the leaked hardware has not shown pro.ise, other than the dual camera. Then Apple was a TV, and they want to be in cars, then the iPad Pro is suppose to be able to reach a laptop, yet they claim the Surface was tweeible at being a tablet and a laptop, while the iPad is the one actually terrible at it. Yet they raised the price. If Verizon didn't sell me the Pro model for the price of the Air 2, I wouldn't even have gotten it. It is a waste of money. I should have followed by first intention which was to get a Surface Book. IVE is doing nothing with design. I don't know how you can improve AI with to little.of data. Sorry it isn't going ro work. Apple does need an alternative to the iPad and iPhone because those are going ro drop every year. By 2020 Apple will.probably be selling less than 100M iPhones a year at this rate. They need to make some shear over to provide another fad product. posted on 16 Aug 2016, 23:04 1 Reply 9.

Are you sure? While I'm not an Apple walled garden fan, I was a fan of their FBI privacy stance. Normally I would agree with your article but I feel like it is lacking some basic framework for the argument. In your mind AI exists in the cloud and data sent to the cloud in any fashion is unsafe. But who says AI can't be on your device? I would welcome a more private approach to AI that is local. I would also argue that when you do your own search for whatever it is you need, that information is also being transmitted in a similar fashion as with AI to the internet to return you a result. In some cases having a massive cloud based AI that communicates with thousands of anonymous clients over a secure connection may serve to further protect individual users as long as the AI is essentially a VPN with intelligence. Design it to only work once the device sending the data has sent a key and destroy the key after processing the request. I think there are ways to do this securely and I would hope Apple and Google could both find better ways to implement and improve AI. posted on 18 Aug 2016, 01:27 0 Reply 14. roscuthiii (Posts: 2225; Member since: 18 Jul 2010) The "I" in AI stands for "intelligence"... a learning computer. If you destroy the data after every use, there is nothing learned. You don't have AI - All you've achieved is a basic tokenized Google search. I suppose having all the learning done locally would be an option... someday. But, to my knowledge, no personal computer comes evenclose to that capability yet. You'd need a supercomputer, which resemble server farms, or some kind of sci-fi quantum computer. posted on 16 Aug 2016, 22:27 1 Reply 8. tedkord (Posts: 12153; Member since: 17 Jun 2009) Always good to see Mr. Heller here.

August 16, 2016 7:18am Nasdaq:AAPL ShareTweet From Zacks Research: With Warren Buffett’s company disclosing a massive new investment in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), many investors are wondering if they should follow the venerable oracle into a larger position as well. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B – Analyst Report) raised its stake in Apple (AAPL – Analyst Report) by 55% to 15.23 million shares as of June 30.  About 3 months ago, the firm held close to 9.8 million AAPL shares which were purchased at an average price of about $109 per share.  Warren Buffett, founder and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is commonly regarded as one of the greatest (if not the greatest) investors of all time.  It should be noted, however, that it wasn’t Buffett’s decision to initiate the first purchase of Apple shares 3 months ago. Warren Buffett favors a value-oriented mentality when it comes to investing, so it should not come as a large surprise that his firm picked up more shares last quarter.  After all, Apple’s share price trended down since Berkshire’s last purchase, and value investors love buying beaten-up shares in companies they own.  They do this because of their strong belief in the long term potential of their investments.  Berkshire Hathaway seems confident enough to double down on Apple, so should you follow suit and pick up some AAPL shares? Long Run For long term investing, it is hard to argue a case against Apple.  There are weaknesses, like the strong reliance on its iPhone to drive revenue numbers and growing competition on the smartphone front as Samsung (SSNLF) keeps finding ways to test the limits of modern technology.  It should be noted, however, that Apple commands a strong user base with unparalleled brand loyalty.  Many iPhone users don’t just buy the phone for its hardware specs, but because it is simply the iPhone.  Fans of the brand refuse to use a platform that isn’t running on IOS.  This is a key aspect of the Apple brand which no other Android product has, and it will be a major key with regards to retaining its loyal user base. Also, Apple’s services have done well in showing growth potential, and in the company’s recent Q3 earnings report, Services grew by 19% year-over-year and App Store sales came in at the highest they’ve ever been.  Services include sales from Internet Services, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing, and other services, and they accounted for 14% of Apple’s revenues in the third quarter. In addition to its core base, Apple is seeking to keep innovating by investing money in several ventures such as an Uber competitor, virtual reality, autonomous driving, mobile payments, music, and more.  Although the company has hit a growth slump, it should be able to make up for that by diversifying revenues and investing in new technologies. Bottom Line Apple is trading for close to $110 right now, and it does look pretty cheap on the valuation front.  The stock trades at a forward PE of 13.08, and it has a pretty tame PEG of 1.51.  The company is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), so you may want to wait for the earnings outlook to pick up in the short term before buying shares. Apple shares rose $0.46 (+0.42%) to $109.94 in premarket trading Tuesday. The world’s largest computer and mobile device maker’s stock has gained 4% year-to-date, compared with a 7% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 during the same period.

Starting Tuesday, customers of KDDI, Japan's second-largest mobile phone company, have the option in the Apple App Store to pay by mobile, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the deal hasn't been announced. Japanese consumers who don't have credit or debit cards can participate in the mobile economy. Carrier billing represents another battlefield between Apple and its chief rival Google, and one where the tech giants are taking very different approaches. Google Play, the app store on Android devices, has been signing up as many global carriers as possible and now has mobile billing availability in 45 markets, including deals with Japan's top three phone companies. By contrast, Apple has been quite deliberate in its expansion, starting in Germany with Telefonica's O2 in late October, followed by VimpelCom's Beeline unit in Russia five weeks later. On Monday, the rollout hit Switzerland through a deal with Swisscom and Far EasTone in Taiwan. "Something previously reserved for Android users is now available to millions of Apple customers via Swisscom," the Bern-based carrier said in a press release. "As a result of an extensive collaboration, they can as of now easily pay for digital content in the App Store and on iTunes, Apple Music, iBooks and Apple TV via their mobile phone bills." Having seen positive results from its initial deals, Apple has several more countries in the near-term pipeline, sources said. With iPhone sales slowing, Apple is touting its growth opportunity in software and services, and the revenue potential from games, music subscriptions, books and cloud storage. Apple carrier billing deals Market Carrier Date Subscribers (mlns) Germany Telefónica O2 Oct. 2015 9.4 Russia VimpelCom Beeline Dec. 2015 57.7 Switzerland Swisscom Aug. 2016 6.6 Taiwan Far Eastone Aug. 2016 7.4 Japan KDDI Aug. 2016 46.6 Source: Company reports Japan is a critical market for Apple because it's among the countries where consumers are most comfortable with mobile payments. According to research firm Ovum, carrier billing accounts for 70 percent of purchases on Google Play in Japan and South Korea. Only in those two countries has carrier billing reached far beyond digital goods and into physical products for "low-value items such as snacks, drinks and phone accessories," Ovum said. But games are the key. Japan is the world's biggest mobile gaming market, with consumers flocking to apps like Puzzles & Dragons from GungHo Online Entertainment, Fate/Grand Order from Aniplex and, of course, Pokemon Go. Games on phones produced about $6.2 billion in revenue last year, according to SuperDataResearch, $1 billion more than in China. With 46.6 million subscribers, KDDI is bigger than SoftBank in Japan and smaller than NTT Docomo. KDDI didn't immediately respond to a request left before the opening of business in Tokyo. CNBC.com also put in requests for comment to SoftBank and NTT Docomo to see if they too are rolling out carrier billing, but we haven't heard back. Apple hasn't yet offered a comment. Carrier billing has distinct advantages over plastic. Consumers are already paying their phone bills every month, so it's much easier to add items with the simple tap of a button than it is to type in information from a credit card or link to a PayPal account. For app makers, musicians and other content creators, that means more completed transactions. show chapters No headphone jack? Here's what we know about the iPhone 7    Tuesday, 9 Aug 2016 | 9:00 AM ET | 02:33 Apple has a separate page on its website, describing how to set up mobile billing on an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, or in iTunes from a computer. "If your carrier supports it, you can pay for your iTunes Store, App Store, and iBooks Store purchases and your Apple Music membership through mobile phone billing," the web page says. It also notes that "mobile phone billing is currently available with select carriers in Germany, Russia, Switzerland and Taiwan." The rates that carriers charge per transaction are higher than the average credit card fee, but they've come way down in recent years into the single digits. In the top markets, carrier billing adds enough volume to make up for the loss in margin. Like other big platforms, Microsoft has been bolstering its roster of global carrier partners. Last week, the world's biggest software maker said that carrier billing is available across Windows 10 devices in the U.K. with O2 and in Italy with Wind. Meanwhile, Google made a big splash in May, signing its first carrier deal in India with Idea Cellular. As Apple plays catch-up, expect to hear of several more rollouts in the coming weeks and months.

A hollow battery – the center opening is about the size of two fingers – is considered advantageous because lithium-ion batteries typically heat up from the middle and require a cooling device as a result. With air flow in the center instead of heat, there is no need for cooling devices, enabling a boost in battery capacity in the same space. Apple, per usual, isn't talking about the agreement, and has generally been mum about anything having to do with what's referred to as Project Titan, which is potentially an electric car program. That's why there's no word on which South Korean battery company is getting involved, but ETNews says the company has fewer than two-dozen employees. Last month, the computer-making giant moved longtime executive Bob Mansfield over to lead the vehicle effort. Mansfield had worked on Apple projects such as the iMac, iPad, and the MacBook Air. Additionally, Apple also tapped Dan Dodge to work with Mansfield on the vehicle program. Dodge previously led BlackBerry's automotive-software development. Apple continues to look for more real estate to broaden its vehicle-making efforts. San Francisco Bay Area developer Hudson Pacific Properties said in May that Apple had been hunting around for about 800,000 square feet of Silicon Valley space for the car project, while Google was looking for something about half that size. As for South Korea, that country continues to boost its presence in the plug-in vehicle world via lithium-ion battery development, as it is home to both Samsung and LG Chem.

This latest offer from the tech giant is focused on simplicity. The app only supports video calls between two people and does little else. With the market already saturated with similar services, it will be interesting to see whether Google will be able to get this one to stick. Here’s how Duo stacks up against its rivals: Google Duo Availability: The Google Duo app can be downloaded for free on Android and iOS devices. Convenience: You just need to input a phone number and give the app access to your address book. It isn’t connected to any of Google’s other communication services, and because it’s so new you’ll likely have to request that a friend download the app before you can call them through it. Performance: If you’re moving around it will automatically switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data without dropping the call. There is also a “Knock Knock” feature that allows you to see the caller before you answer. FaceTime Availability: Available for free on Apple products—iPhones, iPads, iPod Touches, and Mac computers. Convenience: Using this feature requires an Apple ID and an email address which, if you’re using an Apple product, you likely already have. It works with your address book rather than having to make a call through a separate app. If you receive a call, you can answer on any one of your Apple devices. Performance: You can easily switch between voice calls and video calls, and adjust the view from portrait to landscape or from front camera to rear camera. Skype Availability: Skype can be downloaded on most mobile devices—Android, iPhone, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, Amazon Fire Phone, and iPod Touch. It’s also available on various tablets, Android Wear, Apple Watch, and Xbox One. Convenience: You can link your Skype account to Outlook and GroupMe. Skype-to-Skype calls, group calls, and instant messaging are free. You can either pay as you go or buy a subscription to access other features including calls to mobile phones and landlines. Performance: You can add up to 25 people to a group call and, unlike Google Duo and FaceTime, can instant message during a video session. Skype also offers screen sharing, call forwarding, voice messages, and a translator. Facebook Messenger Availability: Video calling is available through Messenger to anyone with a Facebook account. It works on three browsers—Firefox, Google Chrome, and Opera. Convenience: Video calling works both on a web browser and through Facebook’s mobile Messenger app. Performance: Unlike FaceTime and Google Duo, Facebook recently announced that group calls of up to 50 people are now available through the service.

That is, of course, not the way it works. Unless you’re Apple. Apple is currently holding $181 billion overseas, largely thanks to arbitrarily deciding that its most valuable intellectual property seems to live exclusively in low tax countries. For instance, at one time Apple’s subsidiaries in Ireland — a country with 4.6 million people — “earned” over one-third of all Apple’s worldwide revenue. And due to a very business-friendly quirk in U.S. tax law, Apple doesn’t have to pay any U.S. taxes on its overseas profits until it “brings them back” to America. Here’s what Apple CEO Tim Cook had to say about it in a long interview published this weekend in the Washington Post: We’ve said at 40 percent, we’re not going to bring it back until there’s a fair rate. There’s no debate about it. Is that legal to do or not legal to do? It is legal to do. It is the current tax law. It’s not a matter of being patriotic or not patriotic. It doesn’t go that the more you pay, the more patriotic you are. Cook simultaneously wants us to know he is not a bad “traditional CEO” who just cares about money. No, to the contrary, he feels an “incredible responsibility” to “the communities and the countries that the company operates in” and “the whole ecosystem of the company.” Therefore, because Cook cares so little about money and so much about communities, Apple won’t be paying its taxes. That’s just fair. And more fairness is just around the corner, Cook thinks. “I’m optimistic that, in 2017, there will be some sort of corporate tax reform,” he said. “The U.S. needs to invest more in infrastructure — so what would be great is if they take the tax proceeds of a corporate tax reform and invest it in infrastructure and roads and bridges and airports.” Translated into plainer English, this means Cook believes that Corporate America’s longterm plan to hold the U.S. for ransom will in fact come to fruition next year. U.S. corporations have by now stashed over $2.1 trillion in profits overseas (including Apple’s $181 billion), thereby starving the U.S. of revenue we could use to repair our collapsing infrastructure. What they want is for Americans to get so desperate that Congress is willing to deeply slash the corporate tax rate for “repatriated” money. This will deliver a one-time jolt of tax revenue, at the cost of sending the message that everyone who possibly can should use tax avoidance schemes like Apple’s in the future. Cook is right to be optimistic: Hillary Clinton has hinted that she’ll push for exactly this in her first 100 days in office, while Donald Trump has said explicitly that he wants to make it happen. Moreover, in the interview Cook also notes he’s gotten advice on how to handle this issue from both Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Bill Clinton. So get ready for a tsunami of fairness, headed your way next year. (“It doesn’t go that the more you pay, the more patriotic you are” has a nice ring to it. You should definitely tell that to the IRS.)

Google Duo is just a creepier FaceTime Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Messaging August 16, 2016 Nobody's home, Google. (Reuters/Morris Mac) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Messaging August 16, 2016 Google’s FaceTime killer seems more like a rip-off than an innovation. Today (Aug. 16) Google announced a new video-calling app called Duo that doesn’t seem all that different to its predecessors. The app opens with a split-screen of your image and a button to initiate calls, with your recently called contacts listed next to it. Unlike Apple’s FaceTime, Duo works across Android and iOS devices. “You shouldn’t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are,” the company writes in a blog post. Google’s main innovative feature is “Knock Knock ,” which lets you see live video of your caller before you answer, unlike Apple’s FaceTime. Google calls this “more like an invitation rather than an interruption” and “spontaneous and welcoming.” The Snapchat-esque live video calling feature is actually pretty creepy. There’s little added value in someone seeing you before they answer your call since the only people who can utilize the feature are people in your contact list. Apple blocks the Google app from accessing its devices’ screens, so iPhone users only get an incoming call notification without the video. Android users can opt out of the feature via the app’s settings. Google says Duo is “simple from start to finish” because it can directly access people in your phone’s contacts list. FaceTime also does this. Google also says the app is “fast and reliable” and allows people to seamlessly transition from wifi to cellular networks. However, that only matters in poor conditions. Google’s approach came to light at this year’s I/O conference in May, when the Mountain View, California, giant announced Duo alongside chat-focused app Allo, which is yet to be released. Even if Apple users are enticed by the cross-platform functionality–they can only make Apple-to-Apple FaceTime calls– Google still has to win over Android consumers—that’s over 80% of the worldwide smartphone market—who can use Microsoft’s Skype and Google’s own Hangouts. Plus, these platforms offer file transfers, text messaging and group calling, in addition to one-on-one calls, so “Knock Knock” won’t be enough to convert them to Duo users.

The Apple CEO visited several businesses in the country in an attempt to boost enthusiasm for his company in the local market.  ( Andrew Burton | Getty Images ) Advertisement Apple CEO Tim Cook visited China once more and touted that an Asia-Pacific Research and Development (R&D) center will be deployed in the country by the end of the current year. Although little other details surfaced, it looks like the statement happened during a meeting of Apple's leader with the Chinese Vice Premier, Zhang Gaoli. Reuters reports that Foxconn CEO Terry Gou was also part of the meeting where the R&D center was announced. Foxconn is one of Apple's main business partners, as the company supplies components to the tech company. Cook's agenda contained more than meeting with officials from the Chinese government. He also had a meeting with Guo Pei, a famous fashion designer from the country. He commended the way in which Guo Pei taps into the potential of her iPad Pro to design new fashion collections. "Nihao, Beijing! It's great to be back," Cook posted on Sina Weibo, one of the country's most used social media platforms. Since he took the reins of Apple in August 2011, this is the ninth time Cook has visited China. During his visit back in May, Cook demoed the new Chinese music features the company packed into GarageBand, Apple's music production software. In the demonstration, he was joined by Singaporean musician JJ Lin in Beijing. At the time, Apple announced its plans to invest in Didi Chuxing, a local rival to Uber. During the recent trip, the Apple CEO stopped by a gym where he showcased the Apple Watch's potential as a fitness tracker, and he went to a showroom where Apple's HomeKit was in use. These might seem like small publicity stunts, but the company needs all the help it can get to push its revenue in China upward. During the Q3 2016, Apple's revenue from Greater China ranked only $8.85 billion, which is a drastic 33 percent drop compared to figures during the same period last year. Apple's media sales in the country are still being throttled by the authorities. In April this year, the company's movie and e-book stores were closed down as the government asked for increased oversight over their content. During the recent earnings report, Cook addressed the issue and pacified investors, saying that the two stores did not bring a consistent stream of revenue anyway. The install base for iPhones also increased by 34 percent year-over-year, despite decelerating revenue reported in the country. China Mobile, for example, which happens to be the most popular wireless carrier in the country, touts that smartphones from Apple on its network overtake any rival manufacturer brand.

He reportedly told government officials that Apple would increase its investments in China and build a research facility there, according to a state television report cited by The Wall Street Journal. ADVERTISEMENT Quartz reported that Cook was documenting his trip to the country on Sina Weibo, a popular Chinese social media tool. He visited with a Chinese fashion designer who uses an iPad and a gym where students were using Apple Watches. His visit — said to be his ninth to China — comes as the tech giant looks to overcome regulatory problems it has faced with local authorities. China blocked Apple’s iTunes movie and e-book stores this spring, prompting concerns over whether the company’s generally good relationship with the country was souring. Cook said in May that Apple was “pretty confident and optimistic that we’ll be back online and offering those to our Chinese customers soon.” The dustup was notable because Apple has traditionally enjoyed a better relationship with China than many other American technology firms. Both Google and Facebook are currently not accessible to users in mainland China. Apple’s business in China has also recently fallen off, with revenues in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan falling by 33 percent since last year.

The newer Apple's maybe lighter and have other perks but they do not have a DVD slot. Granted most people these days stream their videos or use Netflix, but living in a country setting and relying on limited WiFi the DVD feature satisfies our needs. Couldn't be more pleased! Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: pumpkincq10 (2) (0) by allenlouis Apr 14, 2016 Apple I have a Macbook Air, 2014, SSD, clearly a fine laptop. The 2012 Macbook Pro was added to my Apple products. I like the system, although it doesn't have the SSD, so speed is not up to par (SATA). Also one of my complaints is the sound volume is very low, the volume control is maxed out, apparently this is a problem with this release year. It is heavy and the battery life does not compare with the Air. I do like the fact that it has a DVD drive. I have gained memory and after researching, have found that I can increase the memory to 16mb, this is one reason I settled on a used Macbook Pro, also i can install an SSD drive. For me this was my purchasing criteria. I like the Apple line and it is hard to find fault, although clearly there are areas that need to be improved upon. I would recommend this laptop. Once you get past the cost, it's all good. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: nay321 (2) (1) by ttaggyi Aug 08, 2016 Still growing but a great little addition to our Apple Family We use only Apple Products on our household and I purchased this version of the MacBook Pro for it's portability and built in optical drive. I sometimes have clients that want instant gratification. So I sometimes have to build them a deliverable on CD or DVD. the built in Drive comes in very handy) I haven't downloaded all of my software just yet, but I'm getting to it and all have to is go to the app store where all thus stuff is paid for and I can download and install it. Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: myfavelectronics (2) (2) by the-flameous Apr 30, 2016 Great notebook for developing Powerful laptop for students and developers, or students-developers like me. Pros: 1). Great performance with SSD. Android Studio starts in 8-12 seconds, other IDEs - same. 2). Long battery life. Helps in hackathons and lectures. 3). Backlit keyboard. Great stuff in dark. 4). UNIX based OS. Like my favourite Debian, but with lots of animations. 5). Design. Yeah, it's amazing! Cons: 1). Price. Yep, 600$ for used laptop is not very nice. 2). Screen resolution. When I'm working a long time for a laptop, my eyes tired. Wants Retina. 3). No HDMI port, only MiniDP and useless FireWire. Well, laptop is great, but in 2016 Macbook Pro with Retina is more preferred.

In iOS 10, Siri is being opened up to developers. Zou Tao, co-founder of Run Again, an app featuring sports and social networking, used Apple's digital assistant Siri to introduce his app. In addition, he opened the app Run Again by giving Siri a voice command. Luo Wen, vice president of products at Didi Chuxing, China's leading ride-hailing service provider, demonstrated how its app combines with Siri, which has the function of "talking" to the third-party apps in iOS 10. Being asked by Luo to call a taxi to the airport, Siri smartly understood this order and asked Luo about which airport he would like to go to, before a conformation card popped up. Cook told developers that iOS 10, the largest update of the iOS software that attracted five million customer registrations over a short time, has many new functions, including many that were developed for the Chinese market. He said Siri was studying Chinese culture, including Chinese poems, which meant if he only remembers a few words of a poem, Siri can help identify the poem's author and the full text. As Siri has been opened up to developers, it can assist users in using the car-calling voice services of third-party apps, Cook said. He also emphasized the update of iMessage, which features a new keyboard function supporting a mixed input of Chinese and English that does not need to switch. Insisting that iOS's user experience was much better than Android's, Cook said Apple was unique in terms of consumer satisfaction, whether it's just in China or across the world. He spoke about the low penetration rate of smartphones in India and the room for development in many other countries, stating that the smartphone market had not yet been saturated. When addressing Apple's sales slumps in China, Cook tried to make clear that while Apple's sales in channel decreased, its sales to consumers actually rose. And he says the depreciation of the yuan is also affecting its amount of revenue priced in US dollars. Cook explained that the smartphone's cycle had a peak and low tide, saying Apple was focusing on the long term and did not care about some changes within a short period of time. He said the company was investing in years of technology rather than the current market or a present quarter. In addition, Cook expressed that he wanted to meet more Chinese developers and entrepreneurs, who, in his view, were like sowing a seed for the future - significant for China's development.

It’s said that this year’s iPhone won’t bring a fresh new design which if true is kind of lame-sauce, and if these models are anything like the real deal, I think it’s time to be a bit disappointed in Apple’s design choices… As you can tell, there’s not much changing here. Of course these are simple mock ups of what the rumors have led us to believe, but at this stage these types of dummies are usually pretty on point with what the actual phone ends up looking like. From a design perspective, there are two major changes happening here. First off, with the iPhone 7 design, we still have quite the camera bump on the back, and hopefully an improved camera to go along with it, but side-by-side the iPhone 6s, you can see that it’s been smoothed out a bit. There’s no hard edged circle here, but instead a gradual slope leading up to the camera lens. With the iPhone 7 Plus mock up it’s a completely different story though. Rumor has it that Apple will be implementing two rear cameras this time around. The actual functionality of said rumored cameras are unknown at this point, but it changes up the design quite a bit when compared to the iPhone 6s Plus. I’d like to hope that the design won’t be this hideous though… because it’s not pretty. Check out our iPhone 7 / 7 Plus rumored design video below: The second major change with these mockups is the fact that neither of them feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. This is a rumor that’s been around for quite some time and one that will surely make a lot of people upset with Apple. According to these mockups, it sadly doesn’t seem to affect the devices thickness, which either means absolutely nothing or more room for more battery. Sure, there are Lightning connector headphones available, but it’s a rough move when you remove a gold standard for audio from a smartphone. Unfortunately, I’m sure Apple will sell you an adapter for that though. So with no headphone jack, redesigned camera layouts, and a similar aesthetic as the current generation iPhone, how much of an upgrade will this be? I’m sure Apple will have some wow-factors with this launch, but to me the rumored design seems more like an S variant rather than what we’re used to seeing two years into a design. The question is, will Apple really launch essentially what is an iPhone 6s…S? I mean let’s be honest here, this design is kind of boring after seeing it for the last two iPhone generations. I think a lot of what this iPhone has to offer will be in the form of software-specific features with iOS 10, but who knows at this point. Maybe 2016 isn’t an iPhone year and perhaps we’ll see something entirely different come 2017, but will that be enough to keep Apple on top? What do you think about this rumored design? Are there any features you’d like to see with the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus?

Located on two levels of the World Trade Center Transportation hub — inside the “Oculus” shopping area — the store sits across from the fashion brand COS and near a John Varvatos and Boss Hugo Boss. This is Apple’s seventh Manhattan location, its tenth across the boroughs of New York and 485th globally. For its latest location, Apple didn’t go too far in trying to fit in with its futuristic Oculus surroundings, but it did mimic the flow of the surrounding architecture. The company, for example, designed its interior beams and display tables to line up with the transportation hub’s curved beams. The ceiling on the second level of the store is also curved to extend the shape of Oculus’ wing design. The interior of the shop looks about the same as most other Apple locations, but also features a huge video wall complete with a sitting area called the “Forum”, where people can tinker around with their new products and learn how to use them. There’s also a wall called the “Avenue,” a play on the concept of walking along a city block and window shopping. Each “window” in the Avenue section, which changes each season, displays products people can test out for themselves. The last time Apple launched a store in Manhattan was June 2015 on the Upper East Side. For that location, the company restored a 1920s-era bank, complete with the same Italian marble flooring as the original. Earlier this year, Apple opened its first Brooklyn location in Williamsburg. Westfield, the developer of the Oculus shopping center, celebrated dozens of other store openings on Tuesday, which marked the official grand opening of its newest retail center. The $3.9 billion structure was designed to look like a flying dove by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. The World Trade Center Transportation hub connects dozens of different subway lines, including the PATH system, which runs between New York City and New Jersey. Hundreds of thousands of commuters and visitors pass through the center every day, according to Westfield.

This news led to a surge in Twitter stocks, giving hope to investors that such a deal can help Twitter come out of the sluggish user growth and falling revenues. SEE ALSO: Here Comes An Earpiece That Can Translate Conversations in Multiple Languages Instantly The availability of Twitter app on Apple TV will help reach more people as they love watching live sports on TVs and not on a mobile app or desktop, The Verge reported on Tuesday. "Such a partnership might also complement Apple's plans for the TV business," the report added. Apple TV has more than 10 million customers in the US. In April, Twitter secured the rights to live stream NFL games. It is known that Twitter will make money from advertising when it streams 10 NFL games later this year. Twitter also live streamed the Wimbledon coverage and is also in talks with the NBA, Major League Soccer (MLS) and Turner for more streaming rights.

By Lucy Schouten August 16, 2016 Save for later Saved An Xiaomi phone is held aloft by vice president of global operations Hugo Barra after a presentation in San Francisco, Thursday, Feb. 12, 2015. Jeff Chiu/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of The Chinese company Xiaomi is quickly losing its once-undisputed prowess in China's highly competitive smartphone market.  A successful launch, charismatic style, and passionate fan base gave the smartphone maker a reputation as "the Apple of China," but competitors have now taken several bites from the company's market share. Although its hardware is not available in the United States, the meteoric rise and fall of Xiaomi illustrates the swiftly changing tech potential in China, a competitive market where Apple itself is struggling to keep up.  Recommended: 40 iPhone tips and tricks everyone should know Xiaomi was the world's most valuable tech startup in 2014, valued at $1.1 billion after just four years. The company marketed its app and additional services by selling high-quality smartphones at "rock-bottom prices," The Wall Street Journal reported. 40 iPhone tips and tricks everyone should know Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/22 Analysts saw Xiaomi as China's decisive answer to Apple , which had stumbled upon entry to the Asian country, and the company aimed to sell 100 million phones in 2015, Rob Price reported for Business Insider. But Xiaomi's lack of marketing – the company disdained paid advertising in favor of word-of-mouth sharing, an energetically loyal fan base, and news-making speeches by the top executive – cut into the now-saturated market when Chinese competitors Oppo and Vivo made an aggressive entry, Bloomberg reported. The company shipped 10.5 million phones during its second quarter this year, compared to 17.1 million in 2015, Bloomberg reported, falling 38 percent. “The success of Huawei , OPPO, and vivo in the market can be attributed to their concerted effort to build their brand and aggressive marketing to attract the consumers, along with the focus on product differentiation,” Xiaohan Tay, senior market analyst for the research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) said in a press release announcing the sales fall. The rapid changes in the top three of such a large market suggests smartphone makers must work harder to differentiate and stay ahead in China.  "The Chinese market, the world’s biggest, has grown increasingly competitive as domestic manufacturers have improved their quality, design and marketing, putting pressure on global leaders Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Apple saw shipments in China drop 32 percent in the second quarter and the iPhone maker fell to fifth in the market, according to IDC," Peter Elstrom wrote for Bloomberg.  Chinese state media reported Tuesday that Apple plans to open an “independent” research and development center in China, according to The Wall Street Journal. Although the company has provided no details as yet, it could be a response to Apple's difficulty with both China's market and its regulations, as the company lost two lawsuits, including a trademark infringement case. Some of its services were shut down after the company refused to share its source code with Chinese authorities.  The US company may have additional challenges, but Apple and Xiaomi are competitors up against a similar, challenging market.  “The iPhones lack features such as waterproofing and wireless charging. Apple needs to catch up with the competition if it wants to compete,” Canalys research analyst Jessie Ding wrote, according to Bloomberg.  Next up 40 iPhone tips and tricks everyone should know What Tim Cook says about Apple's future Saving Money How to sell your old phone Print/Reprints About these ads Sponsored Content by LockerDome About these ads Monitor's Best: Top 5 Why Hillary Clinton lost the white women's vote For jihadists, Trump election brings a change in strategy As US pulls back from Pacific trade deal, countries look to China As Trump's AG, how might Sessions crack down on recreational marijuana?

When Apple Music gets a redesign this fall as part of the wider iOS 10 rollout, users will have the option to view song lyrics while they listen. That seemingly Herculean task is going to take a team of lyrics curators and a detail-obsessed manager to oversee them. Enter: You. As spotted by MBW, Apple has just posted a new job listing for a "Lyrics Curation Manager" out of its Santa Clara Valley office. Aside from needing to be a "flexible individual" with "strong analytical skills" and a proficiency in Excel, the qualifications note that experience with lyrics would be a major plus. Apple was looking for lyrics curators in June. "We’re looking for a manager to lead a team of lyrics curators with excellent writing skills, music knowledge, and attention to detail," the job post says. "Passion for technology and a will to question the current workflows with the mindset to improve tools and processes. General understanding, love, and ideally, experience in writing lyrics." Launched a year ago, Apple Music is said to be working on a new interface that will replace the current colorful look of its text and backgrounds with simple black and white, as well as bigger album art. "The simple, intuitive design makes it even easier to enjoy your favorite songs," the company touts on a preview page for iOS 10. "You can also view the lyrics while you’re listening to them." Apple Music’s chief rival, Spotify, recently removed its lyrics function from across all platforms when its partnership with Musixmatch soured. Whether the new job posting means Apple is going it alone in regards to collecting, transcribing and/or licensing lyrics -- or if there will be a mixture of in-house/third-party for different elements -- remains to be seen. A spokesperson for Apple confirmed a team was working on bringing lyrics to the service but declined to expand further on the project.

During the second quarter, Berkshire left its IBM stake unchanged.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Well, now, there’s a nice little vote of confidence.

JWSC Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 5:33 pm · Reply Buffett has said many times that he doesn’t understand technology companies and that he won’t invest in anything he doesn’t understand. This leads me to ponder what he knows now that he did not know before. Certainly, anyone who looked and AAPL fundamentals could see that the stock was grossly undervalued. But I don’t think that would have been enough to convince Buffett to buy shares. I’m thinking that his connections on The Street indicated to him that sentiment was about to shift and that many institutions were about to increase their AAPL portfolio. Welcome to the party, Warren Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 6:35 pm · Reply Warren Buffett may not understand technology, but he certainly knows a “moat” when he sees one ! Also, perhaps now he has “younger” workers — say, in their 60s, for example — on staff who _do_ get technology and reassure him it is a good long-term investment. Plus, he has probably figured out that you do not need to be a technologist, or tech genius, to make good returns on Apple. I would be surprised if Apple’s stellar returns over the past decade did not make him regret not buying in earlier. Anyone who bought Apple shares around 2003, for example, saw that investment outstrip even the returns of Berkshire Hathaway over the same period. Welcome to the party, Warren. It is about time.

New details have emerged that could possibly hint at when the device will ship to consumers. Since the iPhone 5, Apple has been sticking to September for its iPhone events. Evleaks first noted that the new iPhones will be hitting stores on September 16, following a September 9 pre-order date. From there, we’ve speculated that Apple will hold its event on September 7, two days after Labor Day. Today, an AT&T retail schedule has leaked, detailing upcoming merchandising reset hours. Specifically, the dates are September 9 and September 23. If this has any relation to the iPhone, it could mean that pre-orders will be available on September 9, following a ship date on September 23. This would follow the iPhone 6s release schedule, with roughly two weeks between pre-orders and ship dates. Take this with a grain of salt, however, as AT&T regularly has merchandising resets and Apple has yet to announce its September event. Though, some store managers were told that ‘certain major phone’ will be released on AT&T on September 23.

However, it’s unlikely that Apple will stray from tradition and not launch new iPhones in the month of September. It’s unclear at this point in time what the iPhone 7 release date is going to be but a new report suggests that it could be September 23rd. Multiple rumors and reports have already pegged the iPhone 7 release date on different dates in September and since Apple hasn’t confirmed it we can’t be too sure until we hear it from the proverbial horse’s mouth. A previous report suggested that the iPhone 7 would be unveiled on September 7th and that pre-orders would open September 9th. The release date was said to be September 16th. A purported retail schedule from AT&T has been leaked online, it calls for merchandising resets on September 9th and September 23rd, that’s basically when advertising material is put in place to inform customers that a new product is available now. The schedule doesn’t specially mention the new iPhone but it does lineup nicely with the timeframe. Apple has previously released the iPhone between the second and third week of September so it would not be surprising if pre-orders open on September 9th and the handset is released by carriers on September 23rd. Apple is yet to send out invites for its iPhone 7 event, expect that to happen by the end of this month. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about iphone 7.

Apple plans to build a new R&D center in China Posted Aug 16, 2016 by Romain Dillet (@romaindillet) 0 SHARES Next Story Microsoft signals broader gaming push with Xbox Wireless for partners Apple CEO Tim Cook is currently visiting China. According to Reuters, he used this opportunity to announce that the company would build a new research & development center in China before the end of the year. Other than that, we don’t know much. It’s unclear what engineers in China will work on, but it’s safe to say that they might be better positioned to work on Chinese standards, such as weird wireless technology standards. The team would be well-located to work on hardware projects as well. This news comes a couple of months after a Beijing court had some issues with the iPhone 6’s design, saying that it looks too similar to other Chinese phones. At the same time, sales have been slowing down dramatically in China. While China is still a major market for Apple, slowing economic growth combined with increased competition with Chinese OEMs are warning signs for Apple. Following today’s announcement of a new R&D center, Apple will have a foot on the ground in China and will also tap into new talent. Many great electronics engineers are now based in Shenzhen. This isn’t the first R&D center outside of the U.S. for Apple. The company also has teams in France, Israel, the U.K., Japan and Sweden. Apple hasn’t talked about the size of this new R&D center. It could end up being a small team given Apple’s size, but a sign of goodwill for the Chinese government. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Wed, Aug 17, 2016 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Berkshire built Apple stake as stock fell BUY LOW:With Apple’s stock dipping in the second quarter due to slower iPhone sales, Warren Buffett’s company boosted its stake by 55% to 15.2 million shares Bloomberg Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc increased its investment in Apple Inc in the second quarter, taking advantage of a dip in the iPhone maker’s stock to build the holding. Berkshire boosted its stake in Apple by 55 percent to 15.2 million shares, according to a regulatory filing on Monday from the billionaire’s Omaha, Nebraska-based firm. The investment was valued at US$1.46 billion as of June 30. “Apple’s stock came down substantially in the second quarter,” David Kass, a professor at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business who has taken students to meet Buffett, said in a telephone interview. “Value investors always like the price to go down, because it gives them an opportunity to buy more.” Apple shares fell shortly after Berkshire took its initial stake, sliding 12 percent in the second quarter. Sales of iPhones have fallen this year as customers upgrade their handsets at a slower pace. That, paired with mounting competition in China, means that the company’s revenue is expected to decline this fiscal year for the first time since 2001. Yet with Apple gearing up to introduce a new iPhone this year, the trough of its product cycle might also have presented an opportunity for investors to boost their stakes. The share price averaged less than US$100 during the quarter and has rallied 13 percent since July 26, when chief executive officer Tim Cook forecast a sales decline for the fiscal fourth quarter that was less severe than many analysts had expected. Berkshire’s bet stands in contrast to those of other prominent investors. In April, billionaire Carl Icahn said he exited a position in the company because of concern about its relationship with China. David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management disclosed in May that it sold its Apple stake in the first quarter. Buffett has previously said that smaller investments, including the Apple stake, were initiated by his deputy money managers, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler. Even as Berkshire’s stock picks are closely watched by investors, they have become less important to its overall performance. Over the past two decades, the billionaire has focused more on acquisitions than stocks to generate growth. Berkshire also cut a number of its holdings in the quarter. Its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc — one of Buffett’s picks — fell from 55.2 million shares to 40.2 million. The retailer rallied 6.6 percent in the second quarter to US$73.02 per share. Buffett’s company also cut holdings of Deere & Co and Suncor Energy Inc in the three months ended June 30, according to Monday’s filing. “It’s a little bit of fine tuning,” Kass said. Buffett and his deputies “do not make many changes to their portfolio,” Kass said. This story has been viewed 1342 times. Comments will be moderated.

The Notebook 7 Spin, which was recently released, has a 15.6-inch 1080p screen, 16GB of RAM, a 128GB SSD, and a 1TB hard drive. It also runs Intel’s latest generation Core i7 processor. CNET gives the Notebook 7 Spin four stars. Samsung Notebook 7 Spin review: A big-screen hybrid laptop with some gaming chops https://t.co/c5xOMG4tai pic.twitter.com/Uad56JKXwq — CNET (@CNET) August 15, 2016 “It doesn’t have a lot of wow factor, but the 15-inch Samsung Notebook 7 Spin packs in decent premium features, including some you won’t find in other hybrids,” says critic Dan Ackerman, who notes that the laptop is good for gaming. The only thing Ackerman really doesn’t like what he calls a “bland” design, a mediocre touchpad, and the fact that the hyped-up HDR mode offers only a slight improvement. However, Gizmodo says the Notebook 7 Spin is a laptop Apple should have put out. “Samsung’s gone and done it guys. It’s made a perfectly wonderful laptop that retails for under a grand, is of exceptional quality, and is neither under-powered nor teeming with crappy finishes. This is the college-bound laptop everyone, including Apple, has failed to make for the last couple of years.” Is the Samsung Notebook 7 Spin really a MacBook Pro killer? [Photo via Daryl Deino] The review adds that even though the laptop is bigger than Gizmodo prefers, it’s a lot more satisfying and easy to use than similarly priced laptops like the Dell Latitude 5000 series or HP Envy 15. Apple fans in the comments section are angry. “This is not a MacBook killer. This will have paltry sales. It is just another laptop in a sea of Windows laptops that try to cram everything into a laptop and throwing the proverbial kitchen sink at it, hoping something sticks, without really knowing what laptop users want,” says Zanky. “Until another laptop natively runs mac OS, NOTHING will ever be a ‘MacBook Killer,'” claims Keith S. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LG_hX0lc-0U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Perhaps one thing that may turn people off of the Notebook 7 Spin is the fact that it only has a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution screen. On a 15.6-inch laptop, that simply may not be enough, with images and text looking slightly pixelated. Most laptops these days, even ones that only have 13-inch screens, have Quad HD screens. Some even have 4K screens, but a screen with such a high pixel density does eat up battery life faster. It’s quite clear that Samsung is aiming the Notebook 7 Spin at would-be MacBook Pro buyers, who have been very impatient. However, it looks like Apple will try and one-up Samsung again with a completely redesigned MacBook Pro. 9 to 5 Mac has the news. “A new report says that the new range of MacBook Pro models will have a smaller footprint than existing models, and will be thinner but not adopt the wedge shape of the MacBook Air and 12-inch MacBook. The trackpad is also slightly wider than current models. All of the info lines up with previous reports and a set of leaked shells from earlier this year.” It is believed that the MacBook Pro will be released in the usual 13.3 and 15.6-inch versions, but may add a smaller option as well. The MacBook Pro has not received a major upgrade since 2012, so there are a lot of excited consumers out there who are skipping Windows laptops and waiting or Apple to deliver the MacBook Pro — which could be in either October or November. Do you think Samsung can challenge Apple with their Notebook 7 Spin, or will Apple always be the leader in the laptop world? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section.

(Photo: Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images) Ken Burns has always rubbed me the wrong way. But after listening to his 2016 Stanford University Commencement speech; a pious, faux Jesus, offering a Sermon on the Mount takedown of that fallen angel who threatens to defile the House of Lincoln, I began to muse: Is Ken channeling a higher power? “Make Babies…” he exhorted the students at the close of his speech (not well reported); tapping into the Genesis-inspired command to “be fruitful and multiply” Huh? I thought; perhaps a bit politically incorrect to be giving newly-minted graduates a fertility pep talk, but it does fit in well with Ken Burns’ narrative ,which relies heavily on biblical allusions. Ken Burns, like the Blues Brothers before him, is on a mission from God. He’s the “Archangel” in a pantheon that includes a posse of “Better Angels” and If you don’t believe it check out The Better Angels Society, a 501 (c)3 non-profit devoted exclusively to raising money for Ken Burns and his vision for a Better America; after all, according to a quote on the site by the late historian Stephen Burns, “More Americans get their history from Ken Burns than any other source.” I’d summarize the Ken Burns effect this way: A strong desire to believe that you should like – even love – his films, even though you’d rather be doing something else. There’s a group photo of Ken and his Angels on the website; lily-white, mostly male assortment of foundation execs, financial consultants and private equity types. Smack in the middle is a dressed-down (to the max) unimposing Ken Burns sporting his signature mop-top doo (one that’s caused speculation whether the inspiration was Prince Valiant, Moe Howard, Captain Kangaroo, or, now, Boris Johnson). Burns has an image problem; physically speaking. He says weighty things – good things that sound good – but despite the whiskers he’s lately taken to sprouting, he still looks like Boy Scout frozen in time; albeit sounding like a version of Leave it To Beaver’s insincere sycophant, Eddie Haskell. If Jon Heder were to do a Napoleon Dynamite sequel, I could see a role for Ken. “Pride Goeth Before a Fall,” according to Proverbs, so best to keep Ken from appearing too flashy, too immodest; just nurture the public perception that Ken – a wise old soul — has brought forth a documentary genre that uplifts the American soul and encourages viewers to be “curious, not cool” (a further bit of wisdom he offered at the end of his Stanford speech). I’m not sure how curious these Stanford grads wanted to be; they applauded politely but I wonder whether they’d sacrifice Game of Thrones for a binge-watch of twelve hours of National Parks. I’d summarize the Ken Burns effect this way: A strong desire to believe that you should like – even love – his films, even though you’d rather be doing something else. The bio on Ken’s twitter page proclaims his holiness as one of the “most influential documentary makers of all time” – along with Robert Flaherty – and references a Baltimore Sun reviewer: “Burns is not only the greatest documentarian of the day, but also the most influential filmmaker period.” Knowing something about the history of the documentary I’ll buy Robert Flaherty (Nanook of the North) but when it comes to contributing to the art of the genre I’d say Ken plays in the minor leagues compared to contemporary filmmakers like Alex Gibney or Errol Morris and with a nod to the past, pales before the contributions of innovators like the Russian Dziga Vertov, the Scotsman John Grierson and Americans Robert Drew and the brothers Maysles. Stringing together hours and hours of talking heads, stitched together with a maudlin banjo track and monotonish narration does not make a documentary great. Even in the realm of length-driven documentaries it’s hard to see Ken competing in the same stadium as Frenchman, Marcel Ophuls, still one of the world’s greatest masters of the genre at 88. Frankly, I’ve done my due diligence and stayed with a Burns episode for a few minutes before getting too squirmy at which point I remote it over to Bravo or HGTV for a more entertaining, less taxing experience (I find Flipping Out’s Jeff Lewis the perfect antidote to an overdose of Ken Burns). Even the so-called “Ken Burns effect,” known to all who use Apple video software as the gimmick that allows you to zoom in on the High School bully in the class photo or the college girl in the prom snapshot you once had the hots for, seems to have roots in a digitally based Burns mythology. The Ken Burns effect (Photo: Wikipedia) According to legend, it was Steve Jobs himself — impressed by the use of historical stills in The Civil War –who approached Burns with an offer to license his name. But true to his non-profit inclinations the documentarian couldn’t be seen taking filthy lucre for purely mercenary commercial reasons, so the deal was done on the basis of a donation of Apple computer gear to Burns’ non-profit film company. Not to rain on Ken’s parade but before Ken Burns, we called this “benching stills.” That was pre-digital; a filmmaking world that was all industrial age gears, sprockets, belts and 16mm reversal celluloid. Under the tutelage of Marty Scorsese, circa 1970 NYU Film School, all us students learned to tack up photos on an easel, get a heavy fluid head tripod (for stability) become one with the camera and try to execute these same moves, smoothly, by hand. I reached out to Mr. Burns for comment but he declined. Meanwhile, his representative endeavored to kill this piece by suggesting that the Observer had commissioned it as revenge for Mr. Burns’ remarks condemning Donald Trump. In fact, my opinion of Burns took shape years before Donald Trump began running for president; I first discussed this piece with his representative on March 27, 2013. While Ken didn’t invent the Ken Burns effect, he’s more than happy to accept the credit. As a documentarian with forty five years in, I’ve witnessed the Ken Burns’ effect close-up at work in places like PBS; which clears the decks whenever there’s a new series bearing his name, usual time-constraints be damned. He’s afforded unbridled access to the airwaves in what’s called “common carriage,” where all public TV stations, across different time zones, all broadcast his epics, same day, same time. So powerful is the Ken Burns effect that when asking for attributable comments from colleagues, all but one demurred. These are folks who normally roll their eyes whenever the Burns name is mentioned but the reaction to going public is something akin to the mob’s “Omerta” admonition: keep your mouth shut or else. Or else? Go public with a bad-mouth Burns campaign and you might find your next proposal for documentary funding at a place like the National Endowment for the Humanities dead on arrival. The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) established by Lyndon Johnson was designed to promote scholarship and research in a form palatable to a citizenry often labeled by critics like HL Mencken as “Boobus Americanus.” As it rolled out its media program in the 1970s, it became the go-to source for documentary funding and by the time Ronald Reagan became president some of the films funded had caused a political hiccup or two. For NEH operatives it became imperative to find a filmmaker they could believe in; one who could weather the political storms no matter who was doing the blowing. In Ken Burns, they found their man. According to an NEH spokesperson the institution has given Ken fifteen separate grants totaling more than $9.1 million since 1979. When asked if Ken has ever been turned down for a grant, the spokesperson cited confidentiality as the reason she couldn’t provide an answer. Nowhere was the NEH’s deification of Ken Burns more in evidence than last May, when he was invited by the institution to deliver the annual Jefferson Lecture, the NEH’s “highest” honor, given for intellectual achievement (which also carries with it a cool ten grand honorarium). It was all pomp and circumstance at the Kennedy Center: a military color guard trooped in, backstopped by a huge American flag waving on a rear screen. Current NEH Chairman William Adams provided an introduction so fawning that if Burns’ own inspiration, Honest Abe, were to suddenly appear, he’d think it was his own. Filmmaker Ken Burns speaks onstage during the press conference for ‘Jackie Robinson’, a film by Ken Burns. (Photo: Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images) The speechifying was typical Burns; an earnestness that never quite rises to the level of fiery oratory, but it doesn’t have to. With head cocked slightly upward, as if channeling the departed energies of those Better Angels, the effect is to infuse an audience with the notion that just listening to him speak – or watching his films – will make them Better Americans. And just to be sure you know how important a personage he is, he’ll pepper his speeches with references to all those important folks he knows personally (“when I asked poet and novelist Robert Penn Warren…”) During the Adams introduction a document suddenly appeared on the screen. It was Ken’s first NEH application, circa 1979. It was all very Dead Sea Scrolls like, which I presume was the intended effect. 1979 was also the same year we got our first NEH grant (by “we” I mean myself and Pacific Street Films co-founder, Steven Fischler) The funding was for a documentary, Anarchism in America; an exploration of different anti-authoritarian strands – on the left and on the right – that have intertwined themselves throughout the fabric of this country’s history. We took to the road documenting the last immigrant anarchists – Jewish, Spanish, Italian — who were colleagues of Emma Goldman, but our cameras also traveled to West Virginia to interview libertarian icon, Karl Hess (famously, Barry Goldwater’s speechwriter turned radical) and his startling appearance, together with left anarcho-syndicalist anarchist, Murray Bookchin, at the 1979 Libertarian Party conference; both discussing the ways in which far left and far right ideologies converge (Ed Clark and David Koch, ran on the ticket that year). The 19th century individualist philosophy of newspaper editor Benjamin Tucker (“anarchists are simply unterrified Jeffersonian Democrats”) and influential labor reformer, Lysander Spooner, both of whom couched their libertarianism as a return to lost American values, were also important threads that ran through the finished film. All this perceived radicalism gave a grave case of agita to incoming NEH chairman, Bill Bennett (appointed by Ronald Reagan), who had staff ask us to remove the institution’s name (we refused). Subsequently, a pilot program for a series on the law, titled The Law and Sexual Freedom — probably, the first to deal with Gay Rights — was put to bed by Bennett’s successor and future SLOTUS, Lynne Cheney. The opening scene, filmed in 1981, probably sealed our fate. An NYPD Sergeant, Charles Cochrane, in uniform, introduces himself to camera as just having exited the closet and “proud to be gay.” Cochrane, who founded the NYPD’s Gay Officers Action League, succumbed to cancer in 2008, but today is considered a hero (he’s had a street named after him). Ken Burns has staked out Public Television as his turf and PBS offers no resistance. His don’t-rock-the-boat films are great for promoting those insufferable tin-cup rattling pledge drives. Despite having been academically credentialed with Guggenheim Fellowships (at the time, 1978, the youngest filmmakers to be so honored) we were never again offered any sort of full production funding despite the submission of numerous encyclopedic applications with the requisite equally credentialed academic advisors. (NEH makes you pursue a paper chase second only to Harvard Law School). Ken Burns has staked out Public Television as his turf and PBS offers no resistance. His don’t-rock-the-boat films are great for promoting those insufferable tin-cup rattling pledge drives. His vision is also in synch with PBS’s corporate friendly image, one that caused a kerfuffle back in 2011 when it offered Goldman Sachs an opportunity to buy 15-30 second “sponsorship message” on strands like Frontline and Masterpiece, causing viewers to complain when “Upstairs, Downstairs” was interrupted with an advertisement for Goldman . Filmmaker Ken Burns speaks onstage during a panel discussion at the PBS portion of the 2014 Winter Television Critics Association tour at Langham Hotel on January 20, 2014 in Pasadena, California. (Photo: Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images) Ken’s Better Angels have, thus far, avoided any major criticism surrounding their corporate “partners,” which include US Trust (Bank of America’s personal wealth management division). Regulatory challenged/ sub-prime ravaged Bank of America eagerly tied its star to Ken Burns’ The Roosevelts and established a web page singing the praises of Ken and company. Unfortunately what’s left for us old-time doc-makers still trying to eke out an opinion or two via public television are crumbs and even those are difficult to find. If you can persuade one of the few PBS strands like POV or Independent Lens to agree to take on your left or right of center documentary film then, unlike Ken, you may find it programmed in a time slot catering to serious insomniacs (individual stations, not PBS, make broadcast decisions for these series). Gordon Quinn – fifty years in the business; founder & artistic director of Kartemquin Films, and brave enough to buck the Burns machine — put it best: “I think the point is about diversity. By putting so much money into Burns and favoring him on broadcast they are giving less support and attention to the diversity of voices that are part of America and should be supported by NEH and featured on PBS. In an era when the mainstream media is focusing on targeted demographics and political viewpoints PBS should be the alternative.” Much of the diversity that Quinn alludes to is missing from Ken Burns’ epics. Google Ken Burns/Documentaries/Problems and a host of shortcomings emerge, including the omission of Latin Jazz from nineteen hours of Jazz. There were serious questions raised by Native American and Latino advocacy groups that Ken had skipped over the role that their veterans played in seven episodes of The War. It got so bad that members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus brought up the omission with PBS, which backed Burns, causing Senator Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) to remark that “the way PBS has handled this since the issue was raised has left a lot to be desired.” Another historian, Martin Blatt, who worked at the National Service hosted a roundtable of colleagues to analyze problems with National Parks: American’s Best Idea and among many conclusions were observations that Native Americans might not have shared the sentiment in the title, given they were evicted from their tribal lands to make way for this bestest of ideas. Not much about this in twelve hours of running time. Such is the Ken Burns effect that even when a historian dares challenge the veracity of Burns’ scholarship they feel it necessary to couch criticisms in an apologetic cloak of lavish praise for his general body of work. Reviewing the Roosevelts, for instance, historian Harvey Kaye, an expert on FDR, does a bit of “I’m Not Worthy” bowing and scraping before launching into a serious critique. “Burns and Ward have not produced the history that we so need. They ignore ways in which working people and the labor movement shaped their ‘heroes’ thinking and propelled their action. They note TR’s presidential intervention in the 1902 coal strike, but fail to speak of labor’s role in the Socialist and Progressive parties’ prewar battles against Gilded Age capital (labor unionist and Socialist leader and presidential candidate Eugene Debs is never named).” But damn the torpedoes, full steam ahead for Ken’s Angels who continue to supplement NEH’s financial contributions with a full court funding press of their own. In 2014, per their IRS form 990, Better Angels hoovered in over $12 million and there’s quite a lot on his current plate, including: Country Music (perhaps fiddles/banjos playing a different tune); Hemingway (will Ken run with the bulls next Pamplona?) and, my personal favorite: Defying the Nazi’s: The Sharpes’ War, about a nice white couple dispatched to Europe at the start of the conflict to help save my kinfolk (A disclosure: both my parents were Auschwitz survivors. I was born in post-war Germany). These are all labeled “in production.” Co-director/executive producer Ken Burns speaks onstage during the ‘Defying the Nazis: The Sharps’ War’ panel July 28, 2016 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo: Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images) But there’s lots more Ken wants to do in the future and, according to the website, “funding opportunities are available” so consider investing in: Winston Churchill (hasn’t he been done to death?); The Cold War (hasn’t this been done to death?) and The Mormons (I know that this has been done to death, via a multi-part PBS series several years back). Is anything off-limits for Ken? Not really… There’s even a Stand-Up Comedy series in his future.

Within days of its release, tens of millions of people around the world were hooked and so far the hot new game is showing no signs of slowing down. Pokemon Go remains the top grossing app in Apple's iOS App Store, and it's also still in the top 5 in Apple's free downloads category. But after all this time, people still seem to be having a lot of trouble with one particular aspect of the game: Pokemon Go gym battles. In this post we'll discuss what a gym battle is as well why people have been having so much trouble with gym battles, and we'll also show you a video that details how you can win every single Pokemon gym battle with relative ease. MUST SEE: iPhone 8 concept shows the major design overhaul everyone wanted on the iPhone 7 So what exactly is a gym battle in Pokemon Go? As you likely know all too well at this point, the goal of Pokemon Go is to catch as many Pokemon as you can. The game uses augmented reality (AR) to merge the digital game with the physical world around you, making you travel around your area in order to capture the cute little creatures placed all around you. Some Pokemon are more difficult to capture than others, and your experience level helps determine how easy it is to catch Pokemon. People don't go it alone in the game. Instead, they're placed on teams and when a team occupies a gym, its members' Pokemon can train there. When you come across a gym occupied by another team, you can engage in a gym battle to gain experience points and to take over the gym for your team. Of course losing a gym battle will hurt your Pokemon, and you'll need to use up your supplies in order to heal it. So how can you make sure you win as many gym battles as possible? It turns out that there's a relatively easy way to win every battle you try. The method involves identifying a pattern in the game and using it to your advantage. It's important to note that when you battle a Pokemon at a gym, that Pokemon belongs to another player but he or she isn't actually controlling the Pokemon during the battle. Instead, the Pokemon is controlled by a computer that follows certain patterns with its attacks. Some Pokemon are more difficult to defeat than others, but they all follow the same pattern while they fight. Once you've identified it and practiced a little, you'll be able to win every single battle you engage in. In a nutshell, there's a tell that each Pokemon character has before it attacks. Once you spot the tell, it broadcasts a coming attack and if you dodge at the proper moment, you'll avoid the attack while leaving your enemy vulnerable to your retaliation. It takes a little bit of practice to get the hang of it but once you do, believe us when we tell you that it'll be a complete game-changer for you.

While Apple has unveiled and released new iPhones in September since the iPhone 5 in 2012, prominent leaker Evleaks first surfaced the rumor that new iPhone models would hit stores on September 16 following a pre-order period starting on September 9. From there we speculate that Apple’s September event will likely be held on September 7, two days after Labor Day and two days before pre-orders. A new detail to consider comes in the form of a leaked AT&T retail schedule (below) detailing upcoming merchandising reset hours. Specifically, the guidance calls out September 9 and September 23 as dates for merchandising resets. This could suggest that advertising for pre-orders could be planned for September 9 as expected and new iPhone models could hit the floor on September 23, a week later than previously expected. Put in historical context, both the September 16 and September 23 release dates are possible based on September 9 pre-orders. In 2014, the iPhone 6 launched on September 19 after a September 12 pre-order (7 days); and in 2015, the iPhone 6s launched on September 25 after a September 12 pre-order (13 days) so either a one week or two week period between pre-orders and launch is possible. Take both dates with a grain of salt, however, as Apple hasn’t yet officially announced its September event, and we’re told that AT&T regularly schedules these resets so it ultimately may not be indicative of anything iPhone-specific. We are told, however, that store managers were informed that a ‘certain major phone’ will be released to the carrier on September 23, though that might have been speculation because that high level information doesn’t usually get disseminated so early. It’s also worth considering that LG is releasing its V20 phone next month and perhaps one of these resets is meant for it and not the iPhone 7. The iPhone 7 is expected to largely resemble the current iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s designs, which suggests Apple may opt for a different name this year as the new model won’t be a major redesign. Instead, the rear antenna lines are expected to be simplified, the 5.5-inch model is likely to feature a dual camera system, and both models are expected to drop the headphone jack. A Force Touch Home button, a space black color option, and higher storage capacities will round out the new lineup. Catch up and stay tuned to our continuing iPhone 7 coverage on our iPhone 7 Guide.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Color me confused, folks. Maybe Apple will launch an iPhone 7 Pro, despite recent reports that have suggested it’s currently moving forward to a September launch of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. New images posted by @The_Malignant on Twitter allegedly depict a “WORKING” iPhone 7 Pro prototype in blue. Early rumors indicated Apple was originally planning to launch some sort of blue-hued iPhone 7, though the first images showed a much deeper blue than what you see above. My gut tells me these are fake, given the poor quality of the resolution, what appears to be a fake reflection on the Apple logo, and the terrible iPhone logo toward the bottom of the phone. But the phone also appears to be working, which makes things all the bit more confusing. Also, this phone looks just like the iPhone 7 Plus, a dummy for which we recently obtained in the office. I’ve included that device in a gallery below so you can dissect the two. #Apple #iPhone7Pro first look to a BLUE WORKING prototype (source PCOnline.cn) pic.twitter.com/Z7oQzr6l4s — The Malignant (@the_malignant) August 16, 2016 Who knows, right?

By Todd Haselton | August 16, 2016 Share Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple will announce the iPhone 7 on September 7, according to a recent report from Bloomberg, but it might not be greeted with the same frothing anticipation awarded to earlier iPhones. From the front lines of the gadget world, it’s evident that excitement around the iPhone 7 has dwindled compared to previous launches, with our readers seemingly more excited about the latest Android releases. I can see why. The annual iPhone launch has become a formality. Apple needs to launch a new phone only to avoid the backlash of an industry that would be mute in disbelief if it decided to spend more time — six months or a year — building what the market really wants and needs. It has to appease investors who would shout in dismay if Apple decided not to launch a new product, and fans of Apple products who might otherwise move to Android if they felt Apple wasn’t delivering the latest and greatest gear each September. It’s a strategy that has certainly worked for Apple in the past, but how long can Apple continue the charade? Most pundits close to Apple seem to agree that it will launch its big iPhone upgrade in 2017, not this September when it releases the iPhone 7, a device only expected to offer minor upgrades to the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus that preceded it. Historically, though, this is the year Apple is supposed to launch its major upgrade, not an iterative one. For whatever reason, it’s not doing moving forward with the former. Instead, this year’s iPhone seems to be a product meant entirely to appease the aforementioned investors and Apple fans who want to see something, anything, new from Apple, so long as it’s not sitting quiet. This message seems to have been filtered down to consumers. I haven’t heard much this year from friends or family, from time sitting in restaurants, about the “new iPhone.” Nobody is talking about what’s coming next from Apple. In previous years, specifically around the time of the iPhone 6 launch, the summer was a’buzz with folks talking about the next iPhone, when it would launch and what it would offer the coming fall. I wonder what this will mean for launch. Will consumers line the block for the iPhone as they have in previous years, or will this be one of the first when excitement around the new device runs out? Apple needs to make a big splash on September 7, otherwise I fear Apple’s iPhone will start to lose the momentum it has enjoyed for the better part of the last decade.

We've seen tons of photos and information leak from a wide range of sources over the course of August, and we even got to see a video that shows a working iPhone 7 in action for the first time ever. Excitement among Apple fans is reaching new heights despite the fact that many tech blogs are judging a book by its cover and running with the idea that this year's new iPhones are going to be boring. But as we've discussed, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are shaping up to be anything but boring. Speaking of excitement, rumor has it that Apple's upcoming iPhones will be made available in at least one brand new color — and a fresh set of leaked photos shows us exactly what Apple's new color might look like. MUST SEE: iPhone 8 concept shows the major design overhaul everyone wanted on the iPhone 7 If everything we've seen so far pans out — and we expect that it will — this year's new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will feature a design that is strikingly similar to last year's design. Apple's big iPhone overhaul isn't due until next year's tenth anniversary model, so Apple had to find other ways to make its new 2016 iPhone models appealing to fans. According to recent reports, there are a few different ways Apple plans to ensure shoppers are as excited for new iPhones after they launch as they have been ahead of the iPhone 7's release. Apart from the tweaked design and improved performance, reports suggest Apple is doubling the amount of storage on each model. This way, buyers can choose from 32GB, 128GB and 256GB; the 16GB iPhone has been a huge pain point for some time, so this move would be a huge deal for Apple. Apart from increased storage, Apple will also reportedly release its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in at least one new color. Some suggest it's going to be blue, and a high-quality hands-on video with a blue iPhone 7 mockup showed us how gorgeous a new blue iPhone might be. Other reports suggest the new color will be Space Black though, and the phone might look even better in this sleek new deep black color. A few new leaked photos of an iPhone 7 Plus model in deep black were posted on Tuesday by Twitter user The Malignant, and you'll find them all below. Want to see more?

This video spot shows the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 speaking with Cortana to Apple’s iPad Pro with its Siri. “I just got a keyboard,” says Siri on the iPad Pro to the Surface Pro 4, “I’m a computer now, just like you.” The viewer can see where this is going immediately. The iPad Pro is made fun of mercilessly. “Just because you call something a computer doesn’t mean it fits the description,” said Microsoft PR in a press announcement of this video spot. “Cortana knows that the Surface Pro 4, with its powerful Intel Core processor, detachable keyboard with real keys and a trackpad, pen, touchscreen, full Office and external ports fits the description. Everything else is just late to the party.” In our review of the Surface Pro 4, Chris Davies notes how the device isn’t actually a full replacement for a standard notebook computer – but does a good job of being a PC in a different way. “No, you’re not going to mistake the Type Cover for a true laptop keyboard – if that’s what you’re looking for then please, step this way, because Microsoft would love to introduce you to the Surface Book – but I’ve been surprised at just how good it is to type on now.” Microsoft – and its partners – have never been afraid of creating a large variety of different sorts of computers, in all shapes and sizes. The Surface Pro 4 just happens to be the one closest to what Apple’s presented in the iPad Pro.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube Microsoft has a habit of regularly taking swings at Apple products in its ads, and today it has released a new ad for the Surface Pro which puts it head-to-head against the iPad Pro. Apple recently released an ad which tried convincing people that the iPad Pro is nothing short of a full computer and some would say that Microsoft’s response puts the iPad Pro in its place. The ad shows both devices at a party for the iPad Pro. Cortana asks Siri what the party is for and she replies “I just got a keyboard, I’m a computer now, like you.” So begin the jokes at the iPad Pro’s expense. Cortana starts off by asking if the iPad Pro has more power provided by a processor like the Intel Core i7, and follows up by asking if the iPad Pro is running full Office and not just the app version. It even throws in a question about the trackpad and external ports for good measure, to which Siri just replies: “Maybe this party thing wasn’t a good idea.” Microsoft has cleverly highlighted all of the features that the Surface Pro 4 offers that the iPad Pro doesn’t, enabling the former to run full Windows and making it capable of providing a full PC experience that desktop users are already familiar with. Something tells me this argument about what can be considered a computer doesn’t end here. Your move, Apple. Filed in Computers. Read more about ipad pro, Microsoft and Surface Pro 4.

The decision reflects how important the Chinese market is for Apple, which has had trouble making inroads in the country—sales of iPhones in China have tanked and Apple has tangled with Chinese regulators.

Send 11.23.16 | an hour ago Samsung will debut glossy black Galaxy S7 Edge next month Samsung didn't fail to notice the popularity of Apple's new glossy black iPhone 7, so the Korean company will now release a shiny black version of its popular Galaxy S7 Edge phone, according to the Korea Herald. The new black S7 might give Samsung fans something to get excited about after months of talk about the exploding Galaxy Note 7 debacle. The company already has an Onyx Black S7 Edge, but that's a matte black color, while the new phone will be glossy. Samsung hopes to fire up sales to counter the popularity of the iPhone 7. And new colors do work for Samsung. From the Korea Herald's report: "The Coral Blue version, since its launch on Nov. 11, is selling almost 15,000 units every day on average, while the iPhone 7 has seen its daily unit sales fall to about 10,000 units in recent weeks."  MS samsung 11.23.16 | 2 hours ago Ben Carson indicates he will be named housing secretary  In a Facebook post, Carson teased the announcement of his appointment to President-elect Trump's cabinet.

Digg will now begin looking for a new CEO; managing editor Dan Fallon will head up the entire editorial team.  CW 11.23.16 | 4 hours ago Here’s the only way to figure out if the election was hacked Yesterday, New York Magazine's Gabriel Sherman wrote that results in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania may have been compromised, based on the findings of a group of computer scientists and election security experts.  One of those experts, J. Alex Halderman, penned a Medium post today to "set the record straight" and clarify what he and others have said to the Clinton campaign—that while there isn't clear proof of wrongdoing, it's worth pursuing a recount to put minds at ease and set a precedent for manually reviewing paper ballots in future elections.  From Halderman's post:  Were this year's deviations from pre-election polls the results of a cyberattack? Probably not. I believe the most likely explanation is that the polls were systematically wrong, rather than that the election was hacked. But I don't believe that either one of these seemingly unlikely explanations is overwhelmingly more likely than the other. The only way to know whether a cyberattack changed the result is to closely examine the available physical evidence — paper ballots and voting equipment in critical states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, nobody is ever going to examine that evidence unless candidates in those states act now, in the next several days, to petition for recounts . . .  Examining the physical evidence in these states — even if it finds nothing amiss — will help allay doubt and give voters justified confidence that the results are accurate. It will also set a precedent for routinely examining paper ballots, which will provide an important deterrent against cyberattacks on future elections.  PM 11.23.16 | 8:30 am Morning intel: Facebook courts China, Telegram begets Telegraph • Hillary Clinton's popular vote lead is now up to 2,017,563—1.5 percentage points—and a group of computer scientists and election lawyers believe results in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania may have been compromised and denied Clinton votes. • President-elect Trump is expected to name Nikki Haley ambassador to the United Nations and has reportedly already offered Ben Carson the role of housing secretary. Democrats Harold Ford Jr. and Michelle A. Rhee might be in the running for the transportation and education departments, respectively. • Facebook really, really wants in on China—so much so that it has reportedly created a censorship tool to suppress posts in certain geographic areas. Whether Facebook will actually make the tool public is unclear, but a number of employees working on the project quit "after expressing misgivings about it," according to the New York Times. • Speaking of cracking the Chinese market: Airbnb is in "advanced" talks to acquire Xiaozhu.com, a rival service in China, Bloomberg reports.  • Telegram, the encrypted messaging app that boasts more than 100 million users, just unveiled an anonymous blogging platform, appropriately dubbed Telegraph.  • In a blog post yesterday, Twitter reiterated that using its data products or public data for surveillance—that is, granting access to law enforcement or other parties for that purpose—is explicitly prohibited.  PM ben carson 11.23.16 | 7:34 am A trade body for major publishers sent Google and Facebook a letter urging them to tackle fake news The trade body Digital Content Next (DCN), which represents over 70 major publishers including the New York Times, the Washington Post, Viacom, Time Inc., Hearst, Gannett, Bloomberg, ESPN, the AP, BBC.com, and more, has sent Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai a pointed letter urging them to tackle the epidemic of fake news being shared across their sites, reports Business Insider. The glut of partisan fake news stories in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election has been seen by some as a factor in Trump winning the presidency. Here is the meat of Digital Content Next's CEO Jason Kint's letter: To be clear, our plea is not that you somehow attempt to evaluate bias or censor legitimate speech. Moreover, your recent statements about potentially identifying "fake news" for what it is, and depriving the providers of this noxious material the economic sustenance to create it in the first place, are encouraging and constructive. However, to paraphrase a recent New York Times editorial, we believe you owe your users, and democracy itself, far more. Your companies make it a point to celebrate "moonshots" that require extraordinary vision, resources and engineering prowess. Your capacity to pursue these projects is built on your extraordinary dominance over the digital media landscape. Wouldn't it make sense for you to pursue cleaning-up the garbage littering the digital media ecosystem with the same excitement, investment and vigilance with which you pursue these huge, visionary projects? We don't see that in your public statements or actions. Over the years, you have claimed repeatedly that you are not media companies; instead, the word "utility" has been used, occasionally by your own executives. But if even 1% of the water in our local utility was polluted, wouldn't it be right to move heaven and earth to clean it up? MG Facebook 11.23.16 | 7:17 am Facebook wants to get into China so badly it created a censorship tool The social media giant, in a move to get a foot in the door in the most populous country on the planet, created coding software tools that would allow for easy censorship of users' news feeds, says the New York Times: The social network has quietly developed software to suppress posts from appearing in people's news feeds in specific geographic areas, according to three current and former Facebook employees, who asked for anonymity because the tool is confidential. The feature was created to help Facebook get into China, a market where the social network has been blocked, these people said. Mr. Zuckerberg has supported and defended the effort, the people added. The Times adds that the tool may never be used and that it's just one of the ideas Facebook is throwing around to get into China. The report also notes that if the tool is eventually used in the country, Facebook itself probably wouldn't be suppressing posts; rather the tool would be given to a third party in charge of censorship. MG Facebook 11.23.16 | 6:17 am Secure messaging app Telegram debuts anonymous blogging platform Telegraph The makers behind the 100 million-user-strong Telegram secure messaging app have unveiled the new anonymous blogging platform named Telegraph, reports TechCrunch.  Telegraph shares many of the characteristics of Telegram with its minimalist interface and anonymity for users. The new platform supports markdown, in-line photos, and other embeds and allows anyone to write articles, then share them by simply sharing the URL with others. MG Telegraph 11.23.16 | 5:56 am Twitter suspends Jack Dorsey’s account by mistake The suspension of the account of the company's CEO happened overnight, reports the Guardian. Dorsey's account only came online again hours after users who tried to view his account started getting notifications that it had been suspended. When Dorsey's account did come back online, Dorsey tweeted that the suspension had be an "internal mistake."

In the next category of employee—mid-level execs and managers—27% are female, as was the case in 2015; 11.8% are underrepresented minorities or multiracial, up from about 11.2% last year. On its inclusion & diversity page, Apple noted that the EEOC data is "not how we measure our progress . . . We believe the information we report elsewhere on this site is a far more accurate reflection of our progress toward diversity."  PM 11.22.16 | 4:00 pm This jewelry brand had its highest sales day ever after raising its prices Vrai & Oro, a two-year-old L.A.-based jewelry brand, decided to adjust the prices of all its products last week when the price of gold went up. It has set all product prices at a consistent 60% margin. While 40% of the price covers the cost of raw materials, the rest goes toward overhead and profits. Against the angst-filled protestations of her team, founder Vanessa Stofenmacher chose to explain the new pricing model to customers through a blog post and email, rather than sneakily releasing a new collection with new prices. Her instincts proved correct, because customers had an overwhelmingly positive response, even it meant they were paying more. Many said they were used to feeling duped by marketing, so it was refreshing to get a honest look into a company's business decisions. The day after the brand made the announcement, it saw its biggest spike in sales ever, Stofenmacher says.  ES Advertise Privacy Policy Terms About Us Fast Company & Inc © Mansueto Ventures, LLC

It would immediately make a whole bunch of headphone and microphone products obsolete overnight for those who use iPhones. And while some have compared it to when Apple surprised everyone nearly two decades ago in removing the floppy drive from the iMac, this is quite different. The floppy drive really was pushing the end of its necessary existence, and with the internet and (not too long after) the rise of USB, the internal floppy drive seemed less and less important. But that's not the case with the standard audio jack. Back in June, Nilay Patel at the Verge had an excellent take on why this move would be user hostile in very dangerous ways, starting with the fact that forcing audio through the iPhone Lightning connection would mean DRM: Oh look, I won this argument in one shot. For years the entertainment industry has decried what they call the "analog loophole" of headphone jacks, and now we’re making their dreams come true by closing it. Restricting audio output to a purely digital connection means that music publishers and streaming companies can start to insist on digital copyright enforcement mechanisms. We moved our video systems to HDMI and got HDCP, remember? Copyright enforcement technology never stops piracy and always hurts the people who most rely on legal fair use, but you can bet the music industry is going to start cracking down on "unauthorized" playback and recording devices anyway. We deal with DRM when it comes to video because we generally don’t rewatch and take TV shows and movies with us, but you will rue the day Apple decided to make the iPhone another 1mm thinner the instant you get a "playback device not supported" message. Winter is coming. With the latest rumors insisting that Apple is definitely doing this, Cory Doctorow has also weighed in to make the same point and go in much greater detail about how troubling this is: Once all the audio coming out of an Iphone is digital -- once there's no analog output -- Apple gets a lot more options about how it can relate to its competitors, and they're all good for Apple and bad for Apple's customers. Just by wrapping that audio in DRM, Apple gets a veto over which of your devices can connect to your phone. They can arbitrarily withhold permission to headphone manufacturers, insist that mixers be designed with no analog outputs, or even demand that any company that makes an Apple-compatible device must not make that device compatible with Apple's competitors, so home theater components that receive Apple signals could be pressured to lock out Samsung's signals, or Amazon's. What's more, once Apple gets the ability to add DRM, the record industry gets the ability to insist that Apple use it ("A phaser on the mantelpiece in Act One must go off by Act 3" - Pavel Chekov, Star Trek: TOS). In 2007, Steve Jobs published his Thoughts on Music, in which he said, basically, that the record industry had forced Apple to put DRM in its ecosystem and he didn't like it. The record industry is still made up of the same companies, and they still love DRM. Right now, an insistence on DRM would simply invite the people who wanted to bypass it for legal reasons to use that 3.5mm headphone jack to get at it. Once that jack is gone, there's no legal way to get around the DRM. Perhaps worst of all is the impact on security research: because the DMCA has been used to attack researchers who disclosed defects in DRM-restricted technologies, they are often unable or unwilling to come forward when they discover serious vulnerabilities in technologies that we rely on. The Iphone audio interface is two-way: it supports both input and output. A bug in that interface turns the phone to carry with you at all times, to all places, into a covert listening device. A DRM system on that interface makes that bug all-but-unreportable, guaranteeing that it will last longer and hurt more people before it finally becomes public. As Cory notes, these are not hypothetical stories and fear-mongering, they're all examples from what we've seen happen before, over and over again, when things are pushed into a DRM-based world. Cory is hoping that if Apple really does drop the audio jack -- as many now expect -- then it should simultaneously declare that the digital audio output is not "an effective means of access control," which would then mean it's not covered by the anti-circumvention laws of the DMCA. But, of course, does anyone actually expect Apple to do that? It has almost no incentive to unless the public rejects this situation in massive numbers, which seems unlikely. Hopefully, those who make Android and other phones will not follow down this same path. Related articles Jay Z Raps Direct Attack On Spotify, Apple, YouTube: "niggers die for equal pay right?"

Apple has proferred its superior devices, like the iPhone. Google has fought back with its Android operating system and a series of mobile apps ,” Brian X. Chen reports for The New York Times. “On Tuesday, Google underscored that strategy with the release of its latest mobile app: Duo, a video-calling app that is a direct alternative to Apple’s FaceTime.” “People can only use FaceTime to call others who have Apple devices. But Duo lets you place video calls between Android and iPhone users, and sizably increases the universe of people with whom you can hold a video conversation,” Chen reports. “All of this feeds into Google’s strategy to attract iPhone users over to Android. Google’s apps generally work better on Android devices than on iPhones, so the more that people get hooked on Google’s core apps, the less incentive there is to stay loyal to Apple.” “Last month, Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, repeatedly highlighted that the rate at which people were switching from Android-based devices to iPhones was the highest the company had seen,” Chen reports. “‘Our year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we’ve seen in any nine-month period,’ Mr. Cook said in the call, without disclosing precise figures.” “For now, FaceTime is just as intuitive as Duo so I see no compelling reason to use Duo over FaceTime to call iPhone users,” Chen reports. “But if I had to video call an Android user, I would use Duo over other video-calling services like Skype or Facebook Messenger, which have more cluttered interfaces than Duo’s single-button approach.” Read more in the full article here.

My kid has an old cheap alcatel android phone, total POS but he is only 10 and loves the idea that he has a *cell phone* even though it only works on home wireless. This should make it easier to chat with him when i’m away. At the least he’ll get a kick out of it. Predrag Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 11:06 am · Reply I’m not sure how smart that is. I totally understand the reasoning behind spending minimum on a cheap phone for a 10-year old (and I don’t want to go into the debate regarding the appropriate minimum age for a smartphone), but for me, being a father of two girls, I have serious misgivings about giving an Android to a child. The device has no built-in parental controls, not to mention there is no way for me to ensure (s)he won’t side-load apps of very questionable origin, bringing in malware of all sorts. When my daughters reach the age I consider appropriate for a smartphone, they will get an iPhone (perhaps a used one, three model-years old, such as 5s today), which I can completely control. I can then disable app download without my explicit approval, restrict content ratings in Safari and elsewhere, and make their initial smartphone experience a bit more controlled one. Even without ANY parental controls and restrictions, iPhone is still a much safer choice, as it doesn’t allow side-loading of apps from problematic sources, which prevents inadvertent installation of malware. In my school, kids (5th grade through high school) all get MacBook Airs. In my friend’s school, they get Windows. Our kids are of similar age, and while mine has had her MBA for the past four years, she has yet to encounter malware, while my friend has battled all sorts of Windows viruses over the past three years, re-formatting that laptop twice already. Android isn’t much better in the hands of kids when it comes to malware. I would rather not take that chance, just to save $50 over a used 5S. silverwarloc Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 12:14 pm · Reply I started my two girls with iPhones when they came out.

Chas Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 11:02 am · Reply The answer is spherical, and in the plural. =:~) Predrag Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 11:14 am · Reply Nothing will ever be able to approach the simplicity of FaceTime, due to its deep and complete integration into the iOS. You don’t facetime people by opening FaceTime ap and looking up their names. You intuitively do that from your phone app. It is the natural thing to do: you want to call someone, you open up your phone; there, you have your speed-dial list, your last call list, and your contacts. From any one of these, you can find the person you want to call and instead of dialing their number the old-fashioned way (by tapping the phone icon), you simply tap on the FaceTime icon and the call is made. Even the ringtone (for the recipient) is the same as when getting a phone call. To use this ‘Duo’, you’d have to go into a different app, and that makes it no different from Skype, Viber, ooVoo, Tango, Peer, Google Hangouts… And all of those already have a long and well-established track record.

It’s going to look eerily similar to the iPhone 6 Plus and 6s Plus, but with a few minor design tweaks. It’ll also feature a new dual camera setup and upgraded specs but apart from that, it will for the most part be a faster iPhone 6s Plus. To be frank, the iPhone 6s Plus is a great smartphone but a pretty lousy phablet, and we likely shouldn’t expect much more from the new iPhone 7 Plus. When it comes to phablets, Samsung is still ahead of the pack. And with the brand new Galaxy Note 7, the company’s lead in the phablet market has only grown. UPDATE: The Galaxy Note 7 has been discontinued due to a serious safety risk. Learn more here. View the full Samsung Galaxy Note 7 gallery See all 12 photos I have covered this topic several times in the past, so I’ll elaborate briefly before we dive in. In a nutshell, Apple’s larger iPhone is just that: a larger iPhone. Apple put no effort whatsoever into developing new features that make use of the device’s larger size. Apart from optical image stabilization and a 1080p display, an iPhone 6s Plus is just a bigger iPhone 6s. Of course, people wanted iPhones with bigger screens and so in 2014, Apple finally made iPhones with bigger screens. Samsung took a different approach to the phablet market, which it helped establish back in 2011. It wasn’t the first company to sell an oversized smartphone with a large display, but there’s little doubt that Samsung almost singlehandedly popularized the category. What is perhaps most interesting about Samsung’s approach to phablets as it compares to Apple is that Samsung recognized right out of the gate that there was so much more that could be done with a larger canvas on a smartphone. Having all that extra space enables a wide range of new and useful features, and they can dramatically enhance the user experience. Samsung gets it, and the Galaxy Note 7 is the latest reminder that the world’s top smartphone vendor by shipment volume is also the best in the business when it comes to phablets. Before we get into what makes the Galaxy Note 7 a great phablet, we need to discuss what makes it a great smartphone. And that begins on the outside. Until last year, Samsung’s flagship smartphones were a regular source of disappointment for me and many others. A truly good high-end smartphone offers top-notch performance as well as a sleek design and premium materials. Samsung has always had the performance part nailed, but the company’s phone designs were uninspired and their plastic housings looked and felt cheap. In 2015, that changed. The Galaxy S6 marked a huge turning point for Samsung; the phone’s design and build were finally on par with its performance. Samsung used all glass and aluminum construction that felt fantastic in the hand, and the device had a sleek design to match. Subsequent flagship handsets like the Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge all featured similar designs, and now the Galaxy Note 7 takes things to a whole new level. As an aside, yes, Samsung skipped the “Galaxy Note 6” name and went directly to 7 in order to better align the Note series with its Galaxy S lineup. Like this year’s Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge, the new Galaxy Note 7 features a similar design to its predecessor but offers further refinements… and those refinements are deeply appreciated. At 153.5 x 73.9 x 7.9 mm, the new Note 7 is narrower, thinner and marginally shorter than the Galaxy Note 5 despite having the same size screen. That display — a new 5.7-inch Super AMOLED panel with quad HD resolution and a pixel density of 518 ppi — is absolutely stunning. Samsung’s smartphone screens have been best-in-class for years now. It’s gotten to the point where we take them for granted, which I suppose is a good thing. It speaks to Samsung’s consistency in this key area. Each time Samsung launches a new flagship phone we wonder how a screen could possibly get any better. Then, the next Samsung flagship comes along and proves that it is indeed possible. Plainly put, you won’t find a better display on any smartphone. Graphics and images are crisp and clear on the Note 7, blacks are deep, colors are vibrant and the contrast is outstanding. Once again, we’re left wondering how Samsung could possibly improve on this display. The one issue some may have with the new Galaxy Note 7’s screen is the fact that it is curved on either side. The curved edges are one of my favorite things about the phone, and plenty of people agree. While Samsung doesn’t report shipment figures for its smartphones, rumor has it that the Galaxy S7 edge has been a big seller for the company. Not everyone likes the curves on Samsung’s newer phones, however. That said, if you’re one of the people who has historically not been a fan of phones like the Galaxy S7 edge, give the Note 7 a chance before you dismiss it. The phone features front and rear Gorilla Glass 5 panels that curve much more sharply at their edges. The result is a phone that’s incredibly comfortable to hold despite its large size, but there is also less visual distortion on the edges of the screen when you look directly at it. That distortion has been a complaint that I hear often among users, so it’s nice to see Samsung address it. Corning’s Gorilla Glass 5 will also make the Note 7 far more likely to survive drops, which is a good thing considering how fragile Samsung’s glass phones have been compared to the competition. The phone will also survive spills and even dunks thanks to IP68 water- and dust-resistance. Beneath the Note 7’s gorgeous display is an oblong home button with an embedded fingerprint scanner. Above the screen is an unmissable Samsung logo, an ear speaker, a primary front-facing camera, and a secondary camera with a separate infrared blaster. Those last two components combine to make up the phone’s iris scanner, which is a first for widely available smartphones. In addition to fingerprints, PINs, patterns and passcodes, the Galaxy Note 7 offers iris scanning as a means of security. The setup is relatively simple and after the initial setup, you can use eye scans in place of other means of security to unlock your phone or gain access to the new Secure Folder. The Secure Folder, by the way, is an awesome new feature on the Note 7 that gives users a special folder with an extra layer of security in which they can store files, photos, videos and even instances of apps. That means you can have a main instance of Gmail for your personal email and then a second protected instance in your Secure Folder for your work email. To access those emails and any other files in the Secure Folder, you’ll need to authenticate again with a password, fingerprint scan or an iris scan. This way you can unlock your phone and let a friend or family member use it without having to worry about your private files being accessed. There is a caveat with the new eye scanning feature, though. While actual iris scans are impressively quick — at times, the eye scanner unlocked my Galaxy Note 7 review unit before the iris scanner screen even had time to display on the phone — unlocking the phone with an eye scan takes longer than other methods because the iris scanner is not enabled when you wake the phone. Instead, you have to wake the Note 7 and then swipe the screen to the right to activate the iris scanner. This was done to prevent iris scans from unlocking the phone when the user wakes it to view notifications on the lock screen. Also of note, the phone warns several times during the setup process that contact lenses and glasses can impact the iris scanner, but I haven’t had any problems with either type of lens. Moving past the face of the Galaxy Note 7, the right metal edge is home to a power button while the left edge holds volume up and down buttons. The top of the phone has a SIM and microSD card slot as well as a secondary microphone for noise cancellation, and the bottom edge has a headphone jack, a USB Type-C port, a primary mic, a speaker and the new and improved S Pen stylus. Around back you’ll find a second curved Gorilla Glass 5 panel that mirrors the front exactly, though it doesn’t have any oleophobic coating so it’s a magnet for grease and grime. Beneath the inevitable layer of filth you’ll find another shiny Samsung logo in case you missed the one around front, “Galaxy Note7” branding, a large camera lens with a separate LED flash and sensor cluster. The camera on the Galaxy Note 7 is of particular interest, not just because it’s the best smartphone camera in the world, but also because it’s the exact same camera as the one found on the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. Samsung has historically included an improved camera with each new flagship model. But with the Galaxy Note 7, Samsung chose to make no changes to the camera hardware found on the S7 and S7 edge. On one hand, why not use the same camera? Samsung’s 12-megapixel Dual Pixel camera takes the highest quality photos we’ve seen from a smartphone camera thus far, with stunning clarity, fantastic color reproduction and impressive low light performance. But on the other hand, Samsung’s rivals won’t stand still. The company’s lead in this all too important area could narrow or even be closed entirely when the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are released next month. Inside the sleek new smartphone, we find a quad-core Snapdragon 820 chipset running the show. The processor combines two 2.15GHz cores with two 1.60GHz cores to offer power when you need it and battery conservation when you don’t, which is certainly appreciated considering the huge 2K display that the Galaxy Note 7’s 3,500 mAh battery must power. Where performance is concerned, the Snapdragon 820 and Samsung’s tuning leave users with a phone that is easily on par with the top handsets in the world. The user experience is as smooth as you’ll find on any Android phone, and the handset managed an average AnTuTu score of 141,434 in my tests. That’s not quite good enough to beat the Moto Z Droid, but it’s still among the top scores in the world. The phone’s huge battery provides more than enough juice to carry most users through a full day, and then some. In fact, the battery lasted for a full day even while I was testing the phone for this review, when my usage was far heavier than normal. Samsung says the battery is good for up to 14 hours of internet use on either LTE or Wi-Fi, or up to 18 straight hours of video playback. To compliment the large battery and impressive battery life under normal circumstances, Samsung also added two different power saving modes in addition to wired fast charging technology as well as wireless fast charging. How fast is “fast”? I haven’t conducted any scientific tests but anecdotally, the Galaxy Note 7’s 3,500 mAh battery seems to fill about as fast as the 1,715 mAh battery in my iPhone 6s… using wireless charging. It’s even faster when using the wired fast charger Samsung provides. Beyond that you’ve got 4GB of RAM along with 64GB of internal storage. Samsung decided not to give shoppers any options this year when it comes to capacity, instead inviting them to use a microSD card if they have a need for more space. Of note, people who preorder the Note 7 and even people who purchase one after it launches can choose either a free Gear Fit 2 or a free 256GB Samsung microSD card, while supplies last. I recommend the memory card, which has a higher retail value but also leaves you with a 320GB smartphone that costs the same price as a 64GB iPhone 6s Plus. Samsung’s TouchWiz software has received further refinements on the Galaxy Note 7. Even though the phone ships with Android Marshmallow 6.0.1, which also powers last year’s Galaxy Note 5, there are plenty of visual and functional differences. The most significant among them revolve around the phone’s S Pen stylus and the software suite that supports it. The S Pen itself has been redesigned and improved, with a smaller tip that feels almost like a real pen when you use it to jot notes on the Galaxy Note 7’s screen. Speaking of notes, Samsung’s confusing setup consisting of three different note-taking apps has thankfully been nixed and replaced with a single Samsung Notes app that covers all the bases and features a sleek and simple interface based on Google’s Material Design UI. You can begin to enjoy the Note 7’s new S Pen features before the phone is even unlocked. By removing the stylus while the handset is asleep, a Screen Off Memo function is launched that lets you jot down a memo on the phone’s dark display. This feature is nothing new, but that’s not the end of it — on the new Galaxy Note 7, you can pin those notes so that they appear on your Always-On Display, or AOD. For example, you can jot down a quick shopping list and then pin it to your screen. This way, your list is available right on your sleep screen and you don’t have to wake and unlock your phone as you make your way through the super market. Instead, you can just take your Note 7 out of your pocket and double-tap the pinned note icon on the Always-On Display. Other new S Pen features are accessible through the Air Command menu that opens when you hover above the display and tap the button on the stylus. Notable additions include a magnify function that moves a magnifying glass above the display as you hover so you can zoom in on text, a translate feature that translates selected text from one language to another, and a glance feature that keeps an app open as a thumbnail at the bottom of the screen and lets you preview it full screen simply by hovering over it with the S Pen. Another very cool new S Pen feature that I have a feeling is going to be a fan favorite is the integrated GIF maker. With the Smart Select feature accessible through the Air Command menu, you can select any video playing on the screen. As the video plays, record and stop buttons let you choose the exact portion of the video that you want to turn into a GIF. Once you’ve recorded the video, an in-built editor lets you tweak it until it’s perfect, and the clip can then be saved and shared as a GIF. Here’s a great quick video from CNET that shows how it works: With the Galaxy Note 7, Samsung has taken a huge step forward in nearly every area you can imagine. The hardware is a big improvement over last year’s model even though the design of the phone looks practically the same from afar, aside from the curved glass face. The symmetrical curved glass on the front and back of the device help it fit far more comfortably in the hand than any other similarly sized phone in the world. In fact, it’s more comfortable than some smaller phones, too. Samsung’s historical strong points are strengthened even further with this new phablet. The display on the Galaxy Note 7 is positively stunning, featuring fantastic clarity and vivid colors that jump off of the screen. The device also packs plenty of muscle, with tons of power when you need it and smart features that conserve battery life when you don’t. Other features like wired and wireless fast charging as well as two different power saving modes help ensure that your Note 7 always has juice when you need it. As a fun little FYI, the phone will last more than 140 hours on a full charge while using Samsung’s “max” power saving mode. That’s almost six days. Finally, the Galaxy Note 7 is supported by the ever-expanding and ever-improving Samsung ecosystem. There’s a new and improved $99 Gear VR headset launching alongside the Note 7 as well as a $350 Gear 360 camera that can shoot 360-degree video. Then you’ve got all of Samsung’s on-device apps and services, including one that I don’t think gets the attention it deserves: Samsung+. The app includes plenty of resources such as guides and diagnostic tools, and it also has a video chat feature that connects users directly to Samsung’s support team when you need help. The end result is a device that delivers a more comprehensive experience than any rival smartphone in this class. It will instantly become the best phablet on the market when it launches on August 19th, and I would be willing to wager that it’ll still be the world’s best overall phablet come September, even after Apple releases its next-generation iPhones. Apple hasn’t yet begun to concentrate on fully utilizing the extra space afforded by a phablet to offer smart features that differentiate its Plus models in any meaningful way. It will at some point, mark my words. But until then, Samsung’s Note smartphones remain the undisputed kings of the phablet category. There’s the Galaxy Note 7, and then there’s everything else. Samsung’s new Galaxy Note 7 will be released this Friday, August 19th, in the United States and several additional markets around the world. The phone carries a full retail price of $850, though pricing varies by carrier. Each U.S. carrier also offers monthly installment plans, which have been detailed in this post.

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS   skip to main content skip to main menu     Feast your eyes on crips shots of iPhone 7 Pro in Space Black and Deep Blue By Christian Zibreg, Aug 16, 2016 Tweet 34 Comments If you can’t get enough of Space Black/Deep Blue iPhone colorways, we’ve got you covered with some nice looking photos of alleged iPhone 7 Pro units in Apple Watch-style Space Black finish that’s supposed to replace the current Space Gray option. Plus, we have a bunch of crisp shots of a working iPhone 7 Pro prototype in Deep Blue. Feast your eyes on the photos and let us know your thoughts in the comments. More iPhone 7 Space Black images As you can see below, the images purportedly show a rumored iPhone 7 Pro model sporting three pins on the backside, presumably for a Smart Connector. We can clearly see curved appearance of the dual-camera system on the back, along with cleaner antenna lines and a SIM tray on the side (so no e-SIM for the next iPhone). The Home button seems to sit flush with the front face, yet another indication that the iPhone 7 may come with a non-moving Home button outfitted with pressure sensors and haptic feedback to simulate clicks. How about Deep Blue? The images you see below were sent to Chinese site PCOnline.com.cn by an unknown source. The pictured unit is apparently an engineering prototype, running iOS 10. A few images show the device running Apple’s internal testing software, called SwitchBoard. Aside from a nice-looking blueish hue, the device’s backside sports dual cameras, in line with previous rumors, along with legitimate-looking iPhone branding. Whether or not the device on these crisp photographs is a regular 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus model or its rumored “Pro” counterpart is anyone’s guess, but one rumor said Apple had abandoned Deep Blue in favor of a more subdued Space Black finish. All I know is I want one of those blue babies! Yesterday’s Space Black photos Yesterday, Dutch blog TechTastic.nl posted high-quality photos of iPhone 7 casings in Space Black that you can see right below. Japanese blog Mac Otakara was first to report earlier in the summer that the iPhone 7 might come in a new Deep Blue colorway, but the post was later amended to indicate that the hue is actually more akin to the stainless steel Apple Watch in Space Black, so there’s that. iPhone 7 to support fast-charge tech? Last but not least, earlier this morning The Malignant posted a sketchy image suggesting that the iPhone 7 may use a special circuitry to support “at least” 5-volt, 2-amp fast-charging. The image below is said to show an iPhone 6s logic board next to its iPhone 7 counterpart with a new circuitry to support fast-charge technology. September cannot come soon enough! With a little more than three weeks left until a rumored September 7 unveiling, small wonder we’re now seeing high-quality photographs of genuine-looking iPhone 7 parts. I’m eager to hear your thoughts on these rumored Space Black-like and Deep Blue colorways for the next iPhone. Would you pick one over another, and why?

Y2J Gang gang Pam Oakea I want space black. Not interested in blue at all. Why can’t Apple match the antenna lines to the phone? Why white? Interesting that you are calling this the pro when everyone else is reporting that Apple has abondoned the pro moniker at least this year. Christian Zibreg I know, but that’s what the sources called these units. One of the images show three models: 4.7″ iPhone 7, 5.5″ iPhone 7 Plus and 5.5″ iPhone 7 Pro with dual cameras. Tony Morris Which photo is that? The photo above with 3 phones show an iphone 6/6S & 6+/6S+ with what appears to be a iphone 7 plus. You can tell by the antenna lines that these are clearly older models. Christian Zibreg Whoops, you’re right about that. Should have looked more closely at the photos before replying to your comment 😀 h4nd0fg0d I’ve been asking the very same antenna line coloring question many many times. Couldn’t agree more. Its as though Apple wants to showcase them. Smh, lmfao… Bill If they attempt to color match the lines, people will complain that the color is a bit off…and it most likely would be due to the different materials. So surely Apple says “ah screw it, just go with contrasting colors” People will bitch and moan either way, though. Clearly. LOL! h4nd0fg0d Off by a small degree would unquestionably be far better than any other option imaginable, especially contrasting. No? Yes. Xee Same couldn’t give a toss about blue. Black all the way! Xee Same couldn’t give a toss about blue. Black all the way! Abhinav Chaudhary iPhone pro will cost a fortune. Abhijeet Gupta at least in India it will. Jamessmooth I gotta say… if they offer blue AND black, its gonna be a tough choice. Those both look sweeeeeeeet Pj Hickey hope the blue has a white front, 100% buying if it does hate black Eliijah Moss Pj Hickey i can’t stand the black front on the iPhones always wanted space grey but had a black front, have to go with white, just seems cleaner and you don’t see so much smudge marks Eliijah Moss Lol. Just messing with you. I agree as well. I don’t hate the color black, but I would love to see a space black iPhone with a white screen. What you could do is buy a black phone, purchase a white LCD panel from a trusted source like iFixit, and get someone to swap it out. But that scenario racks money up. Xee Makes your screen look smaller, and less seamless. YaBoyLilMayo Racist Tony New colorways won’t get me to purchase a device that has very little “new” to offer, unless they shock people with a new screen and something else… but upgraded optics, more ram and new colorway doesn’t get me excited. n0ahcruz3 They added rose gold for the 6s/6s+! And they sold even more!.. Oh wait.. Lol wwian Can anyone read the IMEI number on any of those blue phones? Last time I looked, the IMEI’s on some of these secret photos matched iphone 6 model info. T. Allen Dosn’t really seem like a “deep” blue as some of the earlier pictures and renderings showed. This looks more like a metallic blue. Leaning towards the black one. matthewmspace That blue looks so sweet, but the actual featureset will have to impress me enough to buy the 7. Corey Hawkins II I was really hoping they would stay with the deep Navy Blue. Dang. /: alexy These are not real iPhones. There are just dummies created by obscure Chinese companies based on some supposedly leaked or guessed information. Jake Platt The Galaxy Note 7 is looking nice.. 5723alex . Right, but only if it comes with iOS and in black. Andrieux Querido The Blue one is Gorgeous. ravinigga I see no 3 dots on the back Shubham Prajapati Deep Blue Gang Bang Nailed it ! Jonny Love that blue! Hope the white lines mean a white front on the final product. Only Space black needs a black front. Jonny One question to the group: Anybody actually like the antenna lines on 6/ 6s? I ask because I always liked them and I always thought they added to the design. I’m afraid with them silver and gold will just look like random pieces of aluminum (and silver is my favorite- it’s what I chose in 5s and 6s): Pure Apple.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines This Mac app lets you switch between recently used apps via Touch Bar A running list of great iOS and macOS apps on sale this week President-elect Trump promises tax incentives for Apple to build “Made in USA” iPhones Apple could slash prices of next year’s 4.7″ and 5.5″ iPhones with legacy LCD technology iPhone 8 to hit mass production late in the third quarter of 2017   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: ClearClockView, PullOver, & more… PullOver lets you pin an app to your screen for easier multitasking Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

Microsoft's new ad mocks Apple's latest iPad Pro commercial by bashing the fact the iOS tablet got a keyboard addition, but no trackpad, full desktop apps, or external ports. "I just got a keyboard," says Siri in the commercial, "I'm a computer now, like you." Like previous comparison ads, Microsoft focuses on the iPad's lack of "power" to describe itself as a computer, by mocking the lack of an Intel processor, full desktop versions of Office, and no trackpad or USB ports. It's similar to what we've seen in the past, but this time it's Siri and Cortana in conversation. The ad ends by claiming that "Surface does more, just like you." Microsoft argues that "just because you call something a computer doesn't mean it fits the description," while Apple believes that its latest tablet really does fit the computer description. It's an argument that certainly won't end with this commercial. iPad Pro 9.7 review Source: Surface (YouTube) More From The Verge Snap Spectacles review: Fun that's totally worth the trouble Cults, chaos, and community: how The Tension Experience rewrote the rules of storytelling Netflix feels like Blockbuster these days The Verge 2016 Holiday Gift Guide Supported By Did Trump just change his mind on climate change?

Apple Apple to out 10.5-inch iPad Pro in 2017, flexible AMOLED iPad in 2018 By Bindu Nair - Apple is gearing up to launch three new iPad models in 2017 as per relatively reliable KGI securities analyst Ming Chi-Kuo. Not only that, the tech giant may also be planning a major refresh of its lineup in 2018 with flexible AMOLED screens. According to Kuo’s latest research report, Apple will launch an all-new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, and low-cost 9.7-inch iPad in 2017. However, he doesn’t expect the new arrivals to drive shipment growth, claiming that it’ll fall by 10 – 20% YoY. The analyst also asserts that Apple may bid for tenders within the commercial and education markets with the help of the 10.5-inch iPad Pro. This makes sense, since consumer growth for the tablet series has been stagnating for the past year. Also Read: Apple patent hints future iPhones could shoot underwater Furthermore, the 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro are expected to run on the A10X processor, while the 9.7-inch slate will settle for the A9X SoC. The latter is presumably being groomed as a cheaper alternative to the other two, hence the slower chipset. Kuo’s report doesn’t contain any mention of the current 7.9-inch iPad mini. Several people have assumed that the company may just abandon the smallest tablet in its portfolio since the advent of the 5.5-inch iPhone Plus models has seemingly lessened the demand for the device. As for the future of Apple’s tablet lineup, Kuo predicts that Apple will introduce revolutionary changes by 2018 at the earliest. He asserts that there will be radical modifications in form factor design and user behavior because of the shift towards a flexible AMOLED screen. Even the 2017 iPhone is likely opting for an AMOLED panel. The 2018 iPad revamp will thus be following in its footsteps and may just reinvigorate sales.

ICONS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP Apple's Boring Mission Statement and What We Can Learn From It Thousands of hours have been wasted talking about mission statements that are, quite frankly, boring. The best mission statements, are both inspirational and to the point By Jim Schleckser Jim Schleckser helps leaders grow companies. He specializes in the issues that fast-growth firms experience in their business models, talent, processes, and systems as they reach higher levels of performance. Schleckser works with CEOs of high-growth companies through his firm the Inc. CEO Project and is the author of the book Great CEOs Are Lazy @incCEOProject CEO, Inc. CEO Project. Author, Great CEOs Are Lazy@incCEOProject WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Mission statements are critically important to your organization because they drive alignment in your organization toward the vision of what you want to get done. That's why it should be the inspiration that your organization rallies around. Unfortunately, many thousands of hours have been wasted talking about mission statements that are, quite frankly, BORING! The best mission statements, on the other hand, are both inspirational and to the point. Consider the example of Apple. When Steve Jobs started the now iconic company, his mission statement was: "To make a contribution to the world by making tools for the mind that advance humankind." Wow; that's something I would get out of bed in the morning for. But as much as Apple has contributed to the advance of technology, the company has come under increasing criticism that it has lost its way since Jobs passed away in 2011. One of the changes the company has made in the years since is to change that original mission statement, which now reads like this: "Apple designs Macs, the best personal computers in the world, along with OS X, iLife, iWork and professional software. Apple leads the digital music revolution with its iPods and iTunes online store. Apple has reinvented the mobile phone with its revolutionary iPhone and App store, and is defining the future of mobile media and computing devices with iPad." Which mission statement do you prefer? While the newer version is very specific about what the company does, it certainly fails to meet the criteria I suggested earlier: it's not inspiring and it's certainly not brief and to the point. Now compare Apple's latest mission statement with some other major companies. For many years, Pepsi's mission statement was: "Beat Coke." That's certainly simple and while it doesn't get into the tactics of how they will fulfill that mission, it gives everyone in the organization a clear vision of what they need to accomplish. Another great example comes from Medtronic, the medical device manufacturer, whose mission statement is: "To extend human life." That's an exciting mission and certainly something that is inspirational for anyone who works inside the business producing products like pacemakers and defibrillators. But you don't have to be a major corporation to have a great mission statement. I worked with a business that competed in the exciting field of humidity measurement. It's not a big market, maybe $500 million in total, but this company established its mission as: "Global domination of the humidity measurement industry." Not only is that clear and inspirational, it gives everyone plenty of scope for the business to aim at over the next several years. What happens in situations like what we see with Apple is that you are trying to please everyone. You worry about offending someone, or leaving someone out. But by trying to be inclusive and non-offensive, you lose that focus and inspirational tone you need for your mission statement to be meaningful. That then leads you down the path of a favorite quote of mine from the movie RoboCop where executive Dick Jones says, "Good business is where you find it." It basically means, "We will do anything for anybody, if we can make money". That's not too inspirational. In other words, you chase every opportunity you can--which can be the worst thing for your organization to do. As I have written about before, your organization is actually defined by what you say no to. Worse than trying to please everyone are mission statements designed by committees. Mission statements are also like strategy in that they are best done in smaller groups--preferably one using the seven plus or minus two rule. When you give the job of crafting your mission statement to a committee, you end up with boring, multi-syllabic paragraphs that say a lot about nothing, much like the one from Apple. So take another look your company's mission statement. If you start yawning when you read it, it's time to make a change by making it shorter, tighter and more inspirational. Grab a small team - be bold, say no to lots of things and inspire your team! The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.

WIRE Warren Buffett's Company Bites Off Larger Share of Apple The move is especially interesting because Buffett himself has shown reluctance in the past to invest in technology companies. By Associated Press WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Warren Buffett's company is taking an even bigger bite of Apple stock and adding to its already sizeable stake in Phillips 66. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. filed an update with regulators Monday on its roughly $130 billion U.S. stock portfolio. Berkshire said it held 15.2 million Apple Inc. shares at the end of June, up from the 9.8 million share stake it first disclosed in the spring. The Apple investment raises eyebrows because Buffett has always been reluctant to invest in technology companies. It may have been the work of one of Berkshire's two other investment managers. The quarterly filings don't disclose who is managing Berkshire's Apple investments, and Berkshire officials don't generally comment on the filings. Buffett tends to handle the larger investments in Berkshire's portfolio, such as IBM, Wells Fargo and Coca-Cola. He has said that investments of less than $1 billion are likely to be the work of Ted Weschler or Todd Combs, who each handle about $9 billion for Berkshire. At the end of June, Berkshire held 78.8 million Phillips 66 shares, which represents about 15 percent of the oil refiner's stock. That's up from 75.6 million shares three months earlier. Buffett's company cut its Wal-Mart Stores Inc. stake to 40.2 million shares in June from 55.2 million in the spring. During the second quarter, Berkshire also made several other changes in its portfolio, including: Increasing its stake in Liberty Media Corp. to 37.5 million shares from 30 million. Reducing its Suncor Energy Inc. holdings to 22.3 million shares from 30 million shares. Increasing its Liberty Global PLC stake to 30.7 million shares from 23.8 million. Besides investments, Berkshire owns more than 90 companies in a variety of industries, including insurance, utilities, BNSF railroad, furniture and jewelry. --Associated Press Published on: Aug 16, 2016 Advertisement

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Jena McGregor August 16 Follow @jenamcgregor Apple CEO Tim Cook with Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) at Apple headquarters in February 2015. (Photo courtesy of Apple) Tim Cook has a poster of Robert F. Kennedy on the wall of his office. He has quoted Kennedy's famous "Ripple of Hope" speech, given in South Africa in 1966. A bust of the young progressive legend, an award received from the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights, sits behind Cook's desk. And so it should come as little surprise that, when asked in an interview with The Washington Post what he's reading, Cook mentions a newly released biography of Kennedy, written by Boston journalist Larry Tye. "Bobby Kennedy: The Making of a Liberal Icon" has been described as "a complete portrait of a complex man" and "the definitive biography" of Kennedy; its author makes use of interviews with his widow, sister and aides, as well as previously undisclosed documents. Image courtesy of Random House MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, in a review of the book for The Washington Post, called it "a fascinating and extensively researched biography that provides the most balanced view to date of this complicated liberal hero." Also on Cook's reading list: Gandhi's autobiography, "The Story of My Experiments with Truth." First published in installments in the late 1920s, the book recounts the Indian independence movement leader's life, as well as how he developed the concept of civil disobedience. Cook said he picked up the book while at a museum during a recent charm offensive trip to India to help Cook grow Apple's business there. (Another business executive who's reportedly a fan of Gandhi's autobiography is Siemens India CEO Sunil Mathur, who told the Indian news site Livemint it had inspired him "to run a value-based business that is sustainable.") "I tend to like nonfiction and particularly reading about people and how they lived and how they fought, and what motivated them and their philosophy and so forth," Cook told The Post. Cook said he will skim more traditional business books "occasionally," but that "I’d rather read about real people." Another real person he's recommended reading about is Rep. John Lewis, who he hosted at Apple headquarters last year. At an event at Apple headquarters, Cook lauded Lewis's graphic novel trilogy about the civil rights movement, "March." "It is a very unique way to present what is probably the most important story of my entire lifetime," Cook said when introducing Rep. Lewis at Apple, according to a report in Computerworld. "My hope is that everyone reads this, and I would love to see the day that it is required reading in every school." And yes, when asked, in his interview with The Washington Post, what public officials he finds inspiring today, Cook named Lewis. "I think he has such a great heart and also has the historical knowledge," Cook said, "to able to both put things into perspective about everything that has been accomplished, but also recognize there's a long way to go."

The vast majority of these leaks only feature dummy iPhone 7 units that don’t actually work, but a brand new set of images show the iPhone 7 Plus as you've never seen before. Not only is the screen turned on, but the phone comes in a fresh new color that Apple has been rumored to roll out with this year's new iPhones. DON’T MISS: iPhone 8 concept shows the major design overhaul everyone wanted on the iPhone 7 Posted online by The Malignant, a Twitter user who has shared various similar leaks concerning the 2016 iPhone and other devices, the images originate from PCOnline.cn, although it’s not clear how the site obtained them. Even more pictures were posted on Chinese site iFeng, showing the device from various angles complete with comparisons with current iPhone models. blue-iphone-7-plus-screen-turned-on-1More Also interesting is the name The Malignant uses for the device: iPhone 7 Pro. Early iPhone 7 rumors claimed Apple would have three iPhone 7 models in stores this year, the expected iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and a new high-end iPhone 7 Pro. The latter was initially intended to be the only 5.5-inch new iPhone to sport a dual-lens rear camera, according to rumors. Since then, more reports indicated that all iPhone 7 phablets will have a dual camera, and will share the same Plus name. https://twitter.com/the_malignant/status/765483104756756480 Getting back to these images, they seem to paint a familiar picture. The blue iPhone 7 Plus has all the design markings we expect: The single-band rear antenna lines and a protruding dual-lens camera are there. blue-iphone-7-plus-screen-turned-on-7More The absence of the headphone jack can easily be seen in some these shots, with the 3.5mm standard audio port being replaced by a speaker grille (which may or may not actually cover a second speaker). blue-iphone-7-plus-screen-turned-on-5More One element that can’t be discerned in the images is the home button. Rumors say the iPhone 7 will have a capacitive home button with 3D Touch support instead of a physical button you can press. blue-iphone-7-plus-screen-turned-on-2More Read More What’s interesting about the images, aside from the new color, is the phone’s display. The device appears to be running a version of iOS 10, although the person who took the photos does not reveal any details about it. The phone likely comes from China considering that language seems to be set to Chinese, and has elements that iOS 10 beta testers will instantly recognize include the new widgets on the search screen, as well as a wallpaper that’s included in Apple’s list of default wallpapers for iOS 10. blue-iphone-7-plus-screen-turned-on-6More Siri, however, is not turned on, and it's replaced by Voice Control. blue-iphone-7-plus-screen-turned-on-3More We’d also point out that, while this leak certainly seems exciting, there’s also a chance that someone either faked these carefully taken photos or used an iPhone clone that runs a custom version of Android. That said, you can check out more leaked images below. blue-iphone-7-plus-screen-turned-on-8More blue-iphone-7-plus-screen-turned-on-4More Trending right now: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 review The ultimate Pokemon Go hack that lets you walk anywhere just got even better Google’s FaceTime killer ‘Duo’ is now available for iPhone and Android See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Donald Trump’s advisors are lying to him Quartz iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech A laser pointer from the stands helped the Oakland Raiders beat the Texans BGR News How to shop Best Buy’s members-only early Black Friday sale for free, today only BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

Tim Cook reportedly made the commitment to Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, stating that the center will be built by the end of the year. The pledge comes after the head of China’s industry and technology regulator in May told Cook he hoped Apple could deepen its cooperation with the country in research and development and stressed information security. Apple likely has two reasons for investing in R&D within China … First, Apple wants to be able to recruit the best research staff worldwide, not all of whom are willing to relocate to the USA. It has established – or is establishing – R&D centers in a number of locations around the world, including France, Israel, Japan, Sweden and the UK. A center in China has long been rumored. Second, the company is seeking to establish closer ties to protect its interests in what is currently its second-largest market. Apple has long had a somewhat precarious relationship with the Chinese government. China has in the past questioned the security of iPhones and banned government purchases of Apple products. More recently, China has said that Apple will be subjected to greater security scrutiny, its iBooks and iTunes Movies services were shut down by a government agency, and a Beijing patent office has ruled that the iPhone 6 copies a Chinese phone. Reuters even suggests that Apple’s $1B investment in Chinese Uber competitor Didi Chuxing – key to Uber abandoning its own operations in the country – may have been partly motivated by political considerations. Before Cook’s charm offensive in Beijing in May, Apple announced a $1 billion deal with ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing, a move many experts saw as an attempt to curry favor with Beijing. Apple’s Q3 earnings report revealed that the company’s sales in China were down 33% year-on-year as it battles local brands.

Here’s our ultimate guide to sharing files and folders from your Mac computer. AirDrop Suitable for: Sharing files locally with other Mac or iOS devices in the vicinity, doesn’t work with Windows, Android or non-Apple machines. AirDrop is Apple’s local file transfer utility and like many other Apple technologies, it only works with other Apple devices. You can transfer files, webpages, contacts, and so on between different Mac computers, and iPhones and iPads running iOS. In order to use AirDrop, you will need to enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on both devices but there is no need for all parties to be sharing the same network. Apple doesn’t appear to have imposed a file size limit on transfers conducted over AirDrop, but as the technology is wireless keep in mind that large transfers can take a while to complete. It is also possible to send multiple files using AirDrop. Ads by Google You’ll find AirDrop as an option under the Share menu on both Mac computers and Apple’s mobile devices. On a Mac you can click on AirDrop in Finder’s sidebar to reveal a list of compatible nearby devices. You can also set your privacy settings here (found by swiping up to reveal Control Center on iOS). On a Mac you can right-click a file (or select several) then head to Share > AirDrop and select a destination device. On an iOS device you will need to make your selection first (e.g. multiple images in the Photos app) then hit the Share button. Keep in mind that AirDrop is notoriously temperamental — we’ve produced an AirDrop troubleshooting guide AirDrop Not Working? Troubleshoot Your File Transfer Woes AirDrop Not Working? Troubleshoot Your File Transfer Woes Having troubles with AirDrop? We can step you through all of your available options. Read More  for this very reason. Cloud Storage Services Suitable for: Small to medium files, collaboration, sharing with Windows and non-Apple operating systems. Cloud storage services offer generous free options, usually only requiring payment if you intend to exceed the amount of free storage provided. As a result, they’re perfect for quickly sharing a file, and with the right software installed will integrate seamlessly into your workflow. You might think of iCloud as being the perfect solution on a Mac, but iCloud is only really suitable for sharing data with your own devices. In reality, there are few true sharing capabilities built into iCloud compared with other online storage options. The two main exceptions are shared Photo Streams in the Photos app and shared iWork documents in Pages, Sheets and Keynote — both of which require the user have an Apple ID and relevant device. If you’d rather share files in the cloud with other users, you’re better of using Google Drive or Dropbox. There are other solutions (Box and OneDrive to name but two) that may also do the job. These services include native Mac clients which integrate cloud storage with your Mac. For example, to share a file with someone via Google Drive: Download the Google Drive app for Mac, start it, and log in. Open Finder and click Google Drive (alternatively, click the Google Drive icon in your menu bar and click the button to open the folder). Drag your file into Google Drive — you can create folders and organize things if you want. Right-click the file and click Share using Google Drive. Click Get shareable link or add the email addresses of any users you want to access the file, and set sharing preferences. You can also share files using your browser by heading to drive.google.com and dragging the file into your browser window. If this seems like hard work, there are a few other apps that can simplify the process further mentioned further down this page. Local Network Sharing If you’d rather share locally with computers on the same network, you can easily set up a shared folder and manage which users can access it. Whenever you want to share a file you can then drop it into the folder. This will only work for users on the same network as you, whether they are using Wi-Fi or a wired Ethernet connection, but there are no restrictions on file sizes beyond a user’s patience while waiting for a transfer to complete. You can specify shared folders under System Preferences > Sharing, add users, and under Options enable SMB sharing for Windows machines. Be sure to read our full guide to sharing files between Windows and Mac computers Easily Share Files Between Windows 7, 8 and Mac OS X Easily Share Files Between Windows 7, 8 and Mac OS X Cross platform file sharing sounds complicated, but it doesn't have to be. Here's how to get a PC and and a Mac to share files with each other. Read More , and alternatives to AirDrop for sharing with Windows users How to Share Files Between Windows & Mac without AirDrop How to Share Files Between Windows & Mac without AirDrop AirDrop only works for Apple devices. Here we introduce equally simple solutions that are free, require no cable or other hardware, and can transfer large files between Windows and Mac over a wireless connection. Read More . BitTorrent & BT Sync Suitable for: Sharing files of any size (even huge ones) privately or publicly. BitTorrent is one of the most efficient ways to share files, whether you want to do so publicly or privately. It’s easy to use once you know how — first you must download a BitTorrent client, next you make a .torrent file by specifying a file or folder to share and adding a tracker, then you send the small file to a friend or upload it to the web. These files act like signposts, pointing users to the file which will then download directly from your device. As a result, BitTorrent is limited by your Internet connection, at least until other users have downloaded the file and start uploading it too. If you intend to share files publicly from a Mac, we’d recommend using the Transmission BitTorrent client and following our simple guide to creating torrents How To Create Torrent Files & Share Them Using Transmission How To Create Torrent Files & Share Them Using Transmission Read More . BTSync (Free) If you only need to share your file with a select few users (or a large number, but you don’t want the file available publicly) then you’re better off using BTSync. This software fuses BitTorrent technology and cloud storage into one solution — first you download the client, then you specify a shared folder and users you would like to access the folder (they too will need the client), and finally you add files into the folder to make them available. It’s the perfect set-and-forget sharing solution for those who need to share regularly — we use it here at MakeUseOf to share media between authors and editors, video reviews, design work, and more. Read more about BTSync and what makes it so great From Pirate Darling To Dropbox Alternative: BitTorrent Sync Lets You Keep Your Files Synchronized Across Machines From Pirate Darling To Dropbox Alternative: BitTorrent Sync Lets You Keep Your Files Synchronized Across Machines Cloud-based file sync services are easy to use and work well, but your privacy may or may not be your first priority. Not to mention the fact that these services always come with a storage... Read More . Other Hosting Services Suitable for: Files of varying size and simplifying the sharing process. Cloud services are great for their ability to back up data, integrate with your computer, and appear just like any other regular folder on your Mac; but they are often limited by restrictive storage demands and registration processes. The following services do things a little differently. Jumpshare (Free or $9.99/month) Jumpshare is a free file sharing service that uses a native Mac app to do all the heavy lifting. Once installed it allows you to grab a file, drag it to the Jumpshare icon in your Mac’s menu bar and begin the upload. You’ll then get a URL which you can copy and share with anyone else — regardless of whether or not they have a Jumpshare account. If it sounds too good to be true, free users are limited to 5GB bandwidth transfer per month. So if you share a 1GB file, it will only be able to be downloaded five times before it won’t work anymore. Users can upgrade for $9.99 per month for 1TB of storage and unlimited bandwidth. Mega (Free or Subscription) The world’s highest ranking New Zealand domain, Mega is a secure file hosting service with an attractive free option. Upon signing up you’ll get 50GB of encrypted storage, with around 10GB of bandwidth per month (though this isn’t currently quoted on the website). By upgrading you can extend this to 200GB with 1TB of monthly bandwidth for €4.99 per month. The service is ideal if you need to host a medium to large file and make it available for download with other users via a standard URL. Uploads and downloads can be performed through a browser or the Mega Sync Client for even faster sharing. Mega isn’t the only example of its kind, so check out a few of the other cyberlockers available online Top 10 Largest File Sharing Websites On The Net Right Now Top 10 Largest File Sharing Websites On The Net Right Now According to Google’s search engine rankings, only 2 of the top 10 most visited file sharing websites are related to BitTorrent. This isn’t to say that torrents aren’t still popular, but five years ago the... Read More . nFiles (Free) An incredibly simple file sharing solution, nFiles offers fast storage for small files using email. Simply open your mail client and send your file to i@nfil.es and you’ll be sent a URL to share with other users. A file limit of 15MB per file applies, or you can head to the website and upload files of up to 2MB without providing any email address. It’s also possible to use your email address on the website to retrieve any past files you have uploaded. It might be limited, but it’s a fast and free way of getting a URL you can pass around. Use Your Own Server Suitable for: Using webspace you’ve already paid for or have access to. Dropzone ($10) Dropzone isn’t a service or a platform but an app that makes uploading files to various services easier than ever. You don’t need to have your own server to take advantage of it, as it will work with Google Drive too, but Dropzone really becomes useful when paired with online storage like Amazon S3 4 Great Uses for Amazon's S3 Web Services 4 Great Uses for Amazon's S3 Web Services Despite Amazon being most well known for their retail services, they actually offer a host of web services for developers and home users that take advantage of Amazons experience and scalability with massive amounts of... Read More or an FTP connection. It also works with Imgur for sharing screenshots, YouTube for videos, Flickr for photos, and other social networks for quickly spreading the word. As the name might suggest, Dropzone uses a drag and drop interface to quickly upload files. Once you’ve connected your various accounts, drag your file to Dropzone in your Mac’s menu bar and release it over the service you want to use. You can also use the app for non-sharing tasks, like copying or moving files, installing applications, shortening URLs, and creating archives of multiple files. FileShuttle (free) An open source project, FileShuttle is essentially a less feature-rich version of Dropzone. It only works with an FTP or SFTP server, but once set up it allows you to automatically save screenshots to your server, or drag and drop files to the FileShuttle menu bar icon to get a URL you can share with whoever you want. If you are planning to use your own storage, be mindful of bandwidth costs should your file be passed around the web and downloaded by lots of people (especially if it’s a large file). As a Last Resort… Even though this guide is designed to remove the reliance on email and physical storage, sometimes the easiest way to share a file is to either send it directly to someone or put it on a removable USB drive and physically carry it to another computer. In most cases though, using one of the above examples will allow you to move more data, in less clicks, and with less hassle. Are you ready to ditch email attachments and flash drives?

The concept is sending a text, digital file(s) or folder to another computer should be as easy as handing a sticky note, paper(s) or physical folder to another person. Also the no user accounts and zero config (unless you turn on a firewall and block the port). Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

This hasn’t gone over well! Apart from forcing some people to buy new wired (or wireless) headphones, it’s likely to raise the cost of the average pair, and make many learn to live with dongles. Still, there are some potential benefits to adopting a digital audio connection like Lightning — noise-cancelling could become standard, for instance, and higher-end Lightning cans could provide better sound. Plus, if Apple makes jack-less iPhones the norm, it’d at least do so in one fell swoop. Lightning replaces 3.5mm, and that’s that. Business Insider/Jeff DunnWhere things get messier is on Android. There, USB-C makes for a natural headphone jack replacement: It has all the same digital capabilities as Lightning, works with various types of devices, and can still pass analog audio, meaning its headphones wouldn’t necessarily have to cost more, the way Lightning pairs tend to. The problem is not everyone’s making the switch. While Lenovo’s Moto Z has (with little immediate benefit), other Android manufacturers are drawing a line in a sand. After Samsung openly mocked Apple over the rumor earlier this month, LG not only confirmed its upcoming V20 will keep the jack late last week — it used that decision to help sell the phone as a whole. More specifically, it promoted how it’s partnered with audio firm ESS to put a 32-bit “quad-DAC” in the device. That means it uses up to four digital-to-analog converters, which in turn means it’s capable of stronger audio — so long as you’re using wired 3.5mm headphones. This could complicate things. There’s less risk in creating Lightning headphones if the next few iPhones only have a Lightning port. If Android phones are on both sides at once, though, headphone makers have less incentive to create USB-C models, which, again, seem like a legitimate successor to what’s available today. They still could, since most Android OEMs are adopting USB-C anyway, but people will buy traditional pairs if the jack is available. Business Insider/Jeff DunnRight now, all of this in limbo, both for buyers and manufacturers. “In general, I feel that about 30% of flagship brands are considering dropping 3.5mm, such as Motorola just did,” V-Moda CEO Val Kolton told Business Insider. “I think they are also waiting to see what Apple will do with Lightning.” Indeed, it’s still early. If the current hysteria turns out to be hot air, you’d think more than 30% of Android OEMs would be comfortable turning to USB-C. The rise of wireless headphones would negate things, too. For the near future, though, it looks like Android has found yet another way to feel fragmented.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Jena McGregor August 16 Follow @jenamcgregor Apple's Tim Cook with Steve Jobs in 2010. (Paul Sakuma/AP) Since he was officially named Apple's CEO in 2011, Tim Cook has often told the story of the advice Steve Jobs gave him just before he died. In the memorial service at Apple headquarters, and in numerous interviews since, Cook has shared the words of wisdom Jobs bestowed on his successor. "Among his last advice he had for me, and for all of you, was to never ask what he would do," Cook recalled in an Oct. 19 speech at Apple headquarters. " 'Just do what’s right,' he said." Five years later, Cook expanded on that, saying that the next best advice he received was "to be myself, to just be myself," he said in an exclusive interview with The Washington Post. "[Jobs] took away the self doubt that would naturally be there in whoever followed him. He was so smart to think about it and know what a gift it would be. There's no bigger gift he could have given me than that statement. It took away the heavy weight." The comparisons to Jobs of how Cook leads the company, of whether he can keep Apple's innovation engine humming, of the kind of leader Apple needs at its current size and environment, are endless. Some are favorable, others are decidedly not. Jobs was a founder, and carried with him the great authority that comes with that role. And he was, of course, a visionary who's been called a modern-day Thomas Edison and a contemporary Leonardo da Vinci. Cook is right when he says "it would have been a treacherous thing" to try and replace him. Meanwhile, he's still conscious of building on what Jobs built. "That doesn't mean that I don't work like mad for his legacy." For Cook, the comparisons to Jobs are not likely to end, especially as customers and investors wait on new mega hits that show Apple can replicate the iPhone's success. Indeed, those comparisons will probably never go away -- whoever one day succeeds Cook will probably be held up to Jobs, too. For now, Cook seems thankful that Jobs gave his blessing to do things his own way, grounded in Apple's values. "You can imagine the human tendency to sit and ask that question [about what Steve would have done] on so many things -- whether they're product things or this FBI thing or shareholder things or acquisitions," he told The Post. "I think that's a lot larger than people think of it. I think it's huge." Read also: Tim Cook's own (slow) brand of innovation Tim Cook’s interview about Apple’s fight with the FBI may be the most important of his career Like On Leadership?

(AP / Nati Harnik, File) Josh Funk, The Associated Press Published Tuesday, August 16, 2016 9:22AM EDT OMAHA, Neb. -- Warren Buffett's company is taking an even bigger bite of Apple stock and adding to its already sizeable stake in Phillips 66. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. filed an update with regulators Monday on its roughly $130 billion U.S. stock portfolio. Berkshire said it held 15.2 million Apple Inc. shares at the end of June, up from the 9.8 million share stake it first disclosed in the spring. The Apple investment raises eyebrows because Buffett has always been reluctant to invest in technology companies. It may have been the work of one of Berkshire's two other investment managers. The quarterly filings don't disclose who is managing Berkshire's Apple investments, and Berkshire officials don't generally comment on the filings. Buffett tends to handle the larger investments in Berkshire's portfolio, such as IBM, Wells Fargo and Coca-Cola. He has said that investments of less than $1 billion are likely to be the work of Ted Weschler or Todd Combs, who each handle about $9 billion for Berkshire. At the end of June, Berkshire held 78.8 million Phillips 66 shares, which represents about 15 per cent of the oil refiner's stock. That's up from 75.6 million shares three months earlier. Buffett's company cut its Wal-Mart Stores Inc. stake to 40.2 million shares in June from 55.2 million in the spring. During the second quarter, Berkshire also made several other changes in its portfolio, including: Increasing its stake in Liberty Media Corp. to 37.5 million shares from 30 million. Reducing its Suncor Energy Inc. holdings to 22.3 million shares from 30 million shares. Increasing its Liberty Global PLC stake to 30.7 million shares from 23.8 million. Besides investments, Berkshire owns more than 90 companies in a variety of industries, including insurance, utilities, BNSF railroad, furniture and jewelry.

Samsung's new Galaxy Note 7 is the most beautiful phone ever made Steve Kovach Aug. 16, 2016, 9:00 AM 273,210 facebook linkedin twitter email print Corey Protin/Tech Insider Update: On October 11, 2016, Samsung announced it is ending production of the Galaxy Note 7 following reports that the device overheats, smokes, and catches fire. We do not recommend buying this phone if you find it in stores. If you already own a Note 7, you should power it down and return it immediately. What follows is the the original review for the Galaxy Note 7: One of my colleagues said it best when he saw me with the new Galaxy Note 7 for the first time. "Wait, that's the new Note?" He was expecting something bigger. And uglier. It's a sharp contrast from a few years ago, when the Note series was seen as an oversize and bulky alternative to the iPhone that was almost universally panned by reviewers. That's not what the Note 7 is. The Note 7 is the most beautiful phone I've ever used. It has more thoughtful features (waterproofing!) than the iPhone. It has a larger screen than the iPhone 6 Plus', yet it's still smaller and easier to hold. And even with an eye-popping $850 price tag (on sale Friday), it's worth every penny if you want the best of the best. Samsung practically invented the phablet category. Now it has perfected it. The Note 7 is absolutely a phone you should buy. It isn't just a great Android phone. It's a great phone, period.  View As: One Page Slides The most beautiful phone ever made Last year, Samsung leapfrogged Apple's design with the Galaxy S6. A year and a half later, it has perfected every aspect of its phone design with the Note 7. While everyone else is chasing Apple's designs, Samsung is now in a class of its own. I have been an iPhone 6 Plus user for almost two years. I've grown used to its extra bulk, changing my habits to the point at which I take it out of my pocket and lay it on the table so it doesn't jab into my hip when I sit down. I've learned to stretch my fingers to the max so I can operate it with one hand. I've given up on trying to hide the giant bulge it makes in my jeans pocket. I had none of those problems with the Note 7. Corey Protin/Business Insider Even though the Note 7 has a slightly larger screen (5.7 inches versus the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus), Samsung was able to shave off every millimeter where it counts. The Note 7 is significantly smaller than the iPhone 6 Plus, making it feel much more comfortable in your pocket and even better in your hand. And then there's the curved screen, which is now a staple in Samsung's flagship phones. The Note 7 is unique in that it is made from two identical pieces of curved glass fused together with a metal band. It is perfectly symmetrical, making it feel thinner and lighter than it actually is. That curved screen isn't a gimmick either. Though there are limited features for the curved portion of the screen, such as swiping over to pull up a tray of your favorite apps or contacts, it's mostly just there to look nice and give you the impression that the screen has no bezels at all. That's good enough for me. I suggest turning off all the extras and just enjoying how good this thing looks. It is one of the best displays ever put on a phone. There's only one downside to the design. The glass on the back is a magnet for scratches. I've accumulated two scratches on the back of my Note 7 in the past week, even though all I've done is keep it in my pocket or on my desk at work. If you want to keep your Note 7 shiny and scratch-free, I strongly recommend buying a case. The best hardware Samsung is a much different phone maker today. Just a few years ago it was pushing wild features like touchless gestures and more camera modes than you could possibly use. And it was all packaged in an unattractive plastic body. That was the old Samsung. The new Samsung is focused on the thoughtful features that matter the most. The Note 7 has it all: waterproofing, wireless charging, fast charging, the best camera ever put in a phone, and removable storage — all inside that gorgeous glass design. It's a phone that can do it all without compromising anything. Corey Protin/Business Insider Like other Note phones before it, the Note 7 also comes with the S Pen stylus, which you can use to doodle or take notes. This year's model has an improved S Pen with a sensitive tip that feels more natural to write with. There's also a cute new feature that lets you grab portions of videos and turn them into GIFs. I've never been a huge fan of the S Pen, and I kept it tucked away in its slot for most of my time with the Note 7. I realize there are plenty of Note fans out there who like it, but I'm glad it's just a hidden accessory and not something essential to the phone. Just like the Galaxy S7, the Note 7 can survive under a few feet of water for up to 30 minutes. Yes, even the S Pen is waterproof. And yes, the phone can still get wet if the S Pen slot is open. This doesn't mean you should go swimming with the Note 7, but you don't have to worry about using it in the rain or accidentally dropping it in the toilet. Or you could always pour Champagne on it, Lil' Wayne style. Corey Protin/Business Insider The other key feature in the Note 7 is the new iris scanner, which takes an image of your eyes with an infrared light and stores it securely on the phone. You can use the iris scanner to unlock the phone, just as you would with the fingerprint scanner. It also lets you access a new secure folder where you can store private photos, files, and apps that only you can access. I was initially intrigued by the iris scanner, but it's a lot better in theory than in practice. Though it is more secure — Samsung says it works only with the user's living eyeball and can't be spoofed the way fingerprints can — it's also an impractical way to unlock your phone. The iris scanner doesn't work well in bright sunlight (it failed on me at the beach last weekend), and it's not as convenient as clicking the home button and resting your fingerprint on the sensor to unlock the device. With the iris scanner, you have to power on the phone, swipe to unlock, and awkwardly hold the phone close to your face while staring into an interface that looks like something out of a sci-fi movie. Not exactly seamless. I think the iris scanner's best hope is to serve as an extra layer of protection for security-minded companies and governments that want employees to keep stuff in that secure folder. It's a clever feature but falls short of being a game changer. Corey Protin/Business Insider The Note 7's camera is the same one that comes with the Galaxy S7, which launched earlier this year. The only difference is the camera app's interface has been cleaned up slightly, making it easier to use. Even with the rapid pace of camera innovation in phones, no one has been able to top Samsung's latest camera. It is the best smartphone camera for just about any environment. Battery life is excellent too. Even with a slim body, the Note 7's battery is large enough to get you through more than a day. It also comes with wireless charging, which works with any standard wireless charger. You can also enable fast charging if you use one of Samsung's charging plugs or wireless charging pads. Battery life is the one feature that matters most to just about everyone, and it's insane that Samsung is the only premium smartphone maker that takes it so seriously. One critical flaw If there's one big weakness to the Note 7, it is the software powering it. Samsung likes to make big modifications to Android, which often gums up the experience. That said, the interface is definitely a lot cleaner in the Note 7 than in previous Samsung phones. Still, Samsung has a horrible record of keeping its phones updated with the latest software, and there's no guarantee you'll be getting the new Note features a year from now. On top of that, the Note 7 also comes bogged down with extras from carriers here in the US. I tested the T-Mobile version and had to spend the first few minutes clearing away all the T-Mobile-branded junk from my home screen. Plus, Samsung has its own suite of apps for email, calendar, etc., on top of all the Google versions of those apps. I'm not a fan of making users juggle two different apps for the same tasks. The software isn't a deal breaker, but compared with the consistency of iOS and its rock-solid ecosystem of apps and updates, it's enough to still give the iPhone a very slight edge over the Note 7. Conclusion Smartphones have gotten to the point where you can get a lot of phone without spending a fortune. As little as $400 gets you a device with a nice camera, a beautiful screen, mobile payments, and even a fingerprint sensor. So if you're going to spend twice as much, you had better be getting your money's worth. The Note 7 is one of the few premium phones available that justifies its high cost. Here's the real kicker: Even though the Note 7 comes with 64 gigabytes of storage, Samsung will give you the option to get a free 256 GB memory card when you buy the phone. That's an insane value. No other phone this good gives you that much storage at this price. (You also have the option to get a free Gear Fit fitness tracker, but I wouldn't recommend it. Storage is much more important than a gadget you're likely to get bored of after a few days.) Overall, the Note 7's biggest weakness is its software. It's not great, but it's good enough. Aside from that, when it comes to hardware and design, Samsung has cemented its position as the leader in the smartphone world. The Note 7 is the best phone the company has ever made and one of the first you should consider buying.

Cook has confirmed the move to Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, one of China’s most senior officials, Reuters reports this morning. “The pledge comes after the head of China’s industry and technology regulator in May told Cook he hoped Apple could deepen its cooperation with the country in research and development and stressed information security,” writes Reuters. The investment marks Apple’s first Asia-Pacific research and development center in China. The CEO did not say where in the country the forthcoming R&D center will be located. According to the report, Apple manufacturer Foxconn’s CEO and Chairman Terry Gou was present at the meeting, too. Cook also met with a Chinese designer and posted the image seen above on Chinese social network Sina Weibo. “Nihao, Beijing! It’s great to be back. Started my trip today by visiting with the incomparable Guo Pei,” Cook wrote on Weibo. “Thrilled to see how her team is using iPad Pro as Guo Pei designs her new collection.” Earlier in the year, Apple invested a cool $1 billion in the country’s ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing which may have helped Didi buy a stake in rival Uber China. This marks Cook’s second trip to China in four months.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Biz Break: Tim Cook looks back and ahead after five years as Apple’s CEO By Rex Crum / August 15, 2016 at 6:41 PM Top Of The Order:   Five Years On: Give someone five years of doing something and they will likely take some time to look back on what they have done. It’s a natural milestone in time to do so. As such, it should come as no surprise that Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook would mark his upcoming five-year anniversary at the helm of what is (probably) the most iconic and (maybe next to Coca-Cola and McDonald’s) most well-known company in the world. Cook inherited the Apple mantle, and mystique, on Aug. 24,  2011 when Steve Jobs stepped down due to ongoing illness, and it is safe to say that no other corporate leader in history followed a predecessor who so totally, and completely, embodied his company, and the industries he shaped, like Cook did when he succeeded Jobs. Under Cook, Apple has continued to flourish, and is the world’s most-valuable company. And even facing slowing sales of its most-popular product, the iPhone, Apple still records as much in sales in one quarter as some of the biggest companies in the world combined. Even faced with its challenges, Apple remains in a place that nearly any other company would envy. And sitting at the top of that Apple is Cook, an operations guy by trade. He looked back at his first five years as Apple’s boss of bosses, and forward at where Apple could go, in an extensive interview with the Washington Post. Yeah, it says its sometimes “lonely” doing what he does, but that he’s “not looking for any sympathy,” either. Done deal, Tim. As long as Apple’s selling more than $40 billion worth of stuff every quarter, you won’t get any sympathy here. Middle Innings: Say It With…: Well, for now, you can say it with Pepsi. If what you’re talking about is expressing your feelings in a tweeted photo. Starting today, Twitter rolled out what it calls “promoted stickers” for various brands, and Pepsi was the first to get in on the deal. You might recall that in late July, Twitter introduced these “stickers”, similar to some emojis, that people could use to decorate photos they tweet out. Only, these new “promoted stickers” are promoteable for a reason. When someone uses one of these sticker, it generates a hashtag that gets posted within the tweet. In Pepsi’s case, that’s #SayItWithPepsi. This makes it so Pepsi can discover the tweet and, possibly market its products toward the aforementioned tweeter in some new, and maybe as yet unknown, tweetable way. And for Twitter, the company makes some money off of its “promoted sticker” deals, something that has to help as the company faces stalling user growth, and slow revenue gains. Maybe it can run its own promoted stickers that tout the company’s upcoming Thursday Night Football streaming deal with the NFL? Bottom Of The Lineup: Here’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did on Monday… Movin’ On Up: Gains came from GoPro, InvenSense, Lending Club, Twitter and Impax Laboratories. In The Red: Decliners included Salesforce.com, Yelp, Netflix, Medivation and Facebook. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.6 percent to 5,262. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3 percent to end the day at 18,636. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent to close at 2,190 Quote Of The Day: “When I got to 50 meters, I knew I was going to catch him.” — Usain Bolt, who came from behind to catch American Justin Gatlin and win the gold medal in the 100-meter sprint at the Olympics Sunday.

If Apple had great products, then he can focus on social issues on the side, but without Jobs, Cook is lost and the Apple ship has been drifting. Apple Watch?

Skype, truly the pioneer in video calling, has become a household name for us. Especially for those who have family staying abroad. A number of others came with their own rendition of what an ideal video calling app should be like. Apple came up with Facetime that allowed Apple users connect with each other through video via WiFi or cellular networks. Google too, came out with Hangout but they were still lacking a simple, mobile-only video messaging app until now. Welcome, Duo.  Google What is it? To put it in the simplest way possible, Google Duo is a 1-to-1 video calling app only available for Android and iOS. Keeping the UI (user interface) as clean as possible, Google takes pride in claiming that Duo takes the complexity out of video calling, keeping it as basic as possible.  Google How does it work? Launching today and being rolled out in app stores worldwide over the next few day, Duo is pretty basic to set-up and use. When a user signs up, the app checks your phone number from the SIM and sends you confirmation text. That's it. Done. You would now be able to reach everyone on your phone's contact list. No separate account required, no remembering password nonsense either. Its simple interface might be exactly what attracts people. In fact, the app itself is a very simple and basic one that's meant to carry out one function, and do it well. You cannot use it for anything apart from your phone. You cannot make conference calls, or make funny Snapchat like faces.  Google It also claims to solve a major issue we face regularly. No matter how advanced a video app is, one problem that's been constant, even in the most sophisticated of apps, is the issue of choppy video and call drops. The apps aren't to be blamed here. Our local internet and cellular connections are generally so bad that call drops and lags are something we have learnt to live with over the years and this is exactly what Duo promises to tackle. According to Google, Duo is built to be fast and reliable which makes sure the video works well even on slower networks like Indias. Even when the network connection is patchy, Duo reduces call resolution making sure the call goes on smoothly. It also switches from your cellular to WiFi seamlessly without automatically dropping your call. Claims that can be verified in India only after its official launch.  Google Knock Knock Knock Knock is a standout feature of the app. In order to make video calls less of an intrusion and more of an invitation, Knock Knock lets Duo users see a live video of the caller even before you answer their call. Just to give you a sense of what they are up to or why they are calling.

Frankel, The Washington Post, 16 August 2016 Share on FacebookTweetShareShareEmailReddit Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he developed his "moral sense" growing up in rural Alabama in the '60s and '70s - a period of incredible social upheaval. Today, at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., Cook keeps in his office photos of two men who pushed the South to change: Robert F. Kennedy and Martin L. King Jr. In recent years, Cook appears to have been inspired by Kennedy and King as he pushed for the South to change again, this time on the issue of gay rights. Cook, who publicly acknowledged he was gay two years ago, has advocated for changing laws in states such as Alabama, where employees can be fired for being gay. He also has criticized states with "religious freedom" laws that seemed designed to sanction some forms of discrimination. The line connecting Cook's youth with his current stance on gay rights seems obvious - especially to some of the people who know Cook. Yet Cook dismisses the idea that his upbringing influenced his views on privacy, which grabbed headlines earlier this year when Apple refused to help the FBI crack the passcode-locked iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino terrorists.In an exclusive interview with The Post's Jena McGregor, Cook insisted there were other sources for his views on privacy: McGregor: You've talked about privacy being part of Apple's values. How personal is it for you? You're known as a very private person. You grew up gay in a red state. Did those early years have an impact on how you lead Apple and on your public stances about privacy? Cook: "Undoubtedly, your childhood and your upbringing is a constant across your life in terms of the things you learn and your point of view. "But in terms of privacy, I wouldn't link the two. There's a broader thing in play. Privacy, in my point of view, is a civil liberty that our Founding Fathers thought of a long time ago, and concluded it was an essential part of what it was to be an American. Sort of on the level, if you will, with freedom of speech, freedom of the press. The other thing is how all this data sits out there in different places. I do worry about people not really understanding deeply about what kinds of things are out there about them. So it's really both of those - not really the growing up in the South." Apple's stance on privacy did not begin with Cook. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was an ardent believer in the need for his company's products to be private and safe. But Cook, since taking over as CEO in 2011, has made an especially forceful case about the need for privacy. And since the dispute with the FBI over the unlocking of a killer's smartphone, Cook has pushed the fight in interviews and speeches, not content to allow Apple's attorneys and spokesmen to handle the message. Perhaps Cook really doesn't believe that growing up gay in the small town Deep South affected his current views. Maybe he's worried that acknowledging the personal connection will cheapen the privacy message. But under Cook, Apple no longer talks about privacy as some bonus feature of its devices. Privacy is elevated to something more intrinsic, more personal: A right. © 2016 The Washington Post Tags: Apple, Apple vs FBI, Encryption, Mobiles, Steve Jobs, Tim Cook LeEco, Coolpad Launch Cool1 Dual With Dual Rear Cameras, 4060mAh Battery Instagram Stories Gets Slide to Zoom Feature The Privacy Debate Is Personal to Tim Cook     Advertisement   In Mobiles and Tablets Latest Ziox Mobiles Zelfie Intex Aqua E4 HTC Desire 650 Panasonic Eluga Mark 2 HTC 10 evo Ziox Mobiles Astra Prism Ziox Mobiles Astra Zing+ Huawei Mate 9 Lite Vivo Xplay6 Vivo X9 Plus Vivo X9 Lyf Wind 7i OnePlus 3T Gionee S9 Vivo V5 Huawei Mate 9 Pro HTC Bolt Hyve Pryme Panasonic P71 Zopo Color F2 Popular iPhone 7 Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Motorola Moto Z Moto Z Play Lenovo K5 Note Xiaomi Redmi 3s HTC 10 OnePlus 3 Moto G4 Xiaomi Mi5 Galaxy J7 2016 Redmi Note 3 iPhone SE Sony Xperia Z5 Micromax phones Samsung phones Android Phones Smartphones Google Phones From Gadgets 360 Shop » Yu Yureka Plus In Mobiles Buy Now Rs. 12,500Rs. 6,389 Celkon Millennia Q599 Ufe...

Buffett's company adds to stakes in Apple and Phillips 66 By Associated Press • Aug 16, 2016 TweetShareGoogle+Email OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Warren Buffett's company is taking an even bigger bite of Apple stock and adding to its sizeable stake in Phillips 66. Berkshire Hathaway filed an update with regulators Monday on its roughly $130 billion U.S. stock portfolio. Berkshire said it held 15.2 million Apple shares at the end of June, up from the 9.8 million share stake it first disclosed in the spring. The Apple investment raises eyebrows because Buffett has always been reluctant to invest in technology companies, but it may have been the work of one of Berkshire's two other investment managers. Berkshire now owns 78.8 million shares in oil refiner Phillips 66, up from 75.6 million. It also cut its Wal-Mart investment to 40.2 million shares at the end of June from 55.2 million shares in March. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In light of this, TIME has rescinded our recommendation of the Note 7. Below is our original review, written before the issues came to light. The good: Premium design, long battery life, great camera, helpful stylus The bad: Bloatware, Edge panel doesn’t add much to the experience Who should buy: Those seeking a larger-sized Android phone, especially for productivity After a quick tap, the tiny red light began to gleam. This signal indicated that the device was scanning my irises to make sure I was authorized for access. This isn’t an excerpt from a science fiction novel — it’s how I’ve been unlocking my phone over the past week. An iris scanner is among the standout features on Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7, the latest device in the South Korean company’s series of large-screened, stylus-toting Android smartphones. The Note 7, which launches on August 19, is a modest but welcome improvement over its predecessor, offering a more ergonomic design, an enhanced stylus, the same camera as its Galaxy S7 cousin, and some software tweaks. It costs around $30 per month, or more than $800 without a payment plan, depending on the carrier. The Note 7’s launch comes just weeks before Apple is expected to unveil its much-rumored iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the latter of which is a direct competitor to Samsung’s Note lineup. Samsung and Apple are the top two smartphone vendors in the world, but their approaches are wildly different. The Note 7, in some ways, is everything the iPhone isn’t: it’s water-resistant, there’s a stylus, it can scan your eyeballs, it comes with three times as much storage by default with the ability to add more, and it charges wirelessly. But the phone’s software is also much more convoluted than that of the iPhone — unlike Apple’s smartphone, it comes with promotional apps from your carrier. I’ve spent the past several days using the Galaxy Note 7 for all of my daily tasks instead of my usual iPhone. Here’s a closer look at what that’s been like. Hardware Samsung’s smartphones have become nearly indistinguishable from one another since the Galaxy S6 was released in the spring of 2015. Like last year’s Note 5 (Samsung skipped the 6), the Note 7 is made of glass and metal, with its S Pen stylus neatly tucked away in a port at the bottom of the phone. This year’s model looks mostly similar to last year’s, albeit with a slimmer overall profile. This is a nice change, making it easier to hold in one hand. The phone is also water-resistant, dust-proof, and packs Samsung’s fast-charging technology. Samsung offers two ways to unlock the Note 7 without typing in a passcode: holding your thumb on the home button’s fingerprint sensor, or gazing at the iris scanner above the screen. I found the fingerprint sensor to be slightly faster (because you need to swipe the lock screen to activate the iris scanner), but the iris scanner was more reliable (and more futuristic). The fingerprint scanner would sometimes fail to recognize my thumb, but the iris scanner worked almost every time, whether I was wearing contacts or glasses. The only time I found it difficult to use was when I was outside squinting in bright daylight. The iris scanner is also helpful for instances when your finger is wet, which makes it difficult or impossible for the sensor to read your print. This is an issue I encounter with my iPhone’s fingerprint scanner fairly often. The Note 7’s iris scanner and fingerprint sensor can also be used to access files and apps stored in the phone’s Secure Folder, a separate hub for private content. The Note 7’s 64GB of storage, along with its SD card slot, will satisfy those who store lots of photos and videos on their phone. The iPhone is available in 16GB, 64GB, and 128GB varieties, but it doesn’t have a port to add more storage. That means iPhone owners who want more storage space need a new phone, or they need to store more content in the cloud. This also means the starting price is more expensive than the entry level versions of the iPhone (16GB) and Galaxy S7 (32GB). The Note 7’s larger screen also makes it more expensive than the Galaxy S7. Samsung’s new smartphone lasted more than a full day on a single charge, which is great for those who often find themselves searching for outlets. After nearly 24 hours, the phone still had about 40% battery remaining. Battery life will vary depending on what you use your phone for, how often you receive notifications, and whether or not features like Bluetooth and your phone’s mobile hotspot are turned on. I used the Note 7 for basic everyday needs like reading email, checking social media, playing casual games, streaming Netflix, and doing a little bit of work in Google Drive. The Note 7 includes the same gorgeous 2,560×1,440 AMOLED screen as its predecessor, making it a great choice for those who often use their phone for watching movies. It also has the same 12-megapixel camera as the Galaxy S7, which captures rich, vibrant shots. When comparing the Note 7’s camera against that of the iPhone 6s Plus, I noticed the Samsung produced bolder, more vivid colors in some circumstances. The iPhone, meanwhile, captured colors more as they appeared in real life. See for yourself in the images below. Notice how the sky and water in the photo taken on the Note 7 look bluer and brighter, while the water in the iPhone’s photo looks a bit more green. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Lisa Eadicicco iPhone 6s Plus     Lisa Eadicicco Software With the Note 7, Samsung has made a clear effort to simplify its software. Yes, there’s still a widget advertising Samsung’s services and a handful of apps from my carrier (T-Mobile) that I’ll probably never use. And yes, the phone still comes with two separate apps for email and Web browsing and two app stores, since the Note 7 includes both Samsung and Google’s stock apps. Even so, Samsung deserves credit for the subtle improvements it’s made to the Note 7’s software. The Settings menu, for instance, has been condensed and streamlined for easier navigation. Samsung’s note-taking apps have been combined into one app, Samsung Notes, to avoid confusion and clutter. And some of the features Samsung adds to Android are actually helpful, especially when it comes to the Note and its S Pen stylus. Ejecting the S Pen from its holster launches a fan-like menu with a selection of stylus-optimized apps, like Samsung Notes, Screen Write (snap a screenshot and annotate it), Smart Select (capture a GIF of a video on screen using the stylus), and Translate (translate text in a foreign language). This feature makes the S Pen more useful — the stylus experience wouldn’t feel as effective without it. That said, the Note 7’s interface still isn’t as simple as I’d like it to be. In terms of software, I prefer plain, stripped-down versions of Android, like those found on Google’s Nexus phones and the OnePlus 3. While I enjoy the capabilities Samsung has added for the S Pen, there are some add-ons I could live without, such as the Edge panel. This strip, which is accessible by swiping in from the right of the screen, includes shortcuts to your favorite apps, contacts, and tasks. But since Android users can pin widgets and apps to their home screen, the Edge panel is superfluous. It doesn’t make any tasks faster or more convenient for me, and I’ve accidentally launched it when trying to navigate between home screens. The Note 7 has also adopted the Galaxy S7’s always-on display, meaning you can see information like the time, date, and your phone’s battery level even when the phone is idle. It’s handy to see this data without waking your phone, but sometimes I forgot that I need to press a button to fully activate the phone, since it feels like it’s already on. You can also pin notes written with the S Pen to the Note 7’s lock screen, which can be helpful for keeping reminders and to-do lists easily reachable. The headline features that Samsung introduced on previous Note devices, like the ability to view apps in split-screen view, are also present on the Note 7. Conclusion Samsung has long tried to make its smartphones stand out by giving them unconventional capabilities. With the Note 7, Samsung has maintained this willingness to experiment, while also learning from past criticisms. The Note 7’s gorgeous glass build, improved S Pen, reliable camera, long battery life and water resistance make it one of the best Android phones available. It’s not perfect; — the software could be cleaner and easier to use. But Samsung is making it increasingly difficult to remain a full-time Apple user. We’ll soon see what Cupertino has up its sleeves. 4.5 out of 5 stars Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Demand for Apple's phones has plummeted in China, and the government maintains a wary attitude towards foreign technology. This is at least the CEO's second trip to the country in four months. Apple's new research and development centre will be built by the end of the year, Cook told Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, one of China's most senior officials, according to the official Chinese state broadcaster. The pledge comes after the head of China's industry and technology regulator in May told Cook he hoped Apple could deepen its cooperation with the country in research and development and stressed information security. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sales in Greater China, once touted as Apple's next growth engine, decreased by a third in its most recent quarterly results, after having more than doubled a year earlier. Not only is a slowdown of the world's second-largest economy stoking concerns, but the company's stores for books and movies also went dark in China earlier this year. Apple has also lost intellectual property battles and faced anti-U.S. sentiment from consumers. Before Cook's charm offensive in Beijing in May, Apple announced a $1 billion deal with ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing, a move many experts saw as an attempt to curry favour with Beijing. Other tech firms have in the past pledged investment in China while facing difficulties in the country, including Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc, but often with mixed results.

The telecoms giant’s “Tap & Go” prepaid service on Tuesday started its support of Apple Pay, roughly a week after HKT group managing director Alexander Arena confirmed the company’s deal with Apple. “The whole mobile payments market is still in its very early days. Not every smartphone has near-field communications (NFC) built into it,” Arena told a press conference last week. Apple Pay uses NFC technology built into iPhones and the Apple Watch to allow for contactless payment in stores, which have the sales terminals to support the service. It can also be used to pay for purchases made within mobile apps on the iPhone and iPad. The mobile payment system was launched last month in Hong Kong, the third major market in Asia to roll out the service this year after mainland China and Singapore, to eligible cardholders of American Express, Visa and MasterCard. “You’ll see NFC being progressively extended to all smartphones, and consumers will be encouraged to use their phone as a wallet,” Arena said. Tap & Go, initially introduced by HKT in July last year to subscribers using Android smartphones, is expected to receive a boost as its large base of subscribers with iPhones now have Apple Pay support.   HKT group managing director Alexander Arena “I don’t think anybody has the market share numbers for Tap & Go yet, but these are very exciting times,” Arena said. HKT had a total of 4.445 million mobile subscribers by the end of June under its premium “1010”, mainstream “CSL” and low-cost “Sun Mobile” brands. Its subscribers open the Wallet app on their iPhones, tap the plus sign and follow the onscreen instructions to add Tap & Go and activate Apple Pay. From Tuesday until the end of this month, HKT is offering a HK$50 rebate promotion to use Tap & Go for Apple Pay transactions. The service enables HKT mobile subscribers to make payments at more than three million MasterCard PayPass readers in stores around the world. There are an estimated 10,000 merchant locations in Hong Kong that accept Apple Pay, and more than 10 million in all nine major markets where the service has launched so far. According to Apple, the Bank of East Asia also started supporting Apple Pay from Tuesday. The initial batch of Apple Pay participating banks in Hong Kong — American Express, Standard Chartered, DBS, Hang Seng Bank, HSBC and BOC Credit Card, a subsidiary of Bank of China (Hong Kong) — cover an estimated 70 per cent of cardholders in the city, according to Apple. Hong Kong has been behind other markets, especially mainland China, in adopting mobile payment services, despite recent campaigns from wireless network operators HKT and SmarTone Telecommunications. Consumers in Hong Kong are used to more familiar payment options, such as Octopus cards. Many merchants are also wary of making new investments in contactless point-of-sale terminals. Banks and other financial services providers, however, are looking forward to changes in the market. “We believe Apple Pay and other payment innovations will help reinvigorate and enhance how millions of people spend and pay everyday,” said Ken Chew, the managing director of consumer finance and eBusiness at DBS Bank (Hong Kong). An Apple Pay spokesman added there may be some adjustments to first-time users of Apple Pay in the city. “Users should hold their iPhone or Apple Watch near the reader when using Apple Pay,” the spokesman said. “The transaction will be finished only until when they see the “Done” alert appear on the screen of either their iPhone or Apple Watch.” Apple Pay does not have a specific payment limit in many stores in Hong Kong that support the service. The models with NFC and Touch ID biometric sensor to support Apple Pay include the iPhone SE, iPhone 6 , iPhone 6s, iPhone 6 Plus and the iPhone 6s Plus. Apple Pay, which was launched in October 2014, is also available in the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Switzerland and Australia.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Fleet of driverless Baidu cars takes to the road in Wuzhen 2 More doubts cast over Chinese scientist’s claim of gene editing tool ‘breakthrough’ 3 Tencent’s Joox music streaming service proves a hit across Asia 4 Virtual reality Batman game turns you into the Caped Crusader 5 Chinese astronauts start return journey after nation’s longest space mission Shared 1 Fleet of driverless Baidu cars takes to the road in Wuzhen 2 More doubts cast over Chinese scientist’s claim of gene editing tool ‘breakthrough’ 3 Tencent’s Joox music streaming service proves a hit across Asia 4 Virtual reality Batman game turns you into the Caped Crusader 5 Chinese astronauts start return journey after nation’s longest space mission Commented 1 Hong Kong legal experts split over court’s ruling in oath controversy 2 Chinese government rebukes US over comments on Hong Kong removal of legislators-elect 3 Lawyer who helped draft Basic Law says Beijing interpretation has destroyed ‘one country, two systems’ 4 Motion on teaching of Chinese history at junior secondary level passed in Hong Kong’s Legco 5 Communist Party leadership calls for fairer global governance of internet Promotions Register for a free copy of XXIV 2017 now Register for a free copy of Home Essentials 2017 now       You may also like China Trump expected to welcome Chinese investment in US, despite threatening tough tariffs on country’s products 16 Nov 2016 - 8:43am 5 Dazzling festivals throughout December: Macau’s seasonal delights to light up the city In partnership with Macao Government Tourism Office Game changes in Hong Kong’s Legislative Council after ban of two localist lawmakers 17 Nov 2016 - 11:15am 67 [SCMP Archive] HKIS Dragons going for gold Sponsored by: Hong Kong International School Hong Kong Joseph Lau slams ‘greedy’ ex-girlfriend in video interview, confirms he wrote newspaper statement about breakup 16 Nov 2016 - 9:11pm 11 Hong Kong Dream of owning a home is over for most young Hong Kong people 15 Nov 2016 - 11:29pm 43 Offbeat The ‘mannequin challenge’ is the latest social media craze Nov 17th 2016, 3:37pm China Booming e-businesses amid tight censorship ... can China have it both ways with the internet? 15 Nov 2016 - 11:28pm 6 Hong Kong HK$14m revamp of Hong Kong Star Ferry looks to make waves with sofas, glass roof and diesel-electric generator 15 Nov 2016 - 10:36pm 7 Hong Kong Hong Kong’s foreign domestic helpers to be protected by new rule on window cleaning in early 2017 14 Nov 2016 - 11:50pm 10 China The day Donald Trump took on the Chinese government – and lost 15 Nov 2016 - 12:20am 15 Politics After Trump and Brexit, is Asia next on the anti-establishment hitlist? 14 Nov 2016 - 9:03am 1 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

A 12.9-inch and new 10.5-inch model of the iPad Pro 2 will likely run A10X processors – a step up from the current A9X M9’s. In addition, a more affordable version of the current 9.7-inch Pro model is forecast. This is expected to keep the A9X chip. An analyst close to the supply chain made the predictions in a research report, reports Mac Rumours. The introduction of a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro could be more enticing to firms bidding for contracts in the business and education sectors, the report said.  Alongside this new model, it is believed a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2 will also emerge next year, with both models running A10X processors – a step up from the current A9X M9’s powering thecurrent iPad Pros. In addition to the new iPad Pros, the report predicts a more affordable version of the current 9.7-inch Pro – which launched in April – that would keep the A9X chip.

But a new 'more affordable' version of the 9.7-inch model could be on the cards for 2017, say analysts The introduction of a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro could be more enticing to firms bidding for contracts in the business and education sectors, the report said (stock image of iPad Pro) But bigger changes could be in store for the iPad. According to Apple Insider, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts ‘revolutionary changes’ to the tablet’s design as early as 2018. The next generation of iPads will likely incorporate Active Matrix OLED (AMOLED) screen technology into the next generation of tablets. These iPads will use a flexible display panel will see changes to how users interact with their tablet, and could follow reported plans for the iPhone, which could potentially see an all-glass iPhone in future.  The latest predictions follow in the wake of rumours around the Cupertino firm's plans for the next generation Apple Watch, which could launch later this year. RUMOURED UPDATES TO THE APPLE WATCH  Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently predicted upcoming features and release date for the Apple Watch 2. Rumours indicate the next generation of the smart watch (pictured) will  have increased battery life, more powerful processor and a barometer Thinner watch face - the second generation could be thinner by 40 per cent Better screen resolution - AMOLED screen will be replaced with a Micro-LED display Longer battery life - a higher capacity battery would boost battery life of the wrist tech  Wireless chip - allows for basic communication tasks without the need to be paired to iPhone More on-board storage - next generations are likely to have more data storage  Video camera - this will allow FaceTime video calls rather than just audio New models - new materials could be on the cards, such as titanium, platinum and perhaps even Liquidmetal New band materials - a recent patent application has been filed for a strap that has light fibres woven in, meaning you'll be able to get notifications from your wrist all the way around  Barometer - as well as detecting atmospheric pressure, a smart barometer can be used to detect changes in elevation, so could provide more accurately tracking of running routes  GPS - Better location tracking will mean more accurate route setting    Read more: Apple Planning 10.5" iPad Pro in 2017, 'Revolutionary' OLED iPad as Soon as 2018 - Mac Rumors iPad - Compare Models - Apple (UK) Apple to debut 10.5" iPad Pro in 2017, integrate flexible AMOLED tech in 2018 Share or comment on this article e-mail 13 shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima Tidal surge filmed on Sunaoshi River in Tagajo, Japan 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation Six rebel electors have signed an agreement to try to block...

REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/File Photo LOS ANGELES—Apple CEO Tim Cook's coming out had been in the works for a whole year: Cook told the Washington Post in a wide-ranging interview Monday that he had prepared to come out as gay for about a year before finally taking that step in October of 2014. "Just thinking through what to say, how to say it, where to say it, how to do that in a way that advanced what I was trying to do," he said. Cook explained that his decision to come out was prompted by many notes from kids that he had gotten ever since he had taken over the leadership of Apple. Cook's sexuality had been an open secret for some time, making him a kind of unofficial role model, and giving him some insights into what many gay teenagers were going through. "They were kids who were distraught," he told the Post. "Some had been pushed out by their families. They thought they couldn't achieve anything." By coming out, Cook wanted to signal them that one can be gay and successful, and that it helps to be honest about it. Related Apple Q3 2016 Earnings: iPhone Sales Down, Again Cook's interview with the paper comes at a time of increased scrutiny for Apple. The company has seen two mixed quarters, with iPhone sales declining, and revenue in China becoming a sore spot. Slowing iPhone sales have also prompted questions on whether Apple has any "next big thing" in the works at a time when competitors like Facebook, Google and Amazon openly advance their virtual reality and connected home strategies. Cook didn't comment on any future projects, but said that the iPhone as a product was far from dead. "This is still an unbelievable product category to be in, and not just for this quarter, year or for years," he said. "There is nothing that's going to replace it in the short term or in the intermediate term either." But Apple is clearly going through a transition, with services becoming an ever-larger part of its business. In fact, services revenue surpassed the amount of money Apple makes with selling Macs and Macbooks for the first time earlier this year. Some of this revenue includes subscription fees for Apple Music, and Apple's increased focus on content and services has also led to increased investments into original content. Cook mentioned some of those investments during his interview with the Post, including original music video programming and the company's new show "Planet of the Apps," but also stressed that Apple may be willing to spend more. "We do view that the future of TV is apps," he said. "And if there's a way we can be a catalyst into that happening faster or better, then that would interest us in content."

Joseph Woelfel Aug 16, 2016 6:25 AM EDT Updated from 6:03 a.m. with further details on Home Depot's earnings. If you'd like to receive "5 Things" in your email inbox every morning, please register for TheStreet Alerts and follow me. Here are five things you must know for Tuesday, Aug. 16: 1. -- Apple (AAPL) shares were rising 0.5% in premarket trading Tuesday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) disclosed it raised its stake in the iPhone maker by 55%. Berkshire Hathaway held 15.2 million shares of Apple as of June 30, according to a regulatory filing. Three months earlier, Berkshire Hathaway held 9.8 million shares.  The company's Apple stake was valued at $1.46 billion as of June 30. Berkshire Hathaway also reduced its stake in Walmart (WMT)  to 40.2 million shares in June from 55.2 million in the spring, and added to its sizeable stake in Phillips 66 (PSX) . Apple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells AAPL? Learn more now. 2. -- Morgan Stanley  (MS) became the latest target of activist fund ValueAct Capital Management on Monday, but reports suggested manager Jeff Ubben sees the stake as an investment rather than as a vehicle for change to eke out even more profit.  ValueAct owns 38 million Morgan Stanley shares, worth $1.127 million at Monday's close, or 1.98% of the sixth-largest U.S. bank, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The fund bought the shares on June 30. ValueAct is known for taking tiny stakes and winning board seats to enact change, as it did at Microsoft (MSFT)  two years ago with just 0.8% of the company.  ValueAct said in a letter to investors that it thought the bank was undervalued, according to Bloomberg. The investor also praised Morgan Stanley for focusing on fee-heavy, asset-light businesses such as wealth and investment management while cutting risky lending. The stock rose 1.2% in premarket trading on Tuesday.

It was his heart-rate sensor startup that Apple bought for use in the Watch, and the company then hired him from 2010 to 2013 to work on the project. An interview with Messerschmidt by FastCo provides a fascinating glimpse into the world of developing a new Apple product. Of particular interest is the tension between the engineering and design teams, engineers putting forward the best approach from a technical perspective, designers pushing back where that approach conflicts with their knowledge of trends, fashion and user behaviour … One great example is [when] I went to a meeting and said I’m going to put sensors in the watch but I’m going to put them down here (he points to the underside of the Apple Watch band he’s wearing) because I can get a more accurate reading on the bottom of the wrist than I can get on the top of the wrist. They (the Industrial Design group) said very quickly that “that’s not the design trend; that’s not the fashion trend. We want to have interchangeable bands so we don’t want to have any sensors in the band.” Then at the next meeting I would go “we can do it here (on top of the wrist) but it’s going to have to be kind of a tight band because we want really good contact between the sensors and the skin.” The answer from the design studio would be “No, that’s not how people wear watches; they wear them like really floppy on their wrist.” You might expect engineers to find this a frustrating experience, but Messerschmidt says not. He said that you had to respect input on real-life issues, and treat the constraints as a challenge. That creates a set of requirements that drives you toward new engineering solutions […] Engineers left in a vacuum might say “well, that’s maybe not so important; we can get a better signal by doing it the other way so let’s do it that way.” So, left to their own devices, that would be the way the product would end up. So you have to have a really strong voice supporting the user. I think the idea of focusing on that is uniquely Apple. I’ve long argued that debate about innovation at Apple largely misses the point: Apple has rarely been first to any new technology. Its USP is its ability to watch what other companies do, then figure out a way to do it better. In particular, Apple has never been afraid to wait until a piece of tech is sufficiently mature to deliver a great user experience. Apple did that with the iPhone, said Messerschmidt, and it’s doing it now with VR. If you look at products like the iPhone or the iPad there aren’t too many totally new technologies included in those products. The real elegance and differentiation doesn’t have a lot to do with the technology idea itself; it’s about the packaging and the value add it gives to people. Those big (new technology) ideas generally happen elsewhere, and they happen earlier. Virtual reality is a good example. Why hasn’t Apple jumped into VR? It’s because nobody really knows whether there’s really a “there” there. I don’t. Apple’s interested in products where everybody’s going to get some benefit out of it. Messerschmidt is not, however, uncritical of Apple. The company’s famously secretive approach, for example, has been abused by some. There is really a contingent at Apple that has resorted to the tools of secrecy. Steve Jobs wanted secrecy for very specific reasons. He wanted to be able to make the big splash at the product announcement. And that’s almost as far as it went. There’s definitely a contingent at Apple that wants secrecy because it helps them maintain an empire, in a sense. It helps them create a sense that they’re doing more important things that they really are. He also ends on a rather disappointing note. You may remember that right after he died there was all this stuff about “can Apple go on?” Could anybody have the capacity to do that job (Jobs’s)? All I can say at this point is that the jury is still out, but so far I think the signs are kind of pointing to “No.” It’s definitely not the same place. The full interview is worth reading.

Home Top 50 How To Magazine Franchise Events Subscribe Inspiring Quotes From 10 Visionary Business Leaders Who Changed Everything Getty Images | Mike Windle Kim Lachance Shandrow West Coast editor. Frequently covers celebrities, future tech, social media, startups, gadgets and apps. Elon Musk is doing his damndest to save the human race. Sergey Brin envisions making Google the “third half of your brain.” And Arianna Huffington is on a mission to get people to take care of themselves while taking care of business. Visionary business leaders such as these inspire us to be better and do better. They give us hope for a brighter future. Their successes show us that if we dream big and work hard, we can make a difference and leave our marks along the way. Needless to say, these radical influencers know something about dreaming, doing and making it to the top. To help inspire you, and to fuel your own unique entrepreneurial dreams, here are 10 quotes from business leaders who changed everything:Related: 50 Motivational Quotes From Disruptive, Trailblazing, Inspiring Women Leaders 1 / 10 Getty Images | Bloomberg SpaceX founder, Tesla co-founder "If something is important enough, even if the odds are against you, you should still do it." Rocketing humans to Mars and away from our swirling mess of a planet is a daunting feat, to say the least. But Elon Musk isn’t letting go of his dream of making it happen in his lifetime, despite the many challenging tasks before him. The lesson is simple: Whatever you endeavor to accomplish, out of this world or not, do not allow yourself to be deterred by the odds. Bravely forge ahead.Related: Elon Musk's Hamster Units, and 11 Other Times His Responses Surprised Us 2 / 10 Randy Holmes | Getty Images Oprah Winfrey, Harpo Productions founder "The key to realizing a dream is to focus not on success but on significance -- and then even the small steps and little victories along your path will take on greater meaning." Oprah Winfrey’s remarkable rags-to-riches ascent was nothing less than hard-earned, from her humble beginnings working on her grandmother’s farm in Mississippi, to her glass ceiling-shattering triumph as a billionaire media mogul. Step by step, her achievements added up along her path to success and paid dividends in ways she never imagined. Related: 3 Inspiring Business Lessons From Billionaire Media Mogul Oprah Winfrey 3 / 10 Handout | Getty Images Richard Branson, The Virgin Group founder “The main thing is, if you have an idea for business, as I say, screw it, just do it. Give it a go. You may fall flat on your face, but you pick yourself up and keep trying until you succeed.” Richard Branson is no stranger to wild adventures many of us can only imagine, but he’s no stranger to epic failure either. Not all of the businesses he’s launched skyrocketed to success. Take, for example, Virgin Cola and Virgin Brides. Even he admits they “fell flat on their face.” Still, for all of his failed businesses, the bawdy billionaire mogul has launched some 200 more that struck entrepreneurial gold. If he didn’t “screw it, just do it” in the face of failure, where might he be today? Related: 10 Inspirational Quotes From Top Entrepreneurial Leaders 4 / 10 David Livingston | Getty Images Arianna Huffington, Huffington Post founder “Fearlessness is not the absence of fear. It's the mastery of fear. It's about getting up one more time than we fall down.” Arianna Huffington got up after falling down and waking up to a pool of blood gushing from her head. When she came to, everything changed for her. She faced her fear that she couldn’t “do it all” and soon became a champion for caring for yourself while caring for your business. The Greek-American media mogul began espousing the virtues many of us abandon as we battle to succeed in business and in life -- sleep and self-preservation. Clocking at least eight restful hours of sleep a night, she says, leads to a “more productive, more inspired, more joyful life,” thus making it easier to rebound from stumbling and falling on your quest for success.Related: 10 Quotes from the Fearless Arianna Huffington 5 / 10 Justin Sullivan | Getty Images Steve Jobs, Apple co-founder "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it." The late legendary tech entrepreneur Steve Jobs was known to be a passionate, yet persnickety leader. Many say he knew he was a genius and didn’t shy away from letting others know, too. Long before he helmed what is now perhaps the most famous technology corporation in the world, he was like so many other dreamers -- aimless, searching for his life’s purpose. After dropping out of Reed College, the Palo Alto, Calif., native trekked across India, looking for the meaning of life. Instead of wasting his life “living someone else’s,” he eventually listened to his “inner voice.” He followed his heart and dove into the budding personal computer business with his good friend Steve Wozniak. And the rest, as they say, is history. Related: As Steve Jobs Once Said, 'People With Passion Can Change The World' 6 / 10 Jennifer Pottheiser | Getty Images Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo CEO "Just because you are CEO, don't think you have landed. You must continually increase your learning, the way you think, and the way you approach the organization. I've never forgotten that." Indra Nooyi appreciates the value of staying humble, even after you’ve made it to the top. She puts on no pretenses about “having it all,” despite her ascent to the lead position at one of the world’s top-grossing food and beverage companies. Related: Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi: 'I Don't Think Women Can Have It All' 7 / 10 Drew Angerer | Getty Images Tim Cook, Apple CEO “There are times in all of our lives when a reliance on gut or intuition just seems more appropriate -- when a particular course of action just feels right. And, interestingly, I've discovered it's in facing life's most important decisions that intuition seems the most indispensable to getting it right.” Echoing his late manager and mentor Steve Jobs, Tim Cook also extols the virtues of listening to your intuition in business and in life. The veteran engineer blended both worlds when he publicly came out as gay two years ago. He also said heeding his intuition led him to leave Compaq for Apple in 1998, at a time when the latter company was struggling. He listened to his gut and went for it, despite close friends who advised him not to take the job. We’d say going against the naysayers worked out pretty well for him, wouldn’t you? Related: Who the CEO of Apple Turns to When He Needs Advice 8 / 10 Allison Shelley | Getty images Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook COO “Leadership is not bullying and leadership is not aggression. Leadership is the expectation that you can use your voice for good. That you can make the world a better place.” From her days championing leaning in to ultimately being forced to rethink leaning in, Sheryl Sandberg bravely embodies resilience, a trait all entrepreneurs should strive to exhibit. In the wake of the sudden death of her husband, and in doing her part to “make the world a better place,” the former Googler has repeatedly stressed the importance of leaning on positive psychology in the face of adversity, self-doubt and criticism. When it comes to leading others, Sandberg is known to embrace the concept of radical candor. The idea is to boldly speak up and tell your colleagues and employees what you really think about their performance. The key is to be firm and clear, but never condescending. The ultimate goal is to help them do a better job, and to do better by the company. Think of that the next time your boss shares some strong feedback with you, instead of interpreting it as a personal attack. He or she is likely just trying to give you a leg up so you can be your best. Related: Here's How You Can Embody the Strength and Leadership of Sheryl Sandberg 9 / 10 Bloomberg | Getty Images Sergey Brin, Google co-founder "We have tried to define precisely what it means to be a force for good -- always do the right, ethical thing. Ultimately, ‘Don’t be evil’ seems the easiest way to summarize it." Brin wasn't kidding when he said that. At the time, Google’s corporate "code of conduct" mantra really was “Don’t be evil.” (With the onset of Alphabet, which took over Google's holding company as of October, it has now morphed into: “Employees of Alphabet and its subsidiaries and controlled affiliates should do the right thing -- follow the law, act honorably, and treat each other with respect.” From his and Larry Page’s brainchild’s humble beginnings as “BackRub,” to the can’t-live-without tool and verb that it’s mushroomed into today, Brin has continually extolled the virtues of running a company with social good as a guiding principle. While his company tries to render humans immortal -- and remove them from the driver’s seat -- the billionaire hasn’t lost sight of being a “force for good.” His philanthropic donations number in the millions, benefitting a wide variety of causes. Among them are education, healthcare, the environment, human rights and women’s issues.  Related: 11 Things You Might Not Know About Google 10 / 10 Mark Sagliocco | Getty Images Martha Stewart, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia founder “Getting over those unexpected hurdles may not be exactly enjoyable, but ultimately I believe that such challenges and the solutions we find give us more confidence. They teach us with common sense and determination we can turn what looks like a disaster into a triumph.” Life wasn’t all perfectly arranged “Dainty Bess” roses and meticulous place settings for Martha Stewart. You may recall that the multi-millionaire design diva went from domestic bliss to federal prisoner in 2004 after being convicted on charges stemming from lying about a stock sale. She served five months in federal prison and five months on house arrest. Talk about unexpected hurdles. Upon her conviction, she invoked the defiance of The Terminator, vowing, “I’ll be back.” And back she steadily has been ever since she walked free. She came back stronger, more confident and determined to succeed harder than before. Next up, you can catch the “Queen of All Internet” as the other half of an unlikely duo: She’s teaming up with Snoop Dogg to bake munchies on a new VH1 cooking show.Related: Martha Stewart: America Needs More Entrepreneurs Inspiring Quotes From 10 Visionary Business Leaders Who Changed Everything Up Next...

Media Creation | 13 Aug 2016 | Print  | Comment (5) Writing App Ulysses Blends Power and Simplicity by Julio Ojeda-Zapata As a writer with a tech bent, I’ve long been obsessed with writing apps – which I define as software I would use to compose articles like this one, along with blog posts and other kinds of prose. The sheer number and variety of writing apps for Apple users can be vertigo-inducing, and I’ve tried my share. These apps range from the complex (such as Microsoft Word and Literature & Latte’s Scrivener) to the minimalist (like Byword and iA Writer). Some writing apps stick to a middle ground. Apple’s Pages and Google Docs are feature-rich, each in their own way, but not to the point of absurdity like the insanely complicated Word. Then there’s Ulysses, a Mac and iOS writing app that also attempts to strike a balance between simplicity and raw power – but in a way that is a departure from the familiar. The apps’ publisher, a German outfit called the Soulmen, updated the Mac version in March 2016 – and snagged an Apple Design Award for it during WWDC 2016. The iPad version received an update that added iPhone support. Both Ulysses apps last week underwent another, smaller upgrade to add a handful of additional features – such as blog publishing. I’ll focus on the Mac version here but dip into aspects of the iOS app that are important. What It Is… and Is Not -- Before I go further, I should make crystal-clear what Ulysses is – and isn’t – in general terms. Ulysses is not like Word or Pages, which blend word processing with desktop publishing to fashion complex documents that incorporate intricate layouts with all manner of imagery and typography. It’s also unlike Scrivener, which bristles with organizing features for long-form writers, such as novelists who wrestle with plot outlines, character lists, and story arcs. And it doesn’t have collaborative editing capabilities like Google Docs. At its core, Ulysses focuses on plain text. In this regard, it’s more like those minimal apps I mentioned. They typically support Markdown, a plain-text markup language used for composing and converting to HTML and other formats. Ulysses also is Markdown-centric, with users applying the syntax by default. But Ulysses is more ambitious than other Markdown editors in its organizational capabilities, and it adds features (like image embedding) that simpler writing apps leave out. Ulysses users don’t have to be obsessed with Markdown. I’ve yet to fathom why the language is so popular among a certain species of Apple user, but I appreciate Ulysses all the same (I wrote this article in it). I like minimalism, but at the same time, I’m a control freak about keeping things organized meticulously, and Ulysses scratches both itches nicely. Interface Overview — As a sometime user of Byword, a popular Markdown app that is aggressively minimalist, I found Ulysses a bit daunting at first. However, its more complex interface design is easy to grasp after a while. It takes a three-column approach with a composing area on the right, an organizing sidebar or “library” on the left, and a document or “sheet” listing in the middle. Sheets are organized into groups, which appear in the library. The sheet for this story is in a TidBITS group, for instance. Groups include subgroup support with a familiar nesting behavior. Although groups map conceptually to folders and sheets to files, Ulysses departs from other plain-text editors in that you cannot readily locate its content outside the app. It’s a single-library app, and all your content lives inside, much like Apple’s Notes and Photos apps. There is an exception to this rule: Ulysses also supports “external folders,” meaning you can point the app at a Mac folder to access and modify text files therein. It’s an imperfect option, however, because some Ulysses features (such as image embedding) don’t work in externally loaded files. Time to Write — Composing in Ulysses is straightforward. Again, you don’t need to be a Markdown ninja because formatting is mostly automated. Highlight a word, press Command-B, and you will boldface that text — but it shows up as Markdown with two asterisks on either side. To further guide you, formatting commands also appear in a Markup pop-up menu and in a popover window that you park off to one side of your screen for reference. If, like me, you’re not a devotee of Markdown, you’ll have to make your peace with how weird Markdown appears (there is no rich-text composing option, as in Byword). Ulysses masks some of this complexity with colored shapes or “text objects” denoting Web addresses, image embeds, footnotes, and annotations in place of markup syntax. Ulysses actually uses an in-house Markdown variant it calls Markdown XL, with departures from the vanilla Markdown originally created by John Gruber of Daring Fireball fame. The differences aren’t hard to grasp, but you can switch to regular Markdown if you desire. Ulysses adds useful tricks, such as the aforementioned image embedding. Drag a picture into the document and it’s shown as an IMG tag, but double-click it and the image appears. This feature isn’t available with documents that reside in an external folder, as noted. Sync and Export — Ulysses content fits into three buckets, each shown in the library. One of these is an iCloud repository, which syncs content among a user’s Macs and iOS devices. Most users would likely embrace this approach by default, but there is also an On My Mac option with content that resides only on the Mac and doesn’t sync anywhere else. A third option, the previously mentioned External Folders bucket, has taken on greater importance with a recent update to Ulysses for iOS. That version now supports Dropbox syncing, which brings it in line with other iOS writing apps. For those using both the iOS and Mac versions of Ulysses, this means that you can anoint a Dropbox folder as a primary content repository that is available from any device. Stashing a document in Dropbox also enables a simple collaboration scenario if two or more Ulysses users want to work on a document in a shared folder. Regardless of where a sheet lives while in progress, you can export it in multiple ways. Format choices include plain text, HTML, EPUB, PDF, and Word’s DOCX. Those who are particular about how the output is formatted, what fonts are included, and so on can even specify a number of style parameters upon exporting a document. If you’re writing a book or other complex document and you need to consolidate content that has lived across more than one sheet, you can export multiple sheets at a time. Ulysses export also includes a publishing option for bloggers. Users have been able to post content to Medium for some time, and recent upgrades added WordPress (PDF link) as a second posting destination. The Soulmen implemented this feature in a sophisticated manner, supporting both WordPress.com and self-hosted WordPress blogs. It includes HTML and Markdown as export choices, along with options to set categories, excerpts, tags, format styles, featured images, and posting times. I can’t overstate how cool this is for WordPress users. I’ve been able to publish flawlessly to my personal blog, with even embedded pictures posting impeccably. I have also used Byword and WordPress’s Mac app for updating my blog, but Ulysses is shaping up to be my favorite WordPress client. Other Features — Ulysses is a deep application, and you’ll be rewarded for poking around in its nooks and crannies. Features I found notable in the Mac app include: Typewriter mode: You can focus on a line, sentence or paragraph while causing everything else to gray out. There’s a “mark current line” option for even greater focus courtesy of a grayish strip, along with a “fixed scrolling” option that locks the cursor at the middle, top or bottom of the screen. The iOS version of Ulysses includes typewriter mode too. A separate focus feature called “minimal mode” makes the toolbar fade out when you’re writing. You can even hide the library sidebar and the sheet list if you want to focus solely on the composing window. Go dark: “Dark mode” turns all interface elements surrounding a sheet black with white text, while a “dark theme” darkens the sheet too. These features have also just been added to the iOS version. Attachments: This is a somewhat confusing term for a grab bag of document add-ons that all reside in an optional right-hand sidebar (made visible with the click of a paper-clip button in the main toolbar). Such add-ons include PDFs and images, which can be kept in that channel for reference (this is different from embedding images in the document). Also in that sidebar: a tags field, a notes field, and a “goal” console to set and monitor a typing target to be measured in characters, words, lines, paragraphs and the like. Filters: If you want to slice and dice what you see in the library sidebar, you can use filters much like smart playlists in iTunes to control what you see based on a variety of search criteria. Editing markup: The Soulmen calls Ulysses composing “plain text enhanced,” which includes commenting, text highlights, and text strikeouts. These features can be preserved – or not – when exporting to PDF and other formats. Popovers: The Markdown cheat sheet I referred to earlier isn’t the only interface element that you can set off to the side of a display for reference. Just about any pop-up menu – including export options, attachments, or a dashboard showing a word count and other stats – can be torn off into a popover. Backup Apple’s iCloud syncing has been problematic enough over its history that Ulysses’s dependence on it might make some users nervous. The Soulmen provides peace of mind, though, with a built-in backup system that bears a resemblance to Time Machine, and works in much the same way. A related feature allows you to skim through past versions of a document. Favorites and bookmarks: Instead of searching for a frequently used sheet, you can add it to your Favorites collection, which appears near the top of the library sidebar. To use bookmarks, enable Ulysses’ paragraph-numbering feature. Then, bookmark paragraphs by double-clicking their numbers. Once that is done, the bookmarked paragraphs are available from a pop-up menu that you can tear off to become a floating popover window. Wrap-Up -- Ulysses fills a key niche as a personal writing app that packs a punch but doesn’t suffer from feature overload. It has particular appeal for writers who continually move among Macs and iOS devices and want to have a consistent work environment and no significant compromises on the iOS side. For Markdown fans, Ulysses represents an upgrade from simple text editors while not going as far as a full-fledged word processor with a more sophisticated handling of styles and graphics. Even if Ulysses isn’t necessarily the ultimate Markdown editor for all (everyone has a favorite), it’s worth a look. I’ve come to love Ulysses and lament that my particular circumstances keep me from using it as my default writing environment. I use Windows PCs regularly, and there is no Windows version of Ulysses (unlike Scrivener). What’s more, Google Docs is central to my work at my day-job employer and in my freelance duties, thanks to its greater collaborative capabilities. If it were solely up to me how I put words on a screen, however, Ulysses would likely be my writing app of choice.   Smile makes tools so you can have a productive day.

Alan Ralph  2016-08-14 05:38 I've used both Byword and Scrivener over the last year or so. I like Byword's simplicity, and can live with Markdown as it makes me spend less time faffing around with formatting. I also like Scrivener's organising capabilities, although I'm not so much of a fan of its other parts, even after reading the excellent 'Take Control' book dedicated to it. Ulysses sounds like it strikes a nice balance between the two, and I'm definitely going to give it a go. Thanks for the review, Julio! GV  2016-08-16 14:50 Alan, would you mind sharing what parts of Scrivener are causing you grief? George Bush   2016-08-15 20:10 Thanks for the useful info you provide about writing app alternatives! This is slightly off topic, but am I the only Pages user on the planet that misses the ability to select multiple pieces of random text that disappeared when Apple updated to version 5? It's a really useful tool for anyone who does much writing. Every other respectable word processor offers this capability—it's still available in TextEdit. I have to believe it's an oversight, and continue to be surprised that it hasn't been corrected. G. Douglas Eddy  2016-08-19 11:09 Yes, I greatly miss that, along with the failure of Pages to support bookmarks, as it used to, which makes it useless for me except for designing dockets and minutes for meetings. The inability to be able to selecting multiple pieces is infuriating! What a loss with both those abilities removed from Pages-the-middle-school app. I LOVE Nisus Writer Pro (thank you, TidBits for that pointer!) but it does not work with iOS and I have large documents of sermon research I work on each week that benefit from NWP's beautiful bookmark system and ease of adjusting the program to work the way I WANT it - unlike Word. I will give Ulysses a look. I to find Markup a pain though. Excellent review. Natasha Weston  2016-09-08 12:27 Thanks for this interesting read and the comments guys, I love to hear opinions on what works best for them.  Search   Unless otherwise noted, this article is copyright © 2016 Julio Ojeda-Zapata TidBITS is copyright © 2016 TidBITS Publishing Inc.

 The Chinese answer to Apple is falling apart Rob Price Aug. 16, 2016, 5:37 AM 99,245 facebook linkedin twitter email print Lei Jun, the chairman and CEO of Xiaomi Technology and the chairman of Kingsoft Corp., seen before the 2nd plenary session of the National People's Congress on March 9 in Beijing. Etienne Oliveau/Getty Images The "Apple of China" is in serious trouble. Sales in China of smartphones from Xiaomi, a once red-hot Chinese hardware startup touted as the country's answer to Apple, fell by a whopping 38% in the second quarter of 2016 year-on-year, according to new data from the research firm IDC. Xiaomi did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Xiaomi's phones are not yet available in Western markets, but the company has developed a buzzy reputation in the tech press. The company launched in 2010, and it enjoyed meteoric growth: By the end of 2014 it was the world's most valuable technology startup, with a private valuation of more than $46 billion. (It has since been dethroned of that title by Uber.) Specialising in cheap, high-quality smartphones, it had grown off the back of an unusually passionate fan base, which it was careful to cultivate. It liberally borrowed from Apple's playbook, including charismatic CEO keynote speeches. There is also a booming market in China for smartphones. The company set an ambitious target for 2015: Sell 100 million smartphones. But by July, as sales began to slow, it started to become clear that it just wouldn't happen. It ultimately sold "over 70 million," according to a company representative. Some of Xiaomi's phones are very similar to Apple's, and Apple design guru Jony Ive has even accused the company of "theft," a charge it denies. REUTERS/Jason Lee Earlier this year, Fortune reported that Xiaomi's revenue's barely grew in 2015. It pulled in 78 billion yuan, or $11.9 billion, for the year, up 5% on 74.3 billion yuan ($11.3 billion) in 2014 but well short of its 100-billion-yuan target for the year. The latest figures from IDC now suggest that Xiaomi isn't just standing still: It's actually in free fall. Xiaomi sold an estimated 10.5 million smartphones in China in the second quarter of this year, down from 17.1 million a year prior. That's a drop of 38.4%. At the same time, its rivals Oppo and Vivo have skyrocketed, enjoying year-on-year growth rates of 124.1% and 74.7%. IDC (Also interesting: Apple is struggling in China as well, with shipments down 31.7% year-on-year — selling 8.6 million devices last quarter, compared to 12.6 million in Q2 of 2015.) It’s worth noting that Xiaomi sells other products — as varied as water purifiers and hoverboards. But smartphones still make up the lion's share of the company's bottom line, with just 5% of its revenues in 2015 coming from other products, according to Fortune . So what's behind Xiaomi's implosion? A slowing in growth, at least, was inevitable. In previous years the company was perfectly positioned to take advantage of the rapid growth in China's smartphone market. This has now dropped off, though the Chinese market is still growing, 4.6% year-on-year in Q2. IDC points to a failure of marketing as the cause. Xiaomi previously spent very little on marketing and was proud of it, relying on word of mouth and user hype to spread word of its products. But this tactic is no longer viable as Vivo and Oppo are spending heavily, including using "brand ambassadors" to promote their smartphones. Without any concrete ways to differentiate its products, Xiaomi has been forced to follow suit. "In the past, Xiaomi started the trend of selling its phones online and other vendors soon followed suit and created their own online brand. After vendors witnessed OPPO's success with its R9, they also started riding on the trend of hiring celebrity endorsers to represent their brand and appeal more to the young crowd," IDC analyst Xiaohan Tay said. "Hiring celebrity endorsers may help increase numbers in the short term, but this alone may not be sufficient to drive numbers in the long run. As there is very little differentiation across products to warrant significant brand loyalty, vendors must constantly think out of the box to get people hyped up about their products." Xiaomi was once the head of the pack. Now it's playing catch-up — and losing. NOW WATCH: These size comparisons show the true scale of enormous things Loading video...

The US government has now officially granted Apple the patent for the color-balancing technology. While it doesn’t directly confirm the existence of a completely waterproof iPhone, the document does prove that the company is thinking about ways to expand the abilities of the handset when it comes to dealing with water. Apple’s innovation is primarily concerned with an image organizing and editing application which receives and edits photo data of an underwater scene. Its main aim is to remove undesirable tints from objects in the scene without affecting the color of the water itself. According to the document, this would result in a more realistic coloring of people or objects without sacrificing color cues such as the blue shade of the water to indicate that the picture was in fact taken underwater. Apple points out that without a color balancing technique, people’s skin looks tinted by the color of the light filtered through the water. Also Read: Apple to launch iPhone 7 on Sep 7, plans first MacBook Pro overhaul in 4 years Apple asserts that when current color correction methods are applied to images taken underwater or above the water they result in inaccurate photos which don’t preserve the color of the liquid. There’s no telling whether the newly-granted software will make an appearance in the iPhone 7. Several reports have claimed that the next-gen iPhone will boast of advanced water resistance capabilities. As per rumors, Apple has let go of the headphone jack and physical button in the device in order to reduce the number of ways water can enter the smartphone.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion iPhone, iOS News and Updates: Microsoft Office on your Apple Phone Now Lets You Doodle; Features, Pricing and How to Download By Krixia Zhienelle Subingsubing Aug 15, 2016 | 11:08 PM The Microsoft Office Apple Suite in iOS just got a whole lot more interactive and fun; users can now doodle freely onto their projects! With the latest version of the productivity suite, you can now directly draw on your Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and PowerPoint presentations without the need of a stylus. All the tools you need are in the new Draw tab, according to Microsoft's release notes. With these changes, we can now expect livelier, more colorful documents shared across the platform as users have more freedom of interaction with their projects! Microsoft Office for iPhone users Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit This comes as a welcome improvement from Apple's update earlier this year. It added inking support for the iPad and the iPad Pro so users can take full advantage of their Apple Pencil, which is currently marked at $99.00 at the Apple Store. Now, in a considerate move for iPhone users, Apple granted the same support on its iPhone devices - albeit the experience is a lot more different on a smaller screen, and the Draw tab is a little buried away, The Verge noted. The tools readily available for the user's disposal and customization are as follows: a pen that can be adjusted for line thickness and color for your annotations, an eraser, and a highlighter. There's no need to hold back either as you can draw directly on the document, on the cell, or even on the slides you're working on. Couple these with Office's new collaboration tools which allow users to co-author and create documents, much like Google Drive, as well as getting a richer experience on the Microsoft Suite. Where to Download Them These apps are now available on the Apple Store: Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel for your iPhones. While the apps may be freely downloaded, users must subscribe to an Office 365 subscription to be able to create and edit documents. This is part of Microsoft's continuous efforts to make Office the prime productivity suite for users, be it on a Windows ecosystem or Apple devices. This allows them to remain competitive with its contemporaries, such as Google's Apps for Work. Last month, for example, Microsoft released an update on its "Researcher for Word" to allow users explore more material without having to leave the document. Powered by Bing, it aggregates Web content and provides properly formatted citations.

(Reuters/China Daily Information Corporation) Share Written by Josh Horwitz August 16, 2016 Apple CEO Tim Cook is making the rounds in China once again. His trip is the latest in a series of photo-op-ready visits he’s made to the country, with this one coming weeks after the company revealed disappointing quarterly sales there. According to the China Daily this is his ninth trip to the nation. Cook first announced his trip on China’s Twitter-esque Sina Weibo (link in Chinese, registration required). Yesterday (Aug. 15) he posted photos of himself with Guo Pei, one of China’s most celebrated fashion designers. “Thrilled to see how her team is using iPad Pro as Guo Pei designs her new collection,” he wrote. The following day, Cook attended a fitness class led by Tony Nicholson, a British citizen who runs a gym in Beijing. He then posted photos of himself visiting a home showroom equipped with Apple’s HomeKit, from R&F, a major Chinese property developer. (Weibo) In May, Cook appeared with Singaporean musician JJ Lin in Beijing to demo a series of new Chinese music features introduced in GarageBand, Apple’s music production software. That visit also coincided with news that Apple was investing in Uber rival Didi Chuxing. This visit has yet to conclude with equally surprising news. But Cook did meet with Zhang Guoli, China’s vice premier, and announced that the company would build its first Asia-Pacific research and development center in China by the end of the year. Cook’s trip follows disappointing quarterly earnings, reported in July, that saw China lose its place as Apple’s second-largest market to Europe. Despite China’s years-long love affair with the iPhone, Apple has limited options for growth in the country. It already has distribution deals with the major carriers, and consumer demand for smartphones is slowing. Meanwhile the Chinese government may be looking to hinder Apple’s success—it recently blocked domestic access to the iTunes movie store and iBooks. Staged photos of Cook or other top executives might not revive the company’s fortunes in China. But Apple will pursue every tactic to ensure it doesn’t fall further.

News Manufacturers Retailers Tim Cook labels decision to hire former Dixons CEO John Browett as ‘big mistake’ By Alex Yau - August 16, 2016 0 2124 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Apple CEO Tim Cook Browett had only spent seven months at Apple as its retail senior vice president between April and October 2012 Apple CEO Tim Cook has admitted the decision to hire former Dixons CEO John Browett as the tech giant’s retail senior vice president in 2012 was a ‘big mistake.’ Cook had revealed his feelings in an interview with the Washington Post earlier this month (August 13), claiming Browett did ‘not fit the company culturally’. Browett was appointed to the role in April 2012, only to have been sacked seven months later in October. Prior to joining Apple, he was Dixons CEO between December 2007 and April 2012. Following his dismissal from the smartphone manufacturer, he had held a non-executive director role at EasyJet (September 2007 to December 2015) and is now Dunelm Furnishings CEO. Cook, who had taken over Apple in August 2011 after the passing of Steve Jobs, claimed he was ‘proud’ of how quickly the change was made. He said: “I hired the wrong person for retail initially. That was clearly a screw-up. “He [Browett] didn’t fit here culturally is a good way to describe it. We all talked to him, and I made the final decision, and it was wrong. We fairly quickly recognised it and made a change. And I’m proud we did that.” Reference was also made Apple’s recent financial results, where revenue for the three months ending June 25 had dropped year-on-year to £32 billion. The number of iPhone sales also fell by 15 per cent to 40.3999 million. This is the second consecutive quarter where iPhone numbers have dropped. “And, yes, we’re coming down some this year. Every year isn’t an up, you know. I’ve heard all of it before,” explained Cook.

By Agamoni Ghosh August 16, 2016 11:35 BST Apple release iOS 10 beta 1 for iOS Developer Programme membersGetty Images Apple has released the beta 6 version of iOS 10 for developers for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch along with the beta 5 version for public testers. The latest beta version for the OS will most likely be the final testing version before Apple releases the iOS 10 publicly, which is most likely at an event next month. Apart from the regular bugs and its fixes, the freshly released iOS 10 beta version brings an improvement to Siri. While Siri was found to respond inappropriately to requests concerning removed apps in the previous beta versions, the beta 6 of the iOS 10 enables Siri to offer appropriate responses. Other than this there is no major change or feature introduction. iOS 10 departs from iOS 9 and its version by bringing a refreshed look to Apple Music, News, Maps, photos, smarter keyboard and much more. Users will even have the option of deleting system apps on board the iOS 10. iPhone users have often complained about the space crunch on their devices especially those with lower storage versions and with iOS 10, users can finally delete the company's built-in native apps like Maps, Calculator, Music, Videos, etc and download them again later when required. To download the latest beta version if you are already testing iOS 10 beta on your device, head over to Software Update under Settings to find the OTA update. In case you are starting out but are a registered developer head over to Apple's developer page to install the beta profile.

The company may launch not one but as many as three models of its tablet next year. This information comes courtesy respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi-Kuo of KGI Security. Outlining his predictions for the next-generation iPads, Kuo said that they will come in three new screen sizes. Kuo adds that while the 12.9-inch and the 10.5-inch iPad models will run on A10X SoC made by TSMC using 10nm process, the smaller 9.7-inch variant will be powered by TSMC's A9X processor. However, there will reportedly be no major design change. According to a report in Apple Insider, citing Kuo, the upcoming iPad models will largely be of the same design as the existing models. Apple 'stereotypes' India in Rio Olympics 2016 ad Apple recently released its Rio Olympics 2016 ad. The ad titled 'The Human Family' is part of the company's 'Shot on iPhone' campaign. It has voice of poet Maya Angelou and seeks to show people from different countries who are competing at the Games. Looking further ahead into 2018, the analyst predicts that Apple will redesign its iPad tablet by introducing flexible Amoled displays. This would bring in an enhanced user interface complementing the hardware. Nothing else is known for now. Apple is also said to be revamping its iPhone model next year. It has been reported that the iPhone 8 is expected to come with an OLED (organic light-emitting diode) edgeless display. The home button/ fingerprint sensor will not exist as a physical portion of the new phone's design, but will be integrated within the expanse of the display itself. As of now, Apple is rumoured to launch three smartphones this year with the third handset, iPhone 7 Pro being the flagship model. Rumours suggest that the model may come with dual-camera set-up and wireless charging via smart connector (similar to the one in iPad Pro).

There's a very good reason for that. [Photo: Flickr user Juanedc.com; App Photo: Universal Pictures ("Crimson Peak", 2015)] Jared Newman 08.16.16 5:00 AM HomeKit could become the quintessential product of Tim Cook's Apple, but right now it's kind of dull. Apple has yet to tell much of a story around HomeKit since announcing the smart home framework in mid-2014, and there was little fanfare when the first HomeKit-enabled devices, such as the Ecobee3 thermostat and iHome iSP5 SmartPlug, rolled out last year. At Apple's WWDC conference in June, the big news around HomeKit was that the company would release a remote control app for smart door locks, lighting, and thermostats, similar to third-party apps that are already available. This is not the type of dramatic product launch for which Steve Jobs was famous. Playing The Long Game Inside Tim Cook's Apple iPhone sales have slumped, stock is down, and pundits insist Apple is a tech laggard. But the company may be stronger than ever. But maybe it doesn't have to be. Apple is becoming a different kind of company now, one with a burgeoning interest in ever-evolving services. While the persistent iteration that led to the iPhone and other breakthroughs is still present, it's no longer happening behind the scenes. Ambitious connected services like HomeKit, Apple Pay, and HealthKit all involve lots of partners operating at scale, which means they must develop out in the open. These services have the potential to evolve into lucrative businesses for Apple. But in the meantime, the process is going to seem a bit bland. Faith In The Track Record I spoke to several smart home device makers for this story, and all of them seem satisfied to be working with Apple on HomeKit. At the same time, they're short on examples of how HomeKit will push smart home adoption into the mainstream. Most acknowledge that while smart home devices are a growing business, they're still the domain of either tech enthusiasts or home fixer-uppers. "So far, nobody has crossed into the masses yet," says Matt Swatsky, director of product management for smart dimmer maker Lutron. "Apple has historically figured out how to take products and get them to the masses ... They haven't done it yet." Lutron So what drew device makers to HomeKit in the first place? Mostly a belief that Apple's success in this area is inevitable. "Clearly, the ability to work with a leader like Apple, you have to assume that those in the Apple ecosphere are very passionate about their products and devices," says Gary Schultz, who heads product development for iHome's SmartHome line. "It just makes sense that Apple and HomeKit are going to be leading platforms for the future smart home as it evolves, so it was a win-win." A similar line emerged from Schlage, whose smart door locks were among the first HomeKit devices. The main attraction was Apple's demonstrated knack for intuitive products, says Rob Martens, Schlage's futurist and director of connectivity platforms. "You could name any number of experiences they've provided, even buying an iPhone ... that end-to-end experience that they've provided gives what I would call adult businesses, adult manufacturers such as ourselves, a lot of confidence that they're going to do it properly," Martens says, referring to Schlage's decades of experience in the lock-making trade. Of course, it helps that Apple sells a lot of iPhones. Because the its hardware is so prevalent, the company can start assembling a smart home platform even without an anchor product, akin to Amazon's Echo speaker or Google's OnHub router. "They have a different approach than others. Starting with a device that a lot of people have is not a bad way to get people interested in that connected home experience. There's not really an up-front purchase to get started," Lutron's Matt Swatsky says. That's not to say smart home makers aren't at all interested in HomeKit's unique traits. Schlage's Martens praised Apple's work on creating a secure platform—device makers must include a custom chip for secure communications among devices—and the company's steps to minimize data collection. "They have put some stakes in the ground in terms of what they believe are the right things to do and the wrong things to do, and we believe consumers are paying attention and are very interested," Martens says. More broadly, the HomeKit framework is easy for device makers to work with in terms of talking to other devices in the home and helping users get set up, says Stuart Lombard, CEO of smart thermostat maker Ecobee. Ecobee "I think Apple has done a really good job of enabling people like us to create services on top of that platform. They'll deliver services, we'll deliver services, and in the end consumers will win." If there's a common thread here, it's that Apple is doing a lot of thankless work around HomeKit right now, from rallying device makers to building a system around privacy and security. But with products like the iPhone and iPad, this work happened quietly in Cupertino, long before Steve Jobs brought the end result on stage. Now we're witnessing the construction in real time. Where HomeKit Goes From Here So here's the challenge for Apple: How does HomeKit get from a bare-bones product that appeals to a tiny (but growing) fraction of its customer base to something that's part of every iPhone owner's home? In other words, how does it stop being boring? One argument goes that such a transformation won't be necessary, and that HomeKit will grow gradually as people replace failing dumb appliances with brand-new smart ones. "As you go to homes, you see people talking to their homes, you see things in the home responding," iHome's Gary Schultz says. "Word of mouth begets any technology, and really, we're only 12 months into this journey." Ecobee's Stuart Lombard says adoption is already moving from early followers to mainstream users, noting that 40% of new thermostat purchases are Wi-Fi-connected models. Smart homes aren't just the domain of wealthy people anymore; Ecobee customers have a median household income of $75,000, Lombard says, and more of those customers connect to HomeKit than to any other platform. "It is not a rich and famous kind of product," Lombard says. Still, smart home makers expect Apple to do more over time to push HomeKit forward. The upcoming Home app is the first step, allowing users to control appliances and set up automation routines from one place, and device makers are banking on Apple making that app more intelligent. Home App Lombard, for instance, envisions a system that automatically recognizes when you're on vacation, and rotates through lighting to look like someone's still home. It's worth noting that Nest has offered these kinds of advanced home and away automations for a couple years now, but Apple is building a broader framework that works with entire device categories instead of specific partners. "Those types of use cases, where you solve customer pain points and make it easy for them, those are ones that work really, really well." Schlage's Rob Martens also hopes HomeKit will learn to recognize when not to trigger certain actions. For example, if a motion sensor is set up to turn on the lights and play NPR on the speakers when the user gets home from work, that action should get bypassed if someone else is home already. "It's definitely not a play for just the 'good night Siri' thing, in terms of making sure the door is locked, making sure the temperature is where I want it, et cetera," Martens says. "There's a heightened level of integration." But as Martens notes, designing that system requires deep understanding of what each device can do. If a smart lock can tell the difference between someone knocking on the door and trying to kick it in, for instance, HomeKit should know how to communicate that. "Building your solutions off of an incredibly solid foundation allows you to innovate at a much faster pace later," he says. Those who are following the process of building up that foundation via HomeKit may find it dull, but that's how innovation tends to work. Would Apple's partners like to see the company's marketing muscle kick in sooner? Perhaps, but they also realize that's not going to happen until the product feels complete. Only then can Apple perform its usual routine, and explain why HomeKit is something people didn't realize they needed. "Before they put their weight behind it," Lombard says, "they really want to make sure they've got it right."

Johannesburg, 16 Aug 2016 Read in this story No interruptions Who's there? Google Duo is now available to both Android and Apple users, unlike the iOS equivalent, FaceTime. Alphabet's Google has released a video calling app, Google Duo, which will be rolled out to Android and iOS app stores worldwide this week. The app allows for face-to-face video communication through smartphones. Google Duo is differentiated from Apple's Facetime, as it allows users to video call anyone no matter their device. Facetime only allows iPhone owners to call other iPhone owners. "You shouldn't have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are," says Justin Uberti, principal software engineer at Google. "It's no wonder that nearly half of us never make video calls on mobile."   See also No more app downloading Snapchat expands chat options to VOIP Google Duo FaceTimeThis is Google's second play at video-calling. It previously introduced Google Hangouts, which was similar to Microsoft's Skype. The product was mainly used on desktop and allowed for numerous people to join the conversation. Duo is far simpler and is to be used on mobile in one-to-one visual interactions. Google has stripped its video-calling app to the bare minimum. When opening it, video of the user's own face will appear, with a call button at the bottom of the screen. Tapping the button takes the user to a list of phone contacts − those who have the app installed and those who haven't (there is the option to invite them to download it). No interruptions Google says it has optimised Duo to connect faster than other video apps, and to ensure the conversation stays in sync. Uberti says the app is fast and reliable: "We've built Duo… so that video calls connect quickly and work well even on slower networks," such as 2G. Call quality adjusts to changing network conditions, he explains. When bandwidth is limited, the app will reduce the resolution to keep the call going. When bandwidth is good, the calls will be in HD video (up to 720p) and audio. Duo will also switch between WiFi and cellular data automatically without dropping the call. To use Duo, all that is required is a phone number, not a Gmail account. Who's there? A differentiating feature of Google Duo is the live video preview of the caller that is displayed before the call is answered. This is to make the calls feel more like an ‘invitation' rather than an ‘interruption', the company says. The feature, called Knock Knock, lets users see live video of the caller before they answer. Uberti says this gives users a sense of what the caller is up to and what they want to chat about. Once answered, Duo seamlessly transitions into the call. This feature can be switched off, and only works on iOS if the app is already open on the user's phone. Other features include end-to-end encryption, availability in 78 languages, and the ability to swop between front and back cameras during the call by swiping across the screen. This lets the caller show the other person what is in front of them without twisting the phone around. Facebook Messenger and SnapChat both have video-calling offerings too. Google Duo was first announced at the Google developer conference in May. At the same conference, another messaging app, Google Allo, was also announced. Google has not said when this app, which gives users complete creative control of their messages, will be available.
