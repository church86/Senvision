The company is gearing up to introduce its refreshed line of iPhones, including an all-new premium handset with a curved glass body and almost bezel-less screen, Bloomberg reports. Besides the revamped display, the new models are expected to come with boosted cameras as well as an all-glass design with a steel frame. Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE While the report barely offers any new insight as to what we could expect from the upcoming iPhone, it does add further credibility to a heap of previous rumors. Building on earlier speculation, the publication hints the phone will come in three different sizes, all of which will sport a steel frame reminiscent of the iPhone 4. While the preemo model will feature an improved OLED panel, the remaining two devices are slated to pack a standard LCD display – like the iPhone 7. The revamped OLED panels will likely be manufactured by rival Samsung. Interestingly, Apple might also scrap the iconic home button in favor of on-screen keys à la Samsung Galaxy S8. Given that facial recognition might be coming to the new device, it remains unclear whether the company will move the fingerprint scanner to the back or ditch it altogether. One possibility is that Apple will include the fingerprint reader straight into the screen of the OLED version, but insiders claim this will be “technically challenging.” Samsung reportedly ran into similar issues while experimenting with on-screen fingerprint scanners. Another intriguing prospect is that the new iPhone might pack dual-camera setups on both the back and the front. Apple is also said to be experimenting with various configurations and designs, including a vertical camera system on the back. The new and improved cameras are rumored to use revolutionary cam tech that leverages depth sensors to create 3D selfies and other augmented reality gimmicks. Apple is expected to reveal its new iPhone lineup later in September, but shipping might be delayed a few weeks. And in case you’re eyeing the upcoming premium model: Better prepare your money from now, it could set you back more than $1,000. What would you most like to see in the next-gen iPhone?

Headlines ZICTA claims they can read your WhatsApp Messages and Disable any Communication Device April 20, 2017 30 2,071 views Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet ZICTA Director for Consumer Protection Mofya Chisala ZICTA has sensationally revealed that it is able to disable any communication devices and read personal messages. The revelation is likely to unsettle many social media users especially that platforms such as WhatsApp have end-to-end encryption which ensures that only the sender and the person receiving can read what is sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp. On WhatsApp, messages are secured with a lock, and only the recipient and the sender have the special key needed to unlock and read the message. In recent years, some tech companies with very large user-bases have been championing user privacy. For instance, Apple and WhatsApp recently challenged law enforcement authorities’ demands to weaken their security system and/or access encrypted data. Apple most visibly in the San Bernardino case when Apple resisted demands by the FBI that it writes a new version of its OS to weaken the security of the terrorist’s iPhone. But ZICTA Director for Consumer Protection Mofya Chisala has also disclosed that the authority has a good working relationship with Facebook and Google in order to protect internet users in Zambia. Mr Chisala said Communications and Transport Minister Brian Mushimba envisions an ICT sector that is well disciplined. He said Zambia would have a lot of problem if it allowed people to do what they want online. Mr Chisala was speaking when he featured on the Hot FM Red Hot Breakfast show on Wednesday to clarify on the raid at CEC Liquid Telecom and other IT firms in Lusaka. “You know there have been a lot of social media pages, cloning, hate speech and the exchange of pornographic material and the ICT Act is very clear on some of these things. Now we have moved into gear to ensure that even taking you to court, we are going to ask for the maximum penalty because we don’t want a few people to twist the hand of government to now start putting in laws to start restricting people’s use of the internet. That is unnecessary, the Internet is one tool that can be used for businesses, research, communication and other things,” Mr Chisala said. He added, “So we have now gone into gear and we are now going to visit all those we find wanting to ensure that the ICT sector is one that other countries can be proud of and come to learn from.” “I always wish to remind people that with great power comes great responsibility. When you sit in your room on your Ipad or your phone and you start commenting, writing and rubbishing people, you know, we will catch up with you.” Mr Chisala said the ZICTA of today has realised that collaboration and education is not the only way to go hence the need to increase on enforcement of the law. “I think we need to switch up, turn the heat up. We are now following every lead we have and we will get to you. A very good example, a lot of you lose your phones, your laptops and when the police find them in a raid or if it is stolen, what we have to do to know if it belongs to you is that we will have to go through it and now instead of giving you back your stolen item, we will have to arrest you because even if you have deleted anything, we have equipment that can bring back everything that was deleted,” Mr Chisala explained. He added, “So if somebody is disturbing you or harassing you on social media, come and report to ZICTA and by the way, we are having very good relationships with these social media platforms like Facebook and Google and we speaking the same language.” “We are goona come after you and we will make you an example because we will name and shame you and we are going to blacklist you in Zambia, meaning you cannot use any of these services and if cousin, your mother, your father buys you a phone and you start using and we find out, we will blacklist your mother, your father, your cousin and whoever will give you access.” Related posts: ZICTA trains 100 CB teachers in curbing cybercrime ZICTA shuts down internet cafes operating without trading licences Over 6 million Zambians accessing the internet-ZICTA ZICTA raids CEC Liquid Telecom Loading...

No country wants to associate with a Weak dictator, a Museveni Wanna-be. Then he can’t go on a tour to N/W Rhodesia, he’s gonna get stoned, lynched. So he’s now confined to N/E part of the country. He’s a like a prisoner himself.

There is nothing secret about them with the service provider or the regulator. People should simply take precaution not to say or write things they cannot say or write publicly. Reply 9 Bombi Grace April 20, 2017 at 7:54 am +1 0 vote Rubbish news report. The journalist is from a sub standard school. While anti terrorist cells all over the wall could not break whatsApp security system, these dumb guys at the ZICTA are claiming sensations. These are result of an id*otic President and his stup*d Vice President, who are taking the country to full ruination.

Reply 14 Commodore April 20, 2017 at 8:32 am +1 0 vote What ZICTA is saying is that they are monitoring our entire online activity. To protect our selves against this intrusions into our privacy I suggest we use encrypted browsers for laptops and phones such as the Tor Browser. Google it, read more about it.

Reply 20 disk April 20, 2017 at 9:02 am vote Ba Chisala, you are embarrassing the IT fraternity. You are talking like a lay man.I do not support any abuse of social media.However, to say that you can intercept whatsApp message is a far fetched dream. And talking of your equipment that can enable you read even erased data from a PC, that is no news at all. Students all over the world do that everyday.You don’t need special equipment for that. You guys should be me professional and stop sounding so shallow. Reply LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Please enter your comment! Please enter your name here You have entered an incorrect email address!

The company listed all these apps as free on the App Store on Tuesday. Apple previously gave this software away for free with every new macOS or iOS device that was activated. According to a report by Macrumors, the company has not updated its iWork page and the website still says that the software will be free for people who have purchased eligible iOS or Mac devices. The report details that apps have been removed from the Top Free app charts in the App Store. Apple’s support website informs that educational institution and business units can enroll in the Apple Volume Purchase Program (VPP) to get free copies of Pages, Numbers, Keynote, iMovie and GarageBand in the VPP store. MacOS App Store We verified the price drop on both US and India-based Apple accounts and were able to install iWork and iLife apps without paying anything. The interesting thing here is that the company has not issued any official statement regarding the price drop. So you can visit the App Store on your iOS or Mac OS device and get these productivity tools without paying anything.

Authorities in the Chinese capital say they plan to summon the U.S. tech giant to urge it to "tighten up checks" on apps available in its App Store, according to state news agency Xinhua. Law enforcement officials have previously met with Apple representatives about examining live-streaming apps in Apple's store, Xinhua reported. The summons is part of a crackdown on live-streaming platforms, a joint effort being carried out by Beijing's Cyberspace Administration, Public Security Bureau and Cultural Market Administrative Law Enforcement Team. The report didn't say when the meeting would take place. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The extra scrutiny is the latest example of Chinese authorities interfering in what content Apple offers consumers in the country. In January, Apple said it had complied with a Chinese request to pull the New York Times' news apps from the App Store in China. The world's most populous country remains a key market for the U.S. tech firm. Amid falling iPhone sales in China, Apple is looking to sell more apps and services there. That effort hit a stumbling block about a year ago when Chinese regulators shut down Apple's iBooks and iTunes Movies services in the country. The summons reported this week comes after Beijing authorities found that three Chinese websites had violated internet regulations on live streaming, with users broadcasting forbidden content on their platforms, according to Xinhua. All three websites' apps are available in Apple's store. New regulations that went into effect late last year prohibit users from live streaming content that could "endanger national security and undermine social stability."

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 20 April 2017 | MYT 11:30 AM The life of an Apple supplier is getting even tougher Apple has developed its own processors for years, but has stepped up in-house design of components in recent years, which helps the company maintain leverage over suppliers as a recent wave of acquisitions cut the number of chipmakers it works with. — AFP Imagination Technologies Group Plc discovered how fickle life can be as an Apple Inc supplier when it was ditched this month by the iPhone maker. More suppliers may suffer the same fate as the world’s largest technology company faces a shrinking number of semiconductor makers and expands into areas that need special chips designed in-house.  Dialog Semiconductor Plc, Synaptics Inc and Cirrus Logic Inc are particularly vulnerable to Apple’s supply chain whims and demands, according to analysts. One component supplier, Avnet Inc, stopped working with Apple because the relationship was squeezing its profit margins too much.  Apple has developed its own processors for years, but has stepped up in-house design of components, including graphics, Bluetooth and other smartphone-related chips, in recent years. That’s expensive, and creates new risks, but it helps the company maintain leverage over suppliers as a recent wave of acquisitions cut the number of chipmakers it works with.  To secure cheaper prices, Apple likes to have at least two suppliers for any given component. But last year alone, one in five US chipmakers were acquired, according to Susquehanna Financial Group. Key Apple suppliers SanDisk Corp, Broadcom Corp, TriQuint Semiconductor Inc, Intersil Corp, Sharp Corp, Elpida Memory Inc, RF Micro Devices Inc and Fairchild Semiconductor International have all been snapped up since 2013.  Loop Capital Markets LLC analyst Betsy Van Hees, has seen 35 chip companies swallowed since 2014. “You have less competition, less pricing pressure,” she said. “Which may be why Apple is going more internally than externally.” In the past, it was easier for Apple to squeeze outside suppliers to improve profit margins, she added.  This year is particularly important for Apple because it’s preparing to launch three iPhones, including a flagship device with a major new design. The installation of new manufacturing lines and processes is costly, so Apple needs to find savings elsewhere. “To avoid taking a hit you put some pressure” on the suppliers, BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis said.  Cost isn’t the only incentive for Apple to develop its own components. It also helps the company couple its hardware more seamlessly with its software, chief financial officer Luca Maestri explained at a Feb. 14 conference in San Francisco. “We have better control over timing, over cost, over quality,” he said.  Expansion into new markets and products may also require hardware unique to Apple’s needs that isn’t immediately available from outside suppliers. The AirPods Bluetooth headphones, released last year, use low-energy communications chips that Apple got through its purchase of Passif Semiconductor Corp in 2013. In 2012, Apple spent US$356mil (RM1.56bil) acquiring AuthenTec Inc, which had fingerprint sensors and related chipsets that helped build the fingerprint scanner on the iPhone.  Apple was in acquisition talks last year with Imagination Technologies. The Kings Langley, England-based company designs a type of chip called a graphics processing unit that’s used in iPhones and iPads, and analysts theorised Apple wanted to take the technology in house and push it forward on its own terms. Apple decided against making an offer. Then, on April 3, Imagination said Apple would stop using its graphics technology after developing its own solutions. Apple also hired several employees from Imagination, including former chief operating officer John Metcalfe. The British company lost about two-thirds of its market value that day.  That prompted analysts and investors to cast a keener eye over what other suppliers may be next. One immediate example was Dialog, which slumped 20% April 11 after Bankhaus Lampe analyst Karsten Iltgen suggested Apple may cease using Dialog’s power-management chips. Apple is setting up power-management design centers in Munich and California, Iltgen noted, and there’s been a steady flow of engineers from Dialog to Apple over the past year.  Synaptics Inc, whose products help control the iPhone’s touch screen, could also be vulnerable, Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh wrote in an April 12 note. Apple has hired “a significant number” of engineers from the company, suggesting that it’s working on products that would render Synaptics redundant, Vinh said.  Vinh also highlighted Cirrus Logic, which makes audio chips used in iPhones, even as he deemed the risk of Apple developing its own competing components “medium to low.”  Hiring in-house experts doesn’t come cheap (Cirrus spends US$200mil (RM880mil) a year on research, Vinh noted). In the past five years, Apple doubled research and development spending as a percentage of revenue, an increase CFO Maestri attributed to new product categories and developing more of its own underlying technology, among other factors.  Semiconductor research is among the most expensive in the technology industry, often exceeding 18% of revenue. Apple spends 4.7% of its income on R&D, up from 2.2% in 2012.  The pay-off from the investment could be substantial. Semiconductors account for about a third of iPhone manufacturing costs, according to Timothy Arcuri, a Cowen & Co analyst. Tapering growth of smartphone sales has meanwhile heightened the need to squeeze every last dollar of profit out of the handsets that Apple does sell.  The main risk is that Apple misses new technology trends that bubble up through a large supply chain. Relying more on internally created components, it’ll have fewer suppliers lining up to show it the latest innovations. When Nokia Oyj was the world’s largest mobile phone maker, it focused more on cost cutting and controlling component supply and missed out on important changes in the market, according to Mike Walkley, an Apple analyst at Canaccord Genuity.  “You’ve seen what they’ve done to Imagination and Dialog Semi and all of these people who supply to Apple,” he said. “It’s kind of what Nokia did back in the day when they were king of the world.” An Apple spokesman declined to comment.  Then there’s the risk that some partners decide they don’t want to deal with Apple anymore. Bill Amelio, former chief executive officer of Lenovo Group Ltd who now runs Avnet, said he walked away from supplying Apple and it’s helped improve earnings.  The Phoenix, Arizona-based distributor of chips and other computer components had a gross profit margin of 13.7% in its most recent quarter. That’s 2 percentage points wider than it was a year earlier – thanks in part to cutting ties with Apple. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Cyberattack hits 1,200 InterContinental hotels in US Automakers see promise in China car-sharing China's Ant Financial targets brand boost in South-East Asia with helloPay deal Taxing the new economy, starting with Uber, Lyft How to own your first home with zero down payment Pedalling to save the planet Others Also Read Discovering Asia’s Las Vegas Going with the flow – the fun and fundamentals of water Seven mosques in Selangor to be built or refurbished advertisement Latest News JPMorgan said to plan tripling size of New York technology hub Amazon rolls out chatbot tools in race to dominate voice-powered tech Shared office space company WeWork starts facilities management service Cyberattack hits 1,200 InterContinental hotels in US Amazon says it is bringing retail shopfront service to Australia Most Viewed in Tech The original Starcraft now available as free download Bose headphones spy on listeners: lawsuit Could 18:9 displays become the new smartphone standard?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 20 April 2017 | MYT 12:32 PM Tencent’s WeChat abolishes tipping feature on Apple iPhones Apple said in a statement that WeChat could still allow users to tip as long as it used Apple’s own in-app purchase system. — Reuters Tencent Holdings Ltd is shutting down a popular feature on WeChat that allows iPhone users to tip emoji and content creators to comply with Apple Inc.’s policy on in-app purchases.  After months of negotiations, Tencent said on its official WeChat account it “regrettably” had to abolish the feature on the instant message service to comply with new terms Apple laid down in June. According to Tencent, the iPhone maker said developers would be barred from including buttons or links that direct customers to purchasing systems outside of its iOS ecosystem.  Tencent’s doing away with a function credited with helping WeChat become China’s dominant mobile social media and payments platform, with more than 889 million users. Tipping encouraged users to deposit more money within the app’s wallet, while motivating writers and emoji designers to compete for tips, enhancing the overall quality of content.  While Tencent doesn’t disclose the number of content-creators, they’re part of more than 10 million official accounts run by individuals, corporations and government agencies that broadcast news and updates to users.  Apple said in a statement that WeChat could still allow users to tip as long as it used Apple’s own in-app purchase system. Tencent’s latest suggestion for users is that they employ QR codes to receive payments instead, a practice that still isn’t compliant with Apple’s policies.  It’s unclear how other Chinese developers, from live-streaming to gaming apps, that employ their own tipping or payment features are affected.  Tencent is one of the biggest players in mobile app transactions: its payment system accounted for about 38% of market share in China at the end of the third quarter, according to research firm Analysys International.  The changes to payments target only the iPhone version of WeChat – tipping remains available to all users of Google’s Android, which power the vast majority of smartphones in the country.  Separately, Beijing’s internet regulators said on Wednesday they are planning to inspect Apple on the way it screens apps, after authorities ordered three Chinese streaming sites to patch up “significant loopholes” related to content violation, user classification and identity verification, the official news agency Xinhua reported. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested China's ZTE appoints US head Cheng as new mobile business chief Taxing the new economy, starting with Uber, Lyft eBay’s second-quarter profit forecast falls short of estimates Alphabet's Verily unit launches study to track health data How to own your first home with zero down payment Pedalling to save the planet Others Also Read MP sets sights on turning Teluk Intan into hub for higher education Factbox - The ups and downs of U.S. men's 4x100m relays Discovering Asia’s Las Vegas advertisement Latest News JPMorgan said to plan tripling size of New York technology hub Amazon rolls out chatbot tools in race to dominate voice-powered tech Shared office space company WeWork starts facilities management service Cyberattack hits 1,200 InterContinental hotels in US Amazon says it is bringing retail shopfront service to Australia Most Viewed in Tech The original Starcraft now available as free download Bose headphones spy on listeners: lawsuit Could 18:9 displays become the new smartphone standard?

By TheresePoletti Columnist Qualcomm Inc. had a pretty good quarter, but executives barely got to talk about it Wednesday as all eyes focused on the chipmaker’s problems with another tech giant. Qualcomm QCOM, -0.11%   beat analysts’ expectations with a quarterly earnings report Wednesday, but it was hard to tell on the conference call, where all but one question was about the communications-chip company’s complicated and potentially costly legal dispute with Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.37%   In January, Apple sued Qualcomm, a designer of chips used in the iPhone, for $1 billion, contending the company was demanding onerous terms for its technology licenses and that it had withheld rebate payments as punishment for Apple’s cooperation in a Korean regulatory probe of Qualcomm’s licensing practices. Qualcomm filed a countersuit last week that didn’t pull any punches. The ramifications of this fight dominated Qualcomm’s earnings release and call, in which Qualcomm admitted that contract manufacturers underpaid royalty payments in the fiscal second quarter to the tune of about $1 billion. Qualcomm’s accounts receivables soared in the quarter, to a deficit of $1.8 billion, up from $392 million in the year-ago period. The contract manufacturers acknowledged the amounts due and have binding deals, Qualcomm said to reassure investors. Don’t miss: Apple makes move that could improve its gadgets, but it won’t be easy While the lack of payments in the quarter was effectively canceled out by the money Qualcomm has withheld Apple in rebate payments, Qualcomm executives said they could not predict whether or not they will be underpaid again in the current quarter, leading to wider-than-normal earnings guidance. Analysts were clearly worried that contract manufacturers may continue to withhold payments, even though Qualcomm’s contract with Apple ended in December. “The agreement itself with Apple, which is where we have the dispute over what is owed to them, expired at the end of 2016, so it has really no relevance or impact to what the contract manufacturers would owe us for sales during the March quarter,” Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said. This is when driverless cars will hit the road(3:35) At CES in Las Vegas, tech executives, industry analysts and enthusiasts voiced different ideas about when self-driving cars would become widely available. MarketWatch took a spin in a semi-autonomous car to learn more about this emerging technology. The only question not pertaining to Apple in Wednesday’s call was about Qualcomm’s pending $39 billion megamerger with NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI, +0.89% which Qualcomm hopes will broaden its presence in advanced driver-assistance systems in autos, as well as self-driving cars. Nothing about the recent arbitration award won by BlackBerry Ltd., which led Qualcomm to announce standard and adjusted revenue, with the adjusted figure adding nearly $1 billion. No questions were asked about the business, other than whether the company was seeing other licensees question their licensing terms since the Apple suit. “The terms under those agreements, I think were grossly mischaracterized in Apple’s submissions,” Aberle said in response to that question. “So, yes, we’ve had to have some discussions with licensees to try to clarify what it is and isn’t, but I would say that’s sort of normal-course discussions we would typically have with companies.” The obvious concerns about manufacturers withholding payments and other customers following Apple’s lead did not affect Qualcomm’s stock after the earnings beat, with shares gaining 2.5% in late trading. But the stock has been pressured by the news of late, with Qualcomm declining 18.7% in the past three months as the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.17%  has gained 3.5%. For any investor still holding on to Qualcomm stock during the tumult, its clear there is a bumpy ride ahead, with many twists and turns down intellectual property road that could all lead to more questions about Apple.

By tech2 News Staff /  20 Apr 2017 , 09:59 #Apple Getty Images A recent report suggests that Apple will start “trial assembly” of iPhones in India next month at the Bengaluru facility being set up by Wistron. Wistron is a Taiwanese OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) for Apple. The report, published in The Economic Times, quotes Karnataka state officials as saying that they would like to see Apple brings its “entire component-making ecosystem” to India and begin exporting products from there. Apple is also expected to set up a second manufacturing facility in the near future. Apple has requested a number of tax and customs duty concessions before it begins the assembly or manufacture of iPhones in India. However, most of Apple’s requests were denied. Other manufacturers in India, including Samsung, Oppo and Xiaomi work within the Make in India framework set forth by the government and already receive a number of tax sops and other concessions. Apple’s demands might be construed as excessive in this light. State officials apparently believe that Apple will continue to lobby the Centre for more tax sops independent of its Bengaluru plans, as they believe that Apple sees India as a lucrative market that can’t be ignored. Karnataka’s IT minister has reportedly asked the Centre to do its part in encouraging “high-end manufacturing.” Publish date: April 20, 2017 9:59 am| Modified date: April 20, 2017 9:59 am Tags: Apple, Apple iPhone made in India, Apple tax concessions, Bengaluru, iPhone, Made in India iPhone, Winstron Also read Apple’s tax exemption demand for setting up manufacturing unit in India rejected by Finance Ministry Analysts predict that Apple will be worth at least $824 billion in 2017 X Recommended For You Apple iMovie, GarageBand, and iWork apps are now free for all Mac and iOS device users Apple App store is next in line, as Chinese authorities ban live-streaming websites Next iPhone’s final schematics allegedly leak from a Foxconn insider, sports an edge to edge display Facebook F8: Apple Music will come to Messenger soon, Spotify already available Subscribe to our newsletter GO You are Now Subscribed to our Newsletter - Stay Tuned !

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile One big question still surrounds Apple’s iPhone 8 Image Source: AlHasan Husni Yoni Heisler @edibleapple April 18th, 2017 at 9:43 AM Share Tweet The release of Apple’s 2017 flagship iPhone is still several months away, but the hype surrounding the device has been steadily gaining momentum over the past few weeks. Said to feature an edge to edge OLED display, advanced augmented reality features, and a wide array of additional system improvements and features, Apple’s next-gen iPhone will mark a huge technological leap forward and will likely anchor the largest refresh cycle Apple has ever seen. And yet, for the first time in years, what Apple plans to call its next-gen iPhone remains up for debate. Don't Miss: This is supposedly Apple’s final iPhone 8 design From what we’ve gathered from an assortment of credible rumors, Apple’s 2017 iPhone lineup will consist of three distinct devices: an iPhone 7s, an iPhone 7s Plus, and an unnamed 5.8-inch iPhone with a sleek and edgeless OLED display. Unofficially, Apple’s next-gen 5.8-inch iPhone has already been dubbed the iPhone 8, a reflection of the fact that the device will introduce a brand new form factor, a change Apple typically reserves for devices released after an ‘S’ cycle refresh. More recently, we’ve seen reports claiming that the iPhone 8 will actually be called the iPhone Edition, a name which makes much more sense than the iPhone 8 ever did. Consider this: if Apple releases an iPhone 8 alongside two iPhone 7s models, the naming scheme alone would immediately make the two brand new iPhone 7s models appear antiquated. Though new devices, the iPhone 7s models — standing next to the iPhone 8 — would seem like old news. In stark contrast, the iPhone Edition is a clever way for Apple to release three new iPhone models while not steering customers away from the more affordable devices in Apple’s iPhone lineup. Because the iPhone Edition connotes a degree of elegance without masquerading as next-year’s iPhone model, it’s actually a clever way for Apple to designate the edgeless OLED iPhone as a premium device without diminishing the appeal of the iPhone 7s. In effect, the iPhone 7s would be positioned as the MacBook to the iPhone Editon’s MacBook Pro. Problem solved, right? Well, not exactly. It’s no secret that Apple over the past few years has been simplifying its branding. Slowly but surely, the “i” naming scheme has given way to more Apple-centric branding. For example, there’s no iWatch, iMusic or iTV. Instead, we have the Apple Watch, Apple Music and Apple TV. More recently, Apple changed iTunes Podcasts to Apple Podcasts. Consequently, we’re starting to see some chatter and speculation that Apple may keep the train moving and call its next-gen device the Apple iPhone; simple, clear, and unburdened by a legacy of numerical suffixes. The only problem with this idea is that the iPhone is a device that gets updated every single year. In turn, the numerical suffixes are not only helpful when discerning between two devices, they’re essential for both consumer comprehension and Apple’s advertising efforts. If Apple calls its 2017 flagship iPhone the Apple iPhone, what happens when Apple rolls out a new model the next year, or the year after that? If Apple goes this route, it would effectively be sacrificing long-term clarity for short-term simplicity. Interestingly enough, Ken Segall — a marketing legend who worked closely with Steve Jobs on a number of iconic Apple ad campaigns — recently planted a flag in favor of iPhone simplicity. In a recent blogpost, Segall suggests a new naming scheme that would arguably make the iPhone lineup much easier to comprehend. Wouldn’t it be great if each name indicated the phone’s reason for being, and reassured buyers that it contained Apple’s latest technology? Imagine if Tim Cook took to the stage in September to introduce this year’s family of iPhones— • iPhone 8 • iPhone 8 Plus • iPhone 8 Pro • iPhone 8 Mini In this naming scheme, customers could choose a “standard” iPhone 8, a large-screen version, a bigger, more feature-rich pro model, and a beautifully scaled-down thin/light model. Strip away the 8 from every model and it gets even simpler. This is the Great iPhone Naming Opportunity of 2017. As the family of iPhones becomes more diverse, this is the perfect moment to cast off the complexity and give customers an easier choice. This is an interesting take as it completely negates the problems associated with Apple releasing two iPhone 7s devices alongside a flagship device with a completely different naming pattern. It also negates the issues that would arise by calling the next-gen iPhone the Apple iPhone. What’s more, there’s a case to be made for abandoning the ‘S’ naming convention altogether. Rightly or wrongly, ‘S’ upgrades are often viewed as tepid updates that are far less compelling than traditional updates a’la the iPhone 4, 5, 6, and last year’s iPhone 7. All that being said, I think Segall is on the right track here, though the iPhone 8 Mini moniker still seems a bit off. If Apple kept the iPhone SE around alongside the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and the OLED-based iPhone 8 Pro, I think that would really help streamline Apple’s increasingly complex product matrix. If anything, it’s certainly something worth pondering as the iPhone 8 release date (old habits die hard) draws closer and closer. Apple may not need to adjust its iPhone naming scheme, but with the OLED-based iPhone on the horizon, if there were ever an ideal time for Apple to do away with the old and welcome the new, 2017 would be that time.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Facebook Messenger Is Getting An Apple Music And Spotify Extension By Ali Salman Apr 18, 2017 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Facebook is not reluctant to announce new changes in its platforms, even if it includes blatantly ripping off Snapchat Stories. Today, the company has announced a plethora of changes for its Messenger app including the new ways for applications to integrate with it. The announcements were made on the company’s annual F8 developer conference. If you’re excited just yet, one of the partners standing out was Apple Music and Spotify. So lets dive in to see some more details on the subject. Facebook Messenger To Integrate With Apple Music And Spotify If you’re in for a deeper insight on the scenario, the feature will basically allow users to link to Apple Music and Spotify and share songs and playlists directly within the Facebook Messenger app. At this point in time, Apple did not detail any method for how its chat extensions will work. Spotify on the other hand detailed in a blog post about the Spotify chat extension. More or less, Apple Music’s chat extensions will work in a similar way. Related Can’t Get Enough GIFs? Giphy Now Lets You Add GIFs in Facebook Live, Camera & Messenger Facebook announced the feature at its annual F8 developer conference. While Messenger’s new music sharing feature will ship with Spotify integration, Apple Music integration is committed to  be integrated in the days to come. Advertisement Facebook is already integrated with Apple Music in the main app with the feature that lets you share songs called Music Stories. The feature basically allows users to share songs through Apple Music to Facebook feed. The music is previewed in line and can be opened directly in the Apple Music app. Using Spotify chat extensions, users will have the ability to search and share Spotify songs, playlists and albums. The links will play the 30 second preview of the song, while tapping on it will open the full song. The Spotify bot will offer playlist recommendations to users based on their mood, genre and activity. Currently, we’re not sure if Apple will introduce a feature similar to this one. Related Instagram Now Adds Offline Support For Android While Apple Music already offers a music sharing feature, the Facebook integration comes through the Messenger app. Since the feature is not yet available, you can also check out the extension that performs the same features right away. Apple Music is available on iOS as well as Android, so all platforms will adhere to the arrival of the feature. There will be more to the story, so be sure to stay tuned in for that. This is it for now folks. What are your thoughts on Apple Music and Spotify integration in the Facebook Messenger app?

By Agamoni Ghosh April 20, 2017 05:41 BST Apple has over the years faced several bans and enquiries related to its app store in China Dale de la Rey/AFP/Getty Images Apple is facing an enquiry in China following allegations that some third-party apps available on its App Store may have broadcast censored content, including pornography, forbidden by Chinese law. Internet regulators in Beijing are set to question the iPhone maker after authorities ordered three Chinese live streaming websites to rectify management loopholes and content. Toutiao.com, huoshanzhibo.com and huajiao.com have been found guilty of violating four different regulations concerning internet related information services, live-streaming services and online performance, according to the Beijing Cyberspace Administration. Xinhua reports that law enforcement officers have already met representatives from Apple with regards to examining live stream apps available on its store. The US tech giant is likely to be handed a summons to tighten up checks on apps available on its App Store. While Apple may have no direct link with any of them, all apps accepted on the App store come under the company's management. If the management of these apps is found to be violating Chinese law, the company may even have to pay a fine in future. Apple has had to alter its App Store for China and remove many apps to comply with the country's censorship and internet regulatory laws. In January, the company removed the New York Times app from its Chinese app store after authorities requested the company to do so.

A few days ago, Slashleaks and Onleaks managed to post images of what appears to be a design drawing for the tenth anniversary iPhone. Now, another one surfaced yesterday courtesy of Sonny Dickson. In his Twitter post, Dickson added an image of what appears to be the back casing design of an iPhone. The Apple logo is clearly visible and directly underneath it is a circular cutout. A lot of speculations suggest that the the cutout will be for the TouchID fingerprint sensor of the iPhone 8. Another speculation from Mac Rumors suggests that the circular cutout could be for the supposed “wireless” charging feature of the phone. However, in this case, the said feature will use a contact-based design just like the Apple Smart Connectors or the Qi standard. iPhone 8 looks to be taking a new direction pic.twitter.com/mG19bcDYiC — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 19, 2017 From the image, it can also be seen that the camera arrangement is now vertical. This has been rumoured many times, even the recent Bloomberg article says the new arrangement will favor better imaging quality. The bit that is quite interesting though is the idea of the connector port at the bottom of the image. It would seem that the opening is far bigger compared to a standard Lightning port opening. This is why many are speculating that it might turn out to be a standard USB Type-C port instead of the usual Lightning port that Apple uses on the new iPhones. Finally, it is also quite obvious that the design is slightly bigger than the iPhone 7. Also, is it bigger than the dimensions shown on some of the earlier leaked images of the iPhone 8. Unfortunately, it feels like this design is more likely to use an aluminum base instead of what Bloomberg and other pundits believe to be stainless steel. But then again, this is probably just one of the many prototypes that are rumored to be under test from Apple at the moment. For more updates on the iPhone 8, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

However, there’s still no word about its jailbreak counterpart, not even the long due stable iOS 10.2 jailbreak tool. While many publications are claiming a legit one is underway, there’s really nothing concrete that jailbreak hopefuls can count on at this point. Notorious hacker Luca Todesco’s silence is killing the community’s optimism as well. We can recall Todesco, the brain behind Yalu jailbreaking tools declared he will no longer work on jailbreaks after giving a revamped iOS 10.2 version. He even made fun of those who thought another jailbreak will arrive soon on the notion that iOS 10.3 is nearly impossible to jailbreak. Prior to his hiatus tweet, Todesco said he could finalize his Yalu102 jailbreak and add support to the iPhone 7 series or resolve the solution’s 7-day signing issue at least. It is in collaboration with Cydia creator Jay Freeman, better known as Saurik. Unfortunately, both Todesco and Saurik haven’t given an update so far, and the radio silence in effect apparently suggests that the jailbreak status quo will remain stagnant for quite some time. Are we still getting those iOS 10.2 & 10.3 jailbreaking tools? Now, as a stable iOS 10.2 jailbreak seems to be unlikely, the idea of cracking Apple’s operating system moving forward indeed appears to be very difficult, if not impossible. But are the latest versions of Apple iOS really impossible to be jailbroken? The answer lies on the new Apple File System (APFS) which replaced the existing HFS+ file system on the iOS. Does it support root access? If not, then jailbreak hopefuls can forget about getting another cracking tool. If yes, then the jailbreak community survives. But again, there’s no future for Yalu jailbreak when it comes to later versions. What about other Jailbreak teams? There’s no need to worry, though, as reliable jailbreak teams Taig, Pangu, and PP will still be working to jailbreak iOS devices. Unfortunately, there’s still no progress about their tools. They’ve been tight-lipped like Todesco, but rumors have it they could already be sitting quietly on exploits they can use, waiting for the right time and not wanting to announce their intentions until they are ready.   The teams have a history of making surprise releases so there’s a chance it will be the case for the iOS 10.2/10.3 jailbreak. What are our other options for now? Todesco has long advised jailbreak seekers to stay on iOS 10.2.1 mainly because it is the latest iOS version running on HFS+ where root access is available. That said, there’s a higher chance that someone or some group might come up with a jailbreak tool for this version in the near future. Hopefuls can only keep their fingers crossed. What’s certain now is that APFS will remain the centerpiece not only of the official iOS 10.3.2 release but also of the future versions, including the iOS 11 which Apple is set to release in the coming months. Apple iOS 11 Apple, according to BGR, may no longer support 32-bit apps in the new iOS 11. This means developers have to upgrade their apps to 64-bit if they want them to work on iOS devices when the new update is up. The demise of 32-bit app support has long been an inevitability. The tech giant has already warned developers this past January, with the first beta release of iOS 10 that 32-bit apps may not work with iOS in its future version. Other than that, iOS 11 will likely include a completely enhanced version of Siri, a long overdue Dark Mode, advanced augmented reality features, advanced facial recognition, and support for multi-user FaceTime calls.

Thursday, April 20, 2017 Latest: Obstacles Facing Improved US-Russian Relations – Analysis Punjab’s Jingoist Mob Boss Rages Against Canadian Defense Minister – OpEd The Future Of Mexico: The Other Mexican Border – Analysis Sustainability: Beware Of Greenwashing – Analysis US State Dept Sued Over Funding Soros Operations In Macedonia – OpEd Eurasia Review A Journal of Analysis and News News Opinion Analysis Business Social Religion Entertainment Environment Technology About Editorial Staff Authors and Partners Contact Submit an Article Buzz Future Privacy Policy And Terms Of Use Chris Chappell of China Uncensored 1 Entertainment Social Issues  Apple TV Censors ‘China Uncensored’ Show April 20, 2017 Eurasia Review 0 Comment Apple, Censorship, China, East Asia, Film, Free Speech, Internet, Media, Telecommunications By Eurasia Review Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has condemned Apple’s blocking of the satirical Web TV show China Uncensored not only in Mainland China, but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Apple’s extension of its blocking to territories not subject to Chinese law is a dangerous example of international corporate submission to the demands of Chinese censorship. According to RSF, the consumer electronics giant seems to have had no hesitation about making generous concessions to China’s authoritarian regime in order to keep itself afloat in the Chinese market. That at least is the impression one gets from its decision last month to make China Uncensored available on the Apple TV app everywhere except China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. China Uncensored, which can also be seen on YouTube, openly sets out to combat Chinese propaganda. It mocks the regime, carries news about dissidents and persecuted minorities and is produced by New York-based New Tang Dynasty Television (NTD.TV), which is affiliated to the Falun Gong, a religious movement that is persecuted in China. Is Apple scared of the Chinese authorities? “We vehemently condemn this unacceptable act of censorship and we are alarmed by the apparent insouciance with which Apple, one of the giants of online programme distribution, seems ready to sacrifice freedom of information for the sake of its market share”, said Cédric Alviani, the head of RSF’s Taipei bureau, which covers Northern Asia. China is Apple’s second biggest market, after the United States and before Europe. But it is a market in which nothing can be taken for granted. Last year, Apple suffered a major fall in its sales and in its share of the Chinese market to its Chinese rivals. Is Apple trying to ingratiate itself with the Chinese authorities in the wake of these setbacks? Apple has already made a habit of withdrawing certain apps from the Apple Store in China on the grounds of complying with local law. But this is new. This time Apple is taking its self-censorship much further, and including territories not subject to Chinese law. Chinese censorship on the rise Content blocking in response to a formal request from the Chinese government is unfortunately not new. Apple removed the New York Times app from the Apple Store in China last January, but the app remained available in its Hong Kong and Taiwan stories. Chris Chappell, China Uncensored’s host, said: “I totally understand why we’re blocked in Mainland China. We’re clearly disrupting the Communist Party’s harmonious propaganda…but Hong Kong and Taiwan are not supposed to be under Chinese law.” Although China recovered sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, the territory has Special Administrative Region status which explicitly guarantees freedom of expression. Although China claims sovereignty over Taiwan, it has functioned in practice as a sovereign state known as the Republic of China for half a century. “Taiwan and Hong Kong represent two alternative models of Chinese-culture societies, ones with a well-established tradition of freedom of expression,” Alviani added. “Blocking a Web TV show critical of Mainland Chinese propaganda in these territories is no small matter.” An accommodating attitude that could spread RSF condemns Apple’s subservience to the Chinese regime, which could encourage other international content providers to censor themselves in exchange for commercial advantages from the Chinese authorities. The behaviour of Apple, which has its headquarters in Cupertino, California, is all the more incomprehensible because it is one of the world’s most powerful multinationals, one that made more than 46 billion dollars in profit last year alone. When contacted by RSF, Apple declined to comment. “We do not issue statements in response to this kind of information,” a spokesperson said. Censoring content and blocking freedom of information is obviously not the best kind of public relations. China continues to be ranked almost at the bottom of RSF’s World Press Freedom Index (176th out of 180 countries), while Taiwan and Hong Kong are ranked 51st and 69th respectively. ← Where Individual’s Data Security And Law Enforcement Needs Meet Syria: US Mosque Attack Likely Unlawful, Says HRW → You May Also Like The Role Of New Media And Communication Technologies In Arab Transitions – Analysis December 10, 2011 FRIDE 0 2015 BRICS-SCO Summits In Ufa: New Developments In Multilateralism – Analysis July 20, 2015 Alvin Cheng-Hin Lim 0 Red State China?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile 5 ways the Galaxy S8 is better than the iPhone 7 Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Zach Epstein @zacharye April 18th, 2017 at 11:25 AM Share Tweet With just three days to go before the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are officially released, the buzz surrounding Samsung’s next-generation flagship phones has reached new heights. I published my in-depth Galaxy S8 review earlier on Tuesday, and I made my feelings perfectly clear: Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the best Android phones of all time, hands down. In terms of hardware and design, they’re the best smartphones, period. That’s right, Samsung managed to pull off the unthinkable and out-design Apple for the first time ever. For a deep dive into Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, definitely be sure to check out BGR’s full review. In this supplemental post, we’ll cover five key ways the Galaxy S8 is better than the iPhone 7. Don't Miss: Samsung Galaxy S8 review: Meet the envy of every iPhone user Display Design The screen is obviously one of the most important components in any smartphone since it’s still the primary means of displaying content and interacting with content. And in the case of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, the display is the star of the show in so many ways. Beginning with the phone’s design, Samsung has managed to increase the screen-to-body ratio on its new phones to an impressive 83%. That compares with a screen-to-body ratio of just 66% on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Are these ratios really that important? You won’t be able to fully appreciate it until you experience it for yourself, but the answer is yes. Apart from looking much better, the user experience on the Galaxy S8 is so much more immersive than it is on the iPhone 7. It feels like you’re holding content in your hand, not a phone. Apple’s upcoming new iPhone 8 is expected to adopt a similar design that is nearly all screen but until then, the Galaxy S8 has the upper hand in a big way. Display Quality This won’t come as much of a surprise to anyone who has ever used a Samsung flagship phone before, but the Galaxy S8’s screen advantage extends well beyond design. In terms of display quality, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ have no equal. Samsung’s Super AMOLED screens on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are simply stunning. They both have the same QHD+ resolution so the 5.8-inch screen on the smaller Galaxy S8 model actually has better pixel density than the larger 6.2-inch display on the Galaxy S8+. The difference is pretty big on paper — 570 ppi vs. 529 ppi — but I doubt even someone with 20/20 vision would be able to notice any difference at a normal viewing distance. In terms of comparing these screens to the displays on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, it couldn’t be easier: Samsung’s screens are better in every way. Blacks are deeper, colors are more vivid, the resolution is better, the contrast is better, and the clarity is better. Samsung has absolutely hit yet another home run with its Galaxy S8 and S8+ screens. Curved Edges Samsung’s first curved smartphones was a total gimmick that should not have existed. The Note Edge was the company’s first smartphone with a curved screen (on one side only), and it was also a gimmick that was next to useless. The curves on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are far from useless, however. They’re awesome. In terms of software features, the only benefit afforded by the curved screen on the S8 is an option that makes the exposed edges light up with incoming calls when the phone is face-down on a table or desk. Yeah, it’s not exactly Earth-shattering. The real benefit of the curved sides on the front and back of the phone is usability. The Galaxy S8+ is about the same width as the iPhone 7 Plus, and it’s actually a bit thicker than the 7 Plus at its center. But with one hand, I can comfortably reach from one side of the S8+’s display to the other. And Samsung’s rounded sides on the front and back don’t just extend the user’s reach, hey help the S8 and S8+ sit comfortably in the hand. It’s an awesome design. Charging Charging certainly isn’t the first thing that comes to mind when you weigh the pros and cons of a smartphone. But if you stop for a moment and really think about it, this is a hugely important part of the user experience. We charge our phones each and every day, so the speed a phone can charge and the convenience with which it can be charged are actually a very big deal. The Galaxy S8 supports multiple fast charging standards. The iPhone 7 does not. The Galaxy S8 supports wireless charging, and even fast wireless charging. The iPhone 7 does not. Long story short, Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ charge much faster than their iPhone counterparts, and they also have bigger batteries. Google Assistant Siri has come a long way since it was first introduced, and there’s no question that Apple’s virtual personal assistant is solely responsible for the recent explosion in similar solutions from rival companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Samsung. As an iPhone user, however, I really enjoyed the personal assistant on Samsung’s Galaxy S8+ while I was reviewing it. No, not Bixby. Sure, Samsung’s own personal assistant solution shows promise, but its inability to support English-language voice commands at launch makes it a non-starter for the time being. I’m talking about Google Assistant, the latest evolution of Google’s assistant software. These AI driven assistants are always evolving, but Google’s young Assistant solution has already surpassed Siri in many ways. I often find that Siri gets confused, has trouble with context, or just flat-out gets things wrong when I ask it a question or speak a command. Google Assistant, on the other hand, is far more consistent and accurate. This is a big check in the Galaxy S8’s box for me.

Apple expanding successful Search Ads to three new English-speaking markets Ads will begin serving in the UK, Australia and New Zealand on April 25. Greg Sterling on April 19, 2017 at 7:12 pm More Apple launched app-store Search Ads in October 2016. Since that time they’ve received praise from developers as a high-converting, high-value app discovery tool. Today the company is announcing that Search Ads will become available in the UK, Australia and NZ. The booking UI opens today and ad serving begins on April 25. Developers running campaigns in the US will be able to clone their ads for the new markets. AppsFlyer issued the following assessment about Search Ads’ performance in a report issued earlier this year: [Apple had] the best retention in iOS North America, while proving their ability to scale with the third highest number of installs of non-gaming apps. With the strongest debut index performance we have seen to date, Apple came in #3 in the Power Ranking in question. Beyond strong retention metrics, Apple said that, on average, its Search Ads are seeing conversion rates of greater than 50 percent, meaning that half the time a user clicks an ad there’s an install. The company also said that average user-acquisition costs are $1 or less. This compares very favorably with competitors’ metrics, although costs-per-install vary widely by geography and app category. According to some third party estimates, the average CPI on Facebook is in excess of $3. One of the reasons for the success of Search Ads, the company says, is the focus on ad relevance, which is given priority over bid price. Effectively there’s no way for a less relevant app-install ad to beat a more relevant one with higher bidding. In this way the company hopes to keep the playing field more level for smaller developers. Because Apple doesn’t rely on advertising to generate significant revenue it can afford to heavily prioritize relevance over spend. The app-install market, which represents a substantial component of mobile advertising revenue today, is north of five billion dollars.

By: Shilpa Published: Thursday, April 20, 2017, 9:00 [IST] We know how Apple tries to come up with new designs and features in their upcoming model every time. Now, they are planning to release such three new iPhones this fall. Two among them is said to be upgraded version of the previous model whereas, the last one is a completely new handset with renovated look. The company is planning on integrating new screen, stainless steel body, curved glass as well as an improvised version of the camera in the new model. We have come across many such rumors and leaks online. Few sources even claimed that the redesigned phone will take some more months to see the limelight. Rumors say that the new premium model will have larger display compared to previous models. According to them, Apple is testing new screen for that model which is said to cover the front of the device entirely and also the home button will be integrated into the screen itself. This makes it look similar to Samsung Galaxy S8 design. Also Read: Apple's iMovie, iWork and GarageBand apps are made free for everyone They are also said to include the fingerprint scanner in the screen which may be technically challenging for the company. Because even Samsung had the same plan in the earlier stage, but after coming across few difficulties, they moved it to the back of the phone. The other two phones which are said to be the upgraded version of previous iPhones will have the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen size like iPhone 7 and 7 Plus with LCD technology. On the other hand, the newly renovated phone will use an OLED technology. The company has already tested such new prototypes with some partners in Asia. Also Read: iPhone 8 is reported to come with glass sandwich design and flat OLED display One prototype design speaks about the display having symmetrical, slightly curved glass on both front and back of the device. There was another prototype which had a steel frame, little-curved front, and back made up of glass with curves on top and bottom. They have also tested a simple design which had an aluminum back and a slightly larger size. For now, the company is said to ship OLED panels from Samsung since others are not capable of supplying 100 million of panels to them. Like other recently released smartphones, even Apple is testing dual-camera setup on the back which will be positioned vertically. The same concept was used in iPhone 7 Plus but with a horizontal position. According to their experiments, the vertically positioned dual-camera will be able to capture best snaps. Also Read: Apple TV rumored to get new features with tvOS 11; multi-user support expected Some even say that new models may come with the slight bump on the camera which is currently present in other iPhones. Speaking of the front camera, it may feature the dual lenses, unlike previous models which just had the single front camera. The company also plans of packing all new iPhones with the latest iOS 11 which will be announced this June at an annual developer conference.

By LoisWeiss The iconic glass cube at Apple’s Fifth Avenue flagship store is coming down — at least temporarily. New York City issued a permit on April 12 for work described as “full removal of glass cubical structure at Apple store entrance” at the 767 Fifth Ave. plaza. The $2 million job requires a site safety manager with the removal to be done by Englewood, NJ-based Waldorf Exteriors. BuildZoom, which recommends contractors, first reported the permit filing on its site. Executives from Boston Properties, which owns the former GM Building where the store is located, and the Apple media reps did not return calls prior to deadline. Officials from the construction companies declined to comment. All have signed documents saying they would not discuss the project, one executive admitted before hanging up. The delicate glass cube removal is believed to be part of general renovations and expansion of the underground store. Apple AAPL, -0.37%   is planning to expand the flagship to 77,000 square feet, up from its existing 32,000 square feet, according to MacRumors. Apple has relocated to the vacant space on the ground floor of the building (formerly occupied by FAO Schwarz) while renovations are underway, the site reported. So far, no permits have been issued to reinstall the glass cube, which has become selfie central for tourists.

Police, cyberspace administration and cultural law enforcement team will jointly summon Apple, state news agency Xinhua reported, as part of a wider crackdown on live-streaming video services. The three Chinese government agencies planned to tell Apple to “tighten up checks” on software offered on its app store. Law enforcement officers had already met with Apple representatives over live-streaming services, Xinhua reported, but did not provide details of the meetings. The real secret of Chinese internet censorship? Distraction | John Naughton Read more The inquiry appears to be focused on third-party apps available for download through Apple’s online marketplace. The company did not respond to requests for comment. China operates the world’s largest internet censorship regime, blocking a host of foreign websites including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, but the authorities have struggled to control an explosion in popularity of live-streaming video apps. China accounted for almost a quarter of Apple’s worldwide revenue in the company’s most recent financial quarter, and the app store is increasingly important as sales of iPhones and iPad in China slow. Over the past year, Apple has twice been forced to shut or remove services from China at the government’s request. As part of the inquiry into live-streaming, three Chinese websites – toutiao.com, huoshanzhibo.com and huajiao.com – were already found to have violated internet regulations, and had broadcast content that violated Chinese law, including providing “pornographic content”, the Xinhua report said. Pornography is banned in China. The three sites were told to increase oversight of live-broadcasting services, user registration and “the handling of tips-offs”. Two of the websites, huoshanzhibo.com and huajiao.com, were under formal investigation and may have their cases transferred to the police for criminal prosecutions, the Xinhua report said. Rules issued by China’s cyberspace administration in June 2016 ban apps from “publishing or disseminating prohibited information or content”. Casting a wide net, the regulations state that apps cannot “engage in activities prohibited by laws and regulations such as endangering national security, disrupting social order and violating the legitimate rights and interests of others”. A recent survey showed American businesses in China are facing one of the toughest climates in decades, largely due to increasing animosity towards foreign firms and slowing economic growth. Barriers to investment remain high, the American Chamber of Commerce in China said, despite China’s attempts to project an image of globalisation and openness, and about 81% of the chamber’s members said they felt unwelcome in 2016, an increase from 77% in 2015. In December, Apple removed the New York Times app from its store in China after a government request. The newspaper’s website has been blocked in China since 2012 after it published a story detailing the wealth of former prime minister Wen Jiabao and his family. Last year, authorities also forced Apple to shutter its iBooks and iTunes movie platforms in China, where print and online media is tightly controlled.

Serial Apple leaker Sonny Dickson is at it again, and this time he has shared what appears to be part of the plans of the iPhone 8. Dickson, who has a history of more than three years of leaking details of the pre-released iPhones, today has shared what could be confirmation of some Apple fans worst fear about the flagship iPhone 8 to be released later this year. The schematic, which a watermark suggests has been obtained through the Chinese social network QC, appears to reveal the design details of the rear panel of the iPhone 8. If the schematic is accurate, then it seems to be proof that Apple has found it too hard to keep the TouchID fingerprint scanner on the front of the phone and moved it to the rear. iPhone 8 looks to be taking a new direction pic.twitter.com/mG19bcDYiC— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 19, 2017 The schematic shows that the phone has dual camera lenses running vertically down the phone, rather than across the back of the phone as with the current iPhone 7 Plus design. It also shows the location of what is most likely to be the fingerprint scanner beneath the Apple logo - and not included in the Apple logo which some iPhone fans including analyst Carolina Milanesi had raised as a possibility. The sketch shows a iPhone case design that measures 72.497mm wide and 149.501mm tall - which would make the iPhone 8 about 1mm wider than the current iPhone 7 and about 1cm taller. A slimmer and longer iPhone would be in line with the new look Samsung Galaxy S8. Continued below. Related Content Tradies have an easier time getting on the property ladder, industry insiders say Little v Hagamans: Ailing hotelier centre of closing arguments Your Views: Readers Letters The new screen shape reinforces the expectation that the iPhone 8 will have a larger 5.8-inch OLED that will be nearly edge-to-edge in design - or, in other words, a screen about the size of the iPhone 7 Plus in a phone about the size of the iPhone 7. While this appears to be the biggest leak so far about Apple's plans for the iPhone 8, there are reasons to be cautious. Dickson has a good track record on leaks, but this could be wrong. It could either be a design that Apple tried and rejected for the iPhone 8, given we know Apple tries out various models before it commits to a final design. With no indication of the source, it is impossible to confirm that it is even a genuine sketch of an Apple design. Yesterday, there was a warning by analyst Andy Hargreaves at Pacific Crest Securities that Apple would have to delay the iPhone 8 if it could not either solve how to incorporate a fingerprint scanner into the screen or settle with the design compromise of putting the fingerprint scanner on the rear of the phone. While many smartphones have the fingerprint scanner on the rear of the phone, one of the downsides of the design is that you cannot unlock your phone while it is sitting on a desk. - news.com.au Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

By: Shilpa Published: Thursday, April 20, 2017, 8:00 [IST] Here is a good news for all Mac OS and iOS users. Apple made few of their apps totally free as of now. Apps like iMovie, Numbers, Keynote, Pages and GarageBand for both the Mac and iOS devices have been made free and you can download it in the App Store now without paying any money. Before these apps were given free only to the customers who purchased a new Apple devices like Mac or iOS. This was in practice since 2013. Now the company made few changes in the offer. One can get those apps free of cost without making any such purchase. Earlier the owners of the old device had to pay some bucks to install those apps. But, now it is not the case. Also Read: Google Maps update for iOS adds location sharing, new directions widget iOS users had to pay $4.99 for iMovie and Garageband whereas, $9.99 for each iWork apps. Mac apps were more expensive compared to the iOS. iMovie was costing $14.99 and Pages, Numbers, and Keynote were available at $19.99 each. But there is another thing to be noticed. Apple's iWork page have not updated this information and it still asks the customers to buy the new device to avail the Pages, Keynote, and Numbers app for free. They may soon update their page and so one don't have to worry about it. Now by dropping the price to free, it made those apps open to everyone. So, you can try these apps by yourself if you own Mac or iOS device. This change made by the company will surely be useful for educational institutions and businesses.

The company yesterday rolled out the technology powering Alexa, its voice assistant that competes with Apple Inc’s Siri, to developers so they can build chat features into their own apps, CTO Werner Vogels said in an interview. The service, Amazon Lex, was in a preview phase since late 2016. The move underscores how Amazon is racing to be the top player in voice-controlled computing, after losing out in mobile to Apple and Alphabet Inc’s Google. Vogels said that Amazon’s headway in processing how humans write and speak would make conversational assistants or “chatbots” more helpful than the clunky tools they’ve been in the past. “There’s massive acceleration happening here,” he said before speaking at Amazon’s cloud-computing summit in San Francisco. “The cool thing about having this running as a service in the cloud instead of in your own data centre or on your own desktop is that we can make Lex better continuously by the millions of customers that are using it.” Processing vast quantities of data is key to artificial intelligence, which lets voice assistants decode speech. Amazon will take the text and recordings people send to apps to train Lex - as well as Alexa — to understand more queries. That could help Amazon catch up in data collection. As popular as Amazon’s Alexa-powered devices are, such as Echo speakers, the company has sold an estimated 10 million or more. Apple has sold hundreds of millions of iPhones and other devices with Siri. Vogels said people use Alexa for many tasks, from helping them cook to playing music, while they talk to assistants on their phones in fewer scenarios like when driving a car. As with other cloud-based services, Amazon will charge developers based on how many text or voice requests Lex processes. Still, the biggest payoff may come from e-commerce, which has already attracted many to build chatbots. Amazon has begun offering Alexa-only shopping deals to encourage purchases by voice, and Facebook Inc this week said its virtual assistant, called M, can help users order food from delivery.com. “Voice is a big part of the computer interface of the future,” said Gene Munster, a veteran equity analyst and now head of research at Loup Ventures. “Whoever owns voice will be the gateway of commerce.” — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Olympic Council welcomes eSports at Asian Games, ‘Fifa 2017’ named Could 18:9 displays become the new smartphone standard?

By LoisWeiss The iconic glass cube at Apple’s Fifth Avenue flagship store is coming down — at least temporarily. New York City issued a permit on April 12 for work described as “full removal of glass cubical structure at Apple store entrance” at the 767 Fifth Ave. plaza. The $2 million job requires a site safety manager with the removal to be done by Englewood, NJ-based Waldorf Exteriors. BuildZoom, which recommends contractors, first reported the permit filing on its site. Executives from Boston Properties, which owns the former GM Building where the store is located, and the Apple media reps did not return calls prior to deadline. Officials from the construction companies declined to comment. All have signed documents saying they would not discuss the project, one executive admitted before hanging up. The delicate glass cube removal is believed to be part of general renovations and expansion of the underground store. Apple AAPL, -0.37%   is planning to expand the flagship to 77,000 square feet, up from its existing 32,000 square feet, according to MacRumors. Apple has relocated to the vacant space on the ground floor of the building (formerly occupied by FAO Schwarz) while renovations are underway, the site reported. So far, no permits have been issued to reinstall the glass cube, which has become selfie central for tourists.

Already home to a growing Apple data center campus and a massive Switch SuperNap, hosting eBay as the anchor tenant, Reno was recently selected by Google as the place where one of the cloud giant’s future data center campuses will go up. Cheap real estate, low taxes, a business-friendly regulatory environment, access to renewable energy, and proximity to Silicon Valley have all contributed to Reno’s rise as one of the fastest-growing new nerve centers of the cloud. Here’s a timeline of its rise: 2009 A developer called Unique Infrastructure Group sets out to create what is now called the Reno Technology Park. The plan was to prepare a 2,200-acre property just outside the city for data centers and other energy-intensive, technology-oriented buildings, such as semiconductor fabrication facilities. UIC would provide access to multiple different energy sources, including utility-scale renewables. View of the property outside of Reno now called the Reno Technology Park (Photo: Unique Infrastructure Group) June 2012 Apple’s decision to build a data center in Reno Technology Park is made public. The company is attracted to the location by plentiful real estate, city and state tax breaks, and access to power offered by RTP. The Apple data center campus in Reno has been expanding ever since. Access to renewable energy has been a prerequisite in the company’s data center site selection process, but, as it turned out, it was not as easy as the park’s developers had suggested it would be. Nevada is a regulated energy market, which made it difficult for the company to build its own renewable energy projects, dedicated to its data centers. In the end, Apple partnered with the local utility, NV Energy, to build its first solar farm there. Apple financed and built the project, while the utility operates it and acts as the energy provider.

Like Apple, Switch had a tough time securing renewable energy for its new campus because of the state’s regulated market. The company even sued NV Energy and the state utility regulator, claiming it had been forced to sign a bad renewable energy purchase deal with the utility.

Anonymous sources tell The Wall Street Journal that the company plans to eventually build a data center on the property. Like other cloud giants, Google has been investing billions of dollars every quarter in growing data center infrastructure to support its enterprise cloud services.

Apple is preparing three iPhones for launch as soon as this autumn, including upgraded versions of the current two iPhone models and a new top-of-the-line handset with an overhauled look, according to a source. Apple is testing a new type of screen, curved glass and stainless steel materials, and more advanced cameras, the sources said. Those anxiously awaiting the redesigned iPhone, however, may have to wait because supply constraints could mean the device isn't readily available until one or two months after the typical autumn introduction. The iPhone is Apple's most important product, representing about two-thirds of sales. It also leads customers to buy other Apple devices like the iPad and Apple Watch, and serves as a home for lucrative services like the App Store. This year's new iPhone line-up comes at a critical time. Last year, Apple broke its typical upgrade cycle by retaining the same iPhone shape for a third year in a row and endured a rare sales slide. Samsung's new S8 line-up has also been thus far well received after last year's Note 7 battery débâcle. For the premium model, Apple is testing a screen that covers almost the entire front of the device. That results in a display slightly larger than that of the iPhone 7 Plus but an overall size closer to the iPhone 7, the people said. Apple is also aiming to reduce the overall size of the handset by integrating the home button into the screen itself via software in a similar manner to Samsung's S8, the people said. The overhauled iPhone will use an organic light-emitting diode display that more accurately shows colours, while the other two phones will continue to use liquid crystal display technology and come in the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes as last year's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, sources said. iPhone feature and design plans are still in flux and can change, they added. Apple has tested multiple prototypes with manufacturing partners in Asia, including some versions that use curved glass and stainless steel, according to one source. One of the latest prototype designs includes symmetrical, slightly curved glass on the front and the back. The curves are similar in shape to those on the front of the iPhone 7. The new OLED screen itself is flat, while the cover glass curves into a steel frame. The design is similar conceptually to the iPhone 4 from 2010. An earlier prototype design had a thinner steel band, leaving more noticeable curved glass on the sides. Apple also tested a more ambitious prototype with the same slightly curved front and steel frame, but a glass back with more dramatic curves on the top and bottom like the original iPhone design from 2007. Apple suppliers have so far struggled to reliably produce heavily curved glass in mass quantities, so the company is more likely to ship the version with more subdued curves, a source said. The company is also rumoured to be testing a simpler design that has an aluminium back, rather than a glass one, and slightly larger dimensions. Because of its early lead in the mobile OLED display space, Samsung will enjoy a rare upper hand in this year's high-end smartphone contest. At launch, Apple will exclusively use Samsung Display OLED panels for the redesigned iPhone, as other suppliers won't be ready to supply mass quantities until later. Apple has ordered around 100m panels from Samsung, the people said. "This autumn, it would be three years since we had a remarkable shift in iPhone hardware. This raises expectations for this year's phone having a material change in functionality and look," said Gene Munster, co-founder of Loup Ventures and a veteran Apple analyst. "The Samsung Galaxy S8 raises the bar for Apple to hit a home run." Apple and Samsung declined to comment. Apple has also experimented with integrating the iPhone's fingerprint scanner into the screen of the OLED version, which would be technically challenging, the people said. Samsung also tried this approach for the S8, but ended up installing a more standard fingerprint reader on the back of its phone due to the challenges. Camera changes are also in testing. For the back of the phone, Apple is testing versions with the dual-camera system positioned vertically, instead of horizontally like on the iPhone 7 Plus, which could result in better photos. Some prototypes continue to include the slight camera bump found on current iPhones, rather than having them flush with the back surface. For the front-camera, Apple is testing dual-lenses, one source said. The current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have single front cameras. As it has done in the past, Apple is using camera components from Sony, the person added. Apple has explored adding augmented reality-based features and depth-of-field enhancements to its camera system All the new iPhones will run iOS 11, a mobile operating system that will include a refreshed user-interface and is set to be announced in June at the company's annual conference for developers. Apple has been testing using faster processors based on a smaller 10-nanometer production process for all three new models. That's down from 16 nanometers for existing iPhones. The smaller processors are more efficient, allowing Apple to retain its battery life standards while adding more advanced features.

Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Specific information regarding Apple’s acquisition of the documentary are unclear at this point. It’s unknown how much Apple paid for the rights, nor is it clear as to when or how Apple plans to release the film. It seems unlikely that Apple would release “Clive Davis: The Soundtrack of Our Lives” theatrically, instead it will likely focus on a digital release via Apple Music. Today’s report does specify that Apple Music is behind the acquisition, which makes sense given the focus on musician Clive Davis. This also further suggests that it will be released via Apple Music rather than in theaters. “Clive Davis: The Soundtrack of Our Lives” is directed by Chris Perkel and based on the 2013 autobiography from Davis. The film was produced by Michael Bernstein, while Ridley Scott and Mary Lisio were executive producers. IM Global’s Stuart Ford, David Schulhof, and Deborah Zipser also had a hand in producing. In an interview, Davis touted the Apple acquisition and said that he is “overjoyed” to work with the company on the film: “Apple is a global innovator that has revolutionized the distribution of music,” said Davis. “It is a touching honor to share the music and unique stories that have shaped my career with millions of Apple Music subscribers around the world. I am overjoyed to work with them to continue this incredible journey!” Apple itself has yet to comment on the acquisition of “Clive Davis: The Soundtrack of Our Lives,” but it does fall in line with the company’s strategy of making content acquisitions when they complement existing services, such as Apple Music. Apple also recently announced a new video concert series with George Stroumboulopoulos called “House of Strombo.” This show includes concert videos, interviews, behind-the-scenes content, and more. We’d expect Apple to make further announcements concerning the release and marketing sometime in the future.

However as it stands there are still some components of their products that aren’t quite as environmentally-friendly. This is because there are certain components that require the mining of the earth to get them, which like we said is hardly a green thing to do. However that’s something that Apple wants to change because in Apple’s 2017 Environment Responsibility Report, the company has pledged to one day reach the point where they can stop mining the earth altogether. According to Apple, “It sounds crazy, but we’re working on it. We’re moving toward a closed-loop supply chain. One day we’d like to be able to build new products with just recycled materials, including your old products.” However speaking to Vice in an interview, Apple VP of environment, policy, and social initiatives Lisa Jackson revealed that this is something that they’re still working on figuring out. According to Jackson, “We’re actually doing something we rarely do, which is announce a goal before we’ve completely figured out how to do it. So we’re a little nervous, but we also think it’s really important, because as a sector we believe it’s where technology should be going.” Filed in Apple >Cellphones >Computers >Green >Tablets.

The company outlined its aim to stop digging up new resources in its latest Environmental Responsibility Report (PDF), released today. In the document, Apple says that it plans to “one day” move to a closed-loop manufacturing system (in which it can get all the metals and rare earths it needs from recycle and reuse programs), but that it’s not entirely sure how to get to that point. That goal was backed up by an interview with Vice, in which Lisa Jackson — Apple’s VP of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives — said that the company was committing “to not necessarily having to source from the earth for everything that we need,” but that it didn’t have a complete roadmap yet. “We’re actually doing something we rarely do, which is announce a goal before we’ve completely figured out how to do it,” she said. For aluminum, it’s only using old Apple products The company says it already has schemes in place for some materials. For aluminum, it is relying on old Apple products — the only source of the metal on the market that it considers high enough grade to be reused in future iPhones, iPads, and other devices. For tin, however, it’s happy to use a more general supply, specifying that recycled material from other sources meets its quality standards. In working out which materials to prioritize, Apple created “Material Risk Profiles,” judging the environmental and social impact of obtaining the various resources it uses. It then weighed those profiles up against how it uses the materials, how often they are included in products, and where the company could make the most difference. The profiles aim to help Apple systematically tackle the sourcing of each material until mining for new resources is no longer necessary, but that transition won’t be immediate — not all of the materials used in Apple products even have recycling procedures in place yet. To that end, Apple says it also aims to drive improvements in the recycling industry, inventing new processes or sparking changes in policy that could see more metals, minerals, and rare earths drawn out of old devices. It points to “Liam” — a disassembly line of robots that can pull apart old iPhone 6 devices, saving far more of their precious innards than regular recycling processes like shredding are capable of — as an example of such new tech. The Liam robots can pull apart old iPhones quickly Apple’s move has been met with applause from environmental group Greenpeace. “This commitment, and Apple’s recent progress in transitioning its supply chain in Asia to renewable energy, puts it far ahead of others in the sector,” senior IT analyst Gary Cook said. “Major IT brands such as Samsung, Huawei, and Microsoft should quickly match Apple’s leadership, if they don’t want to risk falling even further behind.” But while Apple’s announcement sounds like a promise, the company offers no concrete commitment on when it will move to a 100-percent recycling manufacturing system saying only that it was “challenging” itself to end its reliance on mining. The company has made impressive steps in reducing its environmental footprint in recent years, but how fast it transitions to closed-loop production — or even whether it can — remains to be seen.

The screening will be followed by performances featuring Aretha Franklin, Jennifer Hudson and Earth, Wind & Fire. Apple did not disclose when it will release “Clive Davis: The Soundtrack of Our Lives” or whether it will have a theatrical release. The film is directed by Chris Perkel and based on Davis’ 2013 autobiography. The film is produced by Michael Bernstein of Scott Free Productions, with Ridley Scott and Mary Lisio executive producing alongside IM Global’s Stuart Ford, David Schulhof, and Deborah Zipser. IM Global announced during last year’s Cannes film Festival that it had come on board to finance the film. Davis became president of Columbia Records at the age of 35. He signed Donovan, who became a folk-rock star through Columbia’s Epic label, early on in his career. He went on to play a key role in the careers of Bruce Springsteen, Whitney Houston, Santana, Aretha Franklin, Bob Dylan, Aerosmith, Simon & Garfunkel, Janis Joplin, Chicago, Blood Sweat & Tears, the Kinks, the Grateful Dead and the Eurythmics. From 1967 to 1973, Davis was the president of Columbia Records. He was the founder and president of Arista Records from 1975 through 2000 before heading RCA Music Group. He’s currently chief creative officer of Sony Music Entertainment. Davis has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He also received The Recording Academy’s lifetime achievement award. “It is an incredible milestone to have a film about my life premiere on opening night of the Tribeca Film Festival in an iconic venue such as Radio City Music Hall,” Davis said in a statement. “It will be a moving celebration of music and artistry that hopefully will touch everyone.” The deal was negotiated by WME Global with assistance from attorney Craig Emmanuel of Loeb & Loeb on behalf of the filmmakers and General Counsel Zipser on behalf of IM Global.

By TheresePoletti Columnist Qualcomm Inc. had a pretty good quarter, but executives barely got to talk about it Wednesday as all eyes focused on the chipmaker’s problems with another tech giant. Qualcomm QCOM, -0.11%   beat analysts’ expectations with a quarterly earnings report Wednesday, but it was hard to tell on the conference call, where all but one question was about the communications-chip company’s complicated and potentially costly legal dispute with Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.37%   In January, Apple sued Qualcomm, a designer of chips used in the iPhone, for $1 billion, contending the company was demanding onerous terms for its technology licenses and that it had withheld rebate payments as punishment for Apple’s cooperation in a Korean regulatory probe of Qualcomm’s licensing practices. Qualcomm filed a countersuit last week that didn’t pull any punches. The ramifications of this fight dominated Qualcomm’s earnings release and call, in which Qualcomm admitted that contract manufacturers underpaid royalty payments in the fiscal second quarter to the tune of about $1 billion. Qualcomm’s accounts receivables soared in the quarter, to a deficit of $1.8 billion, up from $392 million in the year-ago period. The contract manufacturers acknowledged the amounts due and have binding deals, Qualcomm said to reassure investors. Don’t miss: Apple makes move that could improve its gadgets, but it won’t be easy While the lack of payments in the quarter was effectively canceled out by the money Qualcomm has withheld Apple in rebate payments, Qualcomm executives said they could not predict whether or not they will be underpaid again in the current quarter, leading to wider-than-normal earnings guidance. Analysts were clearly worried that contract manufacturers may continue to withhold payments, even though Qualcomm’s contract with Apple ended in December. “The agreement itself with Apple, which is where we have the dispute over what is owed to them, expired at the end of 2016, so it has really no relevance or impact to what the contract manufacturers would owe us for sales during the March quarter,” Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said. This is when driverless cars will hit the road(3:35) At CES in Las Vegas, tech executives, industry analysts and enthusiasts voiced different ideas about when self-driving cars would become widely available. MarketWatch took a spin in a semi-autonomous car to learn more about this emerging technology. The only question not pertaining to Apple in Wednesday’s call was about Qualcomm’s pending $39 billion megamerger with NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI, +0.89% which Qualcomm hopes will broaden its presence in advanced driver-assistance systems in autos, as well as self-driving cars. Nothing about the recent arbitration award won by BlackBerry Ltd., which led Qualcomm to announce standard and adjusted revenue, with the adjusted figure adding nearly $1 billion. No questions were asked about the business, other than whether the company was seeing other licensees question their licensing terms since the Apple suit. “The terms under those agreements, I think were grossly mischaracterized in Apple’s submissions,” Aberle said in response to that question. “So, yes, we’ve had to have some discussions with licensees to try to clarify what it is and isn’t, but I would say that’s sort of normal-course discussions we would typically have with companies.” The obvious concerns about manufacturers withholding payments and other customers following Apple’s lead did not affect Qualcomm’s stock after the earnings beat, with shares gaining 2.5% in late trading. But the stock has been pressured by the news of late, with Qualcomm declining 18.7% in the past three months as the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.17%  has gained 3.5%. For any investor still holding on to Qualcomm stock during the tumult, its clear there is a bumpy ride ahead, with many twists and turns down intellectual property road that could all lead to more questions about Apple.

Many of us like to give new products a chance, but the majority of consumers tend to stick to brands already well known. Apple TV was a streaming media player before the term was commonly used, and the 1st generation model produced from 2007 to 2010 actually came with a 40GB or 160GB hard drive to store content. Later models focused only on streaming though, and so moved the trend in media boxes to require an internet connection to temporarily cache video and audio streams rather than storing permanently. Personally, I like to avoid using the term set-top boxes to describe these smaller boxes. In a traditional meaning, a set-top box has a connection to a television service or over-the-air signal. A streaming media player, on the other hand, doesn’t require you have TV service. And although your channel choices expand with a pay TV subscription, you only need internet service to watch a lot of the content on a streaming media player. But those are just the boxes. We’d be missing something if we didn’t mention streaming sticks in this article. There are only two models in the US market that’ll we’ll consider: the Roku Streaming Stick and Google’s Chromecast. The lightweight, dongle-sized devices are extremely practical to install — just plug them into your HDMI input for video/audio and USB port for power and you’ve got no long cables to deal with. Most of these streaming media players are moderately priced below $100, and all give you the most popular streaming video and audio services such as Netflix, Hulu Plus and Pandora. Without further introduction, here are ten streaming media players to consider. 1. Amazon Fire TV Just released in April, Amazon’s Fire TV is ahead of all competitors in terms of processing power, memory, storage, and the ability to expand gaming with the Amazon Fire Game Controller. Fire TV houses a Qualcomm Krait 300 quad-core processor running at 1.7 GHz and a Qualcomm Adreno 320 GPU for graphics processing. The device comes with 2GB RAM and 8GB Flash storage. Second screen capabilities are available to Kindle Fire owners, and a remote control includes a microphone for voice search. The device supports 1080p video and Certified Dolby Digital Plus with 7.1 channel audio. Where the Fire TV falls short upon release are content channels, which aren’t as many as Roku and Apple TV offer, most notably the lack of HBO Go. The Fire TV costs $99, and $39 more for the game controller. 2. Roku 3 Roku has several current models including the Roku 1 and Roku 2, but their flagship Roku 3 is what we’ll focus on here. The Roku 3 is best comparable to Apple TV with regard to storage and memory. But Roku has many more channels to choose from, boasting over 1,000 different choices. The remote control for the Roku 3 has integrated motion technology for gaming (unlike the lower-tier models), and features a headphone jack for late night viewing when you don’t want to disturb anyone. The Roku 3 supports up to 1080p video and Dolby Digital 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound pass through HDMI. $99 bucks get you a Roku 3 with remote control. 3. Apple TV You might call Apple TV a great uncle to other streaming media players out there. But the device is hardly irrelevant among its newer competitors. In fact, Apple recently announced the company has sold 20 million Apple TV boxes through this year’s second quarter. Although Apple seems a bit more selective of the channels it allows on Apple TV (as opposed to Roku), there are plenty of big time networks including HBO Go, Disney Channel, Watch ABC, and A&E. (Take note Apple, that we’re anxiously awaiting Showtime Anytime.) Apple TV has a single-core A5 chip processor, 512MB RAM memory, and 8GB storage. Maximum video resolution supported is 1920 x 1080p (H.264) with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound for audio. And, the streaming media box comes with a nicely designed remote control. Like the Fire TV and Roku 3, the Apple TV will cost you $99. 4. Chromecast Google’s Chromecast is a simple-to-use dongle that plugs into your TV’s HDMI port for video/audio and USB or wall outlet for power. The device requires you use a mobile device (both Android and iOS supported) or Chrome on a Mac or PC as the remote control. Supported apps include Netflix, HBO Go, Hulu Plus, and MLB.TV Premium among the 17 channels listed on the product’s web page. Although, a recent announcement with PlayOn will provide Chromecast users with over 100 more channels from the premium service that costs $29.99 per year. The device supports up to 1080p video and digital audio surround sound pass through. Chromecast is the cheapest streaming device among the bunch, selling for a meager $35. 5. Roku Streaming Stick The Roku Streaming Stick (model #3500) is a direct competitor to Chromecast that hit the market about 6 months after Google’s product (although Roku released earlier 3400 and 3420 MHL models in 2012). Easy to install and discreet, the Roku 3500 is an HDMI dongle that draws power from either a USB connection or wall adapter. The stick gives you all the channels Roku has available, supports 1080p video, lets you cast videos from Netflix and YouTube apps to your TV via mobile phone and tablet, and use your Android or iOS mobile device as a remote control with supporting apps. The Roku Streaming Stick also comes with a standard remote with RF technology (so you don’t have to point directly at the device). Priced a bit higher than Chromecast at $49.99, the Streaming Stick will give you hundreds more channels than Chromecast and comes with the remote control.

Reply Jeff on Would liked to have at least a passing mention of any ability to play local media files Reply Prabhakar Vangala on Try NVidia Shield. It does it all including playing local media (attached directly or on the local network). You will have to use an app like Kodi to best utilize the Shield’s capabilities for playing local media. I think it’s the next best thing to a dedicated HTPC. Reply Randy Bobandy on How are there no options for streaming media players that have 3.5mm or rca audio out ports and an ethernet connection? Anyone with a simple 2.1 speaker system without an optical port is simply screwed. Reply Christen Costa on Hey Randy, the solution is to run the audio to your TV and then out of your TV into your stereo. The thought here is that anyone using one of these players will have to have a compatible television. Reply FORREST OLNEY on NVIDIA SHIELD HAS IT ALL AND MUCH MORE. Reply Prabhakar Vangala on I agree. It’s easily the best of all that I have used – Roku 3, WD TV Live, Amazon Firestick, XBox One, PS3 etc. Some apps that buffer on other media players run smoothly on the Shield. It also streams local network media flawlessly via Kodi. Shield really shines where many other media players have difficulty accessing (or playing smoothly) the huge collection of local media on my network. Reply gavincredible on Thanks for the article.

Apple's iPad Fights For the Education Market Why Apple Should Eventually Build Family Service Robots View All Editorials → Why Apple Will Be Using Xeon CPUs in This Fall’s “Pro” iMac John Martellaro @jmartellaro 3 minute read Apr 19th, 2017 5:33 PM EDT | Analysis Recently, we learned that Apple may be seriously considering the use of a Xeon CPU in its so-called “server-grade” iMac planned for later this year. There are good technical reasons why the use of the Xeon has entered the discussion in what has traditionally been considered a consumer iMac—in contrast to the Mac Pro which has had Xeons all along. Image credit: Intel. Like may elements of society, personal computers are also falling into what’s called a bimodal distribution. Education is a case in point. The advent of inexpensive tablets (and Chromebooks) that can do most of what’s needed has left a gap in the middle price range. More advanced students, professors and researchers, however, need the computational and graphics power to do advanced work. There’s a pricing hole in the middle. Similarly, in professional circles, where Apple left a performance gap in its aging Mac lineup, other companies, notably, HP have moved in and catered to those pros with really powerful workhorse machines that have more memory, better memory bandwidth, and more computational punch. Apple appears to have become sensitive to this movement and the demands of the creative and technical professionals. See, for example: Apple’s Pro iMac to Compete with Microsoft Surface Studio Apple Throws a Mac Pro Hail Mary, Promises Redesigned Model Coming The Xeon Angle The technology, nomenclature and models of the various Xeon processors can quickly become complicated. I’m going to keep it at a high level and cite just a couple of sources. (Here are some additional technical details, as background, for the geeks.) I started with the idea that I’m seeing more and more references to Xeons in areas where it seemed that Core i5 and i7 dominated almost exclusively. It’s probably that bimodal trend. I asked Jim Christensen at HP about it, with the initial hunch that a Xeon is required for Error-correcting Code (ECC) Memory. He confirmed that and told me: The reason behind Xeon and ECC memory is for data integrity mainly. The combination provides server class data and calculation integrity that is not available in Core processors. Xeon processors also tend to have faster clock speeds. I got further confirmation directly from Intel. It’s not as if there’s been a dramatic reduction in Xeon prices or any new emphasis by Intel. Xeons have been around since 1998. Rather, the demands of professionals have meshed well with the entry-level E3-class Xeons. Stephen Gabriel at Intel told me: The Xeon E3-1200 series targets entry level workstations that focus on more performance, more memory, professional VR, graphics rendering, video production, greater memory bandwidth. This is why, for example, there is an option for the E3-1200 V5 in the HP Z2 Mini entry-level workstation that I recently reviewed. The E3 supports only one processor with multiple cores. Some Xeon Advantages In general, then, here are some reasons to select a Xeon CPU, the E3 class, in preference to a Core i7.  Briefly and not exhaustively, It supports ECC Memory. It generally supports higher clock rates. But that means more heat. Tech professionals accept that. Computational power beats “thin.” The memory bandwidth is greater. It can access more memory than the Core series, typically 64 GB. The “Pro” iMac Apple was evidently taken aback by the Microsoft Surface Studio announced last October. In parallel, HP has been working on some very serious Z notebooks and workstations that appeal strongly to professionals. If my email is a glimmer, Apple has come under strong pressure from those creative and technical professionals: “Give us the power we need, or we’ll look elsewhere.” Accordingly, the article I cited above suggests that this fall’s “pro” iMac will have a Xeon E3-1285 v6. The Xeon E5, E7 For clarification, there are three levels of Xeons. I’ve mentioned the entry-level E3 above. The E5 is a mid-range system for high-end desktop workstations. These Xeons don’t have integrated graphics, and so they’re geared towards a partnership with a very high end GPU. A familiar example is the 2013 Mac Pro with its E5-1620 v2 (and AMD FirePro GPUs) that supports multiple processors, each with multiple cores. (The FirePro was strong in 2013, not so much now.) And so, we can likely expect the 2018 Mac Pro that Apple recently talked about to have an E5-class CPU and very powerful discrete graphics. The E7-class Xeon is used primarily in very high-end server farms in data centers. You won’t see one in your Mac any time soon. Summary Technical and creative professionals need extreme silicon quality and stability, high memory bandwidth, lots of RAM and ECC memory for mission critical uses. If Apple is going to regain the trust and admiration of technical professionals who want to use 5K (8K?) iMacs for high end CAD, graphics, professional VR, video production, and scientific computation, then it’s a very natural thing to move to the E3-class Xeons. For those who need even more power and the benefits of their own specialty displays, the (presumed) 2018 Mac Pro with E5-class Xeons and massively capable graphics can carry an even higher load. All in all, it appears as if Apple is back on the Mac extreme power bandwagon, and it’s very welcome indeed. _____________________ Jim Tanous helped with some aspects of this article.

Two factual errors in this article: 1. Xeons are made of higher quality silicon. Not true. They are made from the same bins as the Core series. As a system builder who has sent out thousands of systems, I have only seen two CPUs come back that went bad… and one of them was a Xeon. 2. Xeons tend to have higher clock speeds. Not true. The Core K-series chip have higher clock speeds and lead all CPUs in single thread performance. Xeons tend to be clocked lower, especially since they also tend to have higher core counts than the Core series. That latter point is where they outperform Core series chips, in multi-threaded performance. There are only two reasons why Apple would go with Xeons for the iMac: 1. ECC memory – a dubious benefit to the average iMac buyer, who is a prosumer that does not often do mission critical work. 2. Branding, by which to charge more money for a system with a chip that is only marginally more reliable (by virtue of ECC memory) than a Core chip.

Apple's iPad Fights For the Education Market Why Apple Should Eventually Build Family Service Robots View All Editorials → Apple’s Augmented Reality Plans May Include iPhone 8 Smart Connector for Special Glasses Jeff Gamet @jgamet · +Jeff Gamet 2 minute read Apr 19th, 2017 7:25 PM EDT | News Apple’s iPhone 8 will reportedly include an iPad Pro-like smart connector that may be the link up for augmented reality and virtual reality headsets. The report is tenuous, but the idea that Apple is ready to introduce its augmented reality platform this fall is interesting. Report claims iPhone 8 will include a smart connector for AR glasses Word of Apple’s plan comes courtesy of the Israeli website The Verifier saying the smart connector will also be used for charging, sort of like MagSafe for the iPhone. Assuming they’re right, Apple will use the iPhone’s smart connector right away for more than it’s done with the iPad Pro. Currently, the only accessory taking advantage of the iPad’s smart connector is the Smart Keyboard cover. It’s no secret Apple is exploring augmented reality, which overlays data, graphics, and other content onto whatever users are looking at. Google’s first public attempt at grabbing the augmented reality market was Google Glass—high tech eye glasses that projected information only the wearer could see. Google Glass never amounted to more than a public exploration of what’s possible with augmented reality technology in part because convincing people to wear glasses who don’t need them is a hard sell. Apple will likely use the iPhone as its augmented reality platform, just as Facebook just announced it’s doing. Using smartphones with augmented reality makes sense because users won’t have to buy more equipment to carry around, and the built-in cameras can handle the image and video capture necessary while the phone processors handle the real time overlay of data, all of which displays on the built-in screen. Relying on smartphones means users need their phone in hand to experience augmented reality, which they currently do when playing Pokémon GO—a popular augmented reality game that sends players on hunts in the real world to capture virtual characters. Smartphones and Augmented Reality If Apple wants to make augmented reality feel more immersive, adding in some sort of glasses is the most logical path to take. Glasses as an accessory instead of a requirement means more iPhone owners can try augmented reality without spending extra money, and those who want a deeper experience can buy Apple’s special glasses. Connecting the glasses to a smart port, however, seems clunky and awkward since there’ll be an extra cable running from the glasses to your iPhone. Instead, Apple could use the smart connector to charge its glasses and go with Bluetooth when they’re in use. That said, there isn’t much right now to back up the idea of augmented reality glasses for the iPhone 8 yet. The Verifier doesn’t have a history with insider sources, and there aren’t any independent reports echoing what they’re saying. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, for example, has a well documented track record with Apple product leaks, and his report from earlier this week has no mention of the smart connector or augmented reality glasses. Until more sources back up this report we’re remaining skeptical.

It’s expected to open in the next several weeks, and new drone footage from YouTuber Duncan Sinfield shows what he called “finishing touches.” There are shots of the trees being planted, inside work through the glorious windows, and more. It’s an excellent look at just how far Apple Park has come since an ailing Steve Jobs pitched it to the Cupertino City Council. Check It Out: Mid-April Drone Footage Shows Apple Park ‘Finishing Touches’ Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Email Print Tumblr Tags: Apple, Apple Park, Drones 2 Comments Add a comment joe_u April 19, 2017 Seen many corporations invest in a Taj Mahal like structure due to perceived business expansion plans. Then business downturn ocurs, people are laid off and many parts of the facility are shut down. Then the task of subletting the structure to smaller corporations begins. Apple Park sure looks like a architectural marvel but could become a large white elephant if Apple hits a downturn or at some point in time gets bought out / merges with some other corporation. This stuff happens over time. This will be a difficult structure to sublet or find an alternative use for if Apple goes belly-up which will be a very large headache for Cupertino. Maybe Pentagon West? April 19, 2017 at 7:01 EDT PM Hagen April 19, 2017 … except that Apple is currently occupying over 60 buildings around the area, and rumor is that once the new campus opens, few if any of those building will be vacated. So Apple has a large buffer of more easily expended buildings that they can leave before central operations become a problem. In the late 1990s, Apple let go more than half of the buildings it was using, including most of the buildings along DeAnza avenue, but they kept the Infinite Loop and the Cupertino City Center as their… well, center of operations. Whilst other business decisions meant Apple vacated City Center, the rest of DeAnza has slowly been re-absorbed into the Apple presence. Once Apple moves in to the giant ring that is Apple Park, it will essentially require the demise of Apple as a company for them to leave it. Don’t bet on that for a LONG time.

The battery in this workhorse of a phone is 3,000 mAh on the S8 and 3,500 mAh on the S8+. Both phones have fast charging on wired and wireless and NFC. Finally, both phones come with Android 7.0 out of the box. The pluses The USP of this phone is three-fold. Firstly, it is that bezel-less dual-edge Infinity Display that everyone has come to love. One look at it and you instantly notice how much it has improved since the S7 Edge. Secondly, it is powered by the industry's first 10mn processor that allows for 20% less battery consumption. Finally, it is Bixby, Samsung's own virtual assistant as compared to Google Assistant, Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana. Here's my first impression of the phone after using it after the launch event got over. Design and Screen A 6.2-inch screen at the same height as the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 and slimmer than Apple's offerings. Samsung is clearly pushing the boundaries here. Using the phone in one hand was somewhat difficult, especially reaching the icons near the edges of the screen. Use it for long enough and you'd get used to it. The Infinity Display leaves one guessing as to where the top and bottom bezels are and where the display begins. This is because Samsung chose to make the front uniformly black. It makes every phone before it, including LG's G6, look dated. There isn't any physical home button as well thanks to the edge-to-edge display. Nonetheless, that screen is close to perfection. Samsung's AMOLED displays at a resolution of 2960x1440 are a sight to behold. It's sharp and very good for reading, watching videos and playing games. It felt a little less sharp in the demo zone with lots of artificial light, but nonetheless, the display itself made up for that. Performance The performance of this phone will not make anyone squirm. It breezes through anything anybody throws at it. Everything is seamless and one comes to expect that. Throw a heavy video at it, a graphics intense game or even dozens of apps open at the same time. This phone is no slouch. The minuses Samsung Galaxy S8More Sahil Bhalla/Catch News The most unusual decision from Samsung came with its placement of the fingerprint scanner. From the S7 to the S8, the fingerprint scanner has moved from the front to the back. It's placed right next to the camera. This was done to make space for the battery, Samsung says. The problem here is that it has the same metal raised rim around it, just like the camera. That's a problem for those who want to use the fingerprint scanner as a scroller (as in the case of Motorola's G5 Plus) and for those who just want to lock and unlock the phone. That camera is going to be hit a fair few times and get smudged. Read More Here's what some reviewers in the USA had to say. BuzzFeed News' Nicole Nguyen: "The S8’s fingerprint sensor and the camera feel basically the same, which means I kept smudging the camera lens and unlocking the phone at the same time." The Verge's Dan Seifert: "I frequently touch the camera lens instead of the fingerprint scanner, smearing the lens with all of my lovely finger oils." So, it's safe to say that placement of the fingerprint scanner is definitely a negative. With Samsung touting the Iris Scanner as an alternative to the fingerprint scanner, it'd be a positive if only it consistently worked. While I couldn't personally test it - as the company's executives were worried if one person uses it, the phone might be locked henceforth - reviewers have complained about it failing more than just a couple of times. From the fingerprint scanner to the camera. Samsung's stuck with the cameras from the S7 - 12MP, f1.7 snapper - and comes with dual pixel autofocus. An odd decision but maybe it's because the cameras were already great. Sure, the S7 and S7 Edge cameras are near the top of their class but seeing as Google's Pixel and Pixel XL phones have beaten it, Samsung could have done more. Unfortunately, Samsung's new phones don't come with a dual-camera setup, which the competition has been rocking as of late. What has improved is the front-facing camera. The camera has been bumped up to 8MP from 5MP and comes with smart autofocus. While one can't say for sure whether or not it beats Google's Pixel without fully testing it, in the limited time at the demo zone, the camera seemed only as good as last year's S7, which means it has fallen behind. Lastly, and I won't go into much detail, but that single-speaker is simply not loud enough. It's a weak speaker. Samsung has decided to include AKG by Harman earphones and that's a better way to listen to music. Should one buy it? The question one needs to ask is whether bigger is better. In this case, it most definitely is. That screen is as gorgeous as it can be. The other question to ask is, should one buy the S8 or take a round-trip ticket to New York or just save their money altogether. While last year's S7 came in under 50k, this one has been priced at 58k, a steep price indeed. That gorgeous display aside, Samsung's phones don't have much going for it looking at the competition. Xiaomi just unveiled their latest flagship - Mi 6 - on 19 April and barring the dated design, that looks to be a winner. OnePlus 5 is fast approaching and will undercut Samsung's price by half. If Samsung had launched at the sub 50k price, it may have gotten the necessary market share to justify the phone. For now, while it will have its admirers - just like Apple does - it won't draw in new users. Samsung lovers and prospective Samsung phone buyers might just be drawn to Samsung's C7 Pro that launched in India this month at just Rs 27,990! The question is not whether the Galaxy S8s will outperform the S7s in the market. The question is whether the S8s will do as well as the top executives of Samsung want it to. It will not be the stellar comeback Samsung were hoping for. Once I get my hands on the device and do a thorough review, my thoughts might change, but starting at Rs 57,990 is a tough pill to swallow for a lot of consumers.

Referred to, even in metric Australia, as the "9.7 Inch iPad", it provides 24.6cm diagonal screen display, and will appeal to people who don't want to pay for features they won't use. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Apple's latest iPad is leaner and cheaper than its predecessors. Photo: Supplied At $469 for the 32GB version and $599 for 128GB, these new models are $400 cheaper than the equivalent iPad Pro. They are also slower, a little thicker at 7.5mm, and at 469g around 30g heavier. You won't be able to use an Apple Pencil or attachable keyboard, and there's no anti-reflective coating. But are these issues for you? If you're saying 'so what' to all of the above, then you've just saved a whack if you're in the market.  The speakers aren't as good as the iPad Pro, but movie trailers and all my apps from Solar Walk to Garage Band sound superb and look crisp. Both have the same screen resolution (2048 x 1536 pixels), and both have reasonably good battery life, lasting at least a day or so before recharging. The most surprising thing is that there is a headphone jack, since Apple apparently introduced the 'no jack' policy in the iPhone 7. The new iPad has an  eight‑megapixel camera. It would be nice to have the double 12-megapixel wide-angle and telephoto cameras of the iPhone 7 Plus, but it's not a big issue, as most people tend to take photos with their phones. If you just use tablets for basic activities such as browsing the web, watching movies and TV, checking out social media, using apps, and playing games, then this is a decent choice at a reasonable price.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Clive Davis Documentary Feature From IM Global And Scott Free Productions Coming To Apple Music LOS ANGELES, April 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — The Clive Davis documentary CLIVE DAVIS: THE SOUNDTRACK OF OUR LIVES from IM Global and Scott Free Productions, is coming exclusively to Apple Music customers around the world. Based on Davis’ 2013 bestselling autobiography, CLIVE DAVIS: THE SOUNDTRACK OF OUR LIVES is a riveting profile of the legendary music man, who is a five-time Grammy winner, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee and recipient of The Recording Academy’s Lifetime Achievement Award.  The film chronicles the historic influence of „The Man with the Golden Ears,” who rose from humble beginnings, and in a compelling journey, became one of the music industry’s most iconic figures. Davis’ career spans a remarkable five-decade career, providing an incredible tour of the most sensational music of the cultural revolution, from the ’60s to the rise of hip-hop. Davis has signed, influenced and driven the careers of many of the most important music artists of the 20th and 21st Centuries including Bruce Springsteen, Whitney Houston, Santana, Aretha Franklin, Barry Manilow, Patti Smith, Alicia Keys, Sean „Puffy” Combs, and a great many more who attest to Davis as, in Aretha Franklin’s words, „the greatest record man of all time.”  This amazing film is definitive, fascinating and ceaselessly entertaining proof.  „Apple is a global innovator that has revolutionized the distribution of music,” said Davis. „It is a touching honor to share the music and unique stories that have shaped my career with millions of Apple Music subscribers around the world. I am overjoyed to work with them to continue this incredible journey!” Financed by prolific independent studio IM Global, the film is directed by Chris Perkel, and produced by Michael Bernstein of Scott Free Productions, with Ridley Scott and Mary Lisio executive producing alongside IM Global’s Ford, David Schulhof, and Deborah Zipser.   CLIVE DAVIS: THE SOUNDTRACK OF OUR LIVES will have its World Premiere as the Opening Night film at the Tribeca Film Festival in the iconic Radio City Music Hall on April 19.  The screening will be followed by special concert featuring performances by Aretha Franklin, Jennifer Hudson, Earth, Wind & Fire, Dionne Warwick, Carly Simon and Barry Manilow. Davis added: „It is an incredible milestone to have a film about my life premier on opening night of the Tribeca Film Festival in an iconic venue such as Radio City Music Hall.  It will be a moving celebration of music and artistry that hopefully will touch everyone.”  Said Ford, „It is a great honor for us to be working with Apple Music on the worldwide distribution of SOUNDTRACK OF OUR LIVES, and it’s perfect positioning for a movie that chronicles the career of one of the music industry’s icons over the past 50 years.” The deal was negotiated by WME Global with assistance from attorney Craig Emmanuel of Loeb & Loeb on behalf of the filmmakers and General Counsel Zipser on behalf of IM Global.  SOURCE IM Global CategoriesUncategorized TagsUncategorized Post navigation Previous PostPrevious TransAlta Board Approves Plan for Accelerating Transition to Clean Power in Alberta Next PostNext “Imagine a World Where the Worst-Case Scenarios Have Been Realized” Search Recent Posts Council on Recovery Receives Major Grant to Expand CHOICES™ High-Risk Behavior Prevention Program IMF Video: Press Briefing: Global Financial Stabiity Report Spark Design & Innovation Awards Announces 2017 Call For Entries Membranes Market Growing at a CAGR of 10.3% During 2016 to 2021 – ReportsnReports Aura Information Security Bolsters Leadership Team Proudly powered by WordPress

According to Apple’s 2017 Environment Responsibility Report released today, the company’s latest environmental initiative will see it “stop mining the earth altogether.” “Climate change is undeniable. Earth’s resources won’t last forever. And technology must be safe for people to make and use. We don’t question these realities — we challenge ourselves to ask what we can do about them in every part of our business.” Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Apple says that it will start making devices entirely from recycled materials, including aluminum, copper, tin, and tungsten. The issue, however, is that the company doesn’t know how it’s going to do this yet. “It sounds crazy, but we’re working on it. We’re moving toward a closed-loop supply chain. One day we’d like to be able to build new products with just recycled materials, including your old products.” Speaking to Vice in an exclusive interview, Apple VP of environment, policy, and social initiatives Lisa Jackson explained that this move is an important one because it’s more about pushing the entire industry towards a goal: “We’re actually doing something we rarely do, which is announce a goal before we’ve completely figured out how to do it. So we’re a little nervous, but we also think it’s really important, because as a sector we believe it’s where technology should be going.” Jackson also explained that only a small amount of what’s inside the iPhone right now comes from recycled material. The goal, however, is for Apple to eventually combine high quality recycled metals from suppliers with what’s taken from Apple products returned by consumers. “We are committing as a company to not necessarily having to source from the earth for everything that we need,” Jackson noted. Apple’s 2017 Environment Responsibility Report also offers a few more tidbits on its environmental process. The company now powers its facilities by 96 percent renewable energy, up from 93 percent last year. Furthermore, Apple says seven of its major suppliers have promised to use renewable energy by the end of next year. Apple shifting from mining to the use of recycled materials is notable. The company in the past has come under fire for various issues relating to its mining. Just over a year ago, an investigation claimed that Apple’s battery suppliers were using cobalt mined by child labor. It was also reported at one point that Apple was using tin from illegal mines.

By TheresePoletti Columnist Qualcomm Inc. had a pretty good quarter, but executives barely got to talk about it Wednesday as all eyes focused on the chipmaker’s problems with another tech giant. Qualcomm QCOM, -0.11%   beat analysts’ expectations with a quarterly earnings report Wednesday, but it was hard to tell on the conference call, where all but one question was about the communications-chip company’s complicated and potentially costly legal dispute with Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.37%   In January, Apple sued Qualcomm, a designer of chips used in the iPhone, for $1 billion, contending the company was demanding onerous terms for its technology licenses and that it had withheld rebate payments as punishment for Apple’s cooperation in a Korean regulatory probe of Qualcomm’s licensing practices. Qualcomm filed a countersuit last week that didn’t pull any punches. The ramifications of this fight dominated Qualcomm’s earnings release and call, in which Qualcomm admitted that contract manufacturers underpaid royalty payments in the fiscal second quarter to the tune of about $1 billion. Qualcomm’s accounts receivables soared in the quarter, to a deficit of $1.8 billion, up from $392 million in the year-ago period. The contract manufacturers acknowledged the amounts due and have binding deals, Qualcomm said to reassure investors. Don’t miss: Apple makes move that could improve its gadgets, but it won’t be easy While the lack of payments in the quarter was effectively canceled out by the money Qualcomm has withheld Apple in rebate payments, Qualcomm executives said they could not predict whether or not they will be underpaid again in the current quarter, leading to wider-than-normal earnings guidance. Analysts were clearly worried that contract manufacturers may continue to withhold payments, even though Qualcomm’s contract with Apple ended in December. “The agreement itself with Apple, which is where we have the dispute over what is owed to them, expired at the end of 2016, so it has really no relevance or impact to what the contract manufacturers would owe us for sales during the March quarter,” Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said. This is when driverless cars will hit the road(3:35) At CES in Las Vegas, tech executives, industry analysts and enthusiasts voiced different ideas about when self-driving cars would become widely available. MarketWatch took a spin in a semi-autonomous car to learn more about this emerging technology. The only question not pertaining to Apple in Wednesday’s call was about Qualcomm’s pending $39 billion megamerger with NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI, +0.89% which Qualcomm hopes will broaden its presence in advanced driver-assistance systems in autos, as well as self-driving cars. Nothing about the recent arbitration award won by BlackBerry Ltd., which led Qualcomm to announce standard and adjusted revenue, with the adjusted figure adding nearly $1 billion. No questions were asked about the business, other than whether the company was seeing other licensees question their licensing terms since the Apple suit. “The terms under those agreements, I think were grossly mischaracterized in Apple’s submissions,” Aberle said in response to that question. “So, yes, we’ve had to have some discussions with licensees to try to clarify what it is and isn’t, but I would say that’s sort of normal-course discussions we would typically have with companies.” The obvious concerns about manufacturers withholding payments and other customers following Apple’s lead did not affect Qualcomm’s stock after the earnings beat, with shares gaining 2.5% in late trading. But the stock has been pressured by the news of late, with Qualcomm declining 18.7% in the past three months as the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.17%  has gained 3.5%. For any investor still holding on to Qualcomm stock during the tumult, its clear there is a bumpy ride ahead, with many twists and turns down intellectual property road that could all lead to more questions about Apple.

The company has added the locations of the U.K.’s electric vehicle charging stations by incorporating data from Munich-based Cirrantic’s Moovility service, which lists re-juicing points for cars made by Tesla and Nissan, among others. It has also added public bicycle rental and drop-off points to maps of London, New York and Paris in a catch-up to long-time mobile navigation leader Google, which has listed such stations in multiple countries for some time. Last December Apple added ChargePoint integration to Maps to help users in the U.S. find electric vehicle chargers, so it's nice to see something similar come to Europe. The bicycle rental information is also welcome as Apple Maps continues branching out from simply providing directions to now being a central hub for various modes of transportation, such as ride sharing and now bicycling.

By TheresePoletti Columnist Qualcomm Inc. had a pretty good quarter, but executives barely got to talk about it Wednesday as all eyes focused on the chipmaker’s problems with another tech giant. Qualcomm QCOM, -0.11%   beat analysts’ expectations with a quarterly earnings report Wednesday, but it was hard to tell on the conference call, where all but one question was about the communications-chip company’s complicated and potentially costly legal dispute with Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.37%   In January, Apple sued Qualcomm, a designer of chips used in the iPhone, for $1 billion, contending the company was demanding onerous terms for its technology licenses and that it had withheld rebate payments as punishment for Apple’s cooperation in a Korean regulatory probe of Qualcomm’s licensing practices. Qualcomm filed a countersuit last week that didn’t pull any punches. The ramifications of this fight dominated Qualcomm’s earnings release and call, in which Qualcomm admitted that contract manufacturers underpaid royalty payments in the fiscal second quarter to the tune of about $1 billion. Qualcomm’s accounts receivables soared in the quarter, to a deficit of $1.8 billion, up from $392 million in the year-ago period. The contract manufacturers acknowledged the amounts due and have binding deals, Qualcomm said to reassure investors. Don’t miss: Apple makes move that could improve its gadgets, but it won’t be easy While the lack of payments in the quarter was effectively canceled out by the money Qualcomm has withheld Apple in rebate payments, Qualcomm executives said they could not predict whether or not they will be underpaid again in the current quarter, leading to wider-than-normal earnings guidance. Analysts were clearly worried that contract manufacturers may continue to withhold payments, even though Qualcomm’s contract with Apple ended in December. “The agreement itself with Apple, which is where we have the dispute over what is owed to them, expired at the end of 2016, so it has really no relevance or impact to what the contract manufacturers would owe us for sales during the March quarter,” Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said. This is when driverless cars will hit the road(3:35) At CES in Las Vegas, tech executives, industry analysts and enthusiasts voiced different ideas about when self-driving cars would become widely available. MarketWatch took a spin in a semi-autonomous car to learn more about this emerging technology. The only question not pertaining to Apple in Wednesday’s call was about Qualcomm’s pending $39 billion megamerger with NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI, +0.89% which Qualcomm hopes will broaden its presence in advanced driver-assistance systems in autos, as well as self-driving cars. Nothing about the recent arbitration award won by BlackBerry Ltd., which led Qualcomm to announce standard and adjusted revenue, with the adjusted figure adding nearly $1 billion. No questions were asked about the business, other than whether the company was seeing other licensees question their licensing terms since the Apple suit. “The terms under those agreements, I think were grossly mischaracterized in Apple’s submissions,” Aberle said in response to that question. “So, yes, we’ve had to have some discussions with licensees to try to clarify what it is and isn’t, but I would say that’s sort of normal-course discussions we would typically have with companies.” The obvious concerns about manufacturers withholding payments and other customers following Apple’s lead did not affect Qualcomm’s stock after the earnings beat, with shares gaining 2.5% in late trading. But the stock has been pressured by the news of late, with Qualcomm declining 18.7% in the past three months as the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.17%  has gained 3.5%. For any investor still holding on to Qualcomm stock during the tumult, its clear there is a bumpy ride ahead, with many twists and turns down intellectual property road that could all lead to more questions about Apple.

Business Technology Qualcomm's earnings weighed down by BlackBerry refund The launch of Samsung's Galaxy S8, some versions of which use Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors, helped the company's results. The Associated Press The launch of Samsung's Galaxy S8, some versions of which use Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors, helped the company's results in its fiscal second quarter. The launch of Samsung's Galaxy S8, some versions of which use Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors, helped the company's results in its fiscal second quarter. (The Associated Press) Mike FreemanContact Reporter Muddled results highlight how Qualcomm’s battles over patent licensing are spilling into its financials. Qualcomm reported lower revenue and net income on Wednesday for its fiscal second quarter, with results weighed down by a refund in patent royalties to BlackBerry. Without that setback, Qualcomm would have posted a solid quarter, with higher revenue and adjusted earnings than Wall Street analysts expected. The muddled results highlight how Qualcomm’s ongoing battles over patent licensing, including a contentious lawsuit with Apple, are spilling into its financial results. The company been fined by South Korea’s anti-trust regulator and sued by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over patent practices. It is under investigation in Taiwan. Apple sued in January, claiming that Qualcomm charges too much for use of its cellular technology. Qualcomm has appealed the South Korean fine, is seeking dismissal of the FTC lawsuit and has countersued Apple. Still, it could take more than a year to resolve the disputes, according to analysts. “We have successfully navigated challenges like this in the past, and we have confidence in the sustainability of our licensing business,” said Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf in a conference call with analysts. “But we know these periods can generate added volatility in near term results.” Mollenkopf added that Qualcomm will focus on delivering “the best products to our customers, including Apple. We expect to be an important supplier to Apple now and in the future.” For its fiscal second quarter ended March 31, Qualcomm reported revenue of $5 billion and net income of $700 million, or 50 cents per share, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. That compares with sales of $5.6 billion and earnings of $1.2 billion, or 78 cents per share, for the same quarter last year. GAAP results were hurt by a $974 million reduction in revenue and a 48 cents per share hit to earnings related to a refund to BlackBerry. In 2010, BlackBerry prepaid for patent royalties for the next five years. When it sold far fewer smartphones than expected, it sought a refund. The prepayment was non-refundable, according to Qualcomm, but an arbitration panel ruled for BlackBerry. Excluding the refund and some other charges, Qualcomm posted revenue of $6 billion and earnings of $2 billion, or $1.34 per share. Wall Street analysts forecast sales of $5.89 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.22 per share. Qualcomm’s latest smartphone processor, the Snapdragon 835, has gotten good traction in new mobile devices, including the Sony Xperia XZ Premium, the Xiaomi Mi6 and the Samsung Galaxy S8. The company’s mobile technology also continues to expand into new markets, such as cars, which helped results. Its pending $39 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors received anti-trust approval in the U.S. It is expected to wrap up by year end pending regulatory approval in other countries Qualcomm patent licensing arm reported some good news – including improved royalty collections in China. But it remains under pressure. The company revealed that an unnamed device maker underpaid $150 million in the quarter. In addition, contract manufacturers that build iPhones for Apple withheld a portion of patent royalties owed to Qualcomm in the quarter. Qualcomm claims Apple stopped reimbursing these contract manufacturers after it sued Qualcomm in January. The amount that iPhone makers underpaid in royalties was about $1 billion. That’s equivalent to the nearly $1 billion that Apple claims Qualcomm is withholding in royalty “rebates” under a separate business agreement. Apple contends Qualcomm is retaliating for Apple’s cooperation with anti-trust regulators. It’s unclear whether iPhone makers will withhold additional patent royalties going forward, said Qualcomm President Derek Aberle. “While we would expect Apple suppliers to pay us what they owe under the license agreements, it is possible that Apple will continue to interfere with the Apple supplier license agreements to underpay,” he said. Looking ahead, Qualcomm provided a wider than usual guidance range for the current quarter because of the uncertainty. It predicts sales of $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion, with earnings of 67 cents to 92 cents per share under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Qualcomm reported results after markets closed. Its shares ended the day at $52.61 but rose to $53.80 in after-market trading.

Davis' career spans a remarkable five-decade career, providing an incredible tour of the most sensational music of the cultural revolution, from the '60s to the rise of hip-hop. Davis has signed, influenced and driven the careers of many of the most important music artists of the 20th and 21st Centuries including Bruce Springsteen, Whitney Houston, Santana, Aretha Franklin, Barry Manilow, Patti Smith, Alicia Keys, Sean "Puffy" Combs, and a great many more who attest to Davis as, in Aretha Franklin's words, "the greatest record man of all time."  This amazing film is definitive, fascinating and ceaselessly entertaining proof.  "Apple is a global innovator that has revolutionized the distribution of music," said Davis. "It is a touching honor to share the music and unique stories that have shaped my career with millions of Apple Music subscribers around the world. I am overjoyed to work with them to continue this incredible journey!" Financed by prolific independent studio IM Global, the film is directed by Chris Perkel, and produced by Michael Bernstein of Scott Free Productions, with Ridley Scott and Mary Lisio executive producing alongside IM Global's Ford, David Schulhof, and Deborah Zipser.   CLIVE DAVIS: THE SOUNDTRACK OF OUR LIVES will have its World Premiere as the Opening Night film at the Tribeca Film Festival in the iconic Radio City Music Hall on April 19.  The screening will be followed by special concert featuring performances by Aretha Franklin, Jennifer Hudson, Earth, Wind & Fire, Dionne Warwick, Carly Simon and Barry Manilow. Davis added: "It is an incredible milestone to have a film about my life premier on opening night of the Tribeca Film Festival in an iconic venue such as Radio City Music Hall.  It will be a moving celebration of music and artistry that hopefully will touch everyone."  Said Ford, "It is a great honor for us to be working with Apple Music on the worldwide distribution of SOUNDTRACK OF OUR LIVES, and it's perfect positioning for a movie that chronicles the career of one of the music industry's icons over the past 50 years."

As part of a mid-month update, drone pilot Duncan Sinfield has shared a new video of Apple Park, this time getting some gorgeous nighttime shots of the campus lit up at night. In the evenings, the lights on the ring-shaped main building stay on, and it's an impressive sight. The nighttime shots are towards the end of the video, which also shows the completed parking structures, landscaping work with hundreds of trees being planted, final construction on the main building, furniture installation, and more. While employees are set to start working at Apple Park at some point in April, landscaping and construction on auxiliary buildings will continue into the summer. Tag: Apple Park [ 38 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) coolfactor 7 hours ago at 04:53 pm remember HP also had a massive campus and they are not the same company anymore. This all started happening 7 years ago with the purchase of land from HP http://www.mercurynews.com/2010/11/24/apple-makes-big-land-purchase-in-cupertino-2/ But was HP's campus inspiring, designed and built with the planet and people in mind? Or was it just a boring corporate box surrounded by pavement? I think that's a very important distinction. Apple has always had unique values from the very beginning, and I think that influences their course. Rating: 3 Votes zoetmb 7 hours ago at 04:46 pm With just 11 days left to the month, I doubt very much that any employees are moving into the main building this month. Employees may start moving in in May, but there's tons of work left to do. Just getting the construction equipment off of the site would take several weeks. I bet it would take days just to get that orange safety netting off the top of the building. All those very large cartons sitting inside the building must be office modules and the like. All of that has to be put together. This place is huge. Lots of work still to do and the place will need to be cleaned top to bottom to get rid of construction dust before employees move in. And I don't know specifically what California's laws are, but I would assume the place needs a certificate of occupancy. I can't see the authorities granting that until most of that interior space is cleared of construction and packaging debris. All of these videos have shown very light traffic on the highways, so I assume they're shot on Sundays, probably early Sunday mornings. And so we also see relatively few construction workers. Anyone familiar with the site during the week? Are there a thousand construction workers there? Because it seems to me that's what it would take to get it ready for move-in if it's happening before June.

I can't speak for the main building, but it seems there are already employees in the R&D building. Driving on the highway along the campus, I saw people in a conference room on the top floor. The blinds were also pulled down across much of the building so I'm sure at least some people have moved in already. The outer parking lot is also clearly visible from the highway and it's completely packed with cars during the week.

Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S8 and S8+ on Wednesday in India, filling the void for a "flagship device". Flagship means a high-end smartphone. Globally, as well as in India, Samsung is known for these high-end models, available for nothing less than Rs 50,000. Prior to the Note 7 crisis, which saw users of the device plagued with battery explosions, Samsung commanded around 50-55 per cent share in the Rs 50,000 and above smartphone market in India. Apple, on the other hand, occupied a market pie of around 45-46 per cent in this segment - the super-premium smartphone market - according to Cybermedia Research. Following the Note 7 crisis, Samsung's share reduced to 17 per cent, according to Cybermedia Research's data for January and February 2017. Figures for March were not immediately available. Apple's share grew to 80 per cent in January and February 2017, Faisal Kawoosa, principal analyst, telecom and semitronics, CyberMedia Research, said. "The addressable market for Samsung, therefore, in the super-premium smartphone segment has shrunk in the last few months, implying the company would have to work really hard to regain its lost ground," Kawoosa said. According to experts, the super-premium or Rs 50,000 and above smartphone segment in India is about 4 per cent (or 4.5 million units) of the overall 113-million-unit domestic smartphone market, indicating a tough fight for Samsung. Apple on Tuesday said it was working on new features for its 10th anniversary edition of the iPhone, hinting it has no plans to abdicate the ground it had gained in Samsung's absence, especially in markets such as India, where it is growing quickly. But as the new iPhone would be launched only in the second half of 2017, Samsung, experts said, had time to work its way up in the super-premium segment. "There are some interesting features that the S8 has, such as a curved screen, which has been taken to the next level by the smartphone maker. The S8 offers consumers infinite display and this could be a big hook in India, where display plays a key role for buyers," Niel Shah, analyst at Counterpoint Research said. Samsung has also priced the S8 competitively at Rs 57,900, while the S8+ is available for Rs 64,900. The iphone 7 was launched in October last year at Rs 60,000 for a 32GB variant. The 128GB version was available for Rs 70,000, and the 256GB for Rs 80,000. The iPhone 7 Plus was available for Rs 72,000 for the 32GB variant; Rs 82,000 for the 128GB version, and Rs 92,000 for 256GB. According to Shah, while buyers of super-premium phones are not price-conscious, Samsung's attempt to keep the S8's pricepoints within the Rs 57,000-65,000 bracket would help to improve sales. 7SHARES © 2017 Business Standard     Stay Updated with Us Top 10 Stories Last Week Last Month Last Year Axis Mutual Fund educates customers about SIP usin...

(AAPL) iPhone 8 Facing a Resurgent Samsung (SSNLF) F8 Conference: Facebook Inc (FB) Bets Big on AR Apple Inc. (AAPL) Predicted to Ramp Up New iMac Production in May View All Posts Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expecting a lot from this fall’s iPhone 8. The 10th anniversary iPhone is going to feature an all-new, premium design that is expected to kick off a massive upgrade wave. There’s one big problem with Apple’s plans, and it’s threatening to spoil the party: Samsung Electronic (OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Source: Samsung iPhone 8 Design is Looking More Locked Down While nothing is written in stone yet and we’re working on best guesses based on hints and leaks from Apple’s supply chain, there’s growing confidence we have a good idea of what the iPhone 8 will look like. Bloomberg just published a comprehensive overview of the iPhone 8, listing the generally accepted details of AAPL’s design. Chief among these is a virtually bezel-free front that will appear to be all-screen. Ditching the Home button and stretching the new OLED display to the gently curved sides will let Apple fit a screen nearly the size of the iPhone 7 Plus into a smartphone that closer in size to the iPhone 7. Like the iPhone 7 Plus, the new iPhone is also expected to have a dual camera system, although in the case of the iPhone 8 the two lenses may be positioned vertically instead of horizontally. The iPhone 8 is shaping up to be a worthy upgrade for Apple fans, but one key element of this year’s expected iPhone sales spectacular is not going according to plan. Samsung Is Beating Apple to the Punch When it comes to premium smartphones, we’re accustomed to Apple’s design leading the way and Samsung following. It was the iPhone that forced Samsung to ditch its plastic shell and adopt a premium glass and aluminum design, and it wasn’t that long ago that AAPL sued Samsung for copying the iPhone’s design. But when you look at the key features and design elements expected from the iPhone 8, many sound an awful lot like Samsung’s recently launched Galaxy S8. Samsung’s new flagship sports a near bezel-free OLED display, with a virtual Home button embedded in the glass. In fact –as the iPhone 8 is expected to be– the Galaxy S8 is an all-glass design (front and back). It features iris scanning security, which was also expected to be a big feature on the iPhone 8. When the iPhone 8 finally arrives in September, there’s a good chance it’s going to look a lot like the Galaxy S8 and Samsung will have stolen much of Apple’s thunder.

In a recent tweet by Sonny Dickson, he has posted an image of an alleged schematic of the iPhone 8 which appears to “confirm” the reports that Touch ID on the iPhone 8 could be moved to the back. It should be noted that the previous leaked hinted that the phone could be in its engineering validation test stage, meaning that it is one of the prototypes Apple is testing. However this schematic seems to suggest that Apple could be getting pretty serious about the idea of moving Touch ID to the back of the phone. iPhone 8 looks to be taking a new direction pic.twitter.com/mG19bcDYiC — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 19, 2017 Assuming this is true, it means that the iPhone 8 could indeed be dropping its home button, and that Apple might not have been able to embed Touch ID underneath its display as was previously rumored. Android users have gotten used to Touch ID placed on the back of the phone as there are quite a few Android handsets out there with a similar design, but for iPhone users it will definitely take some getting used to. Take it with a grain of salt for now, but Dickson has in the past been very accurate with his Apple-related leaks, so this schematic could be the real deal, although we guess whether or not it’s just a drawing of a prototype or the final design is a different story.

Qualcomm said on Wednesday that Apple's contract manufacturers including Foxconn paid royalties, although they withheld around $1 billion from the undisclosed total amount due. The amount withheld equaled the amount Qualcomm withheld from Apple last year under a separate agreement to cooperate on mobile technology that has since expired. Shares of Qualcomm, which have lost 19% so far this year, were up 2% in after hours trading based on news of the royalty payments and quarterly results which were somewhat better than Wall Street analysts expected. Qualcomm said it was unsure whether Apple's manufacturers would withhold any royalties owed during the current quarter. Apple declined to comment. The partial royalty payments and future uncertainty come as a legal disputes over intellectual property rights in the mobile market have reignited after a few years of quiet. Apple, which sued makers of Android phones for patent infringement six years ago, filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm in January that claimed the mobile chip designer charged excessive royalties to use its technology and alleged that Qualcomm owed Apple $1 billion in rebates. Last week, Qualcomm counter-sued, saying Apple had violated agreements between the two companies. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. "We have successfully navigated challenges like this in the past and we have confidence in the sustainability of our licensing business," Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf said on a call with analysts on Wednesday. "But we know these periods can generate added volatility in near term results and require open and regular dialogue with our investors." Apple's lawsuit, and other regulatory probes worldwide, have spooked investors by challenging the heart of Qualcomm's royalty business model. The mobile chip maker charges phone makers a percentage of the price of every phone, regardless of whether the device includes chips actually sold by Qualcomm or a competitor like Intel (intc). Qualcomm's royalty business brings in the lion's share of its pre-tax profits, or 80% in the most recent quarter–despite accounting for only about half the revenue brought in by its chip sales. Disclosure of the withheld royalty payments came as Qualcomm (qcom) reported results for the first quarter of 2017, its fiscal second quarter. Adjusted revenue of $6 billion was up 8% from a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share rose 29% to $1.34 and beat Wall Street analyst expectations of $1.19 per share. Why Apple and Qualcomm are headed to court: Analysts said Apple (aapl) and its manufacturers likely would continue to pay at least a portion of what they owe in the future. "The $1 billion cooperation agreement ended at the end of 2016, so Qualcomm is preparing for smaller payments in the next quarter, not zero payments as that would be unprecedented," says Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights & Strategy.

You’ve read about the most important ways Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are better than the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Now, however, it’s time to flip things around and dive into the key ways Apple’s most recent flagship iPhones are better than the new Galaxy S8 and S8+. There’s no question that Samsung out-designed Apple with its latest flagship smartphones, and they’re undoubtedly the most impressive Android smartphones the world has ever seen at this point. But they’re not perfect, and Apple’s class-leading iPhones still have the edge in a number of key areas. In this post, we’ll take a look at five important ways the iPhone 7 is still better than Samsung’s brand new Galaxy S8. Don't Miss: Samsung Galaxy S8 review: Meet the envy of every iPhone user Operating System This is probably the most controversial of the five points listed in this post. All things considered, however, it’s true. After all these years, Apple’s iOS platform is still far more refined and far more simple than Android. Simple, of course, doesn’t mean less capable. While it’s true that Google still gives Android developers far more freedom than iOS developers have, the capabilities afforded by that freedom that aren’t in iOS appeal to a somewhat small subset of users. iOS has grown more and more capable over the years, and its latest iteration is obviously the most impressive yet. Apple has managed to pile on additional features without overcomplicating the user experience or losing the simplicity that made iOS so enjoyable in the first place. Android gets better with each iteration as well, of course, but users still have trouble making sense of much of what the platform has to offer. Software Updates Speaking of software, this is one of the most important advantages Apple has over Google as a platform company. It’s also an area where Google may never catch up. Right now, according to Google’s own data, the most widely used version of Android in the world is Android Lollipop. It was first released about 2.5 years ago in November 2014. Google’s most recent version of Android is Android Nougat, which was released eight months ago but is only found on 4.9% of active devices. Meanwhile, Apple’s iOS 10 software was released a month after Android Nougat, and yet it’s installed on 79% of active iOS devices as of February. New software brings with it new features, bug fixes, and important security updates. iPhones have access to new software releases the moment they’re made available. Android users with devices other than Google’s Pixel or Nexus phones, on the other hand, have to wait months if not over a year before they can install an Android update. Third-Party Apps Sorry, Android fans, but the experiences afforded by Android apps never measure up to comparable apps on iPhones and iPads. The consistency isn’t there, the smoothness and refinement aren’t there, and the usability isn’t there. Google offers great guidelines for app developers, but they’re just not strict enough to ensure a consistent user experience across apps. Until Google tightens the reins — a lot — this isn’t ever going to improve. Continuity Samsung has taken many, many pages out of Apple’s playbook before, and it’s currently working on yet another page thanks to its Samsung Connect solution. Samsung Connect allows devices like the Galaxy S8 to interact with and control other Samsung (and third-party) devices, but it’s nothing like Apple’s elegant Continuity solution. From handing off web pages and copied text between devices, to synchronizing data across devices, to the beauty that is Apple’s cross-device Messages solution, iPhones and other Apple products work together seamlessly. It may be that a solution this slick is impossible unless a company controls hardware and software alike, but Samsung’s efforts with Tizen suggest that may never happen for the South Korean company. Performance Last but certainly not least is performance. It seems odd on paper that Apple’s 16nm quad-core A10 processor could out-perform the brand new 10nm octa-core Snapdragon 835 and Exynos 8895, but a phone’s processor is only part of the story. (That said, the A10 still crushes the 835 and 8895 in single-core performance on paper as well as in real-world usage.) Apple’s iOS platform is so lightweight and so well optimized that it continues to crush even the most powerful Android phones in the world where real-world performance is concerned. And yes, recent performance tests have shown that this is also the case with the brand new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Will Android ever catch up? Maybe some day, but it won’t be anytime soon.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: The 2 Best Dividend Stocks in the PC Industry Breaking down the income-investing outlook for personal-computer makers such as HP and Apple. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Apr 19, 2017 at 5:04PM In the age of the mobile computing, investing in the PC industry sure isn't what it used to be. As the latest in a litany of examples, the PC market contracted 5.7% year over year in 2016,  according to research firm IDC. However, for all the doom and gloom surrounding the PC market, the computer industry remains one of the most important subsectors in all of tech. In fact, even as unit volumes contract, over 260 million personal computers were sold last year globally, and the companies that remain at the center of this market -- names such as HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) -- continue to print tens of billions of dollars in aggregate profits from the space and pass them along to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. So let's review what makes these PC makers some of the best dividend stocks in the industry. HP Inc. After spinning off its server business into what today trades as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, the current HP Inc. represents one of the few pure-play PC companies to trade on American exchanges and also pay a dividend. As you might expect, the company's financial performance reflects the broader trends at work in the PC and printer industries, which are fairly ugly at the moment. Revenue declined 9.1% in the company's fiscal 2015 and 6.2% in 2016.  Few believe the PC industry will go away, but potential investors should understand that the growth outlook remains at best moderate for HP Inc. In fact, the majority of sell-side analysts rate its shares a hold and expect HP sales and profits to remain static over the next several years.  Looking at the company's dividend specs, HP shares currently yield 2.9%, which sits well above the S&P 500's current 1.9% yield.  The company currently pays out 34% of its earnings as dividends, which suggests it could grow its payments in the future. The company's balance sheet isn't overly leveraged, and the bulk of its debt comes due in five years or more. However, even though HP deserves a place on this list because of its prominence within the industry, the following name might prove to be a more attractive option for income investors. Image source: Apple. Apple Though the iPhone remains the profit center that powers Apple's financial performance, the Mac maker remains a force in the PC industry as well. In fact, IDC ranked Apple as the fifth largest PC maker in the world last year, with an estimated 7.1% share of worldwide computer shipments. Apple's shipments and market share declined from 2015 to 2016, though, and it isn't clear which aspects of its PC and notebook business it plans to update this year. The company already updated its MacBook Pro lineup last year. Having already killed off the 11-inch MacBook Air,  and with the ultra-thin 12-inch MacBook Pro appearing to have erased much of the use case for the 13-inch MacBook Air, it seems unlikely Apple will launch dramatically revamped laptops this year. The company reportedly has several important changes in the works to its desktop products. Having gone several years without a meaningful update, Apple is in the midst of overhauling the Mac Pro, though the refreshed model isn't expected in calendar year 2017. That leaves the iMac as the lone piece of Apple's PC business due for an update this year.  Expect this update to come at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in June, if it is indeed in the works. Regardless of Apple's place in the PC market, the company is a solid dvidend payer and seems likely to continue to be for the foreseeable future. If history is any indication, Apple will raise its dividend as part of its upcoming earnings report on May 2. The company has already returned $201 billion to shareholders since 2012,  and this year's likely iPhone upgrade cycle should further pad Apple's ability to afford further dividends and share repurchases in the coming years.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Apple Won't Be First to Augmented Reality, but Can It Be the Best? The odds are stacked in the Mac maker's favor. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 19, 2017 at 6:08PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is very rarely a first mover, and CEO Tim Cook often points out that the company's goal is never to be the first at something -- it just wants to be the best. The iPod wasn't the first music player, the iPhone wasn't the first smartphone, and the iPad wasn't the first tablet. There are more examples. With Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) making a big official push into augmented reality (AR) yesterday, complementing its virtual reality (VR) efforts, will the same scenario play out once again for the Mac maker? Mark Zuckerberg at F8 2017 unveiling Facebook's AR platform. Image source: Facebook. Hardware is hard Cook has made no secret of how much potential he sees in AR, believing that the nascent technology could be truly transformative since unlike VR, AR doesn't isolate you from the real world. In characteristic fashion, don't expect Apple to unveil whatever it's up to until the company feels like it's ready for mainstream adoption. In contrast, Facebook is taking the more traditional Silicon Valley approach of incremental iteration. The social network's new Camera Effects Platform currently just focuses on photo and video filters as a form of expression. Apple's new Clips app offers similar functionalities, which may very well be the foundations of its AR strategy, but Apple isn't calling anything a "platform" quite yet like Facebook is. Apple is also expected to include some AR functionalities in upcoming iPhones, potentially as early as this year. Longer term, both companies appear to be working on AR glasses as the delivery mechanism for an AR platform. The hardware will be a critically important aspect, and fashion preferences have a lot of bearing on wearable technology. Alphabet's Google Glass was too early for its time, and the super futuristic aesthetic was alienating, which may have contributed to that device's failure. Facebook is relatively new to the hardware game, but has been beefing up its hardware talent. The company poached Rich Heley last year from Tesla to join its Building 8 hardware team, where he currently serves as head of manufacturing; Heley was previously a hardware director at Apple. Meanwhile, hardware is one of Apple's greatest strengths, so expectations around Apple AR glasses will be (and should be) quite high. Apple also has much more experience constructing and operating computing platforms (as opposed to a social platform) on a massive scale. Additionally, Apple can leverage its broader product ecosystem to deliver more integrated AR experiences that leverage other Apple products a customer might have. The odds are stacked in the Mac maker's favor. AR platforms may not be mutually exclusive It's worth pointing out that AR platforms may not be mutually exclusive. While the primary platform may very well be tied to what hardware a customer buys, it's quite conceivable that in addition to making AR glasses, Facebook could build its platform on top of other platforms, too, much like its current social platform is primarily built on third-party mobile platforms like iOS and Android. If Apple's underlying AR platform proves to be more successful, with greater mainstream adoption, there wouldn't be anything stopping Facebook from creating an AR app for Apple's platform to deliver the AR experiences that Zuckerberg envisions. On the flip side, it's unlikely that Apple would pursue such a strategy, as it always sticks to its own walled garden. It's still early days in AR, and the coming years will see major AR investments and competition from all the major tech giants. That's good news for consumers.

Wireless iPhone Headphones Restock Not Expected Until June By Eric Chiu @eric_chiu On 04/19/17 AT 6:41 PM Close If you want to pair your iPhone with Apple’s AirPod wireless earbuds, you’re out of luck for a while longer. Despite being released last September, the wireless earbuds remain out of stock at online and brick-and-mortar retailers like Best Buy and Amazon. Through Apple, the AirPods still have an estimated six-week wait time for shipping and are out of stock at most Apple retail stores. Read: AirPods With Biometric Sensors Detailed In New Apple Patents That said, Apple is aware of the shortages. A spokesperson told CNET the company is working to reload its inventory as soon as possible. The AirPods, which retail for $159 and launched alongside the iPhone 7, are Apple’s first significant revamp to its flagship earbuds. The wireless earbuds are untethered units that fit into the ear without a connecting cable and come with a charging case. Apple says the AirPods can provide as long as five hours of listening time on a single charge. Among Apple’s lineup, the AirPods are also a major part of the company’s push to validate dropping the headphone jack on the iPhone 7. Apple expects future smartphones not to include a headphone jack and needs effective wireless headphones to make it worthwhile. Read: How To Track Your AirPods Using iOS Find My Airpods Feature The AirPods are also one of the few wireless headphones on the market that feature the company’s proprietary W1 chip. Other headphones that include the chip are the Beats Solo3, BeatsX and Beats PowerBeats3.

New documents from WikiLeaks, posted Thursday, March 23, 2017, point to an apparent CIA program to hack Apples iPhones and Mac computers such that the exploits persist even after the devices are reset to factory conditions. Security experts say the exploits are plausible, but they are playing down the threat to typical users. The techniques typically require physical access to devices, something the CIA would only use for individuals it is targeting.

Apple is preparing three iPhones for release this fall, including upgraded versions of the two current models and a new top-of-the-line handset with an overhauled look, according to people familiar with the matter. For the redesigned phone, Apple is testing a new type of screen, curved glass and stainless steel materials, and more advanced cameras, the people said. Those anxiously awaiting the redesigned iPhone, however, may have to wait, because supply constraints could mean the device isn’t readily available until one or two months after the typical fall introduction. TOP BUSINESS VIDEOS: Story continues below | Business news first: Sign in for newsletters The iPhone is Apple’s most important product, representing about two-thirds of sales. It also leads customers to buy other Apple devices like the iPad and Apple Watch, and serves as a home for lucrative services like the App Store. This year’s new iPhone lineup comes at a critical time. Last year, Apple broke its typical upgrade cycle by retaining the same iPhone shape for a third year in a row, and it saw sales slide. Samsung’s new S8 lineup has been thus far well received after last year’s Note7 battery debacle. For the premium model, Apple is testing a screen that covers almost the entire front of the device, according to people familiar with the matter. That results in a display slightly larger than that of the iPhone 7 Plus but an overall size closer to the iPhone 7, the people said. Apple is also moving to reduce the overall size of the handset by integrating the home button into the screen itself with software similar to that in Samsung’s S8, the people said. The overhauled iPhone will use an OLED display that more accurately shows colors, while the other two phones will continue to use liquid crystal display technology and come in the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes as last year’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, according to people familiar with the matter. But Apple’s iPhone feature and design plans might change, they added. The people asked not to be identified discussing Apple’s private testing and design plans. Apple has tested prototypes of its redesigned phone with manufacturing partners in Asia, including some versions that use curved glass and stainless steel, one of them said. One of the latest prototype designs includes symmetrical, slightly curved glass on the front and the back. The curves are similar to those on the front of the iPhone 7. The new OLED screen itself is flat, while the cover glass curves into a steel frame. The design is similar conceptually to the iPhone 4 from 2010. An earlier prototype design had a thinner steel band, leaving more noticeable curved glass on the sides. Apple also tested a more ambitious prototype with the same slightly curved front and steel frame, but with a glass back with more dramatic curves on the top and bottom like the original iPhone design from 2007, one of the people said. Apple suppliers have so far struggled to reliably produce heavily curved glass in mass quantities, so the company is more likely to ship the version with more subdued curves, the person added. The company is also testing a simpler design that has an aluminum back, rather than a glass one, and slightly larger dimensions, one of the people said. Because of its early lead in mobile OLED display, Samsung will enjoy a rare upper hand in this year’s high-end smartphone contest. Initially, Apple will exclusively use Samsung Display OLED panels for the redesigned iPhone, because other vendors won’t be ready to supply mass quantities until later. Apple has ordered 100 million panels from Samsung, the people said. “This fall, it would be three years since we had a remarkable shift in iPhone hardware. This raises expectations for this year’s phone having a material change in functionality and look,” said Gene Munster, co-founder of Loup Ventures and a veteran Apple analyst. “The Samsung Galaxy S8 raises the bar for Apple to hit a home run.” Apple and Samsung declined to comment. Apple has also experimented with integrating the iPhone’s fingerprint scanner into the screen of the OLED version, which would be technically challenging, the people said. It’s currently unclear if that feature will make it into the final product. Samsung also tried this approach for the S8, but ended up installing a more standard fingerprint reader on the back of its phone due to the challenges, another person said. Significant camera changes are also in testing for Apple’s overhauled iPhone. For the back of the phone, Apple is testing versions of the phone with the dual-camera system positioned vertically, instead of horizontally like on the iPhone 7 Plus, which could result in improved photos, according to people familiar with the matter. Some prototypes in testing continue to include the slight camera bump found on current iPhones, rather than having them flush with the back surface, the people said. For the front camera, Apple is testing dual lenses, one of the people said. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have single front cameras. As it has done in the past, Apple is using camera components from Sony. Apple has explored adding augmented reality-based features and depth-of-field enhancements to its iPhone camera system. Company engineers in the past have also experimented with integrating cameras into screens, another person said. All the new iPhones will run iOS 11, a mobile operating system that will include a refreshed user-interface and will be announced in June at the company’s annual developer conference, according to a person familiar with the matter. Apple has been testing faster processors based on a smaller 10-nanometer production process for all three new models, a person familiar with Apple’s chip plans said. That’s down from 16 nanometers for existing iPhones. The smaller processors are more efficient, allowing Apple to retain its battery life standards while adding more advanced features.

As new drone video from Duncan Sinfield shows, Apple is working around the clock to put the finishing touches on its new headquarters, both inside and out… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The beautiful new 4K drone footage offers a clear look as work continues around Apple Park. As you can see, the landscaping is still coming along, with much of the campus still lacking grass. However, progress is being made with trees and other small touches. Apple is putting the final touches on the company’s 175 acre campus in Cupertino. Perhaps most interestingly, today’s drone footage offers a peek at the inside of Apple Park with closeup, almost spy cam-like footage. As you can see beginning around the 50-second mark in the below video, much of the inside of Apple Park still looks like a construction zone with machinery and other equipment lying around, but the glass design does look pretty amazing. The video also shows a close look at some of the parking amenities at Apple Park, and there’s expected to be a lot of it. Steve Jobs Theater is also featured with a closeup and overhead view. Closing out the video is some absolutely stunning footage of Apple Park glowing in the dark, showing that work continues from dawn to dusk to get Apple Park ready for employees. The nighttime footage also shows just how big and bright Apple Park is already, and it will only seem bigger once construction is complete and all the lights are turned on. Back in February, Apple officially announced that its new headquarters would be named Apple Park, while the 1,000-seat auditorium would be named the Steve Jobs Theater. The company also stated that Apple Park would be ready for employees to start moving in during the month of April, though it doesn’t seem like that has yet to commence.

The company has added the locations of Britain’s electric vehicle charging stations by incorporating data from Cirrantic’s Moovility service, which lists re-juicing points for cars made by Tesla and Nissan, among others. It has also added public bicycle rental and drop-off points to maps of London, New York and Paris in a move to catch up with Google, which has listed such stations in several countries for some time. Apple laid out its updates to Maps in a briefing in London Wednesday. Improving its maps has become a focal point for Apple in its battle with Google. Apple added U.S. electric vehicle charging points in Maps in December. Last May, Apple CEO Tim Cook said his company would open an Indian development center in Hyderabad, with a specific focus on speeding up the development of more competitive mapping tools. It plans to employ as many as 4,000 people there. In December, Bloomberg reported that Apple is assembling a team to use drones to create and update map information faster than it can currently do with camera-equipped road vehicles. TOP BUSINESS VIDEOS: Story continues below | Business news first: Sign in for newsletters “There are thousands of layers of useful information that could be added to digital maps as an overlay,” said Martin Garner, an analyst at CCS Insight, “and there’s a benefit in becoming known for adding as many as possible. But adding overlays like this is an enormous undertaking and needs an industrial approach in order to source, manage and maintain the information for a large number of layers across many countries.” Apple first integrated transit information for Britain into Apple Maps in December, including route information for trains and buses across the nation, as well as London Underground services in the capital. According to data compiled by Zap-Map, there are just under 4,400 locations in Britain for recharging an electric vehicle. More than 3,000 will now be marked in Apple Maps. To identify these, Apple is using data provided by Cirrantic, a Munich mobility services company founded in 2014, and pinpointing electric vehicle charge points on a map. Google lists charging points globally, but doesn’t explicitly label them with easily identifiable icons. “We think that consistent, live information of the growing charger infrastructure increases the confidence of (electric vehicle) drivers and, especially with Apple Maps,” attracts new users to sustainable products like electric cars, said Arne Meusel, CEO and co-founder of Cirrantic. In Britain, he said, “We started with supporting the major charger operators, including Podpoint, CYC, Ecotricity, NPower and NewMotion. Any interested operator is welcome to set up a connection with us.” Nate Lanxon is a Bloomberg writer.

(Chris Neal/The Capital-Journal) Brian Fedotin, the deputy general council for the Kansas Corporation Commission, walks through reasons why the merger of Westar Energy and Great Plains should not go through prior to the commissioners voting on the merger Wednesday afternoon. (Chris Neal/The Capital-Journal) Kansas Corporation Commission Chairman Pat Apple, left, alongside Commissioner Jay Emler, wrap up Wednesday afternoon’s hearing after unanimously voting down the approval of a merger between Westar Energy and Great Plains. (Chris Neal/The Capital-Journal) The Kansas Corporation Commission Wednesday rejected the proposed sale of Westar Energy to Great Plains Energy, parent company of Kansas City Power and Light, citing it as being financially “too risky.” Commissioners Pat Apple, Shari Feist Albrecht and Jay Emler voted 3-0 to approve a 43-page order concluding the proposed $12.2 billion deal was not in the public’s best interest. “The proposed transaction fails not only to meet the majority of the merger standards but it fails to meet the most important of the factors” the KCC looks at in considering approving such deals, the order said. “The threshold question facing the commission is how much financial risk can be accepted before the proposed transaction does not serve the public interest,” the order added. “In its detailed review of an extensive record, the commission found the proposed transaction to be too risky.” KCC deputy general counsel Brian Fedotin outlined the order’s key points to the KCC prior to Wednesday’s vote during a special meeting at its headquarters in Topeka. The KCC intentionally scheduled the meeting to begin at 3:30 p.m. CST, after the stock market had closed for the day at 3 p.m. CST. GPE officials were disappointed with Wednesday’s order, said Chuck Caisley, a vice president for the company. “KCP&L and Westar have served customers in Kansas and Missouri for more than 100 years as neighboring utilities and as a combined company would create significant operational efficiencies and cost savings that would benefit our customers and communities,” Caisley said. “We will review the order and consider next steps.” The applicants’ options include appealing the order. Wednesday’s order appeared likely to concern more than just GPE’s stock price. Part of the deal, according to paperwork filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, requires GPE to pay Westar $380 million if the KCC fails to approve the acquisition. The company also would be out about $100 million in costs and fees associated with pursuing the transaction, Caisley said earlier this year. Westar spokeswoman Gina Penzig said officials with that utility planned to examine the order before deciding how to respond. Gov. Sam Brownback’s office was also reviewing the decision, said Melika Willoughby, the governor’s communications director. Brownback had been among local and state leaders who publicly expressed support for the proposed sale. Westar, GPE and KCP&L filed a joint application last July with the KCC seeking approval for the purchase. It would have brought GPE a place on the Fortune 500 list of the nation’s largest companies, said GPE president and CEO Terry Bassham. GPE projected the sale would bring about savings of $2 billion over 10 years. The transaction was expected to bring the overall elimination of 638 jobs in Topeka and the Kansas City area. Kansas law required the KCC to assess the proposed sale’s potential effects on consumers, the environment, public safety, state and local economies, utility shareholders and Kansas energy resources, as well as whether it would reduce the possibility of economic waste. The Kansas Open Meetings Act prevented KCC members from discussing the proposed transaction with each other except at their public meetings. KOMA bans the majority of a legislative body — in this case, two of the three commissioners — from discussing business without allowing access to the public. The order approved Wednesday included statements that: The size of the purchase price, particularly for a company of GPE’s size, calls into question its ability to service the acquisition-related debt. The joint applicants haven’t demonstrated sufficient savings to instill confidence that they will be able to service the transaction-related debt. After the proposed transaction was publicly announced, Moody’s Investors Service “placed Great Plains on review for downgrade” of its credit rating. Estimates the KCC received regarding savings GPE would realize as a result of the sale are too speculative to be reliable and do not appear to be all merger-related. The applicants claim they will try to reduce their labor force through attrition, but they can’t guarantee attrition will be sufficient to account for all necessary job reductions. If GPE’s projected savings estimates fall short, that money has to be accounted for and the two most likely sources are either job reductions or higher rates. Rather than propose a rate moratorium or refund, the applicants intended to pass savings to through customers through “rate cases” the KCC would consider. “The savings would stay with the utilities until the filing of a rate case,” the order said. “Until the next rate cases, which are not expected to be filed before 2019, customers will not receive any benefits from savings. GPE admits for the first three years after the transaction, its customers would not see any savings.” The KCC earlier this year heard seven days of testimony from 28 parties to the sale, backed by thousands of pages of documents KCC members had more than two months to examine. Wednesday’s order noted that of those 28 parties, only the applicants supported the proposed merger, with all others being opposed. “The Joint Applicants try to discredit the opposition by claiming ‘most of the intervenors in this case intervened to pursue private individual interests’ rather than representing the public interest the Commission is charged to protect,” the order said. “But the Joint Applicants are also pursuing their own interests in advocating for the transaction.” If approved, the combined company would have 1.5 million customers in Kansas and Missouri, with roughly 13,000 megawatts of generating capacity, 10,000 miles of transmission lines and 51,000 miles of distribution lines. Matt Pivarnik, president and CEO of the Greater Topeka Chamber of Commerce and GO Topeka, said Wednesday that those organizations stood ready to aid Westar in any way they could to digest the ruling’s ramifications and evalute the next steps for their future. “We’ve enjoyed working with Great Plains Energy and KCPL and showcasing to them all that Topeka and Shawnee County have to offer,” Pivarnik said.

The Home Plus was announced at CES earlier this year as a second generation successor to the original Home, adding an Android app, new video logging and time-lapse features, and the aforementioned Homekit support. In a statement to a 9to5Mac reader, Withings customer support commented on the decision, nothing that “Guided by our evolving business strategy, we will not be releasing Home Plus.” While Withings’ statement may be ambiguous as to the reasoning behind the cancellation, it’s easy to speculate that the decision to cancel the camera — which was specifically designed to work with Apple’s Homekit standard — is related to the ongoing spat between Apple and Withings’ parent company, Nokia, following Nokia’s suing of Apple last year. In response to that lawsuit, Apple pulled all Withings products from its online stores last December, and excluded the Home Plus from its list of Homekit devices when it refreshed it earlier this year. It’s also possible that the reasoning might not involve that fight at all, and Withings is simply looking to focus more on a smaller portfolio of products as it goes forward.

Well, sort of: We’re already seeing some fragmentation in terms of the new USB-C connector, which could eventually replace USB, as well as what is thankfully turning out to be a short-lived obsession Samsung had with larger USB micro-B connectors for its Galaxy line. But aside from that, and with the obvious exception of Apple’s Lightning connector, micro USB has destroyed the industry’s penchant for custom ports. Ten to 15 years ago, you always had to make sure you had the correct power supply for each of your gadgets. Usually, that power supply wasn’t even labeled. Today, you can charge your phone at your friend’s house, plug your tablet into any computer, and display photos from a digital camera directly on your TV, all thanks to a standardized connector. In its place, though, there’s a new problem: USB power. Not all USB chargers, connectors, and cables are born equal. You’ve probably noticed that some wall chargers are stronger than others. Sometimes, one USB socket on a laptop is seemingly more powerful than the other. On some desktop PCs, even when they’re turned off, you can charge your smartphone via a USB socket. It turns out there’s a method to all this madness — but first we have to explain how USB power actually works. New specifications There are now four USB specifications — USB 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1 — in addition to the new USB-C connector. We’ll point out where they significantly differ, but for the most part, we’ll focus on USB 3.0, as it’s the most common. In a USB network, there is one host and one device. In almost every case, your PC is the host, and your smartphone, tablet, or camera is the device. Power always flows from the host to the device, although data can flow in both directions, such as when you copy files back and forth between your computer and your phone. Okay, now the numbers. A regular USB 1.0 or 2.0 socket has four pins, and a USB cable has four wires. The inside pins carry data (D+ and D-), and the outside pins provide a 5-volt power supply. USB 3.0 ports add an additional row of five pins, so USB 3.0-compatible cables have nine wires. In terms of actual current (milliamps or mA), there are three kinds of USB port dictated by the current specs: a standard downstream port, a charging downstream port, and a dedicated charging port. The first two can be found on your computer (and should be labeled as such), and the third kind applies to “dumb” wall chargers. In the USB 1.0 and 2.0 specs, a standard downstream port is capable of delivering up to 500mA (0.5A); with USB 3.0, it moves up to 900mA (0.9A). The charging downstream and dedicated charging ports provide up to 1,500mA (1.5A). USB 3.1 bumps throughput to 10Gbps in what’s called SuperSpeed+ mode, bringing it roughly equivalent with first-generation Thunderbolt. It also supports power draw of 1.5A and 3A over the 5V bus. USB-C is a different connector entirely. It’s universal; you can put it in either way and it will work, unlike with USB, and like Apple’s Lightning connector. USB-C is also capable of twice the theoretical throughput of USB 3.0, and can output more power. Apple joined USB-C with USB 3.1 on its 12-inch MacBook and new MacBook Pros. We’re also seeing USB-C on phones in earnest now; current popular models include the Samsung Galaxy S8, the Google Pixel, and the OnePlus 3T. But there can also be older-style USB ports that support the 3.1 standard. The USB spec also allows for a “sleep-and-charge” port, which is where the USB ports on a powered-down computer remain active. You may have noticed this on your desktop PC, where there’s always some power flowing through the motherboard, but some laptops are also capable of sleep-and-charge. Now, this is what the spec dictates. But there are plenty of USB chargers that don’t conform to these specs — mostly of the wall-wart variety. Apple’s iPad charger, for example, provides 2.1A at 5V; Amazon’s Kindle Fire charger outputs 1.8A; and many car chargers can output anything from 1A to 2.1A. Can I blow up my USB device? There is a huge variance, then, between normal USB ports rated at 500mA, and dedicated charging ports, which range all the way up to 3,000mA. This leads to an important question: If you take a phone which came with a 900mA wall charger, and plug it into a 2,100mA iPad charger, as an example, will it blow up? In short, no: You can plug any USB device into any USB cable and into any USB port, and nothing will explode — and in fact, using a more powerful charger should speed up battery charging. We now do this all the time with our mobile devices here at ExtremeTech, and we’ve never had a problem. The longer answer is that the age of your device plays an important role, dictating both how fast it can be charged, and whether it can be charged using a wall charger at all. Way back in 2007, the USB Implementers Forum released the Battery Charging Specification, which standardized faster ways of charging USB devices, either by pumping more amps through your PC’s USB ports, or by using a wall charger. Shortly thereafter, USB devices that implemented this spec started to arrive. If you have a modern USB device, you should be able to plug into a high-amperage USB port and enjoy faster charging. If you have an older product, however, it probably won’t work with USB ports that employ the Battery Charging Specification. It might only work with old school, original (500mA) USB 1.0 and 2.0 PC ports. In some (much older) cases, USB devices can only be charged by computers with specific drivers installed, but this is now going back more than a decade. Quick charging and other notes Many new phones offer some kind of quick-charge capability — often with variable names, the most common being Qualcomm’s Quick Charge that works with Snapdragon-powered phones. The standard evolved quickly, and sits at version 4 at the time of this writing. For quick charging to work, usually you’ll need to use either the power adapter that came with the phone, or an appropriately labeled third-party adapter. Otherwise it will still take several hours to juice up. There are a few other things to be aware of. While PCs can have two kinds of USB port — standard downstream or charging downstream — OEMs haven’t always labeled them as such. As a result, you might have a device that charges from one port on your laptop, but not from the other. This is a trait of older computers, as there doesn’t seem to be a reason why standard downstream ports would be used, when high-amperage charging ports are available. Most vendors now put a small lightning icon above the proper charging port on laptops, and in some cases, those ports can even stay on when the lid is closed. In a similar vein, some external devices — 3.5-inch hard drives, most notably — require more power than a typical USB port can provide. That’s why they include a two-USB-port Y-cable, or an external AC power adapter. Otherwise, USB has certainly made charging our gadgets and peripherals much easier than it ever has been. And with USB-C, things will get even simpler, because you’ll never again have to curse out loud after plugging it in the wrong way.

Do they require a certain amperage, or type of port? I’ve had my older smartphones do that sometimes in the car as well. http://www.mrseb.co.uk Sebastian Anthony Basically, it looks like wall chargers communicate to the device that they ARE a wall charger by shorting the data lines (D- and D+). When the device sees shorted data lines, it knows that it can draw up to 1.5A — that’s what the Battery Charging Spec dictates. If the Touchpad doesn’t do that, then my guess is that HP isn’t implementing the spec exactly. Apple used to negotiate amperage by communicating using the power supply (2V = up to 1A, 2.5V = 1.5A, or whatever). Maybe HP is trying something like that. Would guess that the older smartphones don’t implement the Battery Charging Spec. Bill The spec says they only *have* to source 0.5 A, and then they can drop the voltage to 2 V, and then shut off. Farhan Well specs indicate the available current by voltages on the D− and D+ lines. When D+ = D− = 2.0 V, the device may pull up to 500 mA. When D+ = 2.0 V and D− = 2.8 V, the device may pull up to 1 A of current. When D+ = 2.8 V and D− = 2.0 V, the device may pull up to 2 A of current Bill The Battery Charging Spec doesn’t. It just shorts the D+ and D- lines together. You’re thinking of iPods, which don’t follow the standard. ncgh Some devices (like my Samsung) will only charge if there is a data connection (inner lines) or the data connection ports are shorted (typical for wall chargers). If they’re open, that phone won’t charge. Kary To further complicate things, there was an Android OS upgrade to the Verizon S4 that caused the phone not to charge at all unless the available amperage was a certain level. That eventually got fixed with another upgrade. But many car charger/cable combinations wouldn’t work for a time. RobF I have teh same issue with a Lenovo Tablet. It looks like a standard USB port, but will absolutely NOT charge with anything other than its proprietary charger. Though i can charge other devices with that charger. Go figure! OriGuy I think this is WebOS doing this, not the Touchpad hardware. I installed Android on my Touchpad and it charges OK with any USB charger. devogod My hp stream 8 tablet behaves the same way. Windows 8.1. it will only charge with the wall charger it came with, which is labeled as 2 amp output. geniusthemaster that IS mostly from overamperage against your battery, but the remainging 49% of your issue is that lithium ion batteries are horribly enept and begin faulting in all kinds of conditions, liek moisture {excess votlage during charging} heat overcharging{not removing it from port when battery is 100%} etc personal experience has proven that lead acid was far more reliable and after looking at lithium polymer battiers, i found it to be more like paint on a wall then a battery. Damarkus13 Wow, there is a lot wrong with this post. First off, no lithium-ion charger will allow you to overcharge your battery. Due to the fact that overcharged lithium batteries have a tendency to burst into flames, every single lithium-ion charger monitors at least voltage and usually current during the charge cycle and stops applying current when the battery reaches capacity. Unlike NiCd & NiMH batteries there is no trickle charging of lithium batteries. Second, lead-acid batteries have never been used in portable consumer electronics, to my knowledge. You must be thinking of nickle-based batteries (NiCd or NiMH). Which have an atrocious energy density, serious memory issues, and low per-cell voltages when compared to lithium-ion batteries. Third, the difference between lithium-ion batteries and lithium-polymer batteries is the casing. And finally, the issue with the HP Touchpad is that it uses a non-standard charging setup. Similar to, but different than, the iPhone. geniusthemaster first off you are wrong. secondoff tldr, thrid off i can tell your under 9 years old because DURACELL had lead acid-double a and double a and d batteries long before u were born. Damarkus13 I’d love for you do send me a link to Duracell lead-acid batteries in a AA form factor (I certainly couldn’t find any). The simple fact that a lead-acid cell produces ~33% more voltage than an alkaline cell and require significantly more maintenance to avoid degradation then almost any other rechargeable chemistry, means a lead-acid AA would be useful in very few situations. geniusthemaster http://bfy.tw/57Zk !!durk durk durk!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgYxW30cDN4 Damarkus13 How cute. Can’t be bothered to actually follow that search? Yes, Duracell makes lead acid batteries, but not in any cylindrical form factor. If you had bothered to look, you would know that. geniusthemaster ah first off little chuild, they contain lead and acid if you open the cilindrical batteries , and yes they existed for 20 years before mnimha, but your stupid so…. Damarkus13 Lead-acid Zinc-carbon Lithium Alkaline Educate yourself. geniusthemaster good googling. glad u finally learned. Curtis Sichmeller LOL, not only are you most likely dead wrong, but you’ve also decided to make a complete ass of yourself. I’m not sure if you’re trolling or just stupid, but keep it up kid, this is amusing. geniusthemaster eeeah first off little chuild, they contain lead and acid if you open the cilindrical batteries , and yes they existed for 20 years before mnimha, but your stupid so…. Stefan Vorkoetter A Duracell AA contains neither lead, nor acid. You might want to look up what “alkaline” means (hint: it’s the opposite of “acidic”). But believe it or not, I have a pair of old HP Portable Plus “laptops” that weighed about 10lb and used a 12V lead-acid (gel) battery for power. geniusthemaster ive chopped them open when i WAS 9, so your literally full of shit. nobody said alkaline in my post keed. Stefan Vorkoetter If you chopped open Duracells, then they were alkaline. Clearly a troll here, just making things up as he goes along to show how much of a “genius” he is. Anonymous Interesting article, thanks. But I have a question.From the article:  “In terms of actual current (milliamps or mA), there are three kinds of USB port dictated by the current specs: a standard downstream port, a charging downstream port, and a dedicated charging port. The first two can be found on your computer (and should be labeled as such), and the third kind applies to “dumb” wall chargers. “ What’s the difference between the standard downstream port and the charging downstream port ? Is there really a need for these two ? http://www.mrseb.co.uk Sebastian Anthony From what I gather, standard downstream is basically a normal USB 1 or 2 port. ‘Charging downstream’ was introduced with the Battery Charging Spec (2007). Functionally, they are the same — but the charging port, as it can go up to 1500mA (instead of 500mA) charges devices faster. As for whether the standard port is used any more, I don’t know :) It certainly seems like it is deprecated. Anonymous OK, thanks for the clarification :) thomas kim This is a bit misguiding, read the first reply first up above. USB 3.0 was pretty hard to find in 2012 but I would say 3.0 appears a quarter of the time as of 2015. http://www.cardinalphoto.com David Cardinal I found that with some laptops, external drives can get enough power from some but not all of the USB ports. Don’t know if that is/was a deliberate design where only some have the higher power rating, or a fluke due to the actual layout/wiring. http://www.mrseb.co.uk Sebastian Anthony Yeah, have noticed the same thing. Fairly sure it’s because some ports (perhaps on older computers?) are standard USB 2.0, and some have the increased Battery Charging Spec ports. That’s why some external HDDs/optical drives come with Y cables that you plug into two USB ports, for extra power! http://www.cardinalphoto.com David Cardinal Buffalo came out with an interesting drive that had a capacitor in line so spin-up could be done even on a low power port, then the drive could run on the low power after that. I think they even sold the capacitor separately, but it seems like with the newest drives the manufacturers either have gotten the power down a bit or integrated a capacitor, as the need for Y-cables seems to be decreasing a bit. Alex_Atkin_UK The cheap USB 2.0 caddy I bought of eBay had a capacitor too, but I don’t think the controller waited for it to charge before spinning up the drive so it didn’t seem to make much difference. Does the Buffalo do that? The Y cables are less common as many manufacturers seemed to relax the current limitations after the battery charging spec came out, so that a USB 2.0 device is actually allowed more than 500mA. This seems even more common on USB 3.0 ports where you can usually plug in a USB 2.0 device without using the Y connector, even though according to the spec it SHOULD still limit to 500mA if its running in USB 2.0 mode. I bought an external USB 2.0 DVD drive recently that only has a single fixed USB cable. I can only get it to work in USB 3.0 ports due to the current required to spin up the disc. I have tried with a USB 2.0 hub but that too follows the spec in limiting to 500mA, even though it has a 1A PSU. (not enough to run all four ports at full power either, bloody Belkin cheapskates) http://www.cardinalphoto.com David Cardinal I found that with some laptops, external drives can get enough power from some but not all of the USB ports. Don’t know if that is/was a deliberate design where only some have the higher power rating, or a fluke due to the actual layout/wiring. thomas kim To clarify it further, Standard downstream is USB 1 or 2, the most common. The charging downstream port (USB 3.0) is just a higher speed and more powerful version of the standard downstream port (USB 2.0). USB 3 is newer and usually has the usb symbol and an ss near it and/or has a blue tip. The blue tip or usb 3.0 charges at .9 amps. The wall charger that comes with your phone, charges at 1 amp and the wall charger on a tablet charges at 2.1 amps. Anonymous Don’t forget it was the European Union who took issue with the many different cell phone changers, and forced cell phone manufacturers to standardize. Paul Peterson Australia made this demand too. http://www.mrseb.co.uk Sebastian Anthony Aye, gotta love the EU on these kinds of things. They’re very sensible. Mel M. Liu So why wasn’t the EU or Australia able to fix Apple too? http://twitter.com/snaipperi snaipperi Apple is happily using a loophole in the agreement, which means they’re okay as long as they offer a simple adapter. Oh yeah, and that piece of metal costs £9.   http://www.facebook.com/johnxcassidy John Cassidy Apple are such a bunch of c0ckmuchers with their proprietary hardware and software. When will people realise that Apple products are more style than substance? Scott Kennelly . . . when other companies make computers and other things that are just as good as the stuff Apple makes (i.e. something better than Thunderbolt). Intel developed it (probably because Apple demanded it), and Apple used it. I’m sure other companies can use it too, but they’re too stupid or cheap to do that. The fact is though that Thunderbolt uses the mini display port, so they converted a port that already existed to make it more useful AND backward compatible. THAT’s intelligent innovation. How can you have a problem with that? http://www.brainsnacksdaily.com/ Wait “When will people realise that Apple products are more style than substance?” Because people buy it for style and how mind numblingly simple its interface and software/hardware integration is. Most people are not good with tech and gadgets, hence how Best Buy stays in business with their “helpful” salesman spewing crap they don’t even understand themselves. Besides the proprietary stuff, Apple offers a pretty good user experience, especially when you need assistance and in store warranty work. No other brand offers that. There are plenty of other devices that offer the same feature for half the price. But if you’re not tech savvy, how would you know? Apple is overpriced but people are pretty much guaranteed a solid piece of hardware, software and customers service. So those that isn’t into figuring out specs, troubleshoot, and worry about quality, they just buy Apple and pay the premium. UstillUseAniPhone? As usual, being unknowledgeable costs money. Same with every industry. Except, Apple charges hilariously for it and frankly, takes advantage of it. RC1975 Perhaps, but as expensive as Apple products are, no-one is forcing you to buy them, and as a private company why shouldn’t they charge whatever they like for their products? Joel Trauger AndroidMasterRace http://www.axiam-pc.co.uk Darren Forster I really can’t wait for them to release the apple car – you’ll probably have to pay Apple a small fortune for the keys to unlock the sump to do an oil change, and most of it will be superglued together if the phones are anything to go by – and give up on the chance of doing any boy racer mods to it as it’ll be so tightly locked down to apples own parts. jeff_engel I wish they had adopted a tactile plug orientation standard; we would all love to quit guessing which side goes up. pukoh lightning does? “MaxxFordham” You don’t know, so you’re asking someone who also doesn’t know? Yeah, “that works.” Gmon http://i.imgur.com/8cEBpMB.png Bill We need to make tunneling USB connectors! http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2388 Actually there are reversible USB plugs, and they look just like the bottom picture: http://www.trendhunter.com/trends/double-u-usb-port Bill We need to make tunneling USB connectors! http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2388 Actually there are reversible USB plugs, and they look just like the bottom picture: http://www.trendhunter.com/trends/double-u-usb-port torque On all µUSB plugs I’ve seen (or felt), the underside has two little bumps on it, while the top side is completely smooth. Henrik Danielsson Well, you can’t plug it in wrong by making a wrong guess, unless you really force it in there, same as it’s always been with monitor/printer connectors… This was done to keep implementation costs down, also a reason why USB became popular with manufacturers. Yes, they’ve regretted this choice from a user POV, but USB connectors which go both ways are on the market now. http://www.axiam-pc.co.uk Darren Forster Motorola were making there phones a standard Mini-usb long before the EU ruling. Which is why I stuck with moto for ages ‘cos it meant that as long as I could find a camera cable I could always charge the phone even if I forgot the charger. Paul Peterson You forgot Motorola. Motorola wanted to insure you used only their chargers so many Motorola phones over the years would not charge on any USB charger.  For AC adapters, they had to be for Motorola devices, for Windows PC’s you had to install Motorola’s USB driver for your device to charge. http://www.mrseb.co.uk Sebastian Anthony Yeah, it used to be a lot more complicated. Basically, prior to the Battery Charging Spec, USB devices had to digitally negotiate the ampage. If an OEM wanted to, it could program the USB controller on the device to only talk to an “authenticated” USB host/charger. Nathan Brown Lol. Remember the Moto Milestone problem of the touchscreen going crazy? I found this started to happen after using a non-propriety charger, and then was made worse by the crappy slide cable and humidity… I wonder if Moto were trying to enforce Moto charger use, or just used substandard tech on the charging assembly? Anonymous I saw something similar very recently on my iPhone 4. I had long back bought a cell phone case for my old 3GS which came with a free wall charger. Last week I couldn’t find my phone charger (wall plug), so I tried using this cheap wall charger and while the charger was plugged in my OS started behaving. Wont let me switch apps, touch screen behaved crazy and stuff. I did a few tests to ensure that it was the charger which was bad (I restarted my phone and tried with the bad charger again to reproduce the problem, then checked with apple charger and then used the bad guy again to be sure it always causes trouble). I immediately threw the bad charger in trash. Kary This was more of a bug, but there was a Verizon Android upgrade to the Samsung S4 which made low current car chargers non-functional. If you had a 1 amp car charger it simply wouldn’t work to provide any current/charge, where prior to the update it did work. I didn’t see that same issue with any computer/USB ports, but I didn’t really go looking for it either, and they eventually fixed the problem. The phone though will still warn you that you’re using a low current charger. Ty Gardiner I am confused about the comment “using a more powerful charger should speed up battery charging.”  Isn’t it correct that the device DRAWS the current from the charger, not the other way around?  If that is correct, plugging a device into a charger capable of delivering a higher amount of amps would have zero impact on the charge time. Anonymous If the port only provide 500 mA, the device can’t draw more than that.  If the port can provide 1.5 A, the device could request/draw 900 mA and charge faster than it would on a 500 mA port. Anonymous If the port only provide 500 mA, the device can’t draw more than that.  If the port can provide 1.5 A, the device could request/draw 900 mA and charge faster than it would on a 500 mA port. Trueblue711 But that’s not how the post sounds. It sounds like the device will have a current being put into it as high as the charger supports, which is not the case since devices simply draw what they need. ronch The way I undertand it, voltage cannot be higher than what a device can take in but current can be higher because the device will take only what it needs. Take the wall socket, for example. Plugging a device that only takes 110v into a 220v outlet will blow it up, but you can plug in many different 220v devices with different current input specs into a 220v outlet and they won’t blow up. A cellphone charger will take only as much as it wants although a vacuum cleaner can take more. In the case of mobile devices, one can come with a charger that’s just on the safe side, e.g. bundling a 800mA charger with a device that can actually take in, say, 1500mA. Plug that device into a 2000mA charger and it’ll charge faster because it can now take in 1500mA. Anonymous If the port only provide 500 mA, the device can’t draw more than that.  If the port can provide 1.5 A, the device could request/draw 900 mA and charge faster than it would on a 500 mA port. zzz05 Electrical current is directly comparable to water current. In other words, if you hook up a fire hose nozzle to a garden hose, it won’t provide any higher current than the garden hose nozzle. But hook it up to a fire hose, and it will. On the other hand, hook a garden hose nozzle up to the fire hose, and it won’t.  pukoh confusing analogy. Maybe something for like this Garden tap = 500mA port, Fire hydrant = 2000mA port garden/fire hose = usb cable (no relevance?) My mouth = phone. Question 1: My phone comes with a 500mA charger. = I can drink from a garden tap Is it safe to plug my phone into a 2000mA charger? = Can i drink from a fire hydrant? Will the hydrant decrease it’s flow of water to what ever i can accept? And reading from reading some comments below, it says something about chargers exploding from hungry phones? Question 2: If I usually drink from a fire hydrant, could i make a garden tap ‘explode’ from drinking from it? Brad Wood The key is in Ohm’s law. E = I R or voltage equals amperage (current) times resistance. The charger only forces the voltage. The amperage of a charger is just its CAPABILITY. It’s up to the device being charged to request however much current it wants based on the resistance or impedance of the phone. So, voltage is fixed at 5V. Let’s say a phone has a charging impedance of 7 Ohms, that means it will try to draw 714 milliamps (or .7 amps) of current from the charger. E / R = I so 5 / 7 = .714 So, if you’re using a 500mA charger, then the device only gets 500mA even though it would like more. If you’re using 1A charger, than the device gets to pull its full 714mAs. If you’re using a 5000 Amp charger- the device still just pulls it’s 714mA! That is because the charger doesn’t *push* current. It simply provides a voltage difference (or pressure if you will) and is also rated at its MAX possible current, but the actual current that is pulled by the device is entirely decided on the devices charging impedance. Therefore, the amperage rating of a charger can never be “too high”. Henrik Danielsson True, but some phones may not regulate their draw properly, causing them to overheat. Tom Dudman A poorer quality 500 mA charger may not have protection if too high a load is put on it. A 7 ohm device will still try to draw 714 mA from a 5 V 500 mA charger. A good 500 mA charger will drop its voltage to compensate. A cheap/bad 500 mA charger will try and deliver the over-current until it overheats or blows up. “MaxxFordham” Not true. The garden hose will make the water coming from the fire hose have even more pressure, but with a smaller amount of water running all at once. That’s not quite the same as the way electric current behaves. torque Yes and no. The charging circuit may be perfectly able to draw a higher current than intended by the phone manufacturer. Ty Gardiner I am confused about the comment “using a more powerful charger should speed up battery charging.”  Isn’t it correct that the device DRAWS the current from the charger, not the other way around?  If that is correct, plugging a device into a charger capable of delivering a higher amount of amps would have zero impact on the charge time. http://twitter.com/myrmidonical myrmidonical I’ve noticed with my Samsung Focus that if I charge it with a non-Samsung charger, the charging indicator will never clear after I disconnect from the charger until the next time I use one made by Samsung. Battery life is usually 10%-20% reduced as well. I assume these two issues are related. Has anyone else had this issue with Samsung? Guest going to assume the correct charger has a voltage output of 5.2 VS the other with a output of 5V.0, thus not being able to charge the battery all the way up. Anonymous Correction, the new USB “Battery Charging spec 1.2” dictates that 1.5A is the MINIMUM power supply for a charging downstream port.  Up to 5A is permitted.  See table 5-2 on p.44 of the spec. http://www.mrseb.co.uk Sebastian Anthony Ah, I was trying to work that out actually, but couldn’t quite get my head around it. So, wall chargers (dedicated charging ports) can do up to 5A — but a charging downstream port (in a PC) can only do 1.5A, right? (Something about increased power damaging the data integrity on the data lines). Thanks for commenting! Guest No, the minimum is 0.5 A. Sawyer Norquist To clarify and expand on other comments, the power drawn actually depends on the device drawing the power.  Assuming the charger doesn’t arbitrarily raise the voltage, it cannot force a given amperage into the device being charged.  Ohm’s law dictates that as long as the voltage is consistent, the resistance determines the amperage; in this case the device puts load on the charger (basically closing the circuit while introducing resistance) and that determines the amperage of the system. What the charger rating means is just the MAXIMUM amperage it can provide.  In truth (again, assuming voltage doesn’t exceed the ratings), I’d guess your phone is more capable of making your charger explode.  If your phone tries to draw more amperage than the charger can handle, it could cause significant overheating.  Any half-decent charger should limit itself in this scenario, but el cheapo chargers can still be made to… malfunction (ah, childhood memories…) In other news, I nearly threw a party when I first learned that chargers were moving to a standard spec. http://twitter.com/konaya Benjamin Tayehanpour What you are saying is all true, but in the very unlikely event that something goes terribly wrong inside your device (such as a short-circuit) you wouldn’t want the short-circuit current to be too high, eh? Summary: Higher maximum amperage won’t kill your device, but if your device is old and won’t accept a charge current higher than 500mA, it’s an unnecessary risk to give it the chance to draw much more than that. SARodrigues I don’t think you understood very well what Sawyer Norquist was explaining. The device will draw whatever current it needs, the charger doesn’t exactly have a say. If the charger cannot handle the amount of current, it will overheat and possibly melt or even explode. If the charger happens to be your computer’s USB ports, they will burn (unless they have a failsafe). Personally, I’d rather have the device burn that my laptop, thus I prefer my USB ports to be able to handle higher currents. phishy2 USB ports usually have some sort of electronic circuit breaker. If you exceed 500ma, the USB port automatically shuts off and must be reset. My 10 yr old Dell laptop did this when I tried to plug too many things into a large USB hub. Also, when a USB devices fails, it may trip the port. I had a failed USB hub do this. Bill but in the very unlikely event that something goes terribly wrong inside your device (such as a short-circuit) you wouldn’t want the short-circuit current to be too high, eh? The charger’s maximum current will make no difference in this situation. Max current will be drawn, something will burn up, and the circuit will become open. Simon Taylor Are the USB ports on a desktop PC really limited to 500mA though with only specific ones as dedicated charging ports? If true, I don’t see the point in artificially limiting the current when any ATX PSU can easily provide more than enough amps. Is it something to do with the thickness of the +5V and GND traces on the motherboard that go to the USB ports? I understand why USB ports on a laptop are current limited with maybe 1 higher power port for external HDDs/charging/etc. There’s only so much current the internal voltage regulation circuitry can handle before it overheats. Also most laptop PSUs are less than 4A and of course you want to use as little power as possible when running on the battery. Anonymous There were two issues involved when they created the batttery charging specs 1) backwards compatibility – very important as the older 1.0 standard didn’t allow much power and some devices can be damanged 2) wiring/trace sizes – low-end/cheap boards saved money by going with the absolutely smallest traces/wire size that would carry the load. Related to these two issues in PC’s is the power regulation of the board itself. Remember the capacity issue that many boards suffered a few years back? Overloading the power regulation of a board can easily blow the board itself – CPU and/or chipset fry while GPU’s and such go up in smoke. Very expensive and a potential fire hazzard in your home/office. Don Barker Thanks for the clarification! I always harboured a fear that I might damage a device, although I learned all the electronics I could stand in the USAF. It was the current rating I always sweated. Anonymous How about USB charging ports on emergency  hand cracked generators like the Eton FR160r weather radio? I’ve heard these can damage phones if not done properly. True? http://socialentrepreneurship.change.org/actions/view/twenty-first_century_metric_america_in_your_state BeholdersEye I think and look at specs, they are all under .5 amps, that is why you need to crank a long time…. Hook up to my bike please I know I will not be cranking for hours at a time… Jim N I knew there were some differences in chargers but I would never have suspected that different USB ports on the same computer would be different.  So how can I determine which is the best charging USB port on my desktop or laptop?  James Moore on a desktop box, rule of thumb is the usb ports nearest the PSU (usually the ones you’d plug a keyboard and mouse into) are the ones that deliver the highest port currents. Ports that sit off the motherboard (eg on breakout plates or front panels) are generally data ports, probably not safe to plug in an external hard drive never mind your ipod. Laptops with sleep-charging ports will usually be indicated in the user manual (my Toshiba and my Asus both have it advertised on the box!) http://twitter.com/pjd65 PJD Does anyone know what is up with the NookColor?  It will ONLY charge from its own wall charger.  It looks like USB & a standard USB cable works find for data with a PC or laptop, but even with its own cable, it will not charge from a PC and other wall chargers do not charge it. http://pulse.yahoo.com/_J6N335G6OBCPMGDLCCH56UBECM David For the NookColor, it might be that it needs the 1 to 2 Amps that is supplied by its own charger (have a look at what’s printed on it).  I have a Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet, and its charger supplies 2.1 Amps, and it will only “trickle charge” from a standard USB port supplying the standard 500ma (0.5 Amp). Anonymous Not sure about the NC, but I can plug my Nook Tablet in with a “standard” USB and it appears to take a charge.  This is with the USB connected to my PC and not a power supply though. Anonymous Not sure about the NC, but I can plug my Nook Tablet in with a “standard” USB and it appears to take a charge.  This is with the USB connected to my PC and not a power supply though. Benjamin Druhot  The Nook Color’s power brick shorts the data pins, which is something the Nook looks for. As noted elsewhere, that’s within USB spec; the Nook is just unusually picky in ONLY charging from something that shorts the data lines. Many other chargers put resistors on them instead, to make them communicate properly with various iDevices (again, as noted elsewhere.) The PS Vita is another gadget that does the same thing. A Vita and Nook Color can use each other’s chargers, since they’re both looking for that data short, but not most other non-computer chargers. Anonymous I guess the bottom line is “If it fits, it ships.”  Presumably, slight voltage differences on the chargers: 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, don’t matter. http://www.therebelchick.com The Rebel Chick Jenn I really need to get these new outlets! Level380 Based on the picture they are iphone only. Iphone and android phone use different charging methods SARodrigues They are NOT iPhone only. They’re USB outlets and will charge pretty much any device. Level380 Dude READ MY COMMENT…. Iphone and Android devices use DIFFERENT charging methods. For High speed charging aka AC Charging, iphone and android use different methods! A iPhone charge will only ‘slow’ charge a android phone as it doesn’t use the right high speed charging method. The same in reverse, a android high speed charge will only slow charge a iphone! BTW Hope you feel like a great big man for replying to a comment from over a year ago with ZERO value add SARodrigues I’d say correcting a misleading reply IS indeed adding value. Yes, a year later, because people will read comments no matter what year we are in; I read them. Either way, your current reply doesn’t even address nor nullify what I’ve said; you actually confirmed it. If you notice, I never said anything about charge speed, (or that they would charge all devices as quickly as their original chargers or AC fast-chargers for that matter); I said those outlets WILL charge other devices, period. And by the way, not all phones capable of being charged by USB are either iPhones or Androids. My current crappy Symbian doesn’t give a crap about iPhone/Android charging methods and IS charged by those outlets, confirming once again they are not iPhone only. (Also, not all gadgets capable of USB charging are smartphones, but that is besides the point given the article’s content). By the way: “For High speed charging aka AC Charging, iphone and android use different methods!” -> Talking about USB, there’s AC nothing. It’s DC current. Anyway, that is besides my point. I won’t argue about it anymore, since we’re talking about different things. Whoever reads this later seeking information take it with a grain of salt and should be able to make its own judgment. Eitan Hi, I have a Rc helicopter from silverlit which the transmitter includes 8 AA batteries which means 12 V of charging (the helicopter charges from the transmitter) but the provided a usb cable to save up the batteries but the thing that usb port is only 5 V and the helicopter charging from transmitter is 12 and the usb power hasn’t the sufficient amount of power to charge it properly. any suggestions? I mean can I make my custom charger by buying some components and make a charger suits the helicopter without using the transmiter to charge? thank you very much.. http://www.mrseb.co.uk/ Sebastian Anthony I have no idea what you’re talking about. A USB socket should charge an iPhone and Android equally. Level380 Clearly you shouldn’t have been writing this if you don’t have a understanding on how charging works for signalling high current charging. All chargers will charge at slow charge rate aka 500mah for android and iphone. To move to high speed aka 1000/2000mah the charger needs to signal the device it can supply this higher current. Of course apple uses its own format by providing voltage values on the data lines and android uses the usb charging standard which is the data pins shorted. Clearly these are not compatible as one requires the data pins connected and one doesn’t. Anonymous Great article, but it seems to me that the choice of  micro-usb as the de-facto standard is a big mistake. I have had to replace 4 HTC phones because of problems with the USB port when charging. It is difficult to tell if a usb-micro plug is right side up (whatever that means) and it is apparently easy to bend pins etc.. in the port. Beieve me after the 2nd phone I was careful. The ohter issue is it doesn’t appear that port/connector was ever designed to take the stress of using a cradle… Love the universality of USB hate the choice of connectors. http://www.cardinalphoto.com David Cardinal DF–I have to agree that micro-USB is pretty bad as far as the physical connection. It’s great that there is a standard, but I cringe whenever I need to put my phone in a car cradle, and usually have to try 1.5 times to plug the charger into my phone or tablet since there doesn’t seem to be a standard for which way the jack should work. Thank goodness for my Touchstone wireless charging dock for my TP at least. More wireless charging options would be great, but the industry has been very slow to move after some initial promise. http://www.mrseb.co.uk Sebastian Anthony The standard for USB connectors is always ‘trident up’ — i.e. the USB symbol should face upwards. The trident on Micro-USB is the narrower side of the connector. But yeah, that’s always been the problem with USB: There’s no easy way to feel which way is the right way up (unless you can feel the trident… but YMMV…) http://www.mrseb.co.uk Sebastian Anthony It’s worth noting that not all OEMs implement the ‘trident up’ standard tho’ :P http://www.cardinalphoto.com David Cardinal Yes, that’s part of my problem. One of mine is upside-down, so I always have to remember which one:-) http://www.cardinalphoto.com David Cardinal Yes, that’s part of my problem. One of mine is upside-down, so I always have to remember which one:-) http://pulse.yahoo.com/_EKNZKJ5LBTYYEUH4NCSPTGFGGE Eric Could you be kind enough to list that device here? I bought 2 cables without the trident (probably unlicensed) which still function fine after almost 2 years of daily use… (Thanks Buy.COM – saved a great deal) All of my cables included with phones and a tablet have had the trident and it’s always been designed to face up, alternatively, unless you smoke too much pot you should be able to remember which way it goes after using it 3-5 times… (unless you have a memory disorder like Agnosia, Alzheimer’s, or something like Dimentia) SA: The ones that don’t go with standards probably don’t have a large market share for that, and other reasons… RE: trident up. http://www.cardinalphoto.com David Cardinal Eric–I hate to bust your theory but the two devices (which I use every day) that are reversed from each other are the Samsung / Google Galaxy Nexus and the ASUS / Google Nexus 7. One has the flat side up and one down. So yes I remember which is which, in theory, but still recharging both at the end of the day requires flipping the connector, which seems more than a little silly to have to do. http://www.mrseb.co.uk/ Sebastian Anthony OR… you could flip the device! Late to the party Have you ever had a device that was “backwards from expected”? I’ve had several, and they mess with me forever. For a while I can remember “this device is backwards”, but after a time I learn the orientation, and eventually I try to make it “backwards” which would be back to normal, which is wrong for that device! Aaah!! Mathew Horne Which way is up? Lol. On both my htc rezound and my Nexus 7, the larger, flat side of the micro-USB connector should be to the screen side of the device. In the dark, I just brush my thumb over the connector to feel for the… I’ll call them the barbs. It was the same on the Droid X I had for awhile, but the other way around on the HTC Incredible. I would suggest just noting what is it like on your devices, and then remember. I regularly connect my connect my micro USB cables in the dark. For my two bits about charging amperage vs devices verses wall chargers, none of my devices seem to care what they’re plugged into. I can plug them into the HTC Chargers, the Motorola charger, the Nexus charger, or the USB connector on a power inverter in my car. i did notice that the Nexus 7 was consuming power faster than the computer could charge it earlier today; it’s wall charger can provide 2 amps current vs the .5 of the USB port. http://www.cardinalphoto.com David Cardinal DF–I have to agree that micro-USB is pretty bad as far as the physical connection.

Bill I’ve had the cable connectors fail several times, but that’s exactly what they’re designed to do. The cable side is designed to fail before the device side, so all you have to do is replace the cable. Anonymous Nice article .To charge my cell phone in my car, I can buy a 10 watt USB car charger, a 5 watt, or smaller. The 120 VAC charger that came with the phone has an output of 5 watts. If I connect the phone to a higher wattage charger, will the charging circuit draw higher current or do these new smart phones control the rate of charging?There are LEDs on car chargers to indicate the state of charge. Are the status LEDs controlled by the charger or the phone? Are the data pins in the charging cable used with the charger?I am looking for a high quality, well regulated, surge protected car charger. I have lost a couple of dumb phones in the past after charging them with car chargers. Thanks. Anonymous I don’t see it mentioned here, so I figured I’d mention it: using a low-quality USB AC adapter can be bad for your phone, especially if it can supply a decent amount of current. Low-quality adapters often either have wacky voltages (too high or too low), lots of ripple (varying voltage), or both. Also, in the second-to-last paragraph, “two-USB-port Y-able” should be “two-USB-port Y-cable”. http://www.mrseb.co.uk Sebastian Anthony Thanks for the info — fixed the post! http://twitter.com/dhc1950 Dan Crawford My “semi-intelligent” phone fried after I plugged it into a USB adapter in my car. After about 30 minutes I smelled an odor like overheated wiring. The phone battery was hot and the phone was inoperable. Trying a new battery didn’t help. The SIM card was unscathed, so I forked out $150 bucks for a similar phone and was back in business. Lesson learned: all USBs are not alike, or the “U” for universal ain’t universal after all. I didn’t have specs on milliamps or other details about the USB car charging device. It came with a high-tech travel mug which had a USB cable to keep the coffee warm. whacker7 Probably this was a case where the car charger lacked adequate voltage regulation or selection, and allowed a voltage a bit higher than 5 VDC, perhaps even edging up to the nominal car electrical system voltage of 13.8 VDC (otherwise known as 12 VDC).  Obviously not good.  I have a feeling a lot of the car chargers use simple voltage-divider resistor networks to try and come close to 5 VDC, but fully nailing down what goes on with them is one thing that led me to this article.  Maybe some use a zener diode at the output to regulate.  Who can say?  http://www.facebook.com/people/Michael-Schmitt/100001798884431 Michael Schmitt Check out this pdf from Texas Instruments: http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slva520/slva520.pdf http://profile.yahoo.com/PQZP6LNZVUWX45WXYFMLZVCEZE Jim I once had a professor at the University of Illinois that likened electronics to water flow.  And I think this was one of the guys that invented the first computer or transistor.  Volts was the water pressure and amps was the size of the pipe.  So, if you have a bigger pipe (1 amp vs .5 amps), you can fill up the bucket faster.  But if you have more pressure (10V vs 5V), you can break the bucket. Scooter Ponzani Sooo, I shouldn’t charge my 5V devices with the 10V charger that came with my iPad. Trying to figure this stuff out.

Tomer A Hi, I would like to build some kind of “USB charging station”, meaning to be able to charge many mobile phones simulataniously through an AC powered USB HUB or adaptor, without a laptop involved, only directly from the AC power. My idea is to use as less AC connectors in order to be able to charge as many mobile phones as possible simulataniously and still at normal charging speed. Do you think this is possible? would I need any special tricks or can it just work for example with an AC powered 10X USB hub that can be found on the market for charging 10 mobile device simultanoiusly and efficiently? My goal is to achieve the ability to eventully charge 500-1000 mobile devices simulataniosly and efficiently, with a minimum of AC power points and minimum cables lying around and creating chaos.  do you think I could make it through that kind of system? or is a completly stupid idea? do you have any other idea how to do that? I’ll be happy to hear your opinions and ideas. Thanks. http://twitter.com/AlwaysThinkin Luke Cushanick Are there many monitors that come with charging ports?

Perry Bond Hi Slightly different question.  I have a RC helicopter with a USB charging cable.  The battery in the helicopter states 3.7 volts, yet I know the usb port is 5v (or is it 5.1) I charged it off a mains adapter (UK 230v) and it fried the the battery.  The manufacturer says that I shouldn’t have used a mains adapter, but just a computer USB. Two questions 1. Is there a problem charging a 3.7v battery from 5v USB? 2. Is there a difference between PC’s USB’s and mains adapters? I hope it is OK to ask this question here Thanks http://www.mrseb.co.uk/ Sebastian Anthony In general, every USB plug should work with every USB socket. I think 5v USB should charge a 3.7v battery just fine :) skuppy This is something I’ve always wondered about. Does the 5V source simply get connected to the battery terminals in the phone? Or is there some charging electronics in the phone doing DC to DC down-regulating? skuppy I have tried charging my Samsung GS2 from most of the USB ports of a Dell Optiplex 990 SFF chasis, and all seem to be delivering the normal 500mAh.

Try it and let me know if it works :) AlanM2 Yesterday was the second time to recharge my Kindle ebook I hooked it up to the 1.1 USB jack on my 4 year old Dell desktop computer, turned on the computer, and was unable to get from the Dell screen to Windows XP.  The computer was frozen.  Alone and with the help of a Dell tech by phone we tried unplugging all USB connections, hitting F2, F8, F12, etc. After an hour, when the tech was ready to give up, I suggested unplugging and then replugging the ac cord to the computer while it was still operational, and this rebooting finally got me into Windows again.  Why he never thought of this I do not know.  Note this is the second time this has happened.  The first time a Dell tech was successful but I feel certain he did not suggest what we did the second time and did not recall his solution.  I was using the Kindle supplied USB wire.  Nothing unusual.  Sorry to be anecdotal here but I am not a computer maven these days. Why did this occur?  And was I taking a chance on rebooting  the computer this way?  I did have the approval of the tech.  happyrho So, based on what I’ve read here, am I to understand that if I hooked my cell phone up to a charger that could deliver 1000 amps (but never over 5 volts!) it would charge just fine with no damage to battery or circuits? http://www.mrseb.co.uk/ Sebastian Anthony Yep, I think that’s right :) Umut “Turk” Kocaman Thank you for the detailed article.

Well written. http://www.mrseb.co.uk/ Sebastian Anthony A drive _draws_ as many amps as it can take. The USB charger doesn’t _force_ amps into the device.

Can I charge a tablet (Nexus 7) that is supplied with a 2 amp charger, with a 1 amp charger, wall/car or otherwise. Do the device and the charger communicate? Or is the shorted data pin simply a signal for the tablet to draw as much current as it can. http://www.mrseb.co.uk/ Sebastian Anthony Yep, you can charge it with a 1A charger — it will just charge a little slower :) And if you’re actually using it at the time, it might not charge at all. Alex Worden You clearly don’t understand electricity from your statement: This leads to a rather important question: If you take a smartphone which came with a 900mA wall charger, and plug it into a 2100mA iPad charger, will it blow up? This isn’t the important question at all! More important is if you attempt to plug your iPad into a charger that *can’t* deliver the amps it expects. With regular transformers, this will result in the internal coils melting and causing a short-circuit, delivering 120v AC to your device (and frying it) and potentially it’s current human user!  What I don’t understand is… why doesn’t this happen? Amps are a function of volts / resistance. How do these chargers protect themselves from delivering more amps than they’re capable of? Andres G. And i think you dont understand transformer saturation. The internal switching transformer wil not be able to cope with the current so you get lower voltage and a hell of a ripple, translating in not a good charge or not charging at all and a bit of overheating in the coil but not enough to burst into flames (rated for that). More in my concern is why some manufacturers don’t recommend a 2A charger for their 1A rated products (ex: gopro, iphone). Isn’t the charging circuit the one regulating the current? or they are not regulating the current at all and letting the charger choose the rate via the data pins (really dangerous)? http://twitter.com/captiveinfla Jane Eskay Waldmann I may have read too fast but I don’t see where you say our iphones will blow up. You seem to be saying they won’t. In “layman’s” terms can our phones blow up and on what devices? emsel Great article and comments. I have a wall charger that is rated at 2.0 amps.  I have a tablet (PlayBook) that came with a 1.8 amp charger.  I can plug a USB cable into the wall charger and the PlayBook responds with a lightning rod icon on the battery. I different USB cable, when plugged into the wall charger and the PlayBook responds with a plug icon on the battery. That, according to the PlayBook info means the charge rate is slow.  How is the USB cable determining the charge rate?  Same wall charger, same PlayBook.I’ve tested some other cables, some respond with the lightning bolt (fast charge) and some with the plug icon (slower charge). I can’t see any markings on the cable that would indicate any difference.i just found a cable that would did not respond with any battery icon. Using an app, it indicated the battery was charging but at a very slow rate.Again, no indication on the cable that showed any differences.I know there are data only cables, but those have a clear marking of a battery with a line through it. I just used a new wall charger I bought that is rated at 2.0 amps. Using the same procedure as I did with the 1.8 amp wall charger, I got the same differences between the cables. Could it be that some USB cables are limited to how much current they will carry, perhaps because of undersized wiring in the USB cable? http://www.mrseb.co.uk/ Sebastian Anthony Hehe, interesting! Yes, it would suggest that the wires themselves aren’t capable of carrying 2 amps (though I don’t know how the device would detect that? Maybe it measures resistance on the wires or something?) Might be that the device is only set up to fast charge using dedicated charging cables? (Where the data pins aren’t used.) emsel Thanks for the reply.   It might be that the higher capacity batteries draw enough current that the resistance of the wires reduces the voltage below a fast charge minimum. .   It isn’t dedicated cable related, because the cables that gave the fast charge were from iGo, with a removable micro USB tip. I looked at the many cables I have and was looking for some sort of code or icon that would indicate if it could be used for fast charging.  I couldn’t find anything at all, except the ones that indicated data only. I have an app for my smartphone that measures if the source is charging the phone, it has 2 indications.  One is ‘connected to an external power source charging’ , the other is ‘charging but at a reduced rate’  These are consistent with the lightning bolt icon and the plug icon on my PlayBook.  Both the lightning bolt and the plug come on when the app indicates an external power source.  No icons appear when the app indicates reduced rate, even though is is connected to an external source. I have both a plug in power source and a battery power source rated at 2 amps. Each acts the same, so the device can charge from either a charger plugged into an outlet or a battery source, as long as it is rated at 2 amps or higher. I’m more and more thinking it is smaller power wires in the cables that can’t charge the higher power phones or pads.  The standards industry should require some capacity indications. http://www.cardinalphoto.com David Cardinal Emsel — Some good sleuthing there. I have a box full of chargers & cords to go with my box full of electronics and it drives me nuts with all the different behaviors of combinations of — unmarked — cables with the chargers & devices. Unfortunately there doesn’t seem to be a single uber-cable that will do everything right (for example a charge-only cable is sometimes a better bet for fast charging, but it can’t carry data…), or else I’d just order a dozen of them and throw the rest away. Let me know if you find one! http://www.facebook.com/kleinarne Arne Klein My guess is that the PlayBook works the same way, or similarly at least, as HTC phones. To make sure they don’t overload USB ports and potentially fry the entire controller, the phone requires the data pins to be short circuited. High Power chargers usually provide shorted data pins, but a cheap USB cable sold with a charger might have only the power wires, but not the data wires, so from the phone’s point of view, they are separated rather than shorted. As a result, the phone limits itself to slow charging (500mA) to prevent itself from frying the USB port. Any USB data cable (I.e. o e that can be used to connect a device to a computer) should be able to charge your device with high speed as long as your charger can handle it. The same is not true for Apple devices though – as the article states, they require a specific voltage on the data pins to go to high speed charging. rykellim I have experienced this too. Especially here in Asia, where one can find a wide variety of USB cables (including the cutesy “tangle-free” flat ones) but I have always wondered if there be any CABLE standard specifications too? drghew5y5yherwhertw Using the official SGS3 Samsung charger & micro usb cable that came with my SGS3, I plugged a male to female USB cable that I had spliced so I could check current, voltage, etc of various usb devices. Anyway, I put my ammeter in series with the + power (red) line and I’m only seeing around 200-250maH on my meter! What is going on here? I’ve tried this with another meter (with the same result) so it doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with my ammeters. Also, my phone was at 37% battery last time I tried this. Here’s a picture of how I have it setup…charger on the left, usb cable going to phone on right, ammeter is attached to the alligator clips. http://www.salsunproductions.com/misc_uploads/sgs3_charg_slow_circ.JPG Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks! deusfaux Hi. Thanks for the article. 2 questions for you (or anyone else with the answers): 1. With most wall chargers having data shorted pins, why are so many CAR chargers WITHOUT data shorted pins? I don’t understand that. 2. To work around all these car chargers with open data pins, you need a shorted USB cable. I’ve seen guides on how to cut into the cable and short the wires, etc etc – but how, if at all, is this any different from simply covering or removing the pins at the host connector? ie, with paper / electrical tape / plucking out with tweezers? Tom Hayden Shorted means connected together. Removing them is exactly the same as leaving them ‘open’ and so achieves nothing… maykel I have a question about this. I have a droid device, Samsung S3 and I have the charger it came with, the charger I had previously for my older phone (Evo 4G) and a random usb charger that I am not sure where it came from but it is from Motorola. every time I charge my phone with its own usb cable it charges but the battery as soon as I unplug it goes from 100% to 99% in a second. Same using my evo usb cord charger however when I use the motorola it charges a bit longer and 100% stays on for a while and the battery seems to actually last much longer. I tested it by unplugging the phone at 100% with its own usb cord then it went to 99%, I immediately plugged in the motorola one and the phone started charging then it showed battery charging from 97% still an hour later and still charging the phone. But I know this time it is actually fully charging the phone. Any comments in terms of some usb chargers being better than others? if so how do I know which ones. OH something I forgot to mention, this is when I have changed the battery, it’s not the one the phone came with. rykellim +maykel I am interested to know the answer too… my Samsung Galaxy Note goes from 100% to 99% within 10 minutes after leaving any USB charger (whether wall or PC) and some USB cables take forever to charge it. Case in point – I have a 3-metre long USB cable which takes 8 hours to charge my Note yet it only ends up at 80% #battery maximum. http://www.mrseb.co.uk/ Sebastian Anthony If I had to guess, that’s probably a software issue. Or the battery not communicating with the phone properly. I doubt it has anything to do with the charger (USB chargers are very DUMB. All of the logic is in the phone, not the charger). Most likely, it was a cheap battery — or the phone hadn’t been programmed to ‘accept’ larger/non-standard battery sizes. havieman just to clear on one point as long as the usb charger i”m using has a 5volt output at 750m A it wouldn’t matter if it’s a blackberry charger i’m using for a samsumg galaxy s..right..and as long as the mini usb port matched right? http://www.mrseb.co.uk/ Sebastian Anthony Yep, should be fine. 750ma will be quite a low charger tho’. havieman just to clear on one point as long as the usb charger i”m using has a 5volt output at 750m A it wouldn’t matter if it’s a blackberry charger i’m using for a samsumg galaxy s..right..and as long as the mini usb port matched right? Jimmy Dear Sebastian. I have tried to charge my iphone 5 using a car charger, 2.1 A. This is the second time. Last night i did it and nothing happened. This morning, i tried it again,, and after a while it heats up. I am also using bluetooth at that time and turned my wifi on. The journey lasted around 45 minutes. Is this normal? Should i not charge it anymore using that 2.1 A output? And is it safe for the phone itself after this experience? http://www.mrseb.co.uk/ Sebastian Anthony That’s just a combination of the phone being charged AND the CPU/screen being used intensively. Phones are just like small computers after all — they produce less heat, but they still produce some! If you ever use GPS + 3G + your screen turned on (navigation, for example), you will probably notice your phone getting pretty warm. theboywhoasks I am trying to make a iphone charger out of a shake generator for my school science fair and i am wondering if i need to worry about my battery getting messed up. Thanks! heavenshitman1 I randomly found this article online and read it trying to find an answer to a problem. My HTC Sensation goes hay-wire on my gf’s wall charger (think it’s a generic charger). The phone will respond frantically to any input and will even randomly open apps and change phone settings on it’s own accord etc.. I didn’t see the cause of this particular issue reading this article, but if anyone has any ideas, love to hear it. Reply at peebow1000@hotmail.com Trupper Hi, I’m also looking for information regarding this issue. When I connect my Chinese Droid (W007 model) with a different wall charger the screen goes nuts and start to open apps and doing all kind of things on its own. I’m trying to find some information about what is the factor that produces this behavior, is it volts? mAh? Anyone? http://jesse.la/ Jesse Wilson, MCM, CPM, ACPM A ghost in the machine, most likely. Be nice to your phone… wouldn’t want to get on his bad side! http://jesse.la/ Jesse Wilson, MCM, CPM, ACPM A ghost in the machine, most likely. Be nice to your phone… wouldn’t want to get on his bad side! http://twitter.com/konaya Benjamin Tayehanpour Sounds like a bad charger. It probably generates enough ripple for the screen digitizer to go mad. You should stop using it, as it could easily damage your devices in the long run. http://twitter.com/ArabiTam Tam A. Is this arrangement of iPad-to-iPhone charging possible? (see link for photo) http://instagram.com/p/RGOv1MDsoP http://www.mrseb.co.uk/ Sebastian Anthony Humm. Possibly. Depends if the iPad is outfitted with the hardware/software to become a ‘USB host’. I would guess yes, it’s possible. 8lackie helpful article thank you http://www.facebook.com/people/Daniel-Watkins/629637578 Daniel Watkins So basically these devices that use lithium ion batteries and USB chargers, the chargers act as a hybrid between a constant voltage and constant current charger? If the charger is capable of supplying whatever current the battery could suck up at a specific voltage, then it would be a constant-voltage charging process. But, since I guess a lot of these devices charge faster with a charger rated for higher current, this leads me to believe that the voltage going into the device is actually less than 5V (kind of shorting out the charger in a sense), so most of the time it is a constant-current charging process until the battery starts to get charged up and resistance of the battery increases and the charger can then actually output 5V, then it is a constant-voltage process. Cool stuff. If an expert could elaborate on how these cheap lithium ion battery chargers work, including the cheap camera battery chargers on ebay where you stick the battery in the 2-pronged charger and over time the light changes from red to green, email me at danwat1234@aol.com http://www.facebook.com/people/Joseph-Perkins/100001836663921 Joseph Perkins Basically, look for chargers of decent price (in the US, these will be about $15 to $25) or a name brand (usually one and the same – IO Gear, Logitech, etc) http://www.facebook.com/people/Joseph-Perkins/100001836663921 Joseph Perkins Most laptops can power 2.5 inch drives off their ports (the MyPassport or HP drives, for instance). These are usually “USB 3.0” That’s simply because 2.5 Inch drives only need 5V while 3.5 Inch drives frequently need 12V for the motor and either 5V or 3.3V for the interface (PATA versus SATA power schemes). http://www.facebook.com/patrick.gallagher.7923 Patrick Gallagher Seems like my Apple USB wall plugs blow up after my brother connects his Android to them. I see by this article it is not possible. Just a coincidence? What is the most common culprit to blowing up my apple plugs? XtremeMorph According to one of the comment it will, the device is requesting the amp from the wall plug not the other way round. Genesis Amadeus my Lenovo Ideatab a2107 comes with a Huntkey 5volt 5amp charger. Diagram shows data pins shorted. jo Thanks for the article. Question: can I plug 6v-300ma mini-speakers to a 5v-150-2000ms usb wall plug for iPad? http://www.mrseb.co.uk/ Sebastian Anthony Probably yes. Though I’m not sure about the voltage mismatch. USB should always be 5V. cody bratcher Electrical Shock causing Death (is it the High Volts or the High Amps that do the Damage?)= The Amps are the Killer…. US A/C Home Voltage Standards= 120 volts Other Country’s (European) A/C Standards= 240 Volts European Standards are Far more better, efficient use etc. So this Simple Little Adapters make it more confusing saying that more then 5 volts cause so much damage while the amps are not really an issue and it decides for it’s self….. JonettaC Once I plugged my smartphone charge cable into the plug hub that came with my ipad. After charging overnight, my phone would show that it was fully charged, until I unplugged it from the charger. It would last as little as 30 minutes on the charge. I did this for about a week, and was getting ready to return the phone and/or battery thinking it was defective when I noticed I was plugged into the wrong charger. I’m not techy enough to understand why, but as soon as I changed my charging cable back to the plug in that came with it, all was well again…. http://www.facebook.com/people/Michael-Driver/100001568136916 Michael Driver That’s because it was an Apple product built to APPLE’S standards. In other words obsolete proprietary hardware standards that only Apple hangs onto, which is one of several reasons that Apple is soon going to be in the same place they were not so very long ago. A small, unregarded, niche market company that all but a few hardcore fanboys pretty much ignore. They’re already there with their computers. They only have 10% of the US computer market, and 5% of the global computer market. This is due to gross overpricing, overrated hardware, and their computers being nothing more than very expensive status symbols. They’re flooding the market with those expensive toys called iPad, just like they did with the iPod. Look where the iPod is now. Dying. IPhone is crap compared to Samsung’s offerings. Apple is simply resting on the name Apple. So, in conclusion, it really doesn’t matter if they don’t comply with the USB standard, they’ll soon be of no concern. Theo Jaklitsch I got a cheap (maybe knock-off) apple AC-Usb adapter. Used it with my Nexus S and while charging, the display would become unusable thinking I had touched the top left of the screen when I had really touched bottom right, etc. Eventually I found my 3G antenna having trouble connecting to the network even off-charger, I am pretty sure that it was the adapter that did this but I haven’t the equipment to check. TL;DR : Used cheap apple adapter with my Nexus S, ended up with damaged antenna. david After reading these comments about mini usb i suddenly realised what a mob of brain dead lazy loosers people are becoming.

Thank you very much. Talichuba Walling Hey, I would like to post a comment down here related to USB. Recently, I had an iPhone problem. When I was browsing the internet in my iPhone 3GS, with my phone connected(charging) to my laptop via USB. Suddenly, my phone just went blank(dead). It won’t start…I had tried almost everything(though info from the net)…but I was unable to get it working. So, I took it to the repair shop…his diagnosis was that it was due to over charging via USB(it seems the charge from the PC’s USB is inconsistent), it is still in the repair shop…the problem later on was the dock connector was damaged, and the battery damaged(actually the battery was a new one). Anyway, all I want to ask is, is there a risk in charging from the PC’s USB overtime(to long/frequently)? Please explain, what is the better option for my phone…wall socket/usb? Anticipating your reply. Thank you. nizamsp I had a nexus 4 and i charged it with my friend’s samsung music player’s charger which is also a micro usb charger. When i woke up in the morning, I felt a burnt smell and it came from nexus 4 :( :(. I am heavily disappointed. Will it cover under warranty? According to your post,, it should not affect the phone hardware right? iTech Mark Good evening, I very much appreciate this article. We are working on a project for a New Porsche dealership and we are playing with the idea of installing custom charging stations into the furniture for clients visiting the the store and waiting for service to be completed on their car. I am having a tough time locating a company that can sell me quality hardware to install this into custom made furniture? Any help or direction would be great! Mo Khera Excellent and very informative article – and most of the commenters seem to have the right attitude too Hafeez Luqman My Gigabyte motherboard has “3x USB Power” feature and its charging my phone very fast. Thanks for this article. Hafeez Luqman I observed that cables also matter in charging phones quickly. Some cables don’t charge a phone quickly. http://www.facebook.com/nilcouac Happy Neil Many thanks for this article, this is very helpful and explains why old device are not compatible with new usb wall chargers. Antonio Mastrolia I noticed that on some laptops, usb-charged hard drives fail to start if the laptop is on battery. As soon as you plug in the charger, it seems that the drive has enough amperage and powers up. Why is that? I Spawn At Home Nice article. I read it because I’m trying to get some documentation regarding making my own solar energy panel and connecting it to my phone for charging :). Got any tips? xD But yea, nice article nonetheless Ken This is exactly why you MUST use the USB Y Cable provided with the Fujicell 500F electronic battery charger and external power source. It will charge not only AA & AAA batteries but also run and extend talk and operating time for up to 11,200 mah of storage power for I-Phone 4 / I-Pods, Androids, Tablets, Readers and many more devices – but you have to use the cable that comes with it + plus an applicable micro USB adapter. It has universal voltage adpater and so you can use it workdwide 100v in Japan to 240 volts in the UK or Australia. Some have tried to use Apple connectors instead of rthe supplied cable. The Apple resistors in their connector cables are made deliberately different so that you may think you have to buy more expensive Apple chargers and accessories – but you dont. At $18.98 on eBay and I think Amazon too, this U/L listed charger is a steal and a must have if you are on the road and not near a power oint or in the middle of blackouts or power cuts. http://www.bestbodyshaver.com/usb-mains-battery-charger-aa-aaa-external-battery-backup/ disqus_sNTM3J4hHC hi and thanks for the great info. you mentioned that the age of phone/phone charging may be affected with high amp charging. I am wanting to buy a wall charger that has max 4000mah output for my tablet. would that significantly affect a tablet over say 5 years period? what is your recommended charging output amp for a charger for a tablet. thanks! invention13 I have the exact opposite issue with my samsung smartphone: it charges fine when it is hooked up to the usb port on a real computer, but won’t charge with either a car charger or the wall charger that came with the smartphone. Any ideas? I am puzzled. http://www.nicodetourn.com/ Nico Detourn I did a search for: usb ac adapter charger voltage determining. This article was at the top of the results and was just what I was looking for to make sure I could both charge and power my Sony ICD-SX712 voice recorder using the AC adapter that came with my HTC Incredible without blowing it up. Yay! Thank you. dvlk Please confirm: I can charge mobile phone that came with 0,7A charger using 2,0A charger and this will not harm either the phone, battery or the charger and it will not shorten the life cycle of battery (that means that my battery will not die sooner, it will last for lets say 2 years as it would if I would be charging it with the original charger). Is the above stated correct? And following this: I it also ok to charge mobile phone that came with 2,0A charger using 0,7A charget and this will not harm either the phone, the battery and its life cycle nor the charger? Thank you for you answer. mrsoltys What about the opposite: Charging with an under-powered charger (e.g., charging an iPad with a 500 mA charger, or a smartphone with a 700 mA charger). I understand this means slower battery charge times, but is this good for the lithium battery’s life-span? or does it not really matter? The the amprage is too low, will it damage the battery? Luke O’Malley I have a ‘wire’ to connect my ‘cigarette lighter’ to a min USB plug. It is used for my TOomTom. Will it be safe to use on my smartphone? SanthoshThomas Thank you . I got a dual usb car lighter adapter with 2 ports. 1st with 1amp & 2nd with 2.1amp. So this should be safe to use with 1amp GPS & 1.5amp camera? Thank you Joan I actually did blow up a Samsung phone about 5 years ago by trying to charge it with a car charger that I later found out was meant for a usb powered self-heating car mug. The phone popped loudly, send out sparks and stank of burned circuitry. I was pissed that my boyfriend had told me to charge my phone with this charger. I don’t know what the amperage wad but if it was meant for a heating device then it was no doubt putting out enough juice to fry the insides of my phone. Bill Amperage doesn’t matter. It can’t force current through the device. It probably had a non-standard voltage or pinout. babu Further, if you want to calculate how long it will take for your charger, the equation is mah/amps*.06 = minutes to charge. For a 4500mah battery with 2 amp charger., 4500/2 * .06 = 135 minutes to charge. gregdoryt The reason standard data usb ports are also used (insread of making all usb ports charging-capable) is noise. The power level at the port introduces noise. Circuits have to be specifically engineered to compensate for the RF noise of nearby power (literally only a few milimeters between the outer and inner pins). Also, power has to be routed to that port differently inside the computer so as not to affect nearby circuits. Smart charging ports also have internal switches to make data transfer more noise-free when the connected device is fully charged. This is why on some tablets the touch screen acts erratically when the usb is plugged into cheap and noisy chargers. If you look at a motherboard that feeds both usb data and charge-capable usb ports there is a visible difference in the adjacent electronics and circuitry. This is also why really cheap laptops rarely have charge-capable usb ports. The noise introduced affects the transfer rate, though the file integrity is typically handled by the software. Part of the reason 3.0 is so much faster is the use of more pins, and you will notice the data pins, specifically the + pins are further away from the ground and power. Plus 3.0 ports are better designed for noise inherently. Jill Shilvock Not really connected to your interesting piece, but relevant I feel, why is the design of the mini usb charger crap? I have one where the lead is not attached to the plug and unless I sit and hold it in place it doesn’t make proper contact. Many times Ive left it charger only to return to find my phone and andriod tablet dead. It is driving me mad. mabel leong There is a phenomena where phone lithium ion battery charged with usb 2.0 cable causes overcharging which cause chemical damage to the structure of the lithium battery. Can this be prevented by monitoring the charging process? or is the structure will be damaged whenever it is charged with a significantly higher voltage due to the heating effect of the charging process? Had a Li ion battery swelled up after a few months of charging with a usb cable connected to laptop. T_T Ed Burton I have a wireless mouse that uses a micro-USB charger. I left the cable at work but I have my Android phone charger sitting here also with a micro-USB. Feeling adventurous I plugged it in and sure enough the charging LEDs light up! All well and good. However, I do remember only rechargeable batteries used to have large warning everywhere about only using the charger supplied. Is there any danger charging a device supplied with a USB cable charger from a wall mounted phone charger? The wall charger outputs 5V and 0.7A so I suspect everything is fine. Vladski Not sure of the where and whys – but whilst you say you can’t blow up a device – I on 2 separate occasions ( ie 2 phones) a few years back managed to ‘fry’ my US Motorola Atrix whilst trying to charge them in the UK – both times had to go an buy a new phone for the rest of my trip. shonangreg I’ve had a couple of phones that will not charge from one of the wall wart USB power devices. Sometimes they cycle through on/off settings, and more usually, they ask me to choose what type of data connection I want. So, the phone thinks the charger is a computer, and it will not charge. Other devices charge from the same connector. I’d like to know what type of device is needed to guarantee a charge-only connection. James Kenny Twice I have plugged in a USB cable connected to a pc, to my Chinese phones, and both times the phone will not then recognise USB as a device and will only charge when powered off. dbiss What’s going on when some smartphones display that the connected charger is not recommended? What aspect of the charger would the phone be complaining about and would it be bad for the phone or just maybe slow down the charging process? Taha Benashur Is it a good idea to plug a usb hub in a 1amp 5volt usb port and plug 3 devices in the usb hub to charge in the same time ?? Rick Jenkins Awesome explanation. This answered quite a few questions I had. Thank you! deipak tanwarr When i am charging my android phone through USB charger on a PC running on Windows, what is the possibility of my phone getting infected with a virus (assuming the PC is infected)? Ethan Jarlewski Your comment about “downstream blah blah ports ‘should be labeled’ ” is pure BS. They are NEVER labeled! I’ve been in the industry 30 years and NEVER have seen such labels. I want to smoke whatever you’ve been smoking. Unless you may have seen some such labeling on Macs – but, from my experience, there’s never been any ports labeled “downstream” anything – and I do see that you’ve given an update (albeit in an Appendix) to signify that fact. http://www.ilogic.gr/blog NLS (NULUSIOS) Been in the industry 30 years too (actually EXACTLY 30 years this year) and indeed have not seen most (like 99.99% of motherboards/laptops label the USB ports. I HAVE seen motherboard AND laptops though (rare but do exist) that label some ports as sleep and charge or “usb charging” ports. I distinctly remember at least one motherboard (and the mode was even selectable by a jumper) have that. I post for another reason though. You need to cut down on sugar a bit. Sharon Jarrett I have a Samsung galaxy s3 phone (²yrs old). I have a 1A/5v USB wall charger that I used a 3-4 ft cord with. I bought a 10′ cord and found that is t seemed as if it wasn’t charging. My question is if I increase the wall charger to 2a will it work for the 10′ cord? What do you suggest I use? Does the length of the cord effect how fast a device will charge using aclwer amperage? disqus_3BrONUAJno Given Ohm’s Law, how is it possible for any device to draw more current at the same 5 volt supply? This handshaking seems a bit anal, given that it would be easier to install a limit on the supply than on the draw. All of this gives dumb dongles more credit than they are due, because they are smarter and more generous than a smart USB connection. http://www.cardinalphoto.com David Cardinal Lower impedance is one way to increase the current. AFAIK, the current is limited by the host (for its own protection if nothing else). I assume the handshake is an additional capability on top of that. Maybe a HW designer can chip in with why both are needed? disqus_3BrONUAJno Of course, a lower impedance (or resistance) in the load would necessarily draw more current. IMHO, it is silly to worry about how much current the host device can provide when the maximum under USB1, 2, or 3 is 5 amperes, a minuscule 25 watts. Things might get more dodgy when USB 3.1 pushes the supply voltage to 12 or 20 volts, but then, 3.1 is a new standard which few USBs currently comply with. GUILLEM GLORIA PEDRO MANUEL I see a lot of physics missconceptions in this forum. If you can understand physics, you can understand how charging works… So kids, it all boils down to the laws of electric charge: 1) The forces in nature will tend to neutralize each other to reach an equilibrium. 2) Electrons will flow trough the path offering the less resistance. This are the reasons why both lightning bolts and your cellphone actually works… Your cellphone battery is rated for 3.7Volts and the USB port standard is 5 Volts.. this is what makes the electrons flow from the charger to the battery. Since there is a 1.3 volt (potential difference) between the two parts, electrons simply go to where they should fill the gap. Now that you understand why electrons MOVE from one side to the other, just count HOW MANY electrons are moving.. this is given by the AMPS and will mainly determine at what rate will your battery recharges. You can charge an ipad´s battery in 1 month with a 20mA source… or you can charge it in 4 hours with the 2100mA source… it doesn´t really matters, as long as the voltage of the source is slightly higher than the battery, in order to to keep the electrons flowing towards the battery. Offcourse… materials suffer and will take damage if they are exposed to more power than they were designed to. This is the reason why your ipad can take up to 2100mA and not 20A (thou it would be cool to see it charged in 9 minutes)… AS “Your cellphone battery is rated for 3.7Volts and the USB port standard is 5 Volts.. this is what makes the electrons flow from the charger to the battery” This statement is completely wrong. LiPo cells are a nominal 3.7volts, but can reach as high as 4.2volts. The charge circuit is part of the phone, not the thing that you plug into the wall. The 1.3 volt difference between USB and LiPo is nothing to do with how the battery charges. Julius Thank you for this article. It’s a big help for those wondering why.. I would like to suggest to buy a good USB Charger for your phone. It’s available in amazon store.

Choe Technology CHOE Qi Wireless Charger Kit for Galaxy S4 only on $35.00 for more info. take a look on Amazon ChoeTech Store – http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DRB2ENK Barblocks Is it ok to charge my new (well almost new) kindle Fire with my Samsung Galaxy Y phone charger? David Cheang Can anyone help advise on this please? I plan to do a 2week trek and will need to charge my camera batteries on the go.

Anyone see potential problems arising? Don’t fancy this exploding in my back pack if it is a risk. Mark Wheaton Rheault I just plugged my iphone 5s charger in over night at a resort – heard a loud pop in the middle of my sleep – smelt burning. Looked everywhere but could not see it so I thought maybe it was a neighbor in the connecting unit – nope. It was my brand new iphone 5s charger completely covered in black. Burnt. Edgar Suazo u probly pluged it into the rong wall socket they have 220 volt wall sockets that burn anythin u plug into them .those sockets are reseved for certian things AS Power supplies are rated AC 100-250v 50-60hz, so its unlikely. Luka Krnjaic YEAH but if i put mobilephone like ALCATEL into the computer for charging , does battery or mobile expload allisonfranz1024 Could you do a tear down of the more advanced usb car chargers, it would be interesting on how these are made and work http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/electronics/7965829011/ref=sr_bs_1 Ian Fischer I have heard that charging with a higher than spec charger shortens the life of your battery and by extension the life of your device because you are over powering it. Is this true? matt The story goes, the iPad requires extra current to charge when the screen is on vs off and That Steve jobs had all the MacBooks changed to detect an iPhone / iPad and automatically dump extra current to it. As far as I know every Mac since the iPad 1 does this. There is no way to disable this feature, that i know of. You can see this feature by going into about this Mac, system report and clicking on USB On a standard device it will say Current available 500ma Mininuum current required 500ma When you connect an iPhone it will say Extra current 500 ma When you connect an iPad it will say Extra current 1600ma Ross Banick It’s technically correct to say the wall warts can “output” 2.1Amps, but, for the layperson, it should be noted that these non-standard devices won’t actually source that amount of current unless the device being charged “needs” it. The article should explain to the layperson that having too more “current output” capability than you need isn’t the same as having too much “voltage output”, than you want. Most, if not all charged devices, will have their own current limiters (if for no other reason as to not unduly heat up the batteries), so, in practice, what you want is the highest current output rating (usually in watts, which is the voltage times the current) you can get. Just be careful, manufacturers are sneaky when listing output capabilities. If it doesn’t specifically say that the wattage is for each port simultaneously, then you must assume that the wattage is divided by each port. Hope this makes sense. Addison Dorrance So like it says “5 volts” if iI charge it w/ 6 volts worth of aa batteries/6 volt Solar panel will that 1 volt make a difference? http://socialentrepreneurship.change.org/actions/view/twenty-first_century_metric_america_in_your_state BeholdersEye I would like to know how to charge and plugin a keyboard/mouse/trackball on the same port. They only give you one USB port on phones or tablets. And you can not say it can not be done, cause if you connect your phone/tablet to a desktop computer, it will charge and you can transfer data between the two at the same time…so why not a trackball if you add power to it, like a powered hub….. athreya what id you connect a Multi USB hub to one port and charge more than 2 devices technically from the same USB port? athreya i had dposted a comment earlier i wonder where that goes? Bruce Ratcliffe GREAT details! I have a slightly different concern: I’m building Pb-acid battery-powered cell phone chargers for my students. These batteries output 6 (not 5) volts. Will 6 V damage a cell phone that is supposed to charge at 5 VDC? Thanks for any insight, Bruce Ratcliffe, Fresno Kary One thing not mentioned in the article is that not all USB cables are up to the task of providing a current over 1 amp. This was something I learned when the higher current car chargers started appearing. I don’t remember the gauge of wire required for higher current USB, but not all USB cables have the heavier gauge cable for the two power lines. William Hi, thanks for this great article but I have some doubts. Since you mention USB 2.0 max current is around 500mA. So, even if we are using 1A or 2A charger, it is still charging at 500mA? The charging current is still 500mA, not 1A and not 2A. How can the charging be faster? Hope to get some answer to this question. Thanks. Your mother Suck it Phobos Good question, I guess if the device needs a charger of 500mA and you use 1A or 2A charger, it will only use 500mA out that 1 or 2A charger. I do wonder if the voltage of say 1A or 2A charger is higher of that 500mA could damage the device. Eureka Gomez I just recently bought my usb 2 data cable for my apple devices from http://bit.ly/storeapple . Do you think it is still good or I should stop using it or it still depends on the adapter I am going to use? I use the original adapter though. Please help me. Thanks. sotiredofcrap Thank you for the explanation! Do you know if a cable like SONICable will work? It has a button to switch on and off the data lines. In a way switch between being a cable for a standard/charging downstream port, and a cable for a dedicated charging port. But will the computer really sense the difference, i.e. if no signal provide 1500 mA instead of 500 mA from the USB port to the mobile phone? Sounds doubtful to me… luismg the different voltage will blow your phone, the Amp number won’t do anything. shubham jain well explained sir…….but my only question is…..how much (maximum amperes) charger, a standard smartphone can support ??? Barbara Fuentes Interesting and useful. I have a TicToc music player that’s only ever charged on computers, never wall chargers. Suddenly since the Lollipop 5.0.2 (Android for Nexus 7) update, my tablet is nearly as finicky. Reading this article helps me understand this. I wonder if my laptop will charge it while turned off?

Have a look! – http://goo.gl/lszAU0 Nick Papageorgio My fried phone would disagree. Plugged a new LG Ultimate 2 (came with 500mA charger) into a USB Car Charger (2100mA) and it fried the phone in just a few minutes. thomas kim It should be noted that the smartphone has an internal charging chip that will only allow, in most cases, 1 amp; so a 2.1 amp tablet charger will not charge it any faster. This is to avoid problems like over charging and burning out the battery and the charging chip. Now a .5 amp usb outlet will charge a 1 amp smartphone at half the speed but a 2.1 amp outlet will not charge the smartphone any faster because of the internal limitor. This has been tested many times. A tablet is meant to take the 2.1 amps so it will use the full 2.1 amps and nothing more though. Be careful with voltage, most devices can take a good amount of deviance in voltage but if you send the full 110 volt of a house plug, your phone is dead and there really is no save from that. Dilliwala Please address my doubt related to this article: What if the series charging-path circuitry inside the phone is rated at the rated charging current of the device’s manufacturer-supplied charger? Say, I have a smartphone that came along with a 500mA charger. I try to charge it with a 2,100mA car charger. Now, since my smartphone was packed with a 500mA charger and its user guide carries an advise warning “against usage of chargers other than that supplied with the pack”, will it not be unsafe to use the 2,100mA to charge my smartphone? My reasoning is that the smartphone would be fitted with certain electrical/ electronic components in the charging path that are rated at 500mA and a 2,100mA charging current will therefore destroy them. A battery of course is like a current source and a current sink where you can pump as much current into and draw as much current from as you wish, until of course its terminal voltage plunges down due to internal resistance drop or it stops performing due to excess ionization at its terminals. So naturally the limitation and repercussions, if any, of charging above specified current will lie not with the battery, but with the series circuitry in the charging path between the charger and the battery. I assume that all such circuitry should be there inside the battery charger itself and not inside the smartphone. Inside the smartphone, there must only be the battery terminals ready to connect to the charger. In such a case, charging a smartphone supplied with a 500mA charger using a 2,100mA charger won’t damage the phone. But is that always the case? I mean, can I be sure that my device will not have any series (charging-path) circuitry between the charger and battery terminals? thomas kim Amperage from a wall for example a 20 amp wall socket, is the max it can put out. It isnt necessarily indicative of how much is actually going into the appliance. Its just the max that can be drawn constantly without breaking the breaker. This also applies to a charging block except that there is no breaker and thats just the max amount of power that it supplies. In the same way a microwave only takes 10 amps for example, an iphones charging chip only draws 1 amp. Charging it with less amperage is still let through cause there is no risk of damge however with more amperage, it gets really dangerous with lithium ion batteries because they tend to explode in certain conditions so the charging chip doesnt ever draw more than 1 amp. The internal charging chip is fine regardless of amperage because it chooses how much to draw, the only problem is too high voltage where the amperage is forced into the charging chip and then into the phones delicate electronics (i believe so, im not an electrical engineer). The thing about batteries is that the battery itself has no way to regulate amperage like a piece of wire and thus it will draw as much as it can get and because of the internal resistance it will heat up and melt down. The power block is nothing more than a transformer that limits the amperage going out. thomas kim So to clarify, a 2 amp block only supplies 1 amp to a iphones charging chip because that is all that is requested. However a .5 amp block sends only .5 amps cause thats all it can provide. Dilliwala Thanks for the nice explanation! So do you mean that smartphones and other digital devices like camera, etc. carry built-in ICs that regulate charging current? I know that this voltage and current regulating circuitry is present in the battery charger adapter (wall charger/ car charger/ whatever). But is such a circuitry also designed inside a device (like smartphone)? ronch USB 3.0 isn’t the most popular, USB 2.0 is. Although many computers today come with USB 3.0, USB 2.0 has been shipping for a while now and there are many more of them out there, and they continue to be included in most motherboards. Heck, many smart phones today still use USB 2.0. Severnia you forgot “Adaptive Fast Charge” and “Rapid Charge” which can negotiate higher voltages (usually 9VDC) to deliver more power (Watts) while still not melting your cord or plugs with too high of current (Amps). the new USB 3.1 connector and spec can handle up to 100W comprised of 2x 2.5Amp “rails” operating at 20V. these require active communication between the host and device though. Daniel Wisehart If you want to measure how much current your USB device uses, the PortPilot is a great way to go: http://portpilot.net/portpilot-pro/ I bought one and have been very happy with it. bmwman91 I am not sure if there is any phone from the last 15 years that does not have a PMIC controlling the current through the charging subsystem. Almost all of them need to step the 5V input down to something lower for the battery, and I cannot imagine any of them employ linear regulators to do it. They all have to be using Buck converters. Most switching regulator ICs can sense current across the output inductor, and since it is a closed loop control system it can limit current. So no matter what the current output capability of the wall charger or USB port is, the phone itself will be limiting the input current to whatever the manufacturer deemed appropriate. Paul Mayson what phone is used as the title’s picture. its like an android with iphone 6 build. someone tell me fast, please and thank you Paul Mayson nvm i found it, its the galaxy s6 bwcbwc The key thing on these current and power ratings is that excluding the “power delivery” standard all USB power connections are at 5v and the power/amperage ratings of the power sources are the maximum they can provide at that voltage. So you can’t blow up your device by hooking it up to a supply that can provide more current than you need. But if you hook up a device that requires a lot of current to a power source that can’t provide it you can break the power source. But the most likely scenario is that your device simply won’t run. Kwuarter I love how I thought that was an iPhone 6. Silly Samsung tricks are for.. Never mind. Steve G Great article covering most the bases. I like my Galaxy s5 USB 3.0 port though. It provides a USB 3.0 data connection to my PC, and I can charge it with a micro USB 2.0, or 3.0 cable. Piotr Kachala …as there is no gunpowder – it will never blow up… so kids, don’t worry about that.

ELLAS Today’s Smartphone batteries are intelligent. You can pretty much use any wall USB charger regardless of mA because the battery will dictate how much it can handle at a given time.

I have a question/need some help! I recently purchased an RCA Pro 10 Edition Tablet RCT6203W46. I am looking for an additional wall charger to use in other rooms of my home, etc. I have searched the internet trying to find something compatible and find it a little overwhelming! Can anyone suggest what charger to purchase that would be both compatible & safe to use with this tablet? Thank you! Pete Palm If you have a lot of different devices and aren’t sure what they need this Smart USB Charger comes in really handy. It autodetects the fastest charging settings. Thumper Here’s a question. I have 2 Samsung devices, a Galaxy Note 3 smart phone and the other is a Galaxy Tab 4 Tablet. Using the Samsung 2.0 amp charger and a Y-Cable, can both devices charge simultaneously without damage to either? The Note 3 has a 3300mAH and the Tab has a 4000mAH battery. OriGuy Panasonic used an “non-standard” USB port on its Lumix camera. I think some other camera makers did too. I think it’s called a UC-E6 cable. The camera end looks like this: 0====0 (more or less.) Any idea why? SSXV perhaps slightly misleading, as in some tech can be damaged by using the wrong charging equipment.

I want to use my USB cable to charge my Jabra Stone3 via my double port car charger. The car charger power output is 5V/2.4A. Is the car charger too powerful, and will it fry the Stone3? GuccizBud So then those USB dongle things with a standard male port that goes in the computer on one side and a standard female port on the other side that you plug your mobile device’s charging cable into, and that have a button of some kind on them that allows you to switch between DATA or CHARGING (and that really work incidentally… at least mine does) are basically just “current switchers” (my words)? Higher current for charging, lower for data, both at the same (likely 5V) voltage? What exactly is it that “tells” the computer you want DATA (at which point you can view your mobile device’s folders on your monitor like any drive) or you want CHARGING (at which point the mobile device’s folders are no longer accessible on the computer, but you hear the little charging “ding” sound on your phone, indicating it has indeed resumed charging)? http://szsunda.com/ Lily Lee best 3.1a usb wall charger adapter in our factory http://szsunda.com/home-charger/2.1a-best-usb-wall-charger.html http://szsunda.com/ Lily Lee us eu uk plug wall charger http://www.szsunda.com Anothercoilgun Blow up?

ThinkJim In terms of watts or amps charges don’t “output” anything. The charge is capable of providing up to the rated watts or amps, it’s your devices that determines how much power it wants. It’s like having a glass water, you speed at which you want to drink the water. Dilliwala True, but the chargers themselves limit their output current. They have series devices in the charging path that carry current rating and any current exceeding that can burn those devices. It is like saying that you are dehydrated and your body will therefore accept any volume of water a second, but your throat limits the volume you actually gulp per second. Your dehydrated body is analogous to a discharged battery and your throat’s gulping capacity is analogous to the charger’s current limiting circuitry. The glass is analogous to power supply (mains) and your mouth which fills in water is like the battery charger. ThinkJim Don’t confuse output with draw. Chargers are capable of providing an output, but it’s the devices that draw the current. In your dehydration example your body can only take in a certain amount of water (capacity), your mouth is the draw, the size of the glass is the simply the maximum power available. You determine the speed at which you drink and you control the amount of water that goes in your mouth, the glass is capable of outputting a maximum, but it doesn’t control the flow beyond that.

Seriously, extremetech editor, just go waterboard yourself. http://www.frozenprakash.com Chandraprakash I have just one question about USB Type C port. Presently USB C is spreading like wildfire, i hope in near future, we will all have standard USB C port for high power charging (upto 100W – USB 3.1) as well as Data (upto 10 Gbps). My question is simple, Why can’t we replace the below list to standard USB C ?? ♦ HDD/SSD = Currently powered by 5V port and then data exchanged by Sata port, Why not we could use single USB C to provide Power as well as data to them, would be simple too ?? ♦ TV/Monitors = Currently uses HDMI, mini-HDMI ports to exchange data, Why not use the standard USB C instead of HDMI as the data speed is almost identical ??

Is it bad news to deviate much or will the receiving device cope with that? Any suggestions as to how to easily/cheaply regulate 6 volt down to 5volt? Brandon Hutchison (NZ) geniusthemaster WRONG your device will blow up(on a small scale) in less than a month depending on how much you overdraw the capicitors and the resistors, heat itself is in fact a sign that your device isnt operating perfectly. if the recieving circuitry of your phone is designed with .5ampere wires, a .05 uF(pico-Farad [.01 ohms]) then your device WILL FRY neer exactly 1 month using electroltic capacitors and silver rated(%5 percent error acceptance) if your pumping in 1 amp == 5 watt == 2 volt power supply from your ‘crapple’ charger if u had nasa grade equipment with cyramic capacitors and zener diodes, you could go for 10 years liek that and , probably another 5 years on top and still not givea dam. so if u have a perfect guage wire {1 milimeter per ohm} such as usb wire if your using electrolitic capacitors {what everyone uses currently} at 5 farad [1 ohm] and your resisters are gold tolerance rated (10% error acceptance)[to handle the initial charge and disconnect] then your device would life forever. ps your battery would thank you also John O’Donnell I HAVE A TREAD MILL WITH AN IPHONE 4 CHARGER.

THIS is the answer I have been looking for all night! My oldest device is a Galaxy S2 so I do not worry about the rest. THANK YOU Sebastian Anthony! “In short, no: You can plug any USB device into any USB cable and into any USB port, and nothing will blow up — and in fact, using a more powerful charger should speed up battery charging.” Bluetooth It´s missing from the article that charging with a more powerful charger can heat the battery while charging. Hot lithium batteries deteriorate faster and this can affect the lifetime of the batteries. ncgh A properly designed product has a current regulator on the device, so no that isn’t normally a problem. hex4def6 Fast charging will cause batteries to age faster. It’s a tradeoff. Pablo Alfaro Is this really so in all cases? I’m a total ignorant here but I would like to know. Thre’s no reason to fast charge overnight if you just can leave your phone on the PC and wake up the other day with it fully charged. Abu Nudnik Yes, mine has a little circuit breaker, or so I assume. Otherwise, why a reset button? Gradie Meekins Jr. You got that right! Carl It’s a matter of how much does the battery gets hot . Wireless charging was introduce when larger batteries come out . The larger the battery the lesser it will get hot in charging . Measure it’s temperature (with an app) with fast charging and without . lj0000 missing is also the quick charge, vooc… Jim Pennington Missing was info about various manufacturer’s “turbo” charging. This is where the USB charging standard still seems to be fragmented. I don’t even know if most turbo/quick charging implementations conform to USB specs since, for example, my Motorola turbo-charger doesn’t just deliver 5V. It also bumps up to 9V and 12V as needed. Shachar Petrushka Missing info on the new USB C and compatible/non compatible cables (and can you really distinguish between them?) VN Love the dash charge in the Oneplus 3, it charges your phone in just a few minutes. Hope more manufacturers get into that standard. doge As good as it sounds, USB-C port would wear out as quick as micro-USB thanks to daily charging. Smartphone manufacturers loves these USB ports so that users keep replacing their gadgets every year. SuicSoft Why would it wear out ? doge Those fragile tiny copper pins will no longer flexible thus gives contact issue after some use. Have you ever frustrated when you found out your phone are not charged at all while you asleep? I prefer old school coaxial power connector than micro-USB. Too bad manufacturer no longer use it. sbcontt Coaxial can also get loose. Nokia’s 0.5mm port (the one used in second and third generation of N series and E series) was a nightmare, and I had a pin breakage as well. Current micro USB is the best charging port in my opinion. Kary What in the world are you doing with your USB ports? I keep phones longer than most people and have yet to have a USB port go bad. ncgh That’s why I got a phone with wireless charging. Not for the gimmick, but so that my socket will last. 1000 Yes, worn sockets are a major issue in this day and age, for sure. maverick909 I’ve never heard of ports wearing out but I should join the Cable-Of-The-Month Club. I guess you get what you pay for when it comes to USB cables. I replaced my cheapo Chinese knock-off Lightning cables with a Fuse Chicken Armour cable. It definitely charges faster but time will tell if it holds up longer than the cheapies. Zergling missing is also… Lorfa MissingNo. Dennis R Smeltzer I like fuzzy set theory as much as the next guy, but “older” is not helpful here. Just give an approximate date or age. Are you talking two years as older, or 5 years? You use 10 years and make it sound ancient instead of just old. So just use some numbers. You know, most people in STEM fields are not mathphobic. If you are writing in this filed you really need to get a little more comfortable with numbers. Iva Haddit The Ugly: the problem isn’t so much with the USB power rating, it is that the poor female host connector designs wear out after hundreds or thousands of insertions for charging. A “device” has to be trashed, or repaired (aka $$$$) because of these frail female connectors. Try opening your tablet and replacing the charging USB port connector. Good luck. The old tubular, round charger ports had better and longer lasting connector technology. They were designed for power. The USB connectors were designed for data first, power second and were not intended to be the de facto charging standard. Google failed USB charging connector and read all the complaints. Mikado Cat On the PC/laptop side I buy short USB extension cables and only plug and unplug devices from the extension, not the main board. Device side all I can suggest is to be careful, insert straight and with the correct orientation, never force the plug or put side pressure on it. Replace any wonky cables. RH The biggest thing that is suppose to keep the cells inside the battery from going thermonuclear, are the thermal fuse cutoffs. Every battery pack is suppose to have them. What they are suppose to do, is in the event the charging circuit inside the device does not detect the battery has reached it’s thermal peak, it starts to heat up. Once the cells reach the temperature range of the fuse, the fuse melts, breaking the electrical connection between the battery, and the charging circuit. That is suppose to prevent the cells in the battery from overheating, expanding, then exploding. That’s why I never use “knock off” batteries, or more important, I NEVER charge a battery and leave it unintended or overnight to charge. The fuses inside batteries are TINY, and can fail, as with ANY electrical or electronic component. Been involved with electronics for over 40 years, and I’m a STAUNCH believer in Murphy’s law! I’d rather play it safe, especially with LiOn batteries. WTF I tend to agree as I don’t leave batteries charging unattended either. The problem with Li-On batteries is they have a lot of capacity for size compared with carbon zinc batteries and if a short developes, they catch fire. Gradie Meekins Jr. I’m not that IT savvy but, I purchased the first Samsung Galaxy Prevail in 2011. And I was given the wrong charged by a Boost Mobile employee. Samsung devices call for a 3.7 volt output charger. The employee gave me a charger that was 4.5 volt output. It fried my phone in less than a week. The store went out of business and I had no recourse. But, I learned a $149.00 lesson: Get to know your devices and the correct accessories for them. As the saying goes: A bought lesson is better than a taught lesson. PersonOnDuty ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Not sure if it’s still relevant, but electricity is pulled, not pushed. Example: Car sub-woofers are rated for how many watts they can “use”. A 1000W sub will pull all 1000W from a 1000W amp. So the amp will be working at 100% when it’s at “full volume”. This causes distortion, which is what destroys speakers. If you put a 1500W amp with a 1000W sub, then the amp is only working at 66% when at full volume, never pushing itself to the limits. No distortion, no blown speakers. For phones, unless the tech has specifically changed with “rapid charging” (and other newer tech like wireless charging), the phone should “pull” the most amount of power it “requires”. As long as the charger will allow the higher rate, it will continuously charge at that rate. Once it’s charged, it should shut off or trickle. Clearly, this also depends on the battery. From when I was a cell phone tech, Li-ion batteries were meant to be “topped off”. Not sure about Li-poly, but they are a newer technology. Ni-cd was the old “memory” batteries that needed to be drained once in a while. Regardless of all the tech, we’re throwing away our 1.5 yr old tech for the new stuff anyway (on average), so does it even matter? Salvador Duchamp If I’m not mistaken…1000w = 2/3 of 1500w or 66 2/3 % [not the article’s cited suggested 75% of same, yes?] PersonOnDuty ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes, thank you.. I must have been tired when I wrote that. Your math is correct. I have changed my “75%” to 66% to reflect the correct amount. Abhi Neeth Anyone knows about Optimal cooling case? They claim to solve our heating issues on phones. http://www.bestgadgetsunder.com/best-tablet-under-10000/ Leonard Nguyen Schøyen It’s clear this dude doesn’t know much about the USB cables. In the first paragraph alone he references these USB connectors and standards by these names: – USB type-C by “USB-C” – USB 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 3.1 Type-A by “USB” – USB 3.1 micro-B by “USB micro-B” – USB 2.0 micro-B by “micro USB” The first one is okay since there is only one USB type-C connector. The second one, however, is worse since all these connectors are USB even the USB type C he is comparing it to. The third and fourth is even worse. He wrote that one of them is very good, and the other is really bad in two consecutive sentences without much to distinguish between them – Not mentioning which USB standard each uses in either case. Ruhi Jain may i ask something http://electronictiger.net Fairportfan no Wraiththe What if you have a type C 5V/3A charger with a type C port. A USB to Type C cable that came with a device for charging. A USB to Micro USB converter. A QI wireless charger that needs at least 2A. Take the cable plug the Type C into the wall charger, put the adapter on the other end and plug the micro USB into the qi charger. Do you think this would be a risk? or will it just draw the amps it needs and stay cool? IE Compat news great testing Terry Stick It is not just the more powerful charger, the USB cable that came with the phone carry less current. My LG phone cable carried a maximum of .96 amps. I brought a Anker USB charger and USB cable. The Anker USB cable carried a maximum of 1.32 amps and that help charge my LG phone faster. The Anker USB chargers have a current regulator so battery overheat isn’t a problem. I would prefer having phones with wireless charging so that the USB port won’t wear out. Xyz Pqr Coooollll!!!!!!!!!!! Abu Nudnik Thanks. I was worried about charging a device through a wall-to-usb output & now I’m not. The unit was made for a 12V charger but I can’t get one that works anymore. Aaron Lucas And now a bunch of Galaxy Note 7 are blowing up, and a recall is happening. Answerkey Resuts I am daily using usb cable to charge my phone to Lappy. Is there any problem by connecting to lappy to smart phone by using USB cable. My Resources: ssc cgl tier 1 results 2016 Blackmart apk download Scott B. Barnett Lumia 950 and 950XL use USB C as well….and don’t blow up or brick on upgrade. Come back to the darkside fools! Й. Бернардо Гонзалез I recently installed in my truck a usb charging port bought at ebay, it has 2 usb ports to plug 2 devices at time, 1 usb port is labeled 1a , while the other is labeled 2.1a but if i check the outlet whit a multimeter it shows that both ports are delivering 5.1v 3.5 a, what looks too high for me… the question is, plugging in a smarthphone or other thing will cause any damage to the device?? other than heating the battery and shorten lifetime ? Delphi 5.1v should be fine, USB cables have at least 0.25v per amp drop so don’t worry. Й. Бернардо Гонзалез Thanx for your reply I know oly the basics on electronics and know that 5.1v is ok but I just want to be sure those 3.5amp. In my car usb power outlet wont burn my celphone or other device plugged in; so as you say is it totally safe right? Delphi Well, if you know basics of electronics you should know that amp rating of a voltage source means how much amps it can cough up before frying itself. It’s perfectly OK to draw 0.05 or 1.5 or 3.2A from a 3.5A outlet but not vice versa. All smartphones have (overly) sophisticated charging controller which will only take as much current as it needs. Moreover, if your car charger does not have an 120OHM resistor between data lines (different circuit used for apple) you might be surprised your phone is charging SLOW on a 3.5A adapter. Й. Бернардо Гонзалез Well thank you again, it is always a pleasure having someone helping you or at least sharing a little knowledge, have a good day!! Gonçalo Sampaio Hello! I have a 2010 external hard drive that is powered with one of the mentioned USB 2.0 Y-cable. My mbp doesn’t have two adjacent ports, so I was wandering if I could use one USB 3.0 to mini-usb cable to charge it. The specifications of the port indicate that it has 900 mA available, which is almost twice that of the 2.0. Thanks! Charlie Taylor Its basic electricity guys. A battery will not consume more current than it ‘needs’ . Lots of myths floating around out there. Improper ‘voltage’ or polarities could cause damage. But not available amps. As the device or battery will only consume what it wants. Many more modern devices have smart charging circuits built in now also, or ‘regulated power supplies’ or charging systems now a days. One thing i did not notice in this disscussion on charge time conditions is this. While wall and car chargers can have differnt charging amps, your power ‘cord’ connected to the charger is also a factor in how quickly your device will charge. Example. A 5volt car charger. Well depending on what you bought or how cheap it is, may have a chargeing amp rate of 300 milliamps(500 milliamps is half of a amp) to all the way up to 3 amps. The higher the ampherage available the faster the device will charge…… But…. The cable you attach to the charger, may only have a internal wire guage / size suitable for only 300 to 500 milliamps. You want a cable that has wires (inside it) of the larger wire guage, smaller is not better. And a cheap cable like that will degrade your charging speed. A better made and often slightly more expensive cable can make all the difference, cause you may have a awesome charger, that can charge rapidly at 2.5 to 3 amps, but the cable you put in it….. Well , it will handicap the charge time and really disappoint you. So keep amp rate of the charger you buy in mind and dont skimp on cord quality unless you have no choice. Size DOES matter in device chargeing (amps and wire size) TheN H Yup, you stated that perfectly. A correctly designed device will charge properly, as long as the voltage is right and there’s enough current. I must also mention how warm a cheap cable can get during charging a tablet. High quality or bust. http://electronictiger.net Fairportfan Many after-market legacy-USB to USB-C cables are incorrectly made and can damage chargers or computers not originally designed to work with them … or even some that are. Google engineer Benson Leung (Amazon user LaughingMan) posts reviews on Amazon (19 pages of them so far) where he identifies ones that are compliant, ones that aren’t, and ones that are downright dangerous (one cable fried his laptop completely). It’s a good idea to go there to find good cables if you’re considering buying one. John Gilbert I’d say from experience that fast charging not only damages batteries, is very dangerous too, I’ve just fast charged a phone ; I was niave and thought that anything with a USB socket, would fit….Any plug with a USB socket! not only did the battery and charger get very warm, but afterwards there were very minor scorch marks on the plug socket. We have had a pleothora of people in the UK who’s phones, batteries and chargers have set fire over night, and although people blame inferior, cheap and knockoff chargers, a lot of the problem is both misinformation and not having the knowledge required to look after a product.

Specifically, Qualcomm says Apple’s suppliers have “withheld ~$1 billion from their payments” over royalties for sales activity in the December quarter alone. Qualcomm has also provided a wide range of guidance for its next fiscal quarter because of the ongoing legal battle… Sony A6500 Our guidance range for fiscal Q3 2017 earnings per share is wider than our typical practice primarily due to the uncertainty around whether Apple’s suppliers will withhold some portion of the royalty payments they are obligated to pay under their contracts with us. We have considered a variety of scenarios within the range. However, our guidance range does not include the case where no payments are made by Apple suppliers. Qualcomm adds in its filing that “we continue to carry ~$1 billion in other current liabilities for unpaid disputed amounts with respect to the Cooperation Agreement with Apple.” The dispute publicly surfaced earlier this year when the FTC filed a complaint alleging Qualcomm forced Apple to use its baseband chips for higher patent royalties. Apple swiftly followed with a $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm following the monopoly complaint. Qualcomm said the lawsuit was founded on baseless claims and accused Apple of misrepresenting facts, and openly discussed a countersuit while saying that it hopes business continues as usual. Earlier this month, however, Qualcomm officially countersued Apple after spending a third of its January earnings call discussing the Apple situation. Apple CEO Tim Cook has publicly discussed being open to settling the legal dispute with Qualcomm, although he expects the legal battle to be a lengthy one.

A report from Credit Suisse compares Apple’s services business to an annuity, and estimates that Apple could take in $52 billion in sales from services in 2020. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: April 19, 2017 at 1:58 pm | UPDATED: April 19, 2017 at 3:34 pm Top of the Order:   Services, Services: Let’s talk about annuities, for a minute. No, I’m not here to sell you anything, so stay with me. As you may know, annuities are pretty cool things to have. An investment that kicks out a payment on a pre-set schedule? In effect, all you have to do is wait at home for the check to arrive in the mail. What’s not to like? In business, if a company can set up something that’s like an annuity, where for example, the company gets regular payments on a regular basis from its customers, that’s just easy money. And for Apple, the annuity-like characteristics of its services business are expected to provide billions of such payouts and allay some of the concerns about the company’s revenue and earnings growth prospects.

But, that figure could double to $52 million in three years, as Apple’s base of 650 million consumers using 1.1 billion Apple devices is expected to top 750 million users and 1.5 billion devices by 2020. What also makes services crucial to Apple’s future is the contribution the business makes to the company’s earnings. Garcha said the gross margins from services are at around 70 percent, as services require little in the way of expenses to produce, and their sales result in high profit levels for Apple. Garcha estimates that services contribute $19 billion to Apple’s annual earnings, and that could grow to $39 billion over the long term. Services have been a bright spot for Apple over the last year, a period that was marked by quarterly reports showing, at times, year-over-year declines in revenue and iPhone sales. However, services repeatedly turned in consistent gains in sales, including a 18 percent increase in fiscal first-quarter revenue, to reach $7.2 billion in the period that ended in December. Those figures were among the reasons why Garcha raised his price target on Apple’s stock to $170 a share from $160. “We believe that the market underestimates the gross profit contribution from services, but more importantly, that it underappreciates its growth potential and the annuity-type business it drives,” Garcha said in his report Wednesday. Apple is scheduled to deliver its second-quarter results on May 2. Last year, during Apple’s second quarter, services reached $6 billion, and was the only one of Apple’s main product groups to grow from the prior year. If services revenue continues to rise like it has, then Apple may have found an annuity that just keeps on giving. Middle Innings: Robots on Strike?: Well, it hasn’t come to that, yet. But, Tesla is facing a labor dispute at a robotics factory in Germany. Workers at the company, called Tesla Grohmann Automation since being acquired by Tesla last November, have told the Fremont-based automaker that they want a raise, as they say they are making 30 percent less than union wage levels. Negotiations may be on the horizon, as Tesla disputes the workers claims. From California to…Virginia?: Maybe Carly Fiorina just likes to challenge herself. After all, in 1999 she was the first woman hired as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard. And then in 2005, she was the first woman to be forced to resign as CEO of Hewlett-Packard. Then, in 2010, Fiorina ran against incumbent California Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer, but lost. And then Fiorina failed in a bid to secure the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Now, could Fiorina be about to try for another Senate run? If so, it will be about as far away from California as Fiorina can get, yet remain in the U.S. CNN reported that Fiorina is considering running for a Senate seat in 2018 in Virginia against current Democratic Senator Tim Kaine. That’s the same Tim Kaine who was Hillary Clinton’s vice presidential running mate in last year’s presidential election. According to CNN, Fiorina has said she will likely make a decision this fall about running for Kaine’s Senate seat.

The city of Beijing’s Cyberspace Administration is summoning Apple to ask that it subject Chinese news and live-streaming services to more stringent app reviews to ensure they conform to regulations, the agency said Tuesday in a statement on its WeChat social media account. Local operators Toutiao, Huoshanzhibo and Huajiao have failed to comply with legal requirements, the agency said. All three offer apps on the Chinese edition of Apple’s App Store. “These services lack rules on verifying information, dealing with emergency situations and guaranteeing their technology,” the regulator said. “They also have significant loopholes in supervising live-streaming content, managing viewers, verifying the identities of users and dealing with complaints from the public.” Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock didn’t respond to a request for comment. Unlike Alphabet Inc.’s Google, whose Play Store for mobile apps is banned in China, Apple’s App Store is open to Chinese consumers and helped drive surging sales growth from services in 2016. Yet Apple has encountered mounting resistance from Chinese regulators. It was forced to shutter its iTunes Movies and iBooks services last year, just six months after they were first permitted to operate, and lost a series of patent and trademark disputes to little known Chinese rivals. In return, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has sought to improve Apple’s standing in China with a series of investments. He is opening new research and development facilities in the country, and bought a US$1 billion stake in Didi Chuxing, China’s biggest ride-hailing service. China announced new regulations for mobile developers last year which required them to verify users’ identities with information such as mobile phone numbers, as well as to monitor and report postings that contained banned contents to the relevant authorities. App makers have to keep a record of user logs for 60 days, the rules stipulated. When developers submit their product to the App Store, they are subjected to a review process that evaluates quality and tries to ensure there are no bugs. China’s State Administration of Radio, Film and Television already requires approval for new mobile games for the App Store, Sina reported in June.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Tencent’s 2016 executive pay surpasses Apple, IBM 2 It’s not just text … WeChat’s censoring photos too 3 A plea for rules, even if Hong Kong loses to Singapore in fintech 4 Xiaomi bets on Mi6 smartphone to regain its mojo in China 5 Chinese firm halves costs by hiring army of robots Shared 1 Tencent’s 2016 executive pay surpasses Apple, IBM 2 It’s not just text … WeChat’s censoring photos too 3 A plea for rules, even if Hong Kong loses to Singapore in fintech 4 Chinese firm halves costs by hiring army of robots 5 Transformers: Forged to Fight will sock it to you Commented 1 Artist Ai Weiwei takes to social media after HSBC rejects application 2 Notorious Hong Kong gangster Yip Kai-foon, who inspired hit film, dead at 55 3 US vice-president to North Korea: ‘The sword stands ready’ 4 Don’t mess with Kim, he thinks he’s his grandfather 5 Bike-sharing service running on mobile app rides into Hong Kong Promotions Order your FREE copy of the MICE BIZ 2017 SCMP Invites you to Le French May “Paris Ballet Legend - A Night With The Stars”       You may also like Hong Kong Diamond design for future MTR station falls flat amid delays 18 Apr 2017 - 12:48pm 18 Zero Carbon Building reveals Hong Kong's eco-home potential In partnership with: HKT PREMIER China China launches revamped ‘green cards’ to lure foreign talent 18 Apr 2017 - 10:43pm 14 The Dumont: Refined riverfront living in Prime Central London Brought to you by JLL Hong Kong Hong Kong hikers warned as deaths exceed 2016 total in four months 17 Apr 2017 - 10:53pm 19 Hong Kong Hong Kong pay TV firm i-Cable takes ‘important step’ to stay afloat 18 Apr 2017 - 10:55pm 3 China How students cheated in China’s imperial civil service exams 18 Apr 2017 - 11:35am 4 Hong Kong Yip Kai-foon, Hong Kong's ‘King of Thieves’ dies in hospital Apr 19th 2017, 5:10pm China More Chinese flocking back home after studying abroad 17 Apr 2017 - 8:27am 73 Hong Kong ‘Nano’ flats on the rise amid high property prices 17 Apr 2017 - 10:59pm 9 Insight & Opinion How culture shock means sure turbulence on US-China flights 18 Apr 2017 - 9:07am 26 China ‘Hong Kong separatism’ on Communist Party security agenda 16 Apr 2017 - 8:13am 34 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

By Trace William Cowen Apr 19, 2017 Share Tweet Image via Pixabay Why not dive into another iPhone 8 rumor while the water's still warm? The latest whispering comes via Sonny Dickson, praised by Tech Crunch as a "reliable iPhone leaker." According to Dickson, Apple may be considering a new direction in design: iPhone 8 looks to be taking a new direction pic.twitter.com/mG19bcDYiC — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 19, 2017 Dickson's alleged schematics leak shows a place on the phone's rear for the Touch ID sensor. Additionally, the latest alleged leak suggests the new iPhone will be wider and taller than the current model. The Touch ID sensor relocation, however, is the most notable aspect of the design. Related Apple Is Launching a New Video App That’ll Up Your Social Media Game Apple's Insane Spaceship Campus to Open in April With Theater Named After Steve Jobs Apple Just Moved One Step Closer to Featuring Wireless iPhone Charging Just two days ago, MacRumors reported that equity research analyst Andy Hargreaves felt that Apple could be planning to ditch Touch ID on the new phone altogether. "Likely options for Apple include a delay of production or elimination of fingerprint sensing on the OLED iPhone," Hargreaves, who does analysis for Pacific Crest Securities, said. "We believe Apple continues to work on solving its optical fingerprint issue." Losing the Touch ID feature is still considered highly unlikely by many. If anything, moving the ID to the phone's rear has a greater chance of actually happening.  The fresh Touch ID rumors follow an overwhelming amount of iPhone rumors in recent months. The anniversary phone is expected to boast a prominent design change, including a possible edge-to-edge display. MacRumors adds that the iPhone 8—due later this year—is also rumored to have a faster processor, wireless charging capabilities, a glass body, and no home button. Then again, there's also the possibility that none of these things will happen.

Build Its iPhone Franchise (QCOM) View All Posts Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has been bouncing around over the last several trading days as investors start to consider whether the iPhone 8 will really be everything analysts have been repeatedly promising it will be. This week we heard yet another report of problems with rumored features that may end up being withheld from the final product. This time, it’s the fingerprint sensor that was rumored to be embedded right in the display of the iPhone 8. Why Apple Stock Target Got a Boost Nonetheless, analysts are trying to reassure investors that all is fine with Apple stock. Does the company really need anyone to do damage control where its stock is concerned when analysts are all too willing to do it themselves? In a note on Monday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani bumped up his price target for Apple stock from $155 to $157 per share and reiterated his ‘Outperform‘ rating. He also boosted his iPhone unit estimate for the March quarter and for fiscal 2017. He predicts that the iPhone maker will report $53.5 billion in sales for the March quarter, which is at the high end of the company’s own guidance. Apple is scheduled to release the results from its second fiscal quarter on May 2 after closing bell. According to Daryanani, the product mix for the iPhone is positive as consumers are supposedly showing a preference for the more expensive Plus-sized models, which of course means good things for average selling prices. 5 Tech Stocks to Buy for Growth AND Dividends This is the same analyst who turned heads last week by suggesting that Apple might purchase Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) with the spare change it finds rolling around in its couch cushions, that is, international markets (assuming a tax holiday on repatriated cash). Also this week, Mizuho Securities analysts reiterated their $150 price target and ‘Buy‘ rating on Apple stock. They predict that the iPhone maker’s earnings will be in line with consensus or perhaps slightly above. However, they also warned that its third quarter guidance might be “modestly below estimates” because consumers are probably delaying their iPhone purchases in anticipation of the iPhone 8. Not All are Convinced on Apple Stock Every so often, someone publishes a bearish view of Apple stock, and this time it’s InvestorPlace writer James Brumley, although he’s not bearish as much as he is simply no longer view it as an idol worth of worship. Bromley notes that the company’s products have sustained a fall from grace, of sorts, given that Laptop magazine has downgraded its position on the MacBook, and JD Power found that the iPad no longer tops its tablet owner satisfaction survey. 10 Under-the-Radar Stocks to Buy Now for Explosive Upside Clearly, the iPhone 8 has much more to prove than just that it’s worthy of its position as a tenth anniversary model.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo (Copyright Reuters 2017) Qualcomm Inc, the largest maker of chips used in smartphones, reported higher-than-expected quarterly adjusted profit and revenue, helping allay concerns about the company's patent-licensing business. Continue Reading Below The company's shares were up 2.4 percent at $53.85 in aftermarket trading on Wednesday. Qualcomm forecast current-quarter adjusted profit of $0.90-$1.15 per share and revenue of $5.3 billion-$6.1 billion. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.09 per share and revenue of $5.94 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Qualcomm's patent-licensing practices have come under increasing scrutiny from governments across the world, as well as its key customers. Apple Inc sued the chipmaker in January, accusing Qualcomm of overcharging for its chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Qualcomm fired back at the iPhone maker last week, saying Apple had breached agreements with the firm. In the counterclaim, Qualcomm also said Apple and other contract manufacturers were holding back licensing payments for the use of the chipmaker's products in Apple's devices. The company warned on Wednesday that it was unclear whether Apple's contract manufacturers would underpay royalties owed in the third quarter. Revenue fell 9.6 pct to $5.02 billion in the second quarter ended March 26. The quarter included a $974 million reduction to revenue, or 48 cents per share, related to the BlackBerry arbitration decision, Qualcomm said on Wednesday. On an adjusted basis, Qualcomm reported revenue of $5.99 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $5.89 billion. Net income attributable to the company fell to $749 million, or 50 cents per share, in the second quarter ended March 31, from $1.16 billion, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier. (http://bit.ly/2ot17st) Excluding items, Qualcomm earned $1.34 per share, above the average analysts' estimate of $1.19. The litigation has weighed on Qualcomm's shares, which are down about 19 percent this year through Wednesday's close. The stock is the worst performer this year on the Philadelphia semiconductor index, which has gained about 8 percent.  (Reporting by Narottam Medhora in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila) What do you think?

Apple is expected to being moving in employees this month, a process expected to take six months during which time the company will be completing landscaping and other work at the site. Here’s a gorgeous night shot of one of the secure research and development facilities. Sinfield also took his drone close to the main building. You can literally see workers moving wooden crates with furniture around. Office chairs and tables are already set up in some of the wings. Of note, certain sections of the building have been open to some employees since the beginning of April. Apple will begin moving in employees later this month. Watch Sinfield’s latest drone footage below. The Tantau Avenue parking garage still needs some work. The main ring-shaped structure files as the biggest office building and corporate campus in the world, ever. Among the features of Apple Park is a massive 1,000-seat underground auditorium. This is what it looks like, but that’s just the above-ground structure that’ll host a glass staircase spiraling down into the main underground auditorium. And here’s a shot from above. Named the Steve Jobs Theater as a way of paying tribute to Apple’s legendary co-founder and late CEO, it will be the default venue where future press and corporate events will take place.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile World’s top Apple insider says Galaxy S8 is great news for the iPhone 8 Image Source: Vianney le Masne Zach Epstein @zacharye April 19th, 2017 at 9:43 AM Share Tweet Typically, when a company is on the verge of releasing a new product that is shaping up to be a smash hit, it’s bad news for the company’s rivals. The logic there seems fairly obvious. LG, for example, is in a world of hurt because its sleek new G6 flagship phone is about to be completely eclipsed by Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Interestingly, however, the world’s top insider issued a new report on Wednesday morning that suggests the opposite will be true for Apple. While he does believe Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and S8+ will be wildly popular following their release in just two days, he thinks that Samsung’s imminent success is actually great news for Apple and its upcoming iPhone 8. Don't Miss: 5 ways the iPhone 7 is better than the Galaxy S8 We published our in-depth Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ review on Tuesday, and we were quite clear in our conclusions: these new Samsung smartphones are amazing. From design and build quality to displays and performance, these hot new handsets have everything going for them. Mix in some solid bundle offers at launch as well as Samsung’s multi-billion dollar marketing budget, and you undoubtedly have a recipe for success. Isn’t Samsung’s success a bad thing for Apple? According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, no, it’s not. Kuo issued a pair of new notes to clients on Wednesday morning. The first covered Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Note 8, and Kuo had some interesting details to share about that upcoming phone. His second research report covered the Galaxy S8, which he thinks will be a huge success. So much so, in fact, that he increased his sales estimates for Samsung’s new flagships, even though they were already quite high. “According to our survey, market feedback to Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ has been better than expected since their unveiling,” Kuo wrote in the note to clients, which was seen by 9to5Mac. “We attribute this to a better- than-expected selling point in the full-screen design. For this reason, we revise up our 2017F S8 shipments from 40-45mn units to 50-55mn units.” Hitting sales of 55 million units would be a record for Samsung, which sold an estimated 52 million Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge units, combined — and Kuo’s estimates only cover 2017 sales. Where Apple is concerned, this is apparently a good thing. Kuo’s research found that the Galaxy S8’s Infinity Display design is the key driver for demand. Of course, as we’ve all read in dozens of reports at this point, Apple’s upcoming new iPhone 8 is also expected to feature a new design with a much higher screen-to-body ratio. Kuo was one of the first insiders to report that Apple will adopt what he calls a “full-screen” design on the iPhone 8. In light of sky-high demand for the S8, he thinks the new iPhone 8 design alone will be enough to send demand through the roof. “We now expect full-screen design will accelerate penetration of the high-end smartphone segment over the next few years, thanks to adoption by S8 and the new 2H17F OLED iPhone model,” Kuo added. Apple is expected to release three new flagship iPhones in 2017. Two will apparently be iterative updates currently referred to as the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, though they may feature slightly tweaked designs with glass backs, which is something we haven’t seen before in an “S” update. The third new iPhone — dubbed iPhone 8 for the time being — is expected to feature an OLED display with a “full-screen” design, as well as a number of other new features.

Photo / Chris Ratcliffe Imagination Technologies Group discovered how fickle life can be as an Apple supplier when it was ditched this month by the iPhone maker. More suppliers may suffer the same fate as the world's largest technology company faces a shrinking number of semiconductor makers and expands into areas that need special chips designed in-house. Dialog Semiconductor, Synaptics and Cirrus Logic are particularly vulnerable to Apple's supply chain whims and demands, according to analysts. One component supplier, Avnet, stopped working with Apple because the relationship was squeezing its profit margins too much. Apple has developed its own processors for years, but has stepped up in-house design of components, including graphics, Bluetooth and other smartphone-related chips, in recent years. That's expensive, and creates new risks, but it helps the company maintain leverage over suppliers as a recent wave of acquisitions cut the number of chipmakers it works with. To secure cheaper prices, Apple likes to have at least two suppliers for any given component. But last year alone, one in five US chipmakers were acquired, according to Susquehanna Financial Group. Key Apple suppliers SanDisk Corp, Broadcom, TriQuint Semiconductor, Intersil, Sharp Corp, Elpida Memory, RF Micro Devices and Fairchild Semiconductor International have all been snapped up since 2013. Loop Capital Markets analyst Betsy Van Hees, has seen 35 chip companies swallowed since 2014. "You have less competition, less pricing pressure," she said. "Which may be why Apple is going more internally than externally." Continued below.

This year is particularly important for Apple because it's preparing to launch three iPhones, including a flagship device with a major new design. The installation of new manufacturing lines and processes is costly, so Apple needs to find savings elsewhere. "To avoid taking a hit you put some pressure" on the suppliers, BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis said. Cost isn't the only incentive for Apple to develop its own components. It also helps the company couple its hardware more seamlessly with its software, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri explained at a Feb. 14 conference in San Francisco. "We have better control over timing, over cost, over quality," he said. Expansion into new markets and products may also require hardware unique to Apple's needs that isn't immediately available from outside suppliers. The AirPods Bluetooth headphones, released last year, use low-energy communications chips that Apple got through its purchase of Passif Semiconductor Corp. in 2013. In 2012, Apple spent $356 million acquiring AuthenTec Inc., which had fingerprint sensors and related chipsets that helped build the fingerprint scanner on the iPhone. Apple was in acquisition talks last year with Imagination Technologies. The Kings Langley, England-based company designs a type of chip called a graphics processing unit that's used in iPhones and iPads, and analysts theorized Apple wanted to take the technology in house and push it forward on its own terms. Apple decided against making an offer. Then, on April 3, Imagination said Apple would stop using its graphics technology after developing its own solutions. Apple also hired several employees from Imagination, including former Chief Operating Officer John Metcalfe. The British company lost about two-thirds of its market value that day. On Wednesday, UBS estimated Apple will pay Imagination one-third of its current royalty rate as their relationship winds down over the next two years. We have better control over timing, over cost, over quality. Luca Maestri, Apple CFO That prompted analysts and investors to cast a keener eye over what other suppliers may be next. One immediate example was Dialog, which slumped 20 percent April 11 after Bankhaus Lampe analyst Karsten Iltgen suggested Apple may cease using Dialog's power-management chips. Apple is setting up power-management design centers in Munich and California, Iltgen noted, and there's been a steady flow of engineers from Dialog to Apple over the past year. Synaptics, whose products help control the iPhone's touch screen, could also be vulnerable, Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh wrote in an April 12 note. Apple has hired "a significant number" of engineers from the company, suggesting that it's working on products that would render Synaptics redundant, Vinh said. Vinh also highlighted Cirrus Logic, which makes audio chips used in iPhones, even as he deemed the risk of Apple developing its own competing components "medium to low." Hiring in-house experts doesn't come cheap (Cirrus spends $200 million a year on research, Vinh noted). In the past five years, Apple doubled research and development spending as a percentage of revenue, an increase CFO Maestri attributed to new product categories and developing more of its own underlying technology, among other factors. Semiconductor research is among the most expensive in the technology industry, often exceeding 18 per cent of revenue. Apple spends 4.7 per cent of its income on R&D, up from 2.2 per cent in 2012. The pay-off from the investment could be substantial. Semiconductors account for about a third of iPhone manufacturing costs, according to Timothy Arcuri, a Cowen & Co. analyst. Tapering growth of smartphone sales has meanwhile heightened the need to squeeze every last dollar of profit out of the handsets that Apple does sell. The main risk is that Apple misses new technology trends that bubble up through a large supply chain. Relying more on internally created components, it'll have fewer suppliers lining up to show it the latest innovations. When Nokia was the world's largest mobile phone maker, it focused more on cost cutting and controlling component supply and missed out on important changes in the market, according to Mike Walkley, an Apple analyst at Canaccord Genuity. "You've seen what they've done to Imagination and Dialog Semi and all of these people who supply to Apple," he said. "It's kind of what Nokia did back in the day when they were king of the world." An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Then there's the risk that some partners decide they don't want to deal with Apple anymore. Bill Amelio, former chief executive officer of Lenovo Group Ltd. who now runs Avnet, said he walked away from supplying Apple and it's helped improve earnings. The Phoenix, Arizona-based distributor of chips and other computer components had a gross profit margin of 13.7 per cent in its most recent quarter. That's 2 percentage points wider than it was a year earlier -- thanks in part to cutting ties with Apple.

This time he has plans that appear to confirm Apple’s big design flip. Rod ChesterNews Corp Australia Network April 20, 201710:33am Apple CEO Tim Cook is expected to reveal the iPhone 8 in September. Picture: Stephen Lam/Getty Images. SERIAL Apple leaker Sonny Dickson is at it again, and this time he has shared what appears to be part of the plans of the iPhone 8. Dickson, who has a history of more than three years of leaking details of the pre-released iPhones, today has shared what could be confirmation of some Apple fans worst fear about the flagship iPhone 8 to be released later this year. iPhone 8 looks to be taking a new direction pic.twitter.com/mG19bcDYiC— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 19, 2017 The schematic, which a watermark suggests has been obtained through the Chinese social network QC, appears to reveal the design details of the rear panel of the iPhone 8. If the schematic is accurate, then it seems to be proof that Apple has found it too hard to keep the TouchID fingerprint scanner on the front of the phone and moved it to the rear. The schematic shows that the phone has dual camera lenses running vertically down the phone, rather than across the back of the phone as with the current iPhone 7 Plus design. Iphone 8 Rumours1:10 Rumours are ramping up over the much anticipated iPhone 8. Only time will tell how many of them will come true. February 23rd 2017 2 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ It also shows the location of what is most likely to be the fingerprint scanner beneath the Apple logo — and not included in the Apple logo which some iPhone fans including analyst Carolina Milanesi had raised as a possibility. If they could turn their logo into the scan it would b great https://t.co/V39YsyOL4s— carolina milanesi (@caro_milanesi) April 19, 2017 Dickson, who does not say how he got the image or the likelihood of its accuracy, notes the sketch of the presumed iPhone 8 design also appears to have dropped the two volume buttons on the side of the iPhone. Dickson makes no comment on the measurements indicated on the sketch, but if it is genuine then this reveals another key bit of information about the iPhone 8. Dickson has confirmed to News Corporation that he believes this to be the final design. The sketch shows a iPhone case design that measures 72.497mm wide and 149.501mm tall — which would make the iPhone 8 about 1mm wider than the current iPhone 7 and about 1cm taller. A slimmer and longer iPhone would be in line with the new look Samsung Galaxy S8. The new screen shape reinforces the expectation that the iPhone 8 will have a larger 5.8-inch OLED that will be nearly edge-to-edge in design — or, in other words, a screen about the size of the iPhone 7 Plus in a phone about the size of the iPhone 7. While this appears to be the biggest leak so far about Apple’s plans for the iPhone 8, there are reasons to be cautious. Dickson has a good track record on leaks, but this could be wrong. It could either be a design that Apple tried and rejected for the iPhone 8, given we know Apple tries out various models before it commits to a final design. With no indication of the source, it is impossible to confirm that it is even a genuine sketch of an Apple design. Yesterday, there was a warning by analyst Andy Hargreaves at Pacific Crest Securities that Apple would have to delay the iPhone 8 if it could not either solve how to incorporate a fingerprint scanner into the screen or settle with the design compromise of putting the fingerprint scanner on the rear of the phone. While many smartphones have the fingerprint scanner on the rear of the phone, one of the downsides of the design is that you cannot unlock your phone while it is sitting on a desk.

Bloomberg Photo: AFP Apple Inc. is responsible for the health or mortal sickness of the cottage industry of companies that make parts for iPhones or assemble them. It turns out Apple can also be hurt by the interconnected supply chain. On tap starting this fall will be a shift from two new versions of the iPhone to three. The two expected in Apple’s typical September launch window will be updated versions of the iPhone 7 and its larger-screen sibling, the iPhone 7 Plus. The big deal for this year—the 10th anniversary of the iPhone—is a drastically different new phone with a more vibrant type of screen and extra real estate, thanks to slimmer frames around the edges. Wall Street has already grown excited that this reimagined iPhone will set off a rush of people splurging for a cool new iPhone with a big ticket price. Click here for enlarge Oh, but wait. Literally. The cool new iPhone may not be on sale in September because of hiccups in obtaining enough key components, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday. The most visible is a different type of screen—known as organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display—which allows for a thinner, sharper-looking screens without hogging too much battery life. It gives Apple the technology it needs to make a phone that is essentially all screen. Apple, at least initially, will be depending solely on the leading maker of OLED displays, Samsung Display Co. You know who already has a new smartphone with the same type of screen? That would be Samsung Electronics Ltd. Yes. Samsung is one of Apple’s most important suppliers and one of its most bitter rivals. Much has been written about the peril of suppliers relying on Apple for their livelihood. Well, there’s also a risk to Apple from depending on its suppliers. Click here for enlarge Samsung may not be doing this deliberately, but the smartphone-making part of Samsung apparently has a sufficient supply of OLED screens. Those parts are already rolling off factory assembly lines as the screens for Samsung’s new S8 line of smartphones which compete with the iPhone. The enemy-and-friend relationship between Apple and Samsung has been evident for years. Apple worked hard to wean itself off Samsung computer chips for its iPhones and iPads. Apple sued Samsung for copying key elements of the iPhone even as Apple continued to buy parts from Samsung. If the OLED iPhone model goes on sale in October or November, it won’t be a disaster for Apple. The company is no stranger to muddling through shortages of important iPhone components, and Apple CEO Tim Cook is a wizard of supply-chain management. But the experience is a salient reminder that in the smartphone industry, no company is an island. Not even Apple.

Facebook has announced that Spotify and Apple Music will both be integrated into Messenger, allowing users to share playable links to songs, albums, and playlists directly in-app. This integration is part of Facebook’s new Chat Extensions for its Messenger Platform, first unveiled at the F8 developer conference. According to Spotify, users will be able to search the catalog from the Messenger app, which will also surface their recently played music. Once a song link in shared, recipients will be able to play a 30-second clip. They will have to go to the main Spotify app to listen to the full song. Apple has not disclosed how the Apple Music integration will work, but it’s safe to assume that it will be something similar to Spotify. Facebook will begin rolling out the integrations “very soon.”  In addition, Spotify has created a Messenger bot that will give users playlist recommendations based on their mood, activity, or genre. Why this matters: When Apple turned iMessage into a platform for third-party apps, it integrated with Apple Music because duh. But Apple is also open to outside platforms—first with the release of an Android app, and now Facebook Messenger support. This allows as many people as possible to discover and sign up for Apple Music. However, no amount of third-party integrations will change the fact that both Spotify and Apple Music are still closed ecosystems. If people really want to share music on Messenger or any other messaging app, they’re still better served sending a YouTube or SoundCloud link, which doesn’t require a membership and plays longer than 30 seconds.

Shares rose less than 2 percent after hours. Earnings Adjusted EPS: $1.34 a share, ex-items vs. $1.19 per share expected by Thomson Reuters consensus Revenue: $5.99 billion vs. $5.89 billion expected by Thomson Reuters consensus Adjusted earnings were up 29 percent from the $1.04 per share reported a year ago, while adjusted revenues were up 8 percent from the $5.5 billion reported this time last year. Q3 adjusted EPS guidance: Range of 90 cents a share to $1.15 a share vs. $1.09 a share expected by Thomson Reuters consensus Q3 revenue guidance: Range of $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion vs. $5.94 billion expected Thomson Reuters consensus Legal disputes cast shadow over new technologies Brad Quick | CNBC Steve Mollenkopf, CEO of Qualcomm, at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Feb. 23, 2016. Qualcomm's widely used chips and designs are getting beefed up for the adoption of new technology and 5G connections. The flagship Samsung Galaxy S8, for instance, used one of Qualcomm's most high-end chips, and the company benefitted from higher-than-expected average prices during the quarter, executives said during a conference call with analysts. During the quarter, Qualcomm saw revenue in its licensing division grow 5 percent from a year ago, to $2.25 billion. Revenues for its technology division grew 10 percent from a year ago, to $3.68 billion. Analysts surveyed by StreetAccount expected the licensing division to report $2.24 billion in revenue, and the technology division to report $3.56 billion. But the company's sales bump comes amid intense scrutiny of the semiconductor company's business model. Qualcomm's earnings guidance range for next quarter fell around analyst expectations. But the company warned that a tiff with Apple could affect its outlook, as it expects underpayments from manufacturers: Apple's contract manufacturers reported, but underpaid, royalties in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. However, our revenues were not negatively impacted as the contract manufacturers acknowledged the amounts are due and the underpayment was equal to the amounts that Qualcomm has not paid Apple under our Cooperation Agreement that are currently in dispute. The Cooperation Agreement expired December 31, 2016. It is not clear whether Apple's contract manufacturers will underpay royalties owed under their contracts with us in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, which could have a negative impact on our financial results. Our guidance range for fiscal third quarter EPS is wider than our typical practice primarily due to this uncertainty. The remarks likely refer to $1 billion lawsuit from one of the world's most powerful companies, Apple, which argues that Qualcomm charges "at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined." Qualcomm has filed a counterclaim against Apple for breaching agreements and throttling its processors in the iPhone 7. The "Apple situation" is not the only battle for Qualcomm. Qualcomm is fighting a fine of $868 million in South Korea, over high patent fees and refusing to offer licenses to some chip manufacturers. The earnings report also reflected a $974 million reduction to revenues over a dispute with BlackBerry. New processors and wider internet "pipes" have the promise to push forward technologies like virtual reality, cloud computing and video streaming, Qualcomm CEO Steven Mollenkopf said earlier this year. Plus there's the burgeoning self-driving car industry, which Qualcomm hopes to enter with its $38 billion agreement to acquire NXP Semiconductors. Qualcomm unveiled a new 835 Snapdragon processor, the first ever under 10 nanometers, earlier this year. The Snapdragon 820 and 821 are found in high-end Android smartphones like the Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, LGV20, HTC 10, and BlackBerry's Android device. Executives told analysts that demand for 10 nanometer chips is exceeding supply. "We will continue to protect the value of our technologies, which enables today's robust mobile communications ecosystem, and invest in R&D that will drive the leading edge of mobile computing and connectivity for decades to come — focusing on areas where our technologies will have the most impact and generate the best returns," Mollenkopf said in a statement on Wednesday. But up just 1.5 percent over the last year, Qualcomm shares have lagged the gains of rivals Intel and Nvidia. The company's China business also continues to be in focus, after softness in the region last quarter. "The licensing business had a strong quarter ... the stronger market and improved licensing in China offset the impact of a new dispute with a licensee," Mollenkopf said during the conference call. President Derek Aberle added that the strength reflected "significantly increased" gains from a year ago in China.

An updated version of this software, watchOS 2, came out at WWDC in June 2015 (followed by smaller 'point' updates), so we weren't surprised to see Apple announce and demonstrate watchOS 3 at WWDC 2016 on 13 June 2016. It became available in autumn 2016. How do I get watchOS 3? watchOS 3 is a free public update. Open the Watch app on the iPhone that's paired with your Apple Watch. From the My Watch tab, tap General > Software Update. If there's a watchOS update you've not yet installed, you will be told about it here, and given the opportunity to download and install it on your Apple Watch. Bear in mind that watchOS is tied to iOS, and you may need to update the latter before you're able to update the former. We weren't offered the watchOS 3.2 update, for example, until we installed iOS 10.3. We explain the update process in more detail in our guide to updating watchOS. What's the latest version? The most recent update is watchOS 3.2, released to the public in March 2017. (The next version will be watchOS 3.2.2, which is currently in the beta testing phase. We explain how to install watchOS betas in this article.) Here, we list some of the biggest changes and new features in watchOS 3.2. New Siri capabilities watchOS 3.2 brings enhanced Siri capabilities, thanks to the rolling out of SiriKit for Apple Watch (SiriKit was previously limited to iOS apps only). SiriKit allows developers to set up Siri integration for their apps on the watch for a few select uses. You can talk to Siri via your Watch in order to interact with various third-party apps in a way that will be familiar to those who've used iOS 10. Users will be able to order an Uber, send a message through a chat application and more, simply by speaking to the Apple Watch. Theatre Mode Also new in watchOS 3.2 is the addition of Theatre Mode, designed to avoid distracting others in dark environments like the cinema and the theatre. Theatre Mode lets the user mute the sound as well as disable the raise-to-wake feature, just by the touch of a button. Notifications are still received (including the haptic notifier) and can be viewed by pressing the Digital Crown or by tapping the screen. Control Centre reshuffle As well as these changes there is also a subtle change to the Control Centre. With the addition of Theatre Mode, Apple decided to move some of the buttons on the Control Centre, moving Theatre Mode to the bottom of the panel next to AirPlay. watchOS 3's design & graphical elements Apple's design and interface teams have made some tweaks to visual aspects of watchOS for this update. Here's what to expect. New watch faces Apple unveiled new watch faces, including a Minnie Mouse option that was certainly a crowd-pleaser. There's also an Activity watch face, and you can launch more apps straight from the watch face screen including Workout, Music and Messages. Complications have been introduced to the Photo, Motion and Timelapse faces, too. Redesigned Control Centre The Control Centre has been given a makeover, with it now being easier to access. With the exclusion of Glances in watchOS 3, you can now quickly enter the Control Centre by swiping up from the watch face. This now presents you with a few quick toggles, such as a button allowing you to ping your phone and even toggling airplane mode. Despite being a small update, this new feature greatly improves the user experience and speeds up efficiency when using the Apple Watch. Disable screenshots A very small feature, but useful nevertheless, you can now disable screenshots on your Apple Watch, meaning less accidental screenshots. This is presented as an option within the watch's settings. watchOS 3 features watchOS 3 was a pretty big update, with lots of new features set to make your Apple Watch experience smoother and faster. Read on for more detail about each of the new features and what they mean to you. Dock The new Dock feature is one of our favourites. It makes navigating through apps much easier on your Apple Watch. The Dock will show all of your recent and favourite apps. You access the app dock via the much-maligned side button on the Apple Watch, which used to bring up the favourite contacts dial: we won't miss that. It's always struck us as a niche feature given undeserved prominence - we use our Apple Watches to accept incoming calls and reply to texts, but almost never initiate conversations on it - although we'd be interested to hear from readers who have used it regularly. Instant apps You'll also find that your apps launch much, much faster than they did before. That's because Apple has introduced an instant launch feature, and the apps will update in the background so that the information displayed is accurate, and ready to go, at all times. Apple says watchOS 3 makes the Apple Watch seven times faster at opening new apps. This update might seem minimal, but there cannot be a single Apple Watch user out there who hasn't noticed the device's sluggishness at opening apps, and wishes for some kind of speed boost - watchOS 3 addresses that. Activity and Workout Apple has also improved the Activity and Workout apps to help you stay motivated. You'll be able to share, compare and compete with your contacts, and you'll now get notifications about your friends' progress too. Activity sharing is connected to the Messages app too, so you can send personalised messages of encouragement. With watchOS 3, the Apple Watch can track the activity and fitness of users in wheelchairs. watchOS 3 provides two wheelchair-specific workouts, and determines calories burned in a wheelchair according to how hard the surface is and its gradient, while taking into account different seats and wheel heights. And the "time to stand" fitness notification will be optionally replaced by "time to roll". We discuss the wheelchair-focused features in watchOS 3, as well as looking at alternative fitness trackers for disabled users, in our guide to wheelchair fitness tracking. Breathe app The Breathe app, introduced in watchOS 3, encourages you to take moments throughout the day to do deep-breathing sessions to control your stress levels. You'll get a heart rate summary after the session, which can last for up to five minutes. Quick replies Apple improved the messaging system in watchOS 3. You can use stickers, handwriting, full-screen effects and invisible ink just like the new features in iOS 10. Smart Replies are available within the message notification, and you can use the scribble feature to write custom replies by drawing each letter, which the Apple Watch will convert into text. SOS The SOS app, which is available worldwide so will work wherever you are, even if you're travelling, can be used to call emergency services and alert your emergency contacts right from the Apple Watch. It works using your phone's cellular connection or WiFi. Unlock a Mac with your Apple Watch Fed up of having to enter your password to unlock your Mac? Why not set it up so your Apple Watch can unlock your Mac. Face Gallery You can't create your own custom watch faces, sadly, you can customise the existing ones with your iPhone. Previously you were only able to do this on the watch itself, but the bigger screen makes it easier. Find my Apple Watch The Find My iPhone feature is now available on the Apple Watch, meaning if you lose your watch you can track it through Find My iPhone. Siri Siri has received a small update, where a haptic tap is now felt when Siri is no longer active. We would have liked a bigger updated for Siri on watchOS 3, but we will have to wait for a later revision. Camera controls You can now use the Digital Crown to control the iPhone's digital zoom levels. It's not quite the full customisation of the Digital Crown we were hoping for, but having the ability to zoom in photos is good nevertheless. OUR VERDICT watchOS 3 brings a number of improvements to the Apple Watch that we welcome, with Instant Apps being our personal favourite. We've been reluctant to use Apple Watch apps thus far as they've taken a while to load (so long that we could get our iPhones out and check!), but the introduction of watchOS 3 means that many apps now load instantly. It's a huge improvement over watchOS 2, and we can't wait to find out what Apple has in store for watchOS 4!

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple World’s top Apple insider says Galaxy S8 is great news for the iPhone 8 Zach Epstein BGR News April 19, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Typically, when a company is on the verge of releasing a new product that is shaping up to be a smash hit, it’s bad news for the company’s rivals. The logic there seems fairly obvious. LG, for example, is in a world of hurt because its sleek new G6 flagship phone is about to be completely eclipsed by Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Interestingly, however, the world’s top insider issued a new report on Wednesday morning that suggests the opposite will be true for Apple. While he does believe Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and S8+ will be wildly popular following their release in just two days, he thinks that Samsung’s imminent success is actually great news for Apple and its upcoming iPhone 8. Don't Miss: 5 ways the iPhone 7 is better than the Galaxy S8 We published our in-depth Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ review on Tuesday, and we were quite clear in our conclusions: these new Samsung smartphones are amazing. From design and build quality to displays and performance, these hot new handsets have everything going for them. Mix in some solid bundle offers at launch as well as Samsung’s multi-billion dollar marketing budget, and you undoubtedly have a recipe for success. Isn’t Samsung’s success a bad thing for Apple? According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, no, it’s not. Kuo issued a pair of new notes to clients on Wednesday morning. The first covered Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Note 8, and Kuo had some interesting details to share about that upcoming phone. His second research report covered the Galaxy S8, which he thinks will be a huge success. So much so, in fact, that he increased his sales estimates for Samsung’s new flagships, even though they were already quite high. “According to our survey, market feedback to Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ has been better than expected since their unveiling,” Kuo wrote in the note to clients, which was seen by 9to5Mac. “We attribute this to a better- than-expected selling point in the full-screen design. For this reason, we revise up our 2017F S8 shipments from 40-45mn units to 50-55mn units.” Hitting sales of 55 million units would be a record for Samsung, which sold an estimated 52 million Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge units, combined — and Kuo’s estimates only cover 2017 sales. Where Apple is concerned, this is apparently a good thing. Kuo’s research found that the Galaxy S8’s Infinity Display design is the key driver for demand. Of course, as we’ve all read in dozens of reports at this point, Apple’s upcoming new iPhone 8 is also expected to feature a new design with a much higher screen-to-body ratio. Kuo was one of the first insiders to report that Apple will adopt what he calls a “full-screen” design on the iPhone 8. In light of sky-high demand for the S8, he thinks the new iPhone 8 design alone will be enough to send demand through the roof. “We now expect full-screen design will accelerate penetration of the high-end smartphone segment over the next few years, thanks to adoption by S8 and the new 2H17F OLED iPhone model,” Kuo added. Apple is expected to release three new flagship iPhones in 2017. Two will apparently be iterative updates currently referred to as the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, though they may feature slightly tweaked designs with glass backs, which is something we haven’t seen before in an “S” update. The third new iPhone — dubbed iPhone 8 for the time being — is expected to feature an OLED display with a “full-screen” design, as well as a number of other new features.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About April 20, 2017 You Think You Can’t Be Phished? 51 Comments by: Pedro Umbelino April 19, 2017 Well, think again. At least if you are using Chrome or Firefox. Don’t believe us? Well, check out Apple new website then, at https://www.apple.com . Notice anything? If you are not using an affected browser you are just seeing a strange URL after opening the webpage, otherwise it’s pretty legit. This is a page to demonstrate a type of Unicode vulnerability in how the browser interprets and show the URL to the user. Notice the valid HTTPS. Of course the domain is not from Apple, it is actually the domain: “https://www.xn--80ak6aa92e.com/“. If you open the page, you can see the actual URL by right-clicking and select view-source. So what’s going on? This type of phishing attack, known as IDN homograph attacks, relies on the fact that the browser, in this case Chrome or Firefox, interprets the “xn--” prefix in a URL as an ASCII compatible encoding prefix. It is called Punycode and it’s a way to represent Unicode using only the ASCII characters used in Internet host names. Imagine a sort of Base64 for domains. This allows for domains with international characters to be registered, for example, the domain “xn--s7y.co” is equivalent to “短.co”, as [Xudong Zheng] explains in his blog. Different alphabets have different glyphs that work in this kinds of attacks. Take the Cyrillic alphabet, it contains 11 lowercase glyphs that are identical or nearly identical to Latin counterparts. These class of attacks, where an attacker replaces one letter for its counterpart is widely known and are usually mitigated by the browser: In Chrome and Firefox, the Unicode form will be hidden if a domain label contains characters from multiple different languages. It is possible to register domains such as “xn--pple-43d.com”, which is equivalent to “аpple.com”. It may not be obvious at first glance, but “аpple.com” uses the Cyrillic “а” (U+0430) rather than the ASCII “a” (U+0041). The “аpple.com” domain as described above will appear in its Punycode form as “xn--pple-43d.com” to limit confusion with the real “apple.com”. So far so good, the browsers filters these types of counterpart character substitution. But there’s a catch. It appears that the mitigation fails when all characters in the URL use the same alphabet. The domain “аррlе.com” as in the website shown before, registered as “xn--80ak6aa92e.com”, bypasses the filter by using only Cyrillic characters. One can understand why a developer may have chosen this behaviour, nevertheless it presents a problem, as demonstrated. This affects the current version of Chrome browser, which is version 57.0.2987 and the current version of Firefox, which is version 52.0.2. This does not affect Internet Explorer or Safari browsers. If you are using Firefox, you can switch off the Punycode translation in about:config by changing network.IDN_show_punycode to true. If you are using Chrome, you’ll have to wait for the update. Or manually check the HTTPS certificate in HTTPS enabled websites. Aren’t you just tempted to register a domain to go and phish the phishers?

Anyone else noticing this/considering this? Report comment Reply notarealemail says: April 20, 2017 at 12:01 am Yeah, it is worse than last update. I usually load several tabs and then view them offline to conserve battery life and data. But then half the pages attempt to reload and it’s gone. Hackaday works fine though.

Report comment Reply Unferium says: April 19, 2017 at 2:43 pm Also the fact they dropped the ALSA backend forcing people to FalseAudio or another browser. They could at least have an option selection of, “Enable ALSA (Stereo)” and, “Enable PulseAudio (Surround)”, that would help those who’s not got a mid-end laptop manufactured 5 minutes ago and theirs may not handle PulseAudio smoothly. Also, seems though soundcloud has moved to Flash instead of the more compatible/widely supported HTML5, just because Adobe has resurrected support for Linux users (Though it gives the lazy ones in the Linux users pond a kick up where the sun doesn’t shine). Youtube still sticking with HTML5 for now it seems. Report comment Reply RW says: April 19, 2017 at 2:57 pm Oooo will have to check renewed support for flash out… Couple of flash heavy sites I have to rely on, and the older machine I sandbox them on is a bit doggy. Wondering if lubuntu will be better now Report comment Reply Unferium says: April 19, 2017 at 3:13 pm V25 for NPAPI and PPAPI as separately supplied downloads straight from the adobe website(Looked at 32bit linux support though, not sure if more options for 64…) Report comment Unferium says: April 19, 2017 at 4:09 pm Just updated said flash player, However it claims to require several generations of glibc newer than the one I have, so –force –nodeps on the RPM and a manual copy of the .so into the firefox addons. Then another addon to force youtube to not serve me HTML5 (So flash works instead). Now I have sound on an ALSA only configured Debian. Addons to work around firefox feature removal all over again, they should remove the page viewing pane next because who needs to see websites anyway! Also my battery time at 20% on firefox has gone down from 1h 45mins to 28mins!!!! just by using flashplayer instead of HTML5! Though I remember underclocking (switching to the lowest freq multiplier: 800Mhz and makes a BIG difference in runtime extending) saves battery and heat without causing stutter in flashplayer played videos, even though the CPU utility goes 100%, but that was time ago (flasplayer V11 era). Time to do some rethinking of my energy usage and OS configuration if I want that 3+ hour use away from mains, the biggest reason I haven’t upgraded my OS to the newer Debian 8.x as I had less runtime under such a newer Debian(GNU)+Linux OS, albeit they were unconfigured live CD ISOs on USB. Report comment rob says: April 19, 2017 at 7:09 pm Their decision to depend on the thing formerly known as PolypAudio is why I’m leaving FF after being extremely satisfied from Phoenix 0.9 up to just before the Australis fiasco, when I learned to love Classic Theme Restorer, which is nearing its EOL because the Mozilla devs are now also ripping out the spinal cord lots of customization extensions need. Really rather sad. Ladies and gentlemen, the “Free Web” Report comment Reply rob says: April 19, 2017 at 7:19 pm P.S. ALSA isn’t dropped outright, just the official binaries are nerfed. You can compile it yourself with ALSA and JACK and *no* FoolsAudio, though it really helps to be on any distro that automates that Report comment Reply Reg says: April 19, 2017 at 1:48 pm Firefox 31.6.0 on OpenIndiana 151_a8 shows the URL correctly at the bottom left of the browser window. I *always* check links in blog posts and emails to see where they point.

The whole point is it’s a site that isn’t what it says it is in the URL, imagine this being done to create a false paypal page, etc etc. It tricks you into feeling secure after you manually look at the URL bar, except the URL bar lies to you!

To visit the phishing site, I have to click through to the article, and follow the link from there. The Status bar shows the URL when I mouseover, and that is correct without visiting the page (it shows only the ASCII URL, not Unicode).

Report comment Reply gregkennedy says: April 19, 2017 at 7:20 pm While I can see that showing Punycode in the URL is a better option for security, doesn’t that make the Web very Anglocentric again? I mean why bother registering a domain in real Katakana or whatever, if it is just transformed into xn--somethingUnrecognizable at the URL bar? This is probably why Firefox stands by their original implementation, because an all-Cyrillic URL is probably just a Cyrillic website, so why encode it? Now is the point where I would start bashing on the Unicode Consortium (again) but ai will take the day off instead. Report comment Reply ben says: April 19, 2017 at 10:33 pm Perhaps the sensible approach is to vary by TLD; an all-cyrillic domain is okay in .ru, but should be flagged and displayed as ascii in .com?

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: This Might Be the Worst News Yet for Apple Inc.'s iPhone 8 Apple's bold plan to integrate Touch ID into the display might fail this year. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 19, 2017 at 4:00PM A lot has been written about the woes that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly facing in trying to embed its Touch ID technology directly into the display of its upcoming iPhone 8 smartphone. The company is reportedly facing yield challenges with the technology, and it's not even clear if the issues will get worked out in time to meet Apple's desired launch schedule. Since Apple's new iPhone model is expected to have a full-screen face, embedding the Touch ID sensor into a home button that sits in the "chin" of the new iPhone isn't possible. Image source: Apple via AppleInsider. Two main alternatives to Touch ID embedded in the display have been proposed by analysts. The first is that Apple could put the Touch ID sensor on the back of the device -- something commonly done by Android smartphone manufacturers. Another proposal is that Apple could just ditch Touch ID altogether, instead opting to use alternative forms of biometric identification. Per a new leak from reputable leaker Sonny Dickson (via MacRumors), it looks as though Apple might have given up on embedding Touch ID into the display and is, instead, going with a backup plan. Touch ID on the back of the device The leak from Sonny Dickson clearly shows the Touch ID sensor placed on the back of the device, below the Apple logo. Image source: Sonny Dickson. The unwelcome news is that, if this is the final design and not just the schematic for one of many possible prototypes, Apple was unable to get Touch ID embedded into the display to be viable for mass production this time around. Although it's obviously better for Apple to ship a product with a compromised feature set than to try to sell something that can't be viably manufactured, this would be quite a disappointment. Not only does this suggest that the user experience that Apple may deliver with its upcoming iPhone 8 will be greatly diminished because of the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, but this would also reflect poorly on Apple's engineering/research and development organization. Remember, Apple has substantially increased its research and development spending over the years, and it is now spending at a run rate of over $10 billion per year. That spending is spread across a relatively narrow, focused set of products and technologies, so it's very likely that critical projects and technologies get all the funding that they need. Given this reality, and given the extreme importance of the iPhone to Apple's business, it's highly disappointing to see that Apple's research and development organization may have failed to get Touch ID embedded into the display. If Apple fails, competitors will pounce If it is true that Apple can't get Touch ID embedded into the display for this year's iPhone 8, then the next opportunity it will have to deliver such integration will be the iPhone that it delivers in the fall of 2018 -- a year later. I believe that in the interim between the iPhone 8 and the 2018 iPhone, there's a solid chance that some of Apple's competitors will release devices with the fingerprint scanner built into the display. Indeed, Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) reportedly wanted to ship such a technology with the Galaxy S8, but the technology wasn't ready. You can bet that Samsung will try again to get this tech integrated into the Galaxy S9, and don't be surprised if the aggressive Chinese smartphone makers like Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo try to do the same on new high-end models, too. If Apple isn't first (or among the first) to deliver this technology, then it will look like a copy-cat rather than a leader, which, given Apple's unfortunate recent history of being late to big paradigm shifts in smartphones (large screens, full-screen display, etc.), wouldn't be a good look at all.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

On March 16, Apple filed a permit for the "full removal of the glass cubical structure at the Apple Store entrance," which, according to BuildZoom, was granted on April 17. The removal of the cube will cost Apple $2 million, and according to a second source, could commence on May 9. Apple is planning to expand its Fifth Avenue store to double the size of the original location. The store is growing from 32,000 square feet to 77,000 square feet, giving Apple more space at its flagship New York location. It is not yet clear what Apple is planning to do with the cube. It could be temporarily removed to allow for construction underneath, or the company could have bigger cube renovation plans in mind. This will be the second time the cube has been dismantled -- it was torn down in 2011 to allow Apple to reconstruct it from larger, more seamless glass panes. Prior to 2011, the cube was made up of more than 90 glass panes, but the new cube uses just 15. While construction is underway at the new location, Apple has temporarily relocated the store to a nearby empty storefront that formerly housed the FAO Schwarz toy store. Apple has not announced when the new store will be complete, but rumors suggest it will have some notable improvements, including a unique area for a Beats 1 radio station that will enable live in-store Beats 1 broadcasts.

Withings previously promised HomeKit support through its Home Plus camera. Sony A6500 The development comes from a Withings customer service agent who answered a customer inquiry about the upcoming availability of the Home Plus product: Guided by our evolving business strategy, we will not be releasing Home Plus. We remain committed to providing Home with software updates and improvements, however, we no longer have plans for HomeKit compatibility. Based on the response, the decision is likely attributed to Nokia’s ongoing legal dispute with Apple. Nokia acquired Withings just over a year ago, then sued Apple over patent disputes back in December. Apple responded by countersuing Nokia and accusing it of being a patent troll the following day. Apple has also responded to the Nokia lawsuit by removing Withings health products from its stores similar to its decision to remove Bose products during a lawsuit against its Beats subsidiary. Apple also omitted Withings from its comprehensive list of HomeKit partners and compatible accessories earlier this year which is further evidence that the customer service agent’s statement is accurate. Withings did display its HomeKit-comatible video camera product publicly back in January at the Consumer Electronics Show, however, before being omitted from Apple’s HomeKit list. D-Link later beat Withings to market with the first HomeKit video camera. The company also still lists the Home Plus product online, although availability details have been pending for a while. We have reached out to Withings for more information and will update accordingly. Thanks Nikolaj!

According to Bloomberg, Apple is testing an iPhone model with a touchscreen covering the entire front of the device. The report also says while the screen is larger than the iPhone 7 Plus, the overall size of the smartphone is similar to an iPhone 7. The upgraded, higher-end model of the iPhone will also feature more advanced cameras and stainless steel components, says the report. It's one of three iPhones Apple is expected to unveil this fall. Other models of the device could include a curved display. Apple declined to comment on the report. Since first launching in 2007, the iPhone has become Apple's signature device, and this year's launch could mark a rebound in sales after a slump last year.  In January, Apple reported posting strong sales of the iPhone in the first quarter, ending a three-quarter streak of declining shipments. That should improve once Apple rolls out its anniversary editions of the iPhone later this year. Follow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.

The city of Beijing’s Cyberspace Administration is summoning Apple to ask that it subject Chinese news and live-streaming services to more stringent app reviews to ensure they conform to regulations, the agency said Tuesday in a statement on its WeChat social media account. Local operators Toutiao, Huoshanzhibo and Huajiao have failed to comply with legal requirements, the agency said. All three offer apps on the Chinese edition of Apple’s App Store. “These services lack rules on verifying information, dealing with emergency situations and guaranteeing their technology,” the regulator said. “They also have significant loopholes in supervising live-streaming content, managing viewers, verifying the identities of users and dealing with complaints from the public.” Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Sign Up Unlike Alphabet Inc.’s Google, whose Play Store for mobile apps is banned in China, Apple’s App Store is open to Chinese consumers and helped drive surging sales growth from services in 2016. Yet Apple has encountered mounting resistance from Chinese regulators. It was forced to shutter its iTunes Movies and iBooks services last year, just six months after they were first permitted to operate, and lost a series of patent and trademark disputes to little known Chinese rivals. In return, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has sought to improve Apple’s standing in China with a series of investments. He is opening new research and development facilities in the country, and bought a $1 billion stake in Didi Chuxing, China’s biggest ride-hailing service. China announced new regulations for mobile developers last year which required them to verify users’ identities with information such as mobile phone numbers, as well as to monitor and report postings that contained banned contents to the relevant authorities. App makers have to keep a record of user logs for 60 days, the rules stipulated. When developers submit their product to the App Store, they are subjected to a review process that evaluates quality and tries to ensure there are no bugs. China’s State Administration of Radio, Film and Television already requires approval for new mobile games for the App Store, Sina reported in June. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Those that take up the challenge and spend 30 minutes outside on Saturday will earn a special achievement award and several exclusive iMessage stickers. “Get outside and celebrate Earth Day on April 22 and earn this award,” says the company in a notification that started appearing for Apple Watch users this week. “Go for a walk, run, cycle, wheelchair or swim workout of 30 minutes or more in the Workout app or any third-party app that writes these workouts to Health. You will also earn special stickers for Messages.” Below are the stickers that unlock when users complete the challenge. Apple is not the only tech company marking Earth Day this year. Ahead of the annual awareness event, Google launched an updated version of Earth, its satellite imaging app, that features an impressive new 3D mode.

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals Apple to slash royalty payments to GPU designer Imagination by two-thirds Christian Zibreg on April 19, 2017 4 As Apple is winding down its supply deal with UK-based GPU designer Imagination Technologies over the next two years, a new report alleges that the Cupertino firm is about to slash payments to Imagination to just one-third of its current royalty rate. Reuters cited UBS analysts as predicting that Imagination could very easily become a loss-making company by fiscal 2019 without any Apple royalty contributions. The British GPU designer may even have to axe jobs and consider other potential cost-cutting moves in order to weather the storm ahead. Imagination is currently in talks with Apple on a new shorter-term licensing deal. UBS analysts caution that the iPhone maker is likely to ratchet down the royalty rate it currently pays to Imagination of around $0.30 to closer to $0.10 per iPhone unit. This is about the same what Imagination typically charges customers like MediaTek. Imagination is among suppliers that depend on Apple for more than half of their revenues. Such a drastic royalty rate reduction is a huge blow to Imagination—especially given Apple is Imagination’s biggest customer accounting for more than half of its licensing revenues. Chart via Statista. Imagination recently said Apple would stop using its GPU blueprints within 15 to 24 months. The development caused Imagination’s stock to lose nearly two thirds of its value in a single day. Analysts are now unsure if the company can survive the fallout with Apple. The Cupertino firm informed Imagination that it’s been working on a separate, independent graphics design. Apple’s explanation for severing ties with Imagination in the next two years: it wants to reduce its future reliance on Imagination’s technology. The UK firm reported revenue of more than £120 million (or approximately $150 million) in the year leading up to April 2016. Tim Cook & Co. are not ditching Imagination to save money. Licensing cost related to Imagination’s PowerVR GPU blueprints used in Apple’s A-series chips is less than $100 million annually, so there’s that. Apple was probably unhappy with Imagination’s roadmap and its tile-based deferred rendering technique so it decided to build its own radically new GPU technology from scratch. An Apple-designed GPU could incorporate modern features for photorealistic images, such as ray tracing rendering with real-time shadows, reflections and other effects. Imagination threatened to sue Apple if it proceeds with the development of in-house GPUs. Source: Reuters Tagged: Apple Chips GPU Graphics Imagination Technologies Licensing News Reuters Semiconductors MORE FROM iDB Apple is developing its own GPU chips Apple hires COO and engineers from iPhone graphics provider Imagination Technologies Apple renews contract with its mobile GPU provider, Imagination Technologies JohnS “Imagination threatened to sue Apple if it proceeds with the development of in-house GPUs” Is there some contract that says Apple can’t make GPUs or what possible reason is there for Imagination to sue a customer who is dissatisfied with their roadmap for leaving? Sounds like we’re missing part of the story here. Christian Zibreg As I wrote in my original article, Imagination is basically asserting that it would be impossible for Apple to create a custom GPU from scratch without violating its patents, intellectual property and confidential information. More here http://www.idownloadblog.com/2017/04/03/apple-ends-gpu-contract-with-imagination-as-it-looks-to-develop-custom-graphics-chips/ iByron This ends badly for imagination. Steve__S Apple should just wait until they are at death’s door and they just buy them for their existing patent portfolio and call it a day. They could do so for just such a small amount of money as is.

Your iPhone keeps track of where you've been and stores that information on a map buried deep in your phone's settings. To find this map, open your phone's settings and choose privacy, then select location services. At the bottom of the list is 'system services', and toward the bottom of that screen is a tab marked "frequent locations." If it is turned on, and it probably is unless you've gone in and turned it off, all of your most-frequented addresses and places are plotted out on a map, categorized by city. The entries seem to be limited to the past 3 months but lists the days you were there, the time of day you arrived and when you left. Apple says the information is used to learn places that are significant to you in order to provide personalized services such as predictive traffic routing. Apple also states that the data is kept solely on your device and isn't sent to Apple without your permission. If it still creeps you out a bit, you can turn it off by toggling the frequent locations tab. From what we were able to gather, you won't be inconvenienced by turning it off and won't lose any functionality with maps and direction. You can also keep frequent locations turned on and clear the map of your frequent locations from time to time. Apple isn't the only company keeping a record of your frequently visited places, Google keeps an eye on where you've been with its own map whether you're using an iPhone or Android device. × Post a comment as Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Image Source: AP/REX/Shutterstock iPhone 8 hype is getting out of hand Chris Mills @chrisfmills April 18th, 2017 at 3:49 PM Share Tweet Look, the iPhone 8 is probably going to be a really great smartphone. Recent advances in technology are making no-bezel smartphones with zero physical buttons a reality; add that to steady increases in power, battery life and camera tech, and it’s safe to say that the iPhone 8 (or whatever it ends up being called) will be the most pleasurable six-inch device that anyone’s ever fondled. But the hype train is getting a little silly. It’s only Tuesday, but we’ve already had two analyst notes come out that project Apple shares going to stratospheric new highs, based mostly off an assumption that the iPhone 8 will be the second coming of Steve Jobs. Don't Miss: 5 ways the iPhone 7 is better than the Galaxy S8 According to MarketWatch, Credit Suisse has increased its stock price target for Apple to $170. The shares are trading for $141 today. RBC Capital Markets also has its estimate up this week, to $157. The market consensus target price — basically a best guess from a bunch of analysts — is $150 right now. The strange thing is that Apple’s current stock price, and these bloated estimates, are all riding on some kind of magical iPhone 8 launch. Apple’s stock was trading at around $115 in October last year, shortly after Apple launched the iPhone 7. Since then, nothing has actually happened for Apple’s market cap to increase by $140 billion — that’s billion with a B! — apart from rumors about a mystical new phone. Going off what we know now, the iPhone 8 (or iPhone Edition, or iPhone X) will have a zero-bezel display, some kind of fingerprint reader hidden under the glass, a dual-camera setup and possibly an iris sensor. That all sounds expensive, which is a real problem for the analysts and their sky-high estimates. The reason Apple does so well profit-wise compared to Android manufacturers isn’t just that it can sell in bulk — it’s that it makes crazy profits on every single iPhone it sells. It can do that thanks to negotiating good prices with suppliers, but it also just doesn’t spend as much on parts as other manufacturers. But if the rumors are true, the iPhone 8 will be far more expensive to produce than any previous iPhone. So, Apple will either have to take a bite out of its own profit margins (anathema to investors), or raise the price of the iPhone 8, potentially even to $1,000. Looking at Apple’s stock target price, it looks like investors are banking on the iPhone 8’s features to drive millions of people to upgrade. If the price is that high, you can bet that sales will be lower than expected, and in turn, Apple’s profits won’t be so high. I’m not even remotely trying to say that the iPhone 8 will be a flop. But in the last six months, based off supply-chain rumors and hype, Apple’s somehow become $140 billion more valuable. Maybe we should just wait a little.

Share Tweet Share Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ A mock-up of what the iPhone 8 may end up looking like According to some new information, Apple could pipe the Touch ID component of its next-gen iPhone onto the rear of the device. A move that would see Cupertino follow both Google and Samsung with their most recent flagship handsets, the switch would mark a departure from the long-standing, below-screen arrangement. One of the reasons why Samsung switched the fingerprint authentication hardware from the front of the device was to facilitate the new Infinity Display. It's believed the Korean company wanted to have the feature baked into the display of the Galaxy S8 series, but couldn't quite get the requisite tech ready in time. As such, the S8 and S8+ sport fingerprint scanners alongside the main cameras.  Apple has faced difficulties in trying to integrate its Touch ID fingerprint reading system into the iPhone 8's OLED displayMeanwhile, Apple has apparently been trying to pull the same stunt of splicing Touch ID and the new OLED display of the iPhone 8. As with Sammy, though, things haven't gone as smoothly as predicted, prompting one analyst to suggest that the special edition handset to mark the iPhone's 10th year may even be delayed. As our married readers will attest, you can't really push an anniversary back and instead, the fruit company may simply relocate Touch ID to the back of the iPhone 8's body.   As a refresher, Apple is expected to roll out a landmark iPhone 8 this year alongside the to-be-expected iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. The iPhone 8 will supposedly get that aforementioned OLED display -- curved edge, no less -- and if it is ready by Apple's traditional September announcement period, it'll surely offer a few more perks over the 7s series. Indeed, the new schematics leak by resident Apple informant Sonny Dickson offers one or two clues as to what else may be in store.  Purported iPhone 8 schematic drawing shows where the Touch ID sensor may reside As you'll notice in the image above, the rear-facing camera duo is arranged vertically as opposed the horizontal configuration of the iPhone 7 Plus, while the repositioned Touch ID sits below the Apple logo. The schematics also offer an idea as to the measurements of the iPhone 8. If they're correct, the handset will be around half a centimeter wider and a centimeter longer than the existing iPhone 7. Rumor has it that the iPhone 8 will boast a 5.8-inch screen, though, so for that slight increase in overall footprint, users will potentially gain more than an inch of display real estate over the current 4.7-inch handset. Not bad.  For now, this is only a drawing, and may just be a contingency plan should the embedded Touch ID gig not work out. Given Apple's affinity to seamlessness -- and the potential bonus of rolling out a feature Samsung couldn't prepare in time -- it's very likely that the firm will take the embedded route if at all possible. Given the reports of low yields, though, Apple could play it safe and move Touch ID from front to back. What do you think -- would you welcome this change for a potentially more favorable screen-to-body ratio?

Looking at the measurements something doesn't seem accurate. If it is a 5.8 inch screen, without top bezel (like S8) shouldnt it be shorter than the S8? And if this is supposedly the "plus" model it would be wider... Something isn't adding up fo me... Of course I'm not really crunching numbers right now just browsing around and saw that this looks off. posted on yesterday, 11:24 0 Reply 2. UglyFrank (Posts: 1852; Member since: 23 Jan 2014) According to rumours, this device will have the earpiece/sensor section as part of the screen instead of as a bezel posted on yesterday, 11:33 2 Reply 4. bobby84 (Posts: 398; Member since: 13 May 2016) No what he is says is that the iphone is .50mm taller than the s8 and the s8 has a top and bottom bezel. If the screen will be 5.7 or 5.8 inches, this would imply it has bigger bezels. Unless the small screen comes form the bezel on the sizes. posted on yesterday, 11:41 1 in response to #4 in response to #4 Hide Reply 5. nctx77 (Posts: 2245; Member since: 03 Sep 2013) If you look at the old renderings of this prototype, it looked like the G6.

Bankz (Posts: 1177; Member since: 08 Apr 2016) Theres no way the iphone will put their fps on the back tbh.. Are they trying to tell us that they couldnt get it right since late last year? Even If they dont put it, then it will be on purpose but not for lack of readiness. Btw, theres nothing new to see here as this is still a probability. posted on yesterday, 13:02 7 Reply 10. Cyberchum (Posts: 691; Member since: 24 Oct 2012) “Even If they dont put it, then it will be on purpose but not for lack of readiness.” So you are saying they would never hit a wall there, just like Samsung did, because it's APPLE. Must be fun being a fanboy. posted on yesterday, 13:53 1 Reply 14. TechieXP1969 (Posts: 12889; Member since: 25 Sep 2013) You would think. But then again, the iPhone 7+ has a 5.5" display and the Galaxy S7 edge, the Galaxy Note 5, and Galaxy S6 edge+ all have a 5.7" display and yet the iPhone 7 Plus is taller than all of them, even with a smaller display. OS yes logically you would right. But this is after all, Apple we are talkign about. Their design engineers are lazy and stupid. After all, how did they make the iPhone 6 Plus and not shore up the design to prevent bending?! posted on yesterday, 13:58 1 Reply 15. TechieXP1969 (Posts: 12889; Member since: 25 Sep 2013) First off you have no idea how hard it is to make the tech work. How can you question how long somethign takes? Many compoennets takes "years" to get them to work correctly. You know why Force Touch isn't on Android phones? It's because there is a driver issue with the concept. Apple srtuggled with it too, which is why its ha;lf-baked. Facts that you can Google, showed that Apple had its with its own version of Force Touch and asked/paid Synaptics to fix the issues with the driver. They couldn't and is why Apple really hasn't broaden out the capabilities of the concept. It is also why Synaptics hasn't provided it to OEM's. You don't get to dictate how fast or slow a tech becomes available. How about this, we don;'t want it unless it works and is useful. posted on yesterday, 14:02 1 in response to #10 in response to #10 Hide Reply 16. TechieXP1969 (Posts: 12889; Member since: 25 Sep 2013) Don't mind him, he's technologically stupid and ignorant. He has no idea how hard it is to develop tech that is big and make it small and have it work the same on such a small device. Just remember some of these facts. IBM once had drives that took up a whole wrong and weight more than several men. How long do you think it took for any company to take that tech, and make it fit into a book sized device. Computers once took up whole room. Now we have one sthat ate 1000's of times more powerful on your desk and in yoru pockets. How long did it take for tech to progress ot this point? Bankz is a stupid moron. Hey Bankz, if you have the answer an can make it work right now, get hired by Apple and get rich.

That looks very much like a wireless charging port. That thing is dead center of the phone! It doesn't make sense as a FPS. How do you reach it with one hand? How do you put the haptic engine under it being near the battery? It just doesn't add up! posted on yesterday, 14:56 5 Reply 19. TechieXP1969 (Posts: 12889; Member since: 25 Sep 2013) You don't need a port for wireless charging...lol. Wireless charging is a magnetic coil that is inside the phone. Not a port.

Actually, with the S8 getting glowing reviews everywhere (except PA which reserves the highest marks for only Apple products), something has to be done by PA to bring attention back to the (months away) iPhone and pretend that due to the EXPECTED/SPECULATED features of iPhone 8, iPhone 7 plus somehow becomes better. posted on yesterday, 12:56 1 Reply 9. darkkjedii (Posts: 23384; Member since: 05 Feb 2011) That mockup is not impressive, please don't do that Apple.

That said, if by chance it does come out this year, I rather like it on the back because I can pick it up with one hand and use it in the same hand. With front facing I tend to pick it up with my right hand, unlock it, and then place it in my right hand before using the phone. posted on yesterday, 22:52 0 Reply 25. omnitech (Posts: 445; Member since: 28 Sep 2016) Sorry in the last paragraph it should read pick it up with my right hand and unlock it but rather than just shift the phone to a better grip with one hand I just put it on my left hand after unlocking it. So back is generally better because you never have to change grips or change hands to use it after unlocking it. posted on yesterday, 20:41 0 Reply 24. ibend (Posts: 6258; Member since: 30 Sep 2014) "APPLE HAS FACED DIFFICULTIES IN TRYING TO INTEGRATE ITS TOUCH ID FINGERPRINT READING SYSTEM INTO THE IPHONE 8'S OLED DISPLAY" they didnt face any of this difficulties... other manufacturers is the one that trying to integrate it, and apple simply buying the component from them view all comments Want to comment?

Forbes reported Wednesday the company apparently is more interested in developing apps for self-driving cars than the cars themselves. The California Department of Motor Vehicles granted permits for Apple to test three 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs. Industry analysts say the fact that only three vehicles are involved suggests Apple is focusing on its CarPlay connectivity and infotainment platform, Forbes said. CarPlay already has a significant portion of the vehicle market. Read: California Lawmaker Comes Up With Penalties For Permitless Testing Of New Technology “Three cars and six drivers is so small you couldn’t even really be pursuing sensor tests,” Eric Noble, president of the CarLab, an industry consultant in Orange, California, told Forbes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released its autonomous vehicle guidelines last year, suggesting it should be up to the federal government to certify safety and leaving the states responsible for licensing and registration. Portland, Oregon, became the latest city this week to express interest in allowing companies to operate robotic vehicles within its borders. Read: Boston Next City To Test Autonomous Vehicles; Pittsburgh Testing Driverless Ubers "We can't simply dismiss the idea that autonomous vehicles are going to be a big part of our transportation system. Instead of waiting for this new technology to come here and have us confront it, the responsible thing to do is to prepare for this future," Mayor Ted Wheeler said. Thirty companies already are testing autonomous vehicles in California, with Google sibling Waymo testing 79 of its 100 vehicles in California alone and GM’s Cruise unit testing 27. Tesla has 24 vehicles registered in California. Apple reportedly sees more profit in apps for self-driving cars than in the vehicles themselves. Above, Waymo autonomous vehicle in Mountain View, California, Feb 24, 2017. Photo: Grendelkhan/Creative Commons Waymo, which is planning to add 100 Chrysler minivans to its fleet, also is in talks to supply Honda with a system. Cruise is eyeing a ride-hailing service using perhaps thousands of robotic cars beginning next year. Part of the reason Apple may leave the vehicles themselves to others is the relatively paltry profit margin on new vehicles, about 7 percent compared to the 23 percent for Apple’s iPhones, iPads and Macs. CarPlay was released in 2014 and integrates with iPhone functions. It is available on most brands of new cars. “We do expect Apple to focus on developing the technology hardware/software rather than manufacturing its own autonomous car. However, at this point Apple remains behind Google in this arena,” Angelo Zino, an equity analyst for CFRA Research, told Forbes. “While the margins of producing a car are much lower, we believe that developing the content within the vehicle will have significantly better margins.” Related Stories Apple Will Start Testing Self-Driving Cars In California Cadillac To Unveil Super Cruise This Fall Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

That’s good news for Apple because Facebook just set bar for what the average user will expect, and it very likely plays into Apple’s own plans for augmented reality on the iPhone. Facebook is jumping into the augmented reality world Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO, shared his company’s plans at the F8 conference inSan Jose on Tuesday. F8 is Facebook’s annual developer conference focusing on the future of technology. Augmented reality refers to adding virtual elements, like text and graphics, to what you’re seeing in real time. Google tried to grab a slice of the market a few years ago with its Google Glass experiment that used glasses to overlay data onto whatever users were looking at. Augmented Reality: Using What You Have Facebook’s augmented reality platform relies on smartphone cameras and screens instead of specialized hardware, like glasses. Users can add virtual notes and stickers to real world objects for other people to see, and it can recognize what’s the camera sees. What Facebook is offering, at least for now, sounds a lot like Snapchat’s World Lenses feature that was introduced yesterday. World Lens lets you add graphics and animations to videos you share—which also sounds a lot like Apple’s new Clips app that launched just a few days ago. Jumping into the augmented reality world like this makes sense because users won’t have to invest in new gear. Removing the money barrier makes it more likely people will try out what Facebook offers. Starting simple is a smart move also keeps users from getting overwhelmed with features and flashy graphics. In essence, Facebook, Snapchat, and Apple are training us today for more sophisticated augmented reality down the road. Facebook isn’t alone in the augmented reality world. Apple CEO Tim Cook said last year his company is very interested in the field. “I think AR is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology,” Cook said during an interview last August. “So, yes, it’s something we’re doing a lot of things on behind that curtain that we talked about.” Apple’s first push into augmented reality will most likely use the iPhone and, like Facebook, will be relatively simple. Before today that could’ve backfired on Apple because users would’ve had different expectations for what they see. Thanks to Facebook, the bar has been set and it’ll be a fairly easy one for Apple to hit. Setting Augmented Reality Expectations Facebook is also teaching users to see augmented reality as a when-you-need-it technology instead of something that’s always there. Pulling our phones out and pointing them at objects creates a very different augmented reality experience compared to wearing glasses. Actively engaging in augmented reality instead of passively experiencing it could slow down mainstream adoption, although that may not be a difficult hurdle to overcome. Pokémon GO is a perfect example of embracing augmented reality, and it’s something both Apple and Facebook no doubt have watched closely. Pokémon GO is a game that gets people outside to hunt and catch virtual creatures. It uses your smartphone’s built in camera and display to superimpose characters onto whatever you’re looking at so it appears as if they’re really in front of you. Pokémon GO gives a fun look into augmented reality Smartphone owners flocked to the game in droves and public areas were filled with people wandering around looking for creatures to catch. The game is still popular nearly a year into its launch, but there aren’t as many people walking around with their phone in front of their face hunting for Pikachu. Pokémon GO has been a great experiment showing the average smartphone user accepts and understands augmented reality when they get some sort of personal value out of it. In the case of the game, the value was entertainment. Clips: Apple’s Sleeper Augmented Reality App For Apple, the Clips app may be the first overt step into augmented reality. The app lets users add text, graphics, and animations to photos and video in real time. Apple can take what it learns from the way we use Clips to refine its own augmented reality plans. Exactly when Apple will announce its augmented reality plans is still a mystery. We could get an announcement at June’s Worldwide Developer Conference event that’s—coincidentally—at the same venue as Facebook’s F8 conference. It’s a safe bet we’ll get a look at iOS 11 for the iPhone and iPad, and that would be a perfect time to also talk about augmented reality. Apple’s new social media app Clips may also be an augmented reality push Augmented reality needs the support of third party app developers, which is why Facebook used F8 to show off its new platform. Apple could do the same at WWDC so developers can start preparing to roll augmented reality into their apps ahead of iOS 11’s fall launch. Until then, Apple should send Facebook a fruit basket as a thank you for setting user expectations at a more realistic level. Teaching users today that augmented reality is fairly basic means they’re less likely to be disappointed, which leads to easier adoption, and ultimately more sophisticated features in the future.

NEW DELHI: Samsung expects to mount a stiff challenge with its latest Galaxy S8 and S8+ models for the top slot in India's premium segment led by rival Apple, hoping that it has been able to erase the memories of its Galaxy Note 7 debacle which had hurt its branding and market share. Analysts, though, are divided about the prospects of the success of Samsung's latest devices, with one section pointing to the pent-up demand for the company's premium devices, while the other saying Apple has already taken up most of the share of the addressable market in the segment. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ devices, being made in India, goes on sale through offline retail stores and through Flipkart and Samsung's own online store from May 5. "That (Note 7 debacle) is behind us," Asim Warsi, senior vice-president, mobile business, Samsung India, told ET, stressing that quality was the main focus for the global and Indian market leader. He said sales of S8 and S8+ "will result in significant market share gains," with the S8+, which has a larger screen, expected to draw more demand. iPhone-maker Apple leads India's premium segment with a 56% share, as per preliminary Counterpoint Research data for January to March, with Samsung trailing with 40%. The Korean company, though, still leads the overall phone and smartphone segments in the world's second largest market after China. The Galaxy Note 7 global recall last October after incidents of battery explosions meant Samsung wasn't even able to launch the much-touted device in India, meaning S7 was its last flagship launched a year back. The company saw Apple replace it at the top of the premium segment rankings in the October-December quarter and stay there in the January-March period as well. Samsung's share dropped from a high of 58% in September to 31% in the quarter ended December 2016. But "there is pent-up demand for Samsung devices rolling over from last year due to the disappearance of Note 7. We estimate Samsung to lead the premium segment in April-June and July-September of this year with strong S8 momentum," said Tarun Pathak, associate director at Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research. The firm expects global shipments to exceed 50 million by 2017 end, higher than that of Galaxy S7. Cybermedia Research's Faizal Kawoosa though wasn't upbeat, saying Samsung's new flagship will receive a lukewarm response since a large part of the market had already been taken by Apple. "In January and February, our estimates show that Apple has cornered 80% of above `50,000 market, and Samsung is only 18%, which can be due to iPhone 7 and the absence of Samsung's other models," he said.

The new feature rollout will include listings for bike rental hubs in three cities around the world as well. Sony A6500 Apple tells Bloomberg that the new features for Apple Maps in Europe come as part of a partnership with Munich-based Cirrantic’s Moovility service. Bike rental hubs will appear in Apple Maps for users in London, New York, and Paris as well: It has also added public bicycle rental and drop-off points to maps of London, New York and Paris in a catch-up to long-time mobile navigation leader Google, which has listed such stations in multiple countries for some time. Apple laid out its updates to Maps in a briefing in London Wednesday. The new eco-friendly features happen to coincide with Earth Day this Saturday which Apple is acknowledging with a special Apple Watch Activity Challenge and Apple Store event with former U.S. Vice President Al Gore. In the short term, the new feature rollout to Apple Maps keep the service competitive with Google Maps and benefits Tesla owners and other EV drivers. If Apple’s so-called Project Titan effort to create an electric vehicle of its own materializes, however, the move could be considered groundwork for an essential part of the overall experience. Apple’s effort is said to be focused on developing self driving software for now, however, with the company being permitted to begin testing publicly in California last week.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Samsung Galaxy S8 review: Meet the envy of every iPhone user Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Zach Epstein @zacharye April 18th, 2017 at 11:00 AM Share Tweet I have to be perfectly honest with you… I never thought this day would come. When Samsung released its first Galaxy phone back in 2009, it was clear that the company would become a contender in the revitalized smartphone market. When it released the first Galaxy Note smartphone two years later in 2011, it was clear that Samsung wasn’t afraid to take chances. And when Samsung released the Galaxy S4 in 2013, it was clear that the company’s displays would be the best in the industry for years to come. But something else was clear during all that time. Despite Samsung’s willingness to take countless pages out of Apple’s playbook, the company’s hardware designs were still sorely lacking. The look of Samsung’s phones was boring. The thin plastic backs felt cheap and flimsy. Long story short, Samsung smartphones looked and felt like cheap iPhone knockoffs. Now, in 2017, the new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ mark a changing of the guard. The torch has been passed. The student has become the teacher. Call it whatever you want, but the bottom line is this: Samsung has out-designed Apple with its new flagship smartphones. They look and feel like the future, and Apple’s three-year-old iPhone design is stuck in the past. Samsung’s transition began in 2015 when the company released the Galaxy S6. It was the first flagship phone from the South Korean electronics giant that looked and felt like a flagship phone. The smooth glass front and back were joined by a sturdy aluminum mid-frame, and there were only a few small pieces of plastic on the phone’s exterior — the small strips that separated each section of the aluminum frame, and the home button. It was official: Samsung was a premium smartphone maker. The company’s flagship Galaxy S and Galaxy Note handsets have always featured cutting-edge specs. They have always offered terrific performance that was on par with the best Android phones in the business. And they have always had stunning displays with vivid colors and great contrast. Now, starting with the Galaxy S6, they also featured designs to match. But still, few people would argue that the company’s phones looked as sleek or felt as premium as Apple’s iPhones. Until now, that is. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR In terms of hardware design, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are the complete package. They’re industry leaders in terms of specs, as Samsung’s flagship phones always have been. They also feature Super AMOLED screens that are unrivaled. Again, this has been the norm for Samsung for years. But the biggest story in terms of Samsung’s growth as a smartphone maker is the design. Samsung has always been a follower, ever since it released its first smartphone nearly a decade ago. But now, Samsung is a leader. In fact, diehard Apple fans have been unable to find anything to complain about, so some of them have resorted to insignificant nonsense like the alignment of the USB-C port and speaker openings on the bottom of the phone. While it’s true that Apple’s alignment on the bottom of the iPhone 6/6s/7 is perfect, I’m not sure there’s a sane end user on the planet who would actually care about something like this. But it’s indicative of the difference between Samsung and Apple when it comes to attention to detail! Perhaps. Or perhaps Samsung decided it was more important to squeeze in the phone’s internal components as tightly as possible so that it could create a design with a remarkable screen-to-body ratio of 83%. Trust me, Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ users are going to appreciate the narrow bezels around the Infinity Display far more than any iPhone user appreciates his or her perfectly aligned ports. Also of note, Samsung managed to make its new flagship phones IP68 water-resistant without removing the 3.5mm headphone jack, misaligned though it may be. Speaking of screen-to-body ratios, welcome to the next smartphone battleground. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR First, it was specs. Then, after Apple introduced the Retina Display, it was pixels. Now, beginning in 2017, it’s bezels. Every top smartphone vendor in the world is hard at work shrinking the bezels on their flagship phones so that the screen takes up as much of the phone’s face as possible. Is doing away with bezels on smartphones really that important? In a word, yes. Apart from being crucial to upcoming advances in augmented reality, barely-there bezels like the ones surrounding the Galaxy S8 display allow for a much more immersive user experience. Distractions fade away and content becomes the sole focus. Why do you think Apple has never included a logo or anything else that might be distracting on the faces of its iPhones? It’s because when someone is using his or her phone, the content on the screen is all matters. The 83% screen-to-body ratio on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ is the best in the business among top-tier global smartphone makers right now. By comparison, the three-year-old iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus design has a screen-to-body ratio of 66%. As I wrote in an earlier opinion piece, using the iPhone after having used the Galaxy S8 feels like going back to a tube TV after having upgraded to a flat-screen. On the flip side, Samsung had to remove its physical home button from the Galaxy S8 and S8+ in order to achieve such an impressive screen-to-body ratio, and the company tried its best to copy Apple with its new virtual home button. It failed. The virtual home button on Samsung’s new phones is pressure sensitive, similar to Apple’s 3D Touch home button on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple’s solution utilizes advanced pressure sensors coupled with a Taptic Engine to make pressing the virtual home button on an iPhone feel and sound like pressing a real button. On the Galaxy S8, pressing the home button feels like pressing a plain old touchscreen, and presses are accompanied by the same weak vibration feedback you’d find on any other phone. It might seem like an insignificant detail, but it’s not. As we move further toward phones that don’t have any buttons at all, advanced haptic feedback systems can make flat glass feel like a button. Apple has a huge head start in this area, and it will be quite some time before other companies catch up. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Like the LG G6, Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ both feature screens with a tall 18:9 aspect ratio. As a result, it’s difficult to compare their sizes to other smartphones. For example, the 5.8-inch display on the smaller Galaxy S8 is technically bigger than the screen on Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus phablet, but Apple’s screen is wider than the one on the S8. Long story short, diagonal measurements no longer tell the whole story. What matters is that both new Galaxy S8 models have nice big displays that are simply unrivaled right now. They both feature Quad HD+ (2960 x 1440) resolution, so the 5.8-inch screen on the Galaxy S8 has a pixel density of 570 ppi while the Galaxy S8+ has a 6.2-inch screen with 529 ppi. On paper, it’s a fairly big discrepancy. In reality, it’s difficult to notice a difference in most scenarios. What matters is regardless of which model you end up with, you’ll hold in your hand the finest smartphone display that has ever existed. As was the case with the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7, the sides of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are curved on both the front and the back. The phones are each about the same width as comparable smartphone models from other vendors, but the curved sides help them sit more comfortably in the hand because they feel narrower. They also feel much thinner than they are thanks to the curves, though widths of 8mm for the Galaxy S8 and 8.1mm for the Galaxy S8+ aren’t very thick even without the curves on either side. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Inside, the US versions of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are both powered by Qualcomm’s new 10nm octa-core Snapdragon 835 chipset, which marries a 2.3GHz quad for heavy lifting with a 1.7GHz quad for everything else. When they are released on Friday, April 21st, they’ll be the first widely available smartphones in the world to feature 10nm chips, which should offer advantages both in terms of power and efficiency. You’ll also find 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM in Samsung’s new flagships, along with 64GB of UFS 2.1 flash storage and microSDXC support. I can vouch for the Snapdragon 835’s performance. Everyone has seen the benchmarks by now, but that’s only part of the story. Everything on the Galaxy S8 feels faster than on rival Android phones, from opening apps, to switching apps, to using apps. It really does feel turbocharged. In my testing over the past few days, I have yet to find anything that can trip up the phone’s performance in any meaningful way. Unfortunately, I cannot vouch for any gains in power efficiency that might be afforded by the Snapdragon 835 or any other optimizations Samsung has made in the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Samsung delivered my review unit just this past Friday, and my usage while testing the phone is obviously nothing like average usage on a day-to-day basis. Normally when I review phones, I like to beat them up with heavy testing for a couple of days and then use them normally so I can communicate real-world battery performance. What I can say about the batteries in Samsung’s new phones is that they refuel quickly. I tested Samsung’s standard fast charging via USB-C as well as its wireless fast charging, and both methods were fast to fill up the phone. As long as they don’t explode, Samsung appears to have done a fine job with the batteries in the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. I believe either phone will carry a person through a full day of average usage, and they charge up very quickly to minimize the hassle on days with heavy usage. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR When Samsung confirmed that the rear camera on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ would be the same 12-megapixel Dual Pixel camera found on the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 edge, and Galaxy Note 7, I saw a number of bloggers and smartphone enthusiasts complain online. On one hand, I can certainly see where they’re coming from — no mobile camera is perfect, so we’re used to seeing camera tech improve with each new generation of smartphone. But on the other hand, Samsung’s Dual Pixel camera is easily one of the best in the business. In some lighting it is the best, hands down. It’s difficult to complain about such a solid smartphone camera. Samsung says that it has made some changes to the rear camera on the software side, though I really haven’t noticed much of a difference in my testing. The Galaxy S7 captured great photos, the Galaxy S7 edge captured great photos, the Galaxy Note 7 captured great photos, and now the Galaxy S8 and S8+ capture great photos. What’s not so great, however, is the rear-mounted fingerprint scanner next to the camera on the back of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. The back of a phone is an awful, awful place for a fingerprint scanner. Even after you’ve spent months with a phone and you know it like the back of your hand, unlocking a smartphone with a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner means blindly sliding your finger around the back before finding the scanner. It’s bad enough on phones with scanners that are placed on the center of the back, and it’s even worse with the Galaxy S8’s fingerprint reader, which is high up the back and off-center next to the camera lens. Side note: Thanks to Samsung’s scanner placement, your rear camera lens will always be covered with plenty of oil from your finger. Speaking of oil, the rear glass panel on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is not treated with an oleophobic coating like the front, so prepare for a permanent layer of grease and grime unless you plan to use a case. Of course, this issue will be familiar to anyone who has owned a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S6. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR The positioning of the fingerprint scanner is, without question, a poor design choice. Complaining about misaligned charging ports is stupid, but the scanner placement is a very valid complaint, and I would wager that Samsung’s own design team would agree. Rumor has it the company wanted to embed the fingerprint reader in the display itself, like Apple is rumored to be doing, but Samsung and its parts suppliers couldn’t find a way to make it work in time for mass production. If fumbling around for a fingerprint scanner doesn’t sound appealing, there are plenty of other ways to unlock your Galaxy S8. Beyond PINs, patterns, and passcodes, the S8 and S8+ also support iris scanning and facial recognition. The latter isn’t terribly secure since it has already been discovered that it can be fooled with a photo. The iris scanner is a bit more secure, but it can also be inconvenient since you have to swipe over from the lock screen by default before the phone will scan your eyes. This was done to avoid accidental unlocks when the user is trying to read notifications or check other lock screen content, which certainly makes sense. If you don’t can about seeing lock screen content, you can configure the phone so that you don’t need to swipe to scan your irises. But you obviously still have to hold the phone out in front of you and position it so that your eyes are in the alignment circles that appear at the top of the screen. It’ll never be as quick as a fingerprint scan. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Moving inside the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, you’ll find a newly refined software experience. As is the case with the Galaxy S8 hardware, the company’s “Samsung Experience” software in 2017 is its best yet. Each year, Samsung continues to strip away more and more clutter, moving ever closer to a stock Android experience. Closer, yes, but make no mistake — there’s nothing stock about the Android build on Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+. The first thing you’ll notice about Samsung’s software on the Galaxy S8 is that it’s fast. Very, very fast. Hardcore Android fans were upset when they found out that a special upgraded Galaxy S8 with 6GB of RAM would be made available in some Eastern markets and not in the US, but I can assure you that the Snapdragon 835 and 4GB of RAM provide more than enough oomph and memory to keep things humming along. From news readers, Twitter and email apps to media streaming apps, 3D games and more, the Galaxy S8+ powered through all my tests without a hiccup. Long story short, it can handle anything a user might throw its way. I had videos streaming in half of Samsung’s multi-window layout while I was loading large web pages in the other half, and again, not a single stutter or stammer to speak of. Apart from a few Android oddities here and there — seriously, is Google EVER going to get scroll physics right?! — the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ offer the smoothest experience you’ll find on a Google-powered smartphone. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR While some other manufacturers have moved away from developing their own apps when Google already offers, Samsung still insists on holding onto a few dupes. For example, you’ll find Samsung’s Gallery app in addition to the preinstalled Google Photos app, which is clearly superior. Samsung also includes its own web browser in addition to Chrome. While moves like these made precious little sense on older phones, there’s a method to the madness on the Galaxy S8. Using a device that Samsung calls DeX, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ can connect to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse to power a desktop computing experience. Samsung’s apps are optimized for this experience, while third-party apps might not always perform as well in desktop mode. The DeX solution looked impressive when Samsung demoed it briefly for me last month before the Galaxy S8 was announced, but the company didn’t supply a DeX dock with my review phone so I haven’t yet been able to test it myself. Beyond Samsung’s apps, the TouchWiz experience — sorry, Samsung Experience — has been tweaked in a number of areas on the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Some changes are minor, such as the option to swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer. Other changes are more significant, like Samsung’s move to on-screen home, back, and app switcher buttons, an obvious necessity since the physical home button was scrapped. Samsung staples like the Always On Display feature and Samsung’s customization options are all still present on the S8. There’s also an “Advanced features” section in the settings app that provides access to several Samsung-only features. Here are some examples: Smart stay: Eye detection keeps the screen on as long as you’re looking at it Game Launcher: A special launcher that can hold all your games instead of mixing them with apps in the drawer One-handed mode: Swipe up from a corner to shrink the size of the screen so everything can be reached with one hand Finger sensor gestures: Open and close the notification panel by swiping up or down on the fingerprint sensor Quick launch camera: Double-tap the power button to launch the camera Multi window: Open two apps on the screen at the same time Smart alert: This feature makes your phone vibrate when you pick it up and have missed notifications Video enhancer: This setting automatically upscales videos to enhance picture quality There are a bunch of other ones in there, and they vary in their usefulness. Another new addition to the Samsung Experience on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is Bixby. As many people might have already read, however, Bixby is a huge letdown for the time being in the US market. In a nutshell, Samsung’s voice-controlled virtual assistant can’t yet be controlled using one’s voice. The weirdest part about is that there’s a dedicated Bixby button that is supposed to offer two functions. Pressing and holding the Bixby button is supposed to launch the Bixby voice assistant, which is like Siri or Amazon Alexa. At launch, this core Bixby feature won’t actually exist; Samsung has delayed the voice portion of Bixby in the United States. Tapping the button launches the Bixby Home page, which is a collection of cards similar to Google Now. At least, it’s supposed to — the alternate method of accessing Bixby Home (swiping right on the first home screen) is the only method of accessing Bixby Home that actually works on my review unit. So, right now on my review unit, the Bixby button does nothing at all. As it stands now, Bixby Home is Samsung’s answer to Google Now. The interface is the same cascade of cards, and the content therein is similar as well, offering time, location, and context-aware content. One nifty feature that Google doesn’t yet have, however, is Bixby Vision. This is similar to the Firefly feature Amazon introduced on the ill-fated Fire phone. Point the camera at an object and Bixby will offer information and context, if it recognizes the object. Bixby Vision can also offer information about points of interest using the camera and your location, and it can translate printed text in real-time in more than 50 different languages. Bixby could grow into a very useful feature on Samsung phones, but right now it’s painfully incomplete. The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ run Android 7.0 Nougat, however, so they also include the much more complete Google Assistant solution. I certainly plan to revisit Bixby once it’s a more complete product, but Google Assistant is clearly the way to go for the time being. Remember, Siri was a mess as well when it first launched, and now it has evolved into a fantastic tool that millions of iPhone owners use all the time. Give Samsung a while to work through Bixby’s initial growing pains before you dismiss Bixby completely. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Nearly everything about Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ leaked long before the company actually unveiled its new flagship phones last month. We thought there was no way there would be any surprises left. While all the phones’ new features were indeed covered by the leaks and rumors that led up to the unveiling, we were still entirely unprepared for the devices Samsung showed off that day. The fact that Samsung has managed to out-design Apple is nothing short of shocking. The South Korean company has been chasing Apple ever since it first entered the smartphone market, but matching the iPhone in terms of design and build is something I never thought I would see Samsung manage. The company hasn’t just matched Apple’s iPhone design with the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, it has surpassed Apple’s iPhone design. Like anyone else who has been keeping an eye on iPhone 8 rumors, I fully expect Apple to make a strong showing later this year when it unveils its redesigned tenth-anniversary iPhone. There’s a lot of time between now and September, however, and I have a feeling many Apple fans will have some soul-searching to do when they finally get the chance to check out Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ following their release this Friday, April 21st. For Android fans, meanwhile, the Galaxy S8 is a no-brainer unless you absolutely must have stock Android. There are a number of good reasons to stick with stock Android, and the timeliness of operating system updates is at the top of the list. It’s a big tradeoff though, when you consider the power, performance, and beautiful design of the Galaxy S8.

Previously, these apps were “free with new device purchase,” which meant that many but not all Apple device users had them; Apple started bundling the apps with new iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Mac devices in 2013. Now, however, anyone with and iPhone, iPad, iPod touch or Mac can download the apps for free, even if they bought their device before 2013. The change was first spotted by MacRumors and subsequently confirmed by TechCrunch. Download GarageBand, iWork (Pages, Keynote and Numbers) and iMovie from the iTunes App Store.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Lifestyle / Mobile / Apple / Leaked design document shows iPhone 8 Touch ID and camera changes Leaked design document shows iPhone 8 Touch ID and camera changes Matthew Wilson 13 hours ago Apple, Featured Tech News It looks like Apple has settled on a fix for its Touch ID placement problem. Earlier this week, we heard that Apple had been having issues integrating its fingerprint sensor into its new OLED display. To get around this, a newly leaked design document shows Apple moving the Touch ID sensor to the back of the phone, similarly to Android devices like the Galaxy S8 or Google Pixel. Apple’s redesigned iPhone is set to launch later this year, with an OLED display with minimal bezel. With the display covering more of the front of the phone, there was no room left for the Touch ID sensor without moving it or integrating it into the display. iPhone 8 looks to be taking a new direction pic.twitter.com/mG19bcDYiC — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 19, 2017 In the image above, you can see a leaked Apple manufacturing document, which was posted online by Sonny Dickson. The image has spread across the web rather swiftly and if real, shows that Apple is planning to move the Touch ID sensor for this particular iPhone. Aside from the movement of Touch ID, the document also shows that Apple may move to dual vertical cameras, which would be another big departure from previous designs. KitGuru Says: It looks like we are finally starting to get some reliable leaks when it comes to the next iPhone. It’s a shame that Apple couldn’t successfully integrate Touch ID into the display itself but having it on the back may not be such a bad move. After all, plenty of Android phone makers have been doing this for a while.

Sonny Dickson, a serial leaker who has in the past revealed features about Apple products prior to their release, published on Wednesday a schematic he says depicts Apple's next iPhone update. The schematic looks at the inside of the back panel and appears to show an area where dual rear-facing camera lenses are arranged vertically. There's also a hole in the back that Dickson says could be used for the handset's fingerprint sensor. Apple (aapl) has for the last several months been rumored to be working on three new iPhones for this year. Two of those handsets, believed to be called the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, could feature only minor upgrades over last year's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, respectively. The third model—which could be called the iPhone 8, iPhone X, or iPhone Edition—is also believed to be in the works. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter The rumors suggest the iPhone 8, which Dickson refers to in his leak, could come with a screen that nearly entirely covers the face of the device. Apple is also reportedly planning a glass backplate that would be separated from the glass face with a steel spine. While it's unknown whether the schematic Dickson published is the real thing or a fake, it follows some of the rumors surrounding Apple's handset. Most notably, Apple is said to be considering modifying its dual rear camera layout by shifting from the horizontal orientation it used in the iPhone 7 Plus to a vertical one in the next handset. iPhone 8 looks to be taking a new direction pic.twitter.com/mG19bcDYiC- Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 19, 2017 Additionally, Apple's rumored design choice to reduce the size of the bezels around the iPhone's screen would mean there would no longer be room for a physical home button under the display. Apple is reportedly considering a virtual fingerprint sensor that would be baked into the device's screen, allowing users to press their fingers to the display to unlock the device. However, some reports have suggested Apple might opt for a physical fingerprint sensor. The hole in the back of the panel in the schematic could be that feature. But as with anything else Apple-related, the schematic needs to be taken with a proverbial grain of salt. Apple hasn't even said it's working on a new iPhone, let alone features that would be coming to such a device. Apple is rumored to be planning to unveil its next iPhone in late summer.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « China Cracks down on Three Chinese Live Streaming Websites and Apple is next for Questioning by Authorities | Main | Indian Officials Claim that Wistron will begin manufacturing iPhones for India in May » April 19, 2017 New Apple Maps rolled out in Europe Include Electric Car Charger and Bike Rental Hubs   Earlier in London today Apple laid out its updates to Maps in a briefing. Apple stated that they were expanding the capabilities of its Maps app in Europe to help users charge their electric vehicles or find bike rental hubs. Improving its mapping products has become a key focal point for Apple in its battle with Google. Apple introduced electric vehicle charging points in Maps in the U.S. in December.   According to a new Bloomberg report, Apple has added the locations of the U.K.'s electric vehicle charging stations by incorporating data from Munich-based Cirrantic's Moovility service, which lists re-juicing points for cars made by Tesla and Nissan, among others.   It has also added public bicycle rental and drop-off points to maps of London, New York and Paris in a catch-up to long-time mobile navigation leader Google, which has listed such stations in multiple countries for some time.   Arne Meusel, CEO and co-founder of Cirrantic stated that "We think that consistent, live information of the growing charger infrastructure increases the confidence of EV drivers and, especially with Apple Maps, attracts new user groups to sustainable mobility offerings like EV cars."

But will the tech titans really live forever? Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak believes all three entities will grow even more powerful over the next six decades. Wozniak told USA Today in a recent interview,. Apple will be around for a long time, like IBM." He continued, “Look at Apple’s cash [$246.1 billion]. It can invest in anything. It would be ridiculous to not expect them to be around (in 2075). The same goes for Google and Facebook.” The inventor is scheduled to expound on those ideas during this weekend’s Silicon Valley Comic Con (SVCC) event, “The Future of Humanity: Where Will We Be in 2075?” READ MORE SEE LESS PLAYLIST Wozniak's predictions for Google, Facebook in future revealed Wochit Tech NOW PLAYING United Airlines CEO says changes are coming Fox Business UP NEXT Unicorns are real, at Starbucks?

UBS estimates that Imagination will be loss-making by fiscal 2019 without Apple's payments and will have to take cost cutting measures to address this. Earlier this month, Imagination Technologies announced that Apple had informed the company that in 15 months to 2 years it will no longer use its intellectual property for GPUs. Rather, as previously reported, the company is building its own GPU. In the announcement, Imagination suggested it would see Apple in court claiming "it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights." UBS forecasts Apple is likely to ratchet down the royalty rate it currently pays of around $0.30 to closer to $0.10 - the rate Imagination charges customers such as MediaTek.

Sony A6500 Apple’s public beta program is free to participate in unlike its paid developer program. iOS 10.3.2 will be released to everyone in the future, and the public beta allows more users to test pre-release versions of the software update before it’s finalized. The version numbers alo suggest we should only see under-the-hood bug fixes and security improvements in these releases when ready. Apple’s iOS 10.3 release included Find My AirPods, a new APFS file system, CarPlay improvements, and much more. The macOS 10.12.5 update follows macOS 10.12.4 which brought Night Shift to the Mac for the first time. The version number and lack of release notes suggest the software update will focus on bug fixes and performance improvements We’ll update with any changes discovered in the latest release. Both watchOS and tvOS betas are only available for developers.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Strategy Analytics: Consumers Largely Satisfied with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto BOSTON, April 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Apple CarPlay and Android Auto have been shaking up in-vehicle infotainment systems since 2016, when many automakers began selling vehicles with mirroring solutions integrated into the embedded infotainment system. The user experience of CarPlay and Android Auto compare very favorably to embedded offerings, though integration issues with the embedded infotainment system can negatively impact the overall user experience. A new report from the In-Vehicle UX (IVX) group at Strategy Analytics, „Consumers Largely Satisfied with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto„, has surveyed new vehicle owners that have Apple CarPlay and Android Auto to understand their in-vehicle usage and satisfaction with these features. Overall, consumers that have mirroring solutions are largely satisfied, and use them for the majority of their infotainment needs. Surveying consumers in the US, Strategy Analytics has found that CarPlay and Android Auto are preferred for duplicate features; CarPlay is easy to use given its similarity to an Apple smartphone’s interface; and both CarPlay and Android Auto have relatively simple and consistent interfaces. But perhaps most importantly, both have the ability to be updated as needed, as new apps are added or when bugs and usability issues are uncovered. This will only work to enhance their value as embedded systems age. Click here for report: http://sa-link.cc/1jZ Chris Schreiner, Director of Syndicated Research and report author commented, „Overall, consumers are satisfied with CarPlay and Android Auto and are happy to recommend it to others. However, consumer-facing embedded navigation could become obsolete for those OEMs implementing smartphone mirroring solutions, as those solutions provide a better experience.” Continued Schreiner, „Smaller OEMs could focus on CarPlay and Android Auto as their connectivity strategy greatly simplifies development while at the same time enhancing the user experience.” Added Kevin Nolan, VP, User Experience Innovation Practice, „OEMs that do not adopt smartphone mirroring solutions will have to provide over-the-air software updates to continually enhance features and fix usability issues, in addition to developing value-added features that tie in with the rest of the vehicle to differentiate themselves from CarPlay and Android Auto. But, the time will come when OEMs must decide whether to implement embedded systems or use mirroring solutions. From our research experience, providing both will not produce optimal results.” About Strategy Analytics Strategy Analytics, Inc. provides the competitive edge with advisory services, consulting and actionable market intelligence for emerging technology, mobile and wireless, digital consumer and automotive electronics companies.

Michigan State Turned 1250 Gallons Of Compromised Mayo Into Power More Tech Wozniak Predicts Google, Facebook Still Vital in 2075 By Stephanie Mlot 04.19.2017 :: 8:00AM EDT Via photographer Nichollas Harrison Stay on target NHL Stanley Cup Playoff Teams Get Assist From Apple Party Like It’s 1990 With Mini LEGO Macintosh Classic Apple, Google, and Facebook have stood the test of time—so far. But will the tech titans really live forever? Yes, according to Steve Wozniak. The Apple co-founder believes all three entities will grow even more powerful over the next six decades. Apple will be around for a long time, like IBM,” Woz told USA Today in a recent interview, citing the New York-based company founded by Charles Ranlett Flint in 1911. “Look at Apple’s cash [$246.1 billion],” he continued. “It can invest in anything. It would be ridiculous to not expect them to be around (in 2075). The same goes for Google and Facebook.” From a couple of friends in a Los Altos garage to a multi-billion-dollar Silicon Valley enterprise, Apple has come a long way from 1976 and the $700 Apple-1 desktop computer. As most young entrepreneurs do, the two Steves (Wozniak and the late Jobs) assumed their business would last forever. Maybe Woz really does have a knack for predicting the future. The trick, he admitted to USA Today, is understanding how rapidly things change. “Who could have foreseen the rise of an Uber a decade ago?” Wozniak said. The inventor is scheduled to expound on those ideas during this weekend’s Silicon Valley Comic Con (SVCC) event, “The Future of Humanity: Where Will We Be in 2075?” Living communally in deserts and interacting regularly with artificial intelligence, according to Woz, who offered some other guesses at life in 60 years. Convinced a colony will exist on Mars, Wozniak foresees the Red Planet’s use for heavy industry, while Earth remains zoned for residential use. Don’t get your hopes up, though, for extraterrestrial contact. “It’s worth trying” to communicate with another race, he said. “But I don’t have high hopes.” The three-day SVCC conference, which Woz helped create last year, boasts other famous guests like actors William Shatner and John Cusack, former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, and architect Greg Lynn.

The Chinese electronics maker unveiled a new flagship smartphone days after Samsung's Galaxy S8 hit stores, hoping to regain lost ground even as Apple prepares to introduce its most anticipated device in years. By: Bloomberg | Published: April 19, 2017 10:18 PM Xiaomi Corp. took the wraps off the Mi 6 at a college gymnasium on the outskirts of Beijing on Wednesday.(Reuters) Xiaomi’s trying to get back in the game. The Chinese electronics maker unveiled a new flagship smartphone days after Samsung’s Galaxy S8 hit stores, hoping to regain lost ground even as Apple prepares to introduce its most anticipated device in years. Xiaomi Corp. took the wraps off the Mi 6 at a college gymnasium on the outskirts of Beijing on Wednesday. The phone sports flourishes now familiar to users of premium devices including the S8: curved glass, virtually non-existent bezels, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and 6 gigabytes of memory. It also features dual cameras on the back. In a nod to Apple Inc.’s latest iPhone, Xiaomi also dropped the headphone jack. The Mi6 goes on sale April 28 starting at 2,499 yuan ($363). The company has moved away from its roots as an online purveyor of cheap devices since local rivals from Oppo to Huawei Technologies Co. began to dominate the Chinese market with higher-end gadgets. Co-founder Lei Jun is going after his rivals not just with increasingly tricked-out phones, but also by adopting the nationwide store networks that super-charged the Oppo and Vivo brands. The company remains on track to open 1,000 stores within three years across China, and expects to chalk up 70 billion yuan of sales through that physical network in five years. You may also like to watch: “Xiaomi has faced some growth pressure over the past years because of our online-only model,” Lei told his launch audience. “I’m excited to say we’ve made a breakthrough.” The billionaire co-founder is overhauling his company’s approach to regain its perch atop the world’s largest smartphone arena — it was ranked No. 5 in China in 2016 according to researcher IDC. Since becoming the country’s largest startup in 2014 with a valuation of $45 billion, the company began to slide the next year when it missed shipments targets. While taking a pounding at home, Xiaomi began to expand globally. Lei said the brand is now No. 2 in India, behind only Samsung Electronics Co. It’s also begun to deepen research into areas as diverse as artificial intelligence and online finance. It applied for 7,071 patents last year, and total patents will “soon” exceed 10,000,” Lei said. For now, the company still gets much of its revenue from its home market. In January, former international head Hugo Barra left and then joined Facebook Inc., raising questions about Xiaomi’s ability to navigate its way through what Lei had described as “unforgettable” challenges.

The report had noted that an aggressive former reporter and editor at Xinhua, the 56-year-old Mr. Lu has been a high-profile pitchman for President Xi's vision of the internet. In meetings with global tech CEOs and at press conferences, he has argued forcefully that national borders should extend into cyberspace and governments should be able to control the internet as they see fit. Today we're learning that Beijing's Internet regulators said Apple is next on a list for inquiries after authorities ordered three Chinese live streaming websites to rectify management loopholes.   The three websites are toutiao.com, huoshanzhibo.com and huajiao.com, which were found to have violated four different regulations concerning Internet information services, live-streaming services and online performance, according to the Beijing Cyberspace Administration.   "Significant loopholes" also existed in their management of live-broadcast products, user classification, authentication of user identity and the handling of tips-offs, according to the regulators.   Some cases will be transferred to the police, and publishers that have committed violations shall receive criminal punishment.   Officers with the law enforcement team said they have also met representatives from Apple about the examination of live stream apps from the tech giant's app store.   The Beijing Cyberspace Administration confirmed that the three departments will jointly summon Apple over the issues to urge the American firm to tighten up checks on software applications available in the Apple Store.   In June the new Chinese Cyber Security Law goes into effect that could go as far as requiring companies like Apple to surrender their source code, even though at the moment that seems remote.    About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

This one appears to depict a metal back with the Touch ID fingerprint sensor placed below the Apple logo. The leak comes from Sonny Dickson, a source who has leaked authentic Apple parts and information in the past. iPhone 8 looks to be taking a new direction Notably, despite most rumors suggesting the iPhone 8 will have a glass back, a recent Bloomberg report claimed that Apple was also testing a prototype with an aluminum back and slightly larger dimensions. There have been many reports that Apple is facing issues with integrating the Touch ID sensor under the display; however, it's unclear if the problem will result in Apple needing to delay release, drop the Touch ID sensor, or move it to the back of the device.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Facebook Messenger Is Getting An Apple Music And Spotify Extension By Ali Salman Apr 18, 2017 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Facebook is not reluctant to announce new changes in its platforms, even if it includes blatantly ripping off Snapchat Stories. Today, the company has announced a plethora of changes for its Messenger app including the new ways for applications to integrate with it. The announcements were made on the company’s annual F8 developer conference. If you’re excited just yet, one of the partners standing out was Apple Music and Spotify. So lets dive in to see some more details on the subject. Facebook Messenger To Integrate With Apple Music And Spotify If you’re in for a deeper insight on the scenario, the feature will basically allow users to link to Apple Music and Spotify and share songs and playlists directly within the Facebook Messenger app. At this point in time, Apple did not detail any method for how its chat extensions will work. Spotify on the other hand detailed in a blog post about the Spotify chat extension. More or less, Apple Music’s chat extensions will work in a similar way. Related Can’t Get Enough GIFs? Giphy Now Lets You Add GIFs in Facebook Live, Camera & Messenger Facebook announced the feature at its annual F8 developer conference. While Messenger’s new music sharing feature will ship with Spotify integration, Apple Music integration is committed to  be integrated in the days to come. Advertisement Facebook is already integrated with Apple Music in the main app with the feature that lets you share songs called Music Stories. The feature basically allows users to share songs through Apple Music to Facebook feed. The music is previewed in line and can be opened directly in the Apple Music app. Using Spotify chat extensions, users will have the ability to search and share Spotify songs, playlists and albums. The links will play the 30 second preview of the song, while tapping on it will open the full song. The Spotify bot will offer playlist recommendations to users based on their mood, genre and activity. Currently, we’re not sure if Apple will introduce a feature similar to this one. Related Instagram Now Adds Offline Support For Android While Apple Music already offers a music sharing feature, the Facebook integration comes through the Messenger app. Since the feature is not yet available, you can also check out the extension that performs the same features right away. Apple Music is available on iOS as well as Android, so all platforms will adhere to the arrival of the feature. There will be more to the story, so be sure to stay tuned in for that. This is it for now folks. What are your thoughts on Apple Music and Spotify integration in the Facebook Messenger app?

[…] By: Bloomberg | Published: April 19, 2017 10:00 PM More suppliers may suffer the same fate as the world’s largest technology company faces a shrinking number of semiconductor makers and expands into areas that need special chips designed in-house.(Reuters) Imagination Technologies Group Plc discovered how fickle life can be as an Apple Inc. supplier when it was ditched this month by the iPhone maker. More suppliers may suffer the same fate as the world’s largest technology company faces a shrinking number of semiconductor makers and expands into areas that need special chips designed in-house. Dialog Semiconductor Plc, Synaptics Inc. and Cirrus Logic Inc. are particularly vulnerable to Apple’s supply chain whims and demands, according to analysts. One component supplier, Avnet Inc., stopped working with Apple because the relationship was squeezing its profit margins too much. Apple has developed its own processors for years, but has stepped up in-house design of components, including graphics, Bluetooth and other smartphone-related chips, in recent years. That’s expensive, and creates new risks, but it helps the company maintain leverage over suppliers as a recent wave of acquisitions cut the number of chipmakers it works with. You may also like to watch: To secure cheaper prices, Apple likes to have at least two suppliers for any given component. But last year alone, one in five U.S. chipmakers were acquired, according to Susquehanna Financial Group. Key Apple suppliers SanDisk Corp., Broadcom Corp., TriQuint Semiconductor Inc., Intersil Corp., Sharp Corp., Elpida Memory Inc., RF Micro Devices Inc. and Fairchild Semiconductor International have all been snapped up since 2013. Loop Capital Markets LLC analyst Betsy Van Hees, has seen 35 chip companies swallowed since 2014. “You have less competition, less pricing pressure,” she said. “Which may be why Apple is going more internally than externally.” In the past, it was easier for Apple to squeeze outside suppliers to improve profit margins, she added. This year is particularly important for Apple because it’s preparing to launch three iPhones, including a flagship device with a major new design. The installation of new manufacturing lines and processes is costly, so Apple needs to find savings elsewhere. “To avoid taking a hit you put some pressure” on the suppliers, BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis said. Cost isn’t the only incentive for Apple to develop its own components. It also helps the company couple its hardware more seamlessly with its software, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri explained at a Feb. 14 conference in San Francisco. “We have better control over timing, over cost, over quality,” he said. You may also like to watch; Expansion into new markets and products may also require hardware unique to Apple’s needs that isn’t immediately available from outside suppliers. The AirPods Bluetooth headphones, released last year, use low-energy communications chips that Apple got through its purchase of Passif Semiconductor Corp. in 2013. In 2012, Apple spent $356 million acquiring AuthenTec Inc., which had fingerprint sensors and related chipsets that helped build the fingerprint scanner on the iPhone. Apple was in acquisition talks last year with Imagination Technologies. The Kings Langley, England-based company designs a type of chip called a graphics processing unit that’s used in iPhones and iPads, and analysts theorized Apple wanted to take the technology in house and push it forward on its own terms. Apple decided against making an offer. Then, on April 3, Imagination said Apple would stop using its graphics technology after developing its own solutions. Apple also hired several employees from Imagination, including former Chief Operating Officer John Metcalfe. The British company lost about two-thirds of its market value that day. That prompted analysts and investors to cast a keener eye over what other suppliers may be next. One immediate example was Dialog, which slumped 20 percent April 11 after Bankhaus Lampe analyst Karsten Iltgen suggested Apple may cease using Dialog’s power-management chips. Apple is setting up power-management design centers in Munich and California, Iltgen noted, and there’s been a steady flow of engineers from Dialog to Apple over the past year. Synaptics Inc., whose products help control the iPhone’s touch screen, could also be vulnerable, Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh wrote in an April 12 note. Apple has hired “a significant number” of engineers from the company, suggesting that it’s working on products that would render Synaptics redundant, Vinh said. Vinh also highlighted Cirrus Logic, which makes audio chips used in iPhones, even as he deemed the risk of Apple developing its own competing components “medium to low.” Hiring in-house experts doesn’t come cheap (Cirrus spends $200 million a year on research, Vinh noted). In the past five years, Apple doubled research and development spending as a percentage of revenue, an increase CFO Maestri attributed to new product categories and developing more of its own underlying technology, among other factors. Semiconductor research is among the most expensive in the technology industry, often exceeding 18 percent of revenue. Apple spends 4.7 percent of its income on R&D, up from 2.2 percent in 2012. The pay-off from the investment could be substantial. Semiconductors account for about a third of iPhone manufacturing costs, according to Timothy Arcuri, a Cowen & Co. analyst. Tapering growth of smartphone sales has meanwhile heightened the need to squeeze every last dollar of profit out of the handsets that Apple does sell. The main risk is that Apple misses new technology trends that bubble up through a large supply chain. Relying more on internally created components, it’ll have fewer suppliers lining up to show it the latest innovations. When Nokia Oyj was the world’s largest mobile phone maker, it focused more on cost cutting and controlling component supply and missed out on important changes in the market, according to Mike Walkley, an Apple analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “You’ve seen what they’ve done to Imagination and Dialog Semi and all of these people who supply to Apple,” he said. “It’s kind of what Nokia did back in the day when they were king of the world.” An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Then there’s the risk that some partners decide they don’t want to deal with Apple anymore. Bill Amelio, former chief executive officer of Lenovo Group Ltd. who now runs Avnet, said he walked away from supplying Apple and it’s helped improve earnings. The Phoenix, Arizona-based distributor of chips and other computer components had a gross profit margin of 13.7 percent in its most recent quarter. That’s 2 percentage points wider than it was a year earlier — thanks in part to cutting ties with Apple. No Comments.

Because of this, employees were instructed to give customers replacement units should the latter visit Apple stores to have their phones with cracked or broken screens repaired.  Another retail source revealed more details regarding the constraint. According to the second source, there was an error in the display components sent to Apple stores recently. The serial numbers for the panels weren’t added to the Cupertino giant’s system correctly, so the outlets failed to validate the components. This then led the stores to return the affected components to Apple, and this has significantly diminished the repair parts available in retail stores.  READ: iPhone 8 rocking smaller bezels than Galaxy S8 Previously, the shortage in screen repair components caused some to speculate that this could be indicative of a possible iPhone SE refresh. However, there have been no reports about a new SE model coming out soon. In fact, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously said that Samsung’s biggest rival will not launch a new iPhone SE during the first half of this year.  In addition, it doesn’t make sense if Apple were to introduce an iPhone SE successor anytime soon. Tim Cook’s company just bumped up the storage options of the original SE. Now consumers can choose between a $399 4-inch iPhone with 32GB memory and a $499 model with 128GB. Apple will likely focus on selling these models first before moving forward in developing a next-generation iPhone SE.  Meanwhile, Apple is currently hard at work in creating its upcoming iOS-running smartphones: iPhone 8, 7s and 7s Plus. Based on a new leak, the company could be developing a bezel-less iPhone 8 with a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, an all-aluminum back case, a vertical dual-camera module and a USB-C port.  Apple is replacing iPhone SE units with broken display.

It comes courtesy of Sonny Dickson, who has leaked news about Apple products in the past, and the drawing itself looks pretty legitimate. Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: What's the story so far? The drawing is of the rear casing of the iPhone 8, and shows a rear-mounted Touch ID sensor. This contradicts a schematic and render we recently reported on, which showed a Touch ID sensor embedded into the glass display. With the renders being an artist's impression, and Sonny Dickson's leak looking more like the real deal, coupled with the fact most phone manufacturers are now leaning towards a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, we're inclined to take some serious note of this latest leak. Of course, we'd love to see if Apple can in fact embed a sensor in the front of the glass display. However, it could be a port to fit a wireless charging receiver, as wireless charging has been a feature that's been rumoured for the new model for quite some time. The drawing also shows a vertical camera array, which is something that matches up with the other schematic drawing leaked this week. The vertical array is said to have been chosen because there isn't enough space in the top section of the phone to fit the components because of the camera and 3D depth sensors on the front of the iPhone. Great iPhone 8 schematic shows Apple's next iPhone with an edge-to-edge display New sources confirm three iPhones for 2017, iPhone 8 with curved OLED display The drawing shows other features that match up with previous iPhones, such as the power and volume switches, mute switch, dual speakers on the bottom and the Lightning connector. As with any leak and rumour, we have to take it with a pinch of salt for now, but this latest one makes predicting what the iPhone 8 will look like a whole lot harder.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Strategy Analytics: Consumers Largely Satisfied with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto Smartphone Mirroring Solutions Provide Better User Experience than In-vehicle Embedded Systems BOSTON, April 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Apple CarPlay and Android Auto have been shaking up in-vehicle infotainment systems since 2016, when many automakers began selling vehicles with mirroring solutions integrated into the embedded infotainment system. The user experience of CarPlay and Android Auto compare very favorably to embedded offerings, though integration issues with the embedded infotainment system can negatively impact the overall user experience. A new report from the In-Vehicle UX (IVX) group at Strategy Analytics, "Consumers Largely Satisfied with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto", has surveyed new vehicle owners that have Apple CarPlay and Android Auto to understand their in-vehicle usage and satisfaction with these features. Overall, consumers that have mirroring solutions are largely satisfied, and use them for the majority of their infotainment needs. Surveying consumers in the US, Strategy Analytics has found that CarPlay and Android Auto are preferred for duplicate features; CarPlay is easy to use given its similarity to an Apple smartphone's interface; and both CarPlay and Android Auto have relatively simple and consistent interfaces. But perhaps most importantly, both have the ability to be updated as needed, as new apps are added or when bugs and usability issues are uncovered. This will only work to enhance their value as embedded systems age. Click here for report: http://sa-link.cc/1jZ Chris Schreiner, Director of Syndicated Research and report author commented, "Overall, consumers are satisfied with CarPlay and Android Auto and are happy to recommend it to others. However, consumer-facing embedded navigation could become obsolete for those OEMs implementing smartphone mirroring solutions, as those solutions provide a better experience." Continued Schreiner, "Smaller OEMs could focus on CarPlay and Android Auto as their connectivity strategy greatly simplifies development while at the same time enhancing the user experience." Added Kevin Nolan, VP, User Experience Innovation Practice, "OEMs that do not adopt smartphone mirroring solutions will have to provide over-the-air software updates to continually enhance features and fix usability issues, in addition to developing value-added features that tie in with the rest of the vehicle to differentiate themselves from CarPlay and Android Auto. But, the time will come when OEMs must decide whether to implement embedded systems or use mirroring solutions. From our research experience, providing both will not produce optimal results."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman The Top Two Reasons to Be Bullish on Broadcom Stock AVGO Stock Promises More Gains to Investors Broadcom stock once again grabbed the headlines as Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO) made a bid for Toshiba’s NAND business last week. (Source: “Japan-U.S. bid eyed for Toshiba semiconductor unit sell-off,” The Asahi Simbun, April 19, 2017.) This news is enough to raise alarms for AVGO stock investors who must be already worried about the company suffering from the actions of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has become more keen to take control of its hardware going forward. The smartphone maker’s decision to design its graphics chips in-house led to the plunge in the stock of Imagination Technologies Group plc (LON:IMG) early this month. Well, Broadcom stock is unlikely to meet such a fate as Apple Inc. has not flashed any indication of venturing into developing chips like radio frequency chips and WiFi combination chips, which Broadcom specializes in. Broadcom is a major supplier of these chips to Apple and there have been reports that the two may also be working together on wireless charging technology for the future generations of the “iPhone.” Apple also has a three-year deal with Broadcom for the supply of RF components and modules. Broadcom Has a Big Product Portfolio One major concern right now is what the future of AVGO stock will be if Apple iPhone sales do not live up to the expectations. Would that impact the business of Broadcom? Yes, the drop in Apple’s smartphone demand is definitely a threat to Broadcom stock. However, the company is one of the few players in the semiconductor space that is really well-diversified. In terms of industry exposure, Broadcom’s products go into not only smartphones, but also data center servers and networks, set-top boxes, telecommunication equipment, power generators, and many more. So, as compared to other Apple suppliers, Broadcom is very well-positioned to face any storm. Broadcom Corporation and Avago Technologies merged last year to build the semiconductor behemoth that the company is today. The size and scale of the current entity helps in improving the market share and lowering the cost of production. One of the strengths of Broadcom is that it is focused on controlling the costs, as it continues to innovate in its well-diversified portfolio of products. The stock chart below shows the steady rise posted over the last one year. AVGO stock has gained about 37% in the year as compared to about 13% posted by S&P 500. Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com The company announced its first-quarter results last month and the revenue from its largest segment, wired infrastructure, was $2.09 billion, 50% of Broadcom’s total revenue. The better-than-expected performance was due to strong demand from cloud data center operators, which is likely to continue in the future. High demand for the company’s products going forward augurs well for AVGO stock. (Source: “Broadcom Limited Announces First Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Financial Results and Interim Dividend,” Broadcom Ltd, March 1, 2017.) Broadcom Has Financial Discipline Broadcom plans to grow through acquiring other companies, but that does not mean that it is wasting money. After the successful completion of the $37.0-billion mega merger of Avago Technologies and Broadcom Corporation last year, the combined entity is now bidding for Toshiba’s memory business for about $23.0 billion. However, this shall further help the company in tackling the challenge of the ups and downs of semiconductor market and boost AVGO stock. Further, Broadcom’s push for innovation is relentless. The company plans to invest about $2.7 billion a year in R&D that would help sharpen its competitive edge. Broadcom is also focused on achieving free cash flow margin of 35%. The company has committed to increasing its dividend payment in the coming years, which is another great reason to own the stock. The financial discipline and dedication to innovation shall keep driving Broadcom stock higher in the coming days. The Bottom Line on AVGO Stock Broadcom stock not only shall enjoy solid growth in the coming days, but also is cheaper as compared to its peers. The stock trades at a lower forward P/E of 13.43 as compared to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which trades at a forward P/E of over 29. (Source: “Broadcom Limited (AVGO),” Yahoo! Finance, last accessed April 19, 2017.) Hence, the well-diversified portfolio of products helps the company in mitigating cyclical risks, and its ability to manage inorganic growth together with financial discipline makes it one of the top choices in the industry. With the rebound in the semiconductor space, the future indeed looks very bright for AVGO stock.   CategoriesUncategorized TagsAVGO stock, Internet, News, Stock Post navigation Previous PostPrevious What Are the Best Defense Penny Stocks in 2017?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman MSFT or AAPL: Who Will Win in the Battle of Apple vs Microsoft One of the greatest tech rivalries of all time is heating up. The Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) saga is long and storied, and has been one of the main driving forces in the computer sector for decades. While the two companies long ago parted ways in terms of the types of products they produce (that explains why you haven’t seen those Mac vs. PC commercials in a long time), the technologies that are currently in development by both companies may bring them back into a heated head-to-head conflict. And that brings us to Microsoft stock vs. Apple stock. The two companies currently have stakes in very different markets. Apple has the “iPhone,” the “Mac,” and the “iPad,” and the company has generally established its empire on the backs of consumer tech gadgets. Microsoft, by contrast, has focused more on the software side of things, with the “Windows” operating system, “Microsoft Suite,” cloud offerings, and “Office 365” being some of the company’s main sources of revenue and growth. But that calculation is changing. Microsoft Surface Studio vs. Apple Mac  One of the biggest new additions to the Microsoft vs. Apple tale is the first-ever desktop computer made by Microsoft: “Microsoft Surface Studio.” Being billed as a direct competitor to Macs, the new Microsoft product seems to be taking what the Mac does best and is outperforming the long-held standard in desktops for creatives. Microsoft Surface Studio is a 28″ super-high-resolution desktop computer complete with touchscreen functionality, sixth-generation Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) processor options, and a dedicated graphics card. It’s being billed as the must-own tool for creative types, which is bad news for Apple Mac. Apple has long held that Macs are preferable to PCs when it comes to creative ventures, including picture and video editing, sound design, art projects, etc. Apple has long since owned that portion of the market, while Microsoft has been seen as the more business-friendly alternative to Apple’s cool factor. But the new Microsoft Surface Studio could shake things up. And computer sales are definitely in need of a revitalization. Computers sales have suffered in recent years. Among the top five computer vendors, Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DVMT) is the only one to see growth in 2016, with a 2.6% boost over the previous year. The industry more broadly saw a sales decline of 6.2% from 2015. But AAPL stock is currently on a tear, regardless of its flagging computer revenue. The company shipped 8.7% fewer Mac units in 2016 than it did in 2015. (Source: “Gartner Says 2016 Marked Fifth Consecutive Year of Worldwide PC Shipment Decline,” Gartner Inc, January 11, 2017.) “The broad PC market has been static as technology improvements have not been sufficient to drive real market growth,” said Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner. Kitagawa continued, “There have been innovative form factors like 2-in-1s and thin and light notebooks, as well as technology improvements, such as longer battery life. This end of the market has grown fast, led by engaged PC users who put high priority on PCs. However, the market driven by PC enthusiasts is not big enough to drive overall market growth.” (Source: Ibid.) Microsoft has long been looking to get into the hardware market, with its “Surface” line of products, but Microsoft Surface Studio is the company’s boldest move yet. MSFT stock might become the beneficiary of the Microsoft finally striking gold with must-have consumer hardware. Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com  Artificial Intelligence Tech in 2017 One of the most exciting developments in the tech sector is the focus on artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The AI sector is likely to be one of the most transformative innovations we’ll see in the next few years. As such, whichever company can assert itself as the leader in the AI sector will likely see huge stock gains. Which brings us to another new front in the Apple vs. Microsoft battle. Both Microsoft and Apple ventured into the realm of responsive machines with voice-activated AI helpers. But, while Apple is focusing more on augmented reality (AR) these days, Microsoft seems to be pushing forward with AI in 2017. “Siri” made headlines years ago when Apple first introduced it, but Microsoft followed its success with a version of its own in “Cortana.” Named after a heroine in its Halo video game franchise (who is, of course, also an AI, though a much more sophisticated and sentient one), the company is seeking to push itself into the AI market. The latest news surrounding the MSFT stock price is the partnership between Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Microsoft, in which the two behemoths will seek out ways to enhance their products via AI tech. (Source: “Adobe, Microsoft working together on artificial intelligence,” The Economic Times, March 23, 2017.) While Apple hasn’t made any significant consumer-facing play in terms of AI since the introduction of Siri, the company is looking toward other forms of machine learning and smart devices in order to take advantage of this burgeoning sector. “Apple Car,” for instance, was once rumored to be the company’s version of an autonomous vehicle, though the latest information now points to Apple moving toward programming for autonomous cars rather than producing its own vehicles. And that makes a lot of sense. Why get involved in the hardware side of things in an area in which your company has little expertise, when you can direct your hugely powerful and resource-rich programming departments to tackle another fast developing tech sector? Apple Investments May Push AAPL Stock Over MSFT Stock  One big advantage that Apple has over Microsoft is a war chest that is fit to burst. Apple has a lot of money that it can play around with and, as such, the company has many targeted investment options that could dramatically alter the path of the AAPL stock price. Perhaps the biggest rumor surrounding Apple is whether it will acquire the massive media mogul Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS). This would be a huge coup for Apple, were the acquisition to take place. Why? Well, for one thing, Apple is a very diverse and well-situated company with a lot of different plays on the go, but one area where it is lacking is the media division. Apple has yet to produce much of its own original media content. The company has always valued its brand image, with some of the most memorable commercials of all time coming from the Apple marketing department, but it has yet to step into the content arena. And we all know how much Apple loves to exert total control when it comes to its products, often avoiding outside influence whenever possible. Bringing Disney into the fold would essentially buy Apple a ready-made media empire that it can shape in its own image. If Apple wants to continue its expansion and dominance into new commercial ventures, eventually the creation and sale of original content will become a likely avenue to pursue in order to open up new revenue streams, Disney being one of the most desirable media acquisitions. Walt Disney Co has rights to the entire box-office-smashing “Marvel Cinematic Universe,” as well as children’s favorites, two foundational genres that often draw in hordes of viewers. Not to mention it also owns the rights to the Star Wars franchise, which is hardly a bit player in movie theaters. Consider the Beauty and the Beast live-action remake that recently hit theaters. With a gross of over $700.0 million since its release in early March, the movie is killing it at the box office. And last year’s highest-grossing film? Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, another Disney production. (Source: “Box Office: ‘Beauty And The Beast’ Waltzes Past $700M Worldwide,” Forbes, March 28, 2017.) Not only would Apple acquire the largest movie franchises in the world, it would also gain the ability to have its own original content produced by the best in the industry. Disney stock is up over eight percent since the beginning of 2017, and up 14% over the past 12 months. The rumors that Disney will be spinning off “ESPN,” which has been seen as a detriment to DIS stock, could also help create an atmosphere for an Apple acquisition. With strong revenue growth year-over-year in 2016, Disney would make a great fit as an Apple investment. (Source: “Global revenue of the Walt Disney Company in the fiscal years 2006 to 2016 (in billion U.S. dollars),” Statista, last accessed April 17, 2017.) MSFT Stock vs. AAPL Stock  With all that information out of the way, where does that leave us with MSFT stock and Apple stock? The fact is that both companies have the ability to be profitable but, as they continue to step into each other’s industries, there will undoubtedly be more friction and, therefore, some strong dips and rises. At this point, Apple looks to be in the better position than Microsoft from a share price perspective, but that can be misleading. While Apple stock has enjoyed strong gains in recent months, the company has acquired a lot of debt and faces declining sales in iPhones, as first adopters who can afford the expensive smartphone are shrinking. And that’s the state of the Microsoft vs. Apple rivalry. After a years-long detente between the two companies, they are once again entering into each other’s markets. While AAPL stock has the upper hand at the moment, threats to its stock in the long run make Microsoft stock a safer pick, albeit with less opportunity for huge growth.

The email notices alerted users of subscription discontinuation or told them they could not change their plans. Others described seeing a banner that instructed them to update their payment information. Users in Japan, Brazil and Australia also reported having issues with their accounts. One user said Apple was working with their engineering department on the issue. “Seems to be an internal issue, they are working with their Engineering department,” said the user. “My email said it expired today but that's not the case, she said almost every account is still intact.” On Apple’s support page system status tracker, Apple Music was labeled as having a “Resolved Issue.” Apple said the issues lasted since last night until this morning. Apple Music and iCloud users reported having trouble with their accounts.

News Stocks Technology Science Tech Space Human Earth Health Politics World Videos TheTape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsWhat’s Keeping Apple From Pushing Forward With iPhone 8 Production? (AAPL) What’s Keeping Apple From Pushing Forward With iPhone 8 Production? (AAPL) Analysts are saying that the iPhone maker is having a hard time integrating one of its signature features with a new one. April 19, 2017 WSP Among the most awaited new features of the upcoming iPhone 8 (aside from true wireless charging) is the removal of the physical home button that will allow a bezel-less (or borderless) display on an edge-to-edge screen. But if the latest rumors floating around turn out to be true, either the feature will have to wait, or it’s Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fans who will have to wait while the company delays production in an attempt to resolve this issue with the home button. The question that begs to be answered is this: what exactly is the stumbling block that’s hampering Apple from pushing forward with its plan to ditch the home button? It’s the Touch ID fingerprint sensor that’s used to unlock the phone, sign into apps and services, and use Apple Pay. More specifically, Apple has to preserve the functionality of the Touch ID which is presently incorporated in the physical home button. Apple supposedly wants to place the fingerprint sensor under the OLED panel display. Unfortunately, the technology that will allow such optical fingerprint sensing doesn’t seem to be in place yet. Digitimes previously reported that Cupertino turned down both Synaptics’ Natural ID touch fingerprint sensor and Qualcomm’s Sense ID fingerprint technology in favor of a fingerprint ID solution that the company is developing in-house. So far, however, the status in terms of any progress on the development of the sensor remains unknown. If Apple is still in the process of figuring out how to integrate Touch ID with its planned buttonless display, analysts believe that the company will be left with three options. The first solution will be to do away with Touch ID and rely on facial recognition (via a 3D laser scanner) instead. Second option — Apple can transfer the Touch ID button to the back of the phone. Which may not be user-friendly because you have to pick up the phone to be able to access the feature. Third option — Apple can simply delay production until the issue is solved, that is, until they are able to perfect their rumored ‘Authentec algorithm combined with Privaris glass identification technology’ for their fingerprint ID solution. It’s not as if Apple fans have not heard about this possible delayed launch before. And maybe that will be easier to accept than a new iPhone without a Touch ID, especially in the face of a number of reports saying that the iPhone 8 will be pegged at a hefty price tag of more than $1,000.00. If Apple needs a little more time to make sure their upcoming flagship phone is as spectacular as fans are expecting it to be, then maybe a little bit of delay won’t be as bad as it sounds. On the other hand, when considering the expectation of a launch in early September, this offers Apple a difficult decision.

Will it pay off, or will it be a flop? By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | April 19, 2017 -- 15:36 GMT (08:36 PDT) | Topic: iPhone The days of Apple being able to push hardware out of the door with crazy price tags on it are at an end, and that makes the $1,000+ iPhone a massive gamble. Will it pay off, or will it be a flop? Must read: How to put an end to Wi-Fi frustrations what's hot on zdnet ​Samsung's Galaxy S8 does DeX: Is it a Chromebook challenger or virtual desktop play? Robots in the cloud: How robotics-as-a-service can help your business Ransomware is now so awful it's actually making us take security seriously How to set up a new Windows 10 PC perfectly in one hour or less All the current evidence -- ranging from the more reliable supply chain chatter and analyst prognostications to the far flimsier pundit wild dreams -- suggests that Apple is planning some sort of special edition 10th-anniversary iPhone that will cost upwards of $1,000. Apple already sells an iPhone for a shade under $1,000: The 256GB iPhone 7 Plus is a cool $969, so the expectation is that the iPhone 8 or iPhone 10 or iPhone Edition or whatever it ends up being called will be priced deep in the $1,000 territory. OK, so why is a super-expensive iPhone a gamble for Apple? Surely it's a license to print money? After all, can't Apple just slap whatever price tag it wants to on new tech and people will buy it? The first and most obvious risk is that an iPhone with a four-figure price tag is simply too expensive to be anything other than a niche item. Apple does dabble with high-end stuff -- remember the solid-gold Apple Watch Edition? But at a time when iPhone sales are showing signs of going soggy, and Apple is having to slash the price of the iPad in order to resuscitate sales, adding pricing friction to the iPhone buying process might not be such a clever idea. iPhone 8: Here's what we know SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 10 NEXT PREV Now, you might counter this argument by suggesting that the 10th-anniversary iPhone will end up being little more than a publicity stunt, much like the solid-gold Apple Watch Edition. A case of make something crazy expensive, watch it being talked about incessantly for a few weeks, and then watch the sales of regular iPhones go through the roof. The problem with this argument is that the solid-gold Apple Watch Edition was essentially a regular Apple Watch in a crazy-expensive case. It seems a bit reckless for Apple to pour huge amounts of R&D money into a product that's not designed to sell or to act as a lure to sell cheaper iPhones. Now, you could further argue that Apple wouldn't be wasting R&D money because the special edition 10th-anniversary iPhone will act as a basis for future iPhones. Well, OK, yes, maybe, but... The first problem with that argument is that tech moves forward at such a pace that the R&D will have a limited shelf life. Something that's cutting-edge this year won't be that next year, so Apple will still have to spend on R&D. Another problem, and one that's likely more problematic -- after all, it's not like Apple doesn't have money to waste -- is that a really awesome but wildly expensive iPhone could actually put people off upgrading to the cheaper models being offered at sensible prices to mere mortals. After all, everyone knows that tech that's expensive today will be cheaper next year, and as such, they may very well hold off upgrading for a year or so and wait for whatever awesomeness that's baked into the special edition iPhone to trickle down to the regular lineup. And Apple is relying on an upgrade wave to boost sales. At the other end of the spectrum is the potential that whatever secret sauce Apple packs into the 10th-anniversary iPhone draws a collective yawn from potential buyers. New innovations such as the Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro haven't really been the huge hits that Apple expected them to be. It's getting harder to excite buyers. So, yes, it's all a pretty big gamble for Apple. If it pays off, then Apple will have -- temporarily -- put a halt to the "iPhone is dying" chatter. If things don't work out, then it's a sign that Apple could be in for a rough ride. As Apple focuses on iOS devices, what's the future of the Mac?

A new report is shedding light on the processors Intel is preparing for the Cupertino giant’s upcoming all-in-one desktop computers.  On Wednesday, Patently Apple reported that Intel is not only working on its new processors, it is also slated to unveil them next month during Computex 2017 in Taipei. The event is set to run from May 30 until June 3 which is two months earlier than its usual schedule. The processors that Intel is believed to be showcasing at the event are the Skylake-X and the Kaby Lake-X. There’s also mention of an X299 chipset.  After introducing them in the Taipei event, Intel is reportedly launching them in the U.S. at the E3 gaming show in June. Then, the company is going to officially release them by the end of the month. The Skylake-X series has three 140W processors with 6-, 8- and 10-core architectures. Intel is also expected to launch a 12-core Skylake-X processor in September. On the other hand, the Kaby Lake-X series has a 112W quad-core processor.  READ: Is Apple open to developing touchscreen MacBooks, iMacs?    Aside from the Basin Falls-based processors, Intel is also launching its Coffee Lake microarchitecture with 14nm process node in August 2017 instead of January 2018. Intel reportedly plans to challenge its competition from AMD’s Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 processors that’s why it is hard at work in preparing for the launch of its new processors. Besides, AMD is also announcing its 16-core Ryzen processor and X399 platform in the third quarter.  Apple has not revealed the specifics of its new iMacs yet, but they are likely sporting the new Skylake-X and or Kaby Lake-X processors. Previously, IBTimes learned that one iMac model could come with an Intel Xeon E3-1285 processor and ECC RAM. Intel’s new Xeon E3 processors are based on Skylake and Kaby Lake architecture. Intel is already preparing to unveil the processors for the next-generation iMacs.

Several users on Reddit and Twitter have also reported receiving the email, which may have been sent mistakenly. Relatedly, some iCloud storage plans were unavailable for purchase on iOS and macOS Sierra. When we checked the "Upgrade iCloud Storage" menu on an iPhone, both the 50GB and 200GB tiers were no longer listed. Later, the 1TB tier disappeared as well. On another iPhone, the menu wouldn't load at all. Apple has not announced any changes to its iCloud storage plans, and it has not recently updated its iCloud storage plans and pricing support document, so this was likely simply a server-related issue on Apple's backend. Apple's System Status page does not reflect any ongoing iCloud-related issues. Apple has not indicated why the "discontinued" emails were sent, but all four of the 50GB, 200GB, 1TB, and 2TB tiers appear to be available for purchase again for most users. We'll update this article if we hear anything else, particularly if Apple does have surprise changes to its iCloud storage plans in the works. 27 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) nutmac 14 hours ago at 10:15 am Dang it, I was hoping for a price drop. At the very least, Apple needs to do Mac Pro like price adjustment. Current: * 50GB @ $0.99/month ($0.24 per GB) * 200GB @ $2.99/month ($0.18 per GB) * 1TB @ $9.99/month ($0.12 per GB) * 2TB @ $19.99/month ($0.12 per GB) My wish is $0.06 per GB across the board: * 200GB @ $0.99/month ($0.06 per GB) * 1TB @ $4.99/month ($0.06 per GB) * 2TB @ $9.99/month ($0.06 per GB) Better yet, offer flexible $0.99/month per 200GB used, with family sharing. In case anyone's wondering, Dropbox is $0.10 per GB and Google Drive varies between $0.20 and $0.10 per GB. And neither offer flexible pay-as-you-use pricing, nor family sharing.

Rating: 2 Votes zorinlynx 12 hours ago at 12:32 pm I doubt that Apple will ever increase the free tier, and if they do, they won't increase it much. Here's why: By ensuring people have to pay $1 a month to use more than 5GB, they are making sure only those who are actively using their iCloud storage will be taking up more than 5GB of space. Think about it: They give out 50GB free, and you have Joe Schmoe sign up, upload his 40GB photo collection, then switch to Android a year later and never use iCloud again. Now Apple has 40GB of data that'll stick around on their servers forever since the 50GB tier is free. By charging $1 a month, Apple will recover the space when Joe stops paying for it. It's an easy way to ensure long gone users don't take up many petabytes of space. $1 a month is something pretty much anyone can pay, but most people will stop paying it if they're not using it. It's a similar reason big cities charge for street parking; it's not so much about making money but about controlling usage of a limited resource.

I would like to have a 100GB option for a dollar less. Ha. You think that's bad? I had to go from $2.99/mo 200GB to $9.99/mo 1TB because I'm using barely over 200GB of data. I culled down my photos and videos over the course of last year, but ran over on data again towards the end of the year so I just upgraded. I have nearly 800GB of space I don't use and what's worse is that I can't even share that with my wife or anyone else on my iCloud Family. I have to pay extra for my wife's storage, and she only needs 50GB! It's ridiculous. I wrote in this post ('//forums.macrumors.com/threads/cheaper-icloud-storage-in-autumn.2041251/') about a week ago what I hope Apple does going forward, given the pricing trends over time. Hopefully this "glitch" today is a sign that they're working on some changes ahead of WWDC. In that post I put the prices I hope to see for this autumn, and here they are again. These are my "Apple Adjusted" numbers. Of course I'd love to see lower, but given we're talking about Apple, I think this is more realistic (aside from them maybe never increasing the free tier because they're tightwads). * 20GB free (5GB isn't even enough to really try it out any more) * 100GB for $0.99/mo * 500GB for $3.99/mo * 1TB for $7.99/mo * 2TB for $14.99/mo Rating: 1 Votes drewyboy 13 hours ago at 11:13 am Dang it, I was hoping for a price drop.

Current: * 50GB @ $0.99/month ($0.24 per GB) * 200GB @ $2.99/month ($0.18 per GB) * 1TB @ $9.99/month ($0.12 per GB) * 2TB @ $19.99/month ($0.12 per GB) Um... either I'm completely wooshing on this one or you're horrible at math. $0.99/50GB= $0.0198 per GB $2.99/200GB= $0.01495 per GB $9.99/1000GB = $0.00999 per GB $19.99/2000GB = $0.00999 per GB My wish is $0.06 per GB across the board: * 200GB @ $0.99/month ($0.06 per GB) * 1TB @ $4.99/month ($0.06 per GB) * 2TB @ $9.99/month ($0.06 per GB) At $0.06 per GB this would be the cost: 200GB = $12.00 1TB = $60.00 2TB = $120.00 As for your wish of $0.06 per GB, SURPRISE it's not more than $0.02 right now. Why would you want to pay 3x? Math is important. Use it responsibly. [doublepost=1492625659][/doublepost] Great breakdown. Shame on you for not even bothering to check his math.

Todd Haselton | @robotodd 16 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Beck Diefenbach | Reuters Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook A new picture of a purported schematic for the Apple iPhone 8 suggests Apple is going to make some drastic changes to the location of the fingerprint reader. The photo was published to Twitter by blogger Sonny Dickson, who has published accurate information about past iPhones, including pictures of new models before they came out. View the Tweet here The rendering shows Apple may move the fingerprint reader to the back of the phone, while also adding a dual-camera module that sits vertically on the back of the phone. The current iPhone 7 Plus has two cameras though the module is horizontal. There are a couple of important takeaways here. First, Pacific Crest Securities' Andy Hargreaves said on Tuesday that Apple is facing supply chain headwinds that may force it to ditch the fingerprint reader altogether. The image from Dickson suggests that, perhaps, Apple may simply relocate it instead. Apple has apparently struggled to find a way to embed the fingerprint reader into new OLED displays from Samsung. Second, the change in camera modules appears to lend some credibility to reports that Apple will add some sort of augmented reality function on the most high-end iPhone 8. It's still unclear what AR plans Apple has, but there are suggestions it will require new camera sensors. Hargreaves said on Tuesday that the iPhone 8 may face some delays. Apple is still expected to introduce two additional iPhones, however, that may not offer some of the more advanced features of the iPhone 8. An Apple spokesperson was not immediately available for comment. Todd HaseltonTechnology Product Editor Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change AAPL ---
Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Music & Millennials April 19, 2017 (Investorideas.com Newswire) According to new data gathered by LendEDU, millennials overwhelmingly use Spotify to listen to music, while iTunes and illegally downloaded music have fallen in popularity. Although vinyl records are making a comeback amongst thrifty millennials and nostalgic baby boomers, their days of mainstream popularity are long over. To that end, audio cassettes and CDs have been archaic music mediums for quite some time. Today, the music marketplace is dominated by on-demand music streaming services and one in particular according to new data uncovered by LendEDU: Spotify. LendEDU has licensed data that reveals 47 percent of millennials get their music from Spotify. For reference, the second most popular choice was a tie at 14 percent. 47% of Millennials Get Their Music from Spotify 6,456 millennials were asked the following question: „Where do you get your music from?” Registering 47 percent of the vote, Spotify was the overwhelming winner. iTunes and „Rip it/Download Illegally” each captured 14 percent of the vote. Soundcloud received nine percent, Youtube took home seven percent, while Pandora got six percent, and three percent went to „other.” While this data produced a lot of interesting takeaways, Spotify’s clear dominance in a saturated field of competition is perhaps the most intriguing. What makes Spotify so popular amongst millennials? For starters, Spotify is a more social music platform than any of its competitors. And, in 2017, being conducive to social media is paramount. A user’s Spotify playlists exist in the cloud and can be shared with anyone they are friends with on Facebook. Additionally, Facebook friends that use Spotify can see what one another are listening to at any given moment. Apple Music appears to be Spotify’s biggest competitor in terms of social sharing, but even they are lagging behind. They differ in that Spotify allows users to share a track, artist, or playlist on their personal Spotify, Twitter, or Tumblr feed, while also being able to share through Facebook, email, text message, WhatsApp, or Google Hangouts. Spotify also gives users the option to „follow friends,” which shows what their friends are listening to on a continuous feed. Apple Music does not have a feature where you can connect with fellow music listening friends. Also, with Apple Music you can only share music through text, email, Twitter, Facebook, or AirDrop, leaving subscribers with much fewer sharing options than Spotify. Competition Copying Spotify’s Subscription Model Another huge attraction to Spotify is the music streaming platform’s subscription based membership model. For a monthly fee of $9.99, Spotify members have unlimited access to Spotify’s music library containing over 30 million songs. When compared to the more outdated payment systems, this model is seemingly preferred by consumers. For example, iTunes users have to pay for each individual song for a price that varies between $.99 and $1.25. After realizing they are losing to Spotify, other music streaming platforms are copying Spotify’s model. For example, iTunes was Apple’s main music application, but that is no longer the case; Apple created Apple Music, which has a subscription model very similar to Spotify. Apple Music users must pay $9.99, exactly the same as Spotify users. Additionally, Pandora, another music platform featured in this poll, just recently rolled out Pandora Premium, the company’s subscription based music service. Just like Spotify and Apple Music, Pandora Premium will cost users $9.99 a month. Subscribers of Pandora’s newest service will have access to a library of over 40 million songs. Hopefully for Pandora, their millennial market share will go up because according to this poll, only 6 percent of millennials use it. It is a common theme in the free market for competitors to copy each other, and the music streaming marketplace is no different. It was only a matter of time before Spotify’s competitors began mimicking their business model. Popularity of iTunes, Illegally Downloaded Music Down One of the more interesting points from this poll is that the same percentage of millennials get their music from downloading it illegally as do the people that get it from iTunes. Signaling a decline in popularity for both, iTunes and „Rip it/Download Illegally” each received 14 percent of the vote. It does not seem that long ago when iTunes was the premiere music streaming application. Before the age of Spotify, Soundcloud, and Pandora, everyone was using iTunes to listen to their favorite tunes. Now with so many competitors offering more bang for your buck, iTunes has taken a significant hit in usage, especially amongst millennials. When iTunes was at its peak, a fair share of its users were actually paying the $.99 per song. However, there was also a significant contingent of people that were using iTunes, but downloading the music illegally. „Ripping” music for free and downloading it onto iTunes used to be very common amongst music fans. File sharing programs like LimeWire and The Pirate Bay were immensely popular because they offered consumers a free and easy way to listen to the newest songs. However, according to LendEDU’s newest poll, downloading music illegally is not as commonplace as it once was. There have been efforts to combat music piracy, and they seem to be part of the reason as to why downloading music illegally has gone down. But, it seems more likely that the plethora of affordable, quality music streaming platforms out there is the main reason why music piracy has diminished. Platforms like Spotify, Pandora Premium, Soundcloud, and Apple Music are simply too cost efficient to revert back to downloading music illegally. Why deal with the stress and computer viruses that come with pirating music, when you can have instant access to over 30 million songs for just $9.99 a month? The same reasoning can be applied to the lessening popularity of iTunes as well. Why pay $.99 for every song you download when you could have more than 30 million songs for only $9.99 a month? In summation, Spotify has emerged as the trendsetter in the music streaming industry; it has simultaneously crushed iTunes and music piracy, while also pushing competitors like Apple and Pandora to copy its business model. Methodology LendEDU has gathered this data under license from polling company Whatsgoodly. In total, 6,456 current college students were polled from November 4th, 2015 to April 17th, 2017. The National Center for Education Statistics estimates that there are 20.5 million current college students in the United States. We estimate that our sample is representative of the population of college students with a margin of error of +-1.22%. Respondents were asked to answer the following question truthfully: „Where do you get your music from?” The full report can be found here: https://lendedu.com/blog/millennials-music-spotify/ Mike Brown Research Analyst Email: mike.brown@lendedu.com LendEDU.com Read More About LendEDU: LendEDU Is Making Student Loan Refinancing Easier @ TechCrunch Medical, Dental, 401(k)?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Rumor Apple Will Still Bundle the Lightning to Headphone Jack Adapter With iPhone 8 Packaging By Omar Sohail Apr 18, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple was generous enough to bundle a Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter with every purchase of the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. This would help prevent future adopters of these phones prevent running into port compatibility problems in the future. However, the next rumor claimed that the company was not going to show its generous side with the announcement of the iPhone 8, meaning the consumers would have to spend additional money to purchase this dongle. Luckily for those who are waiting for the arrival of the iPhone 8, it looks like you will still get to see that adapter as a part of those packaged accessories. Related Apple Reported to Sell up to 230 Million New iPhones – Chip Makers Have Started to Stock Solutions Analyst States That Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Jack Will Come Bundled With iPhone 8 – Might Cease to Exist With 2018 Lineup iPhone enthusiasts might have been salty when they found out that Apple removed the headphone jack. Still, with the iPhone 8 announcement, they can rejoice knowing that this accessory will be a part of the packaged ones when the phone is announced possibly during the month of September. According to Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis (via 9to5Mac), you might be able to enjoy the freebie this year, but starting from the 2018 lineup, the adapter might cease to exist. Advertisement “Debate whether Lightning adapter stays in box, we believe it stays this year but goes away at some point, potentially in the 2018 model.” What the analyst does not explain is if the adapter will stop getting manufactured completely. We do not think that Apple is going to make this big of a move but rather continue to sell the accessory on its store for the same price as the current one, which costs $9.99. While users can continue to spend money on this accessory, this move could probably be used to discourage the use of adapters and move them to purchase wireless audio products such as the AirPods or BeatsX. Looking at the current-gen iPhones, the wired earphones with the Lightning port could still be a part of those accessories but to be honest, they are extremely delicate and their sound quality is below par.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Rumor Three iPhones to Be Released in 2017 – Overhauled Version to Get Curved Screen and Stainless Steel Frame By Omar Sohail Apr 18, 2017 16Shares Share Tweet Submit Several rumors have continuously pointed out that Apple will be releasing three new iPhone models possibly during the month of September. Their names according to numerous reports are the iPhone 8 (also known as iPhone X, or the iPhone Edition), iPhone 7s, and iPhone 7s Plus. While you guys might be aware of how many variants are going to be announced this year, perhaps this latest report may shed light on additional information that might not have occurred to you. Advanced Cameras, Flat OLED Panel and Curved Glass Said to Be Part of the New iPhone Some reports have stated that the iPhone 8 will have a curved OLED sheet. However, a new report published by Mark Gunman and Min-Jeong Lee on Bloomberg states the following about Apple’s plans for the future. Related Apple Reported to Sell up to 230 Million New iPhones – Chip Makers Have Started to Stock Solutions “Apple is preparing three iPhones for launch as soon as this fall, including upgraded versions of the current two iPhone models and a new top-of-the-line handset with an overhauled look, according to people familiar with the matter. For the redesigned phone, Apple is testing a new type of screen, curved glass and stainless steel materials, and more advanced cameras, the people said. Those anxiously awaiting the redesigned iPhone, however, may have to wait because supply constraints could mean the device isn’t readily available until one or two months after the typical fall introduction.” Advertisement Keep in mind that the report says nothing about a curved OLED panel, but a flat display that will take up a large portion of the smartphone’s front side. What will be curved is the glass on the back and front of the phone. The glass material is going to be used in order to allow wireless charging for the radically changed iPhone 8. Related Another iPhone 8 Leaked Schematic Shows Rear-Mounted Touch ID – Another Prototype Apple’s Been Testing Out? Removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack will need something in return and this is probably going to be the only substitute available to allow the user to charge and listen to media on their mobile device. One reason why Apple might not opt for a curved OLED panel is due to supply constraints. Do you prefer this report related to the design of the iPhone 8 or do you prefer something different?

By: IANS | Beijing | Published: April 19, 2017 9:05 PM The Beijing Cyberspace Administration said the three departments will jointly summon Apple over the issues to urge the American firm to tighten up checks on software applications available in the Apple Store.(Reuters) Beijing’s Internet regulators on Wednesday said Apple is next on a list for inquiries after authorities ordered three Chinese live streaming websites to rectify management loopholes. Toutiao.com, huoshanzhibo.com and huajiao.com were found to have violated four different regulations concerning Internet information services, live-streaming services and online performance, Xinhua news agency cited Beijing Cyberspace Administration as saying. In a joint inquiry, conducted by the administration, the Beijing Public Security Bureau and Beijing Cultural Market Administrative Law Enforcement Team, the three companies lacked systematic management and were inadequate in checking information, emergency response and technical support. You may also like to watch: “Significant loopholes” also existed in their management of live-broadcast products, user classification, authentication of user identity and the handling of tips-offs, according to the regulators. Some publishers have broadcast live content forbidden by Chinese law on these platforms, they noted. Some provided pornographic content, according to the regulators. Beijing Cultural Market Administrative Law Enforcement Team said it has collected and sorted evidence on the violations at huoshanzhibo.com and huajiao.com and started investigation. Some cases will be transferred to the police, and publishers that have committed violations shall receive criminal punishment. Officers with the law enforcement team said they have also met representatives from Apple about the examination of live stream apps from the tech giant’s app store. The Beijing Cyberspace Administration said the three departments will jointly summon Apple over the issues to urge the American firm to tighten up checks on software applications available in the Apple Store.

Supplier Stocks This Fool offers up three things that investors should consider when evaluating an Apple supplier stock for purchase. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 19, 2017 at 9:30AM In a previous column, I offered some commentary on whether being an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier is a positive or a negative. I noted that being an Apple supplier can be a huge positive, especially if such a supplier plays its cards right by using its windfall from Apple's business to diversify its customer base and expand into other areas. At the same time, because Apple tends to bring so much business to the table, the risk of losing Apple's business means that if Apple decides to ditch a supplier, though vertical integration or simply by switching to an alternative vendor, the results for that supplier can range from painful to game-ending. Image source: Apple. I'd like to offer three tips that investors may want to consider when evaluating whether to buy stock of an Apple supplier. Look for companies with rare, differentiated technologies Apple is one of the world's most profitable technology companies, and it didn't get there by paying more than necessary for components. If a supplier offers components and technologies that are relatively rare and/or specialized, then it's at a lower risk of being replaced, either by another third-party solution or an internal solution, than if said supplier offers components that are generally available from a broad range of vendors.  An example of a supplier that has "rare, differentiated" technologies is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), the manufacturer of Apple's A-series applications processors, as well as other auxiliary chips inside of Apple's iPhone. Image source: Intel. There are very few companies that manufacture chips, and even fewer that manufacture chips using the latest, cutting-edge chip manufacturing technologies. Apple essentially has two viable choices for the manufacture of its A-series chips, and TSMC seems to have done a respectable job positioning itself as the "superior" choice. Remember that chip performance and power efficiency are very important to Apple, so having the best chip-manufacturing technology -- or at least the best general-purpose foundry -- is what I'd call "rare" and "differentiated." Look for high barriers to entry Even if a technology is rare and/or specialized, that's not necessarily enough to prevent Apple from building an in-house team to roll its own, especially if that technology is strategic. Investors should therefore look for suppliers that build products and technologies with extremely high barriers to entry. Those barriers can come in multiple forms, ranging from capital intensity to substantial intellectual-property hurdles to simply such a high degree of specialization that the industry's know-how is concentrated in very few corporate entities. For example, Apple is unlikely to build its own chip-manufacturing plants to cut out TSMC, for several reasons. First, chip manufacturing is exceptionally capital intensive, and Apple would take on a substantial amount of risk by trying to own and operate its own factories designed to service just its own chip needs. Beyond that, the know-how required to build competitive, viable cutting-edge manufacturing recipes is exceptionally hard -- there are only four companies left in the industry that are even trying, and only three are arguably succeeding. Another example of a supplier that offers a technology with high intellectual-property hurdles is ARM Holdings, which licenses the right to build processors compatible with the ARM instruction set architecture. Every iOS app is designed to run on ARM-compatible processors, so for Apple to try to transition away to an alternative instruction set, such as MIPS64 or a custom instruction set, would be a substantial and difficult undertaking. Look for technologies that clearly affect the user experience There are examples of companies with rare and differentiated technologies and whose technologies offer high barriers to entry that still manage to lose business and share. For example, wireless-chip maker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has a rare, differentiated technology with its cellular modems, and there are very few companies that can even build cellular modems to begin with -- yet it lost significant share to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in Apple's iPhone 7 lineup. Image source: Intel. Intel won this share with a modem that had an obviously inferior feature set and, according to at least one set of performance tests, delivered worse real-world performance. The problem in this case was that cellular modem performance isn't something typical mainstream reviews talk aboutm nor is it something users can easily measure, since cellular performance depends on so many factors beyond the technology inside the phone. And to be blunt, it's not something Apple's customers seem to care about. Apple's iPhones tend to be behind the latest Android phones in terms of modem technology year in and year out, yet that doesn't seem to have hurt them. So when picking Apple suppliers, it's important to not just make sure that they have rare or differentiated tech and high barriers to entry to developing that tech. You also want to make sure the tech matters to consumers and/or can be used as an effective selling point.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

A new report is shedding light on the processors Intel is preparing for the Cupertino giant’s upcoming all-in-one desktop computers.  On Wednesday, Patently Apple reported that Intel is not only working on its new processors, it is also slated to unveil them next month during Computex 2017 in Taipei. The event is set to run from May 30 until June 3 which is two months earlier than its usual schedule. The processors that Intel is believed to be showcasing at the event are the Skylake-X and the Kaby Lake-X. There’s also mention of an X299 chipset.  After introducing them in the Taipei event, Intel is reportedly launching them in the U.S. at the E3 gaming show in June. Then, the company is going to officially release them by the end of the month. The Skylake-X series has three 140W processors with 6-, 8- and 10-core architectures. Intel is also expected to launch a 12-core Skylake-X processor in September. On the other hand, the Kaby Lake-X series has a 112W quad-core processor.  READ: Is Apple open to developing touchscreen MacBooks, iMacs?    Aside from the Basin Falls-based processors, Intel is also launching its Coffee Lake microarchitecture with 14nm process node in August 2017 instead of January 2018. Intel reportedly plans to challenge its competition from AMD’s Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 processors that’s why it is hard at work in preparing for the launch of its new processors. Besides, AMD is also announcing its 16-core Ryzen processor and X399 platform in the third quarter.  Apple has not revealed the specifics of its new iMacs yet, but they are likely sporting the new Skylake-X and or Kaby Lake-X processors. Previously, IBTimes learned that one iMac model could come with an Intel Xeon E3-1285 processor and ECC RAM. Intel’s new Xeon E3 processors are based on Skylake and Kaby Lake architecture. Intel is already preparing to unveil the processors for the next-generation iMacs.

Reuters/Robert Galbraith A couple of weeks ago, Apple unexpectedly announced that not only is it going to launch an iMac 2017 update, the company is likewise planning to release a pro variant of its all-in-one desktop. The Cupertino, California-based tech giant did not provide specifics about the potential specs and release details of the upcoming iMacs, but a new report reveals some insight on the refresh. The new basic iMac units will reportedly be in production next month, while Apple aims to launch them around the third quarter of the year. The Mac maker is said to be testing a new “server-grade” iMac Pro variant for the high-end market. This pro model is expected to compete directly with the recently released Surface Studio, rival Microsoft’s own all-in-one PC. According to Digitimes, the new Apple iMac 2017 models are likely to be manufactured by Quanta Computer, a Taiwan-based electronics hardware company founded in 1988. Quanta Computer happens to be the world’s largest manufacturer of notebooks. Its long list of customers includes Dell, HP, Lenovo, Alienware, LG, Sony, Toshiba and, of course, Apple. “Thanks to its orders from Apple and HP, Quanta is expected to remain the largest [all-in-one] PC maker in 2017,” states the report. “However, Quanta declined to comment on its orders or clients.” Apple currently has two iMac variants available in the market: a 21.5-inch unit and a 27-inch version. The upcoming 2017 devices are likely to be upgrades of the two current models. The new server-grade iMac Pro is reportedly going to feature an Intel Xeon E3-1285 v6 processor with 64GB ECC RAM, up to 2TB NVMe SSD plus a “latest discrete graphics card.” The pro model is projected to be released by the end of the year, just in time for the holiday season. This isn’t the first time the above-mentioned specs were linked to the new iMac. Previous reports also indicated that the new Apple desktop could incorporate AMD graphics (apparently for virtual reality and professional app support) and Thunderbolt 3 ports, which are currently included in the latest MacBook Pro. What’s more, Apple is reportedly going to release the new iMac 2017 models with brand new keyboards. The company is supposedly going to consider changing the name of the operating system as well. The future macOS is said to be dropping the mountain/park name. Stay connected with IBTimes Australia for more updates on Apple and its products.

The robbery of the Shell gas station in the 1400 block of Apple Avenue was reported at 6:40 a.m. April 16. Money, a purse and tobacco products were taken, according to a report from the Muskegon Police Department. Muskegon police officers were able to locate three suspects on Allen Avenue who were apprehended after a foot pursuit, according to the report. Jonathan Wayne Summers, 32, has been charged with the robbery, court records show. The other suspects are juveniles, ages 14 and 16, who were lodged in the juvenile transition center and are being charged in Muskegon County family court, according to police. At the time the suspects were arrested, police recovered "an edged weapon and a realistic looking Airsoft-type handgun" along with items taken from the station, according to the police report. Summers was arraigned April 17 on the armed robbery charge, a potential life felony, as a four-time habitual offender. His bond was set at $250,000 cash or surety and his preliminary examination is set for 11 a.m. May 1 in front of Muskegon County District Judge Raymond Kostrzewa.

Photo: Apple The first iMac’s frightful code name was an in-joke that reflected Steve Jobs’ respect for Sony. The working name — “MacMan” — was so horrible it would “curdle your blood,” according to Ken Segall, the Apple exec who eventually came up with the name “iMac.” Nearly 20 years after Apple shipped the iMac G3, we now have an explanation for the craptacular internal name — courtesy of Phil Schiller, the guy who came up with it. Given Jobs’ marketing genius, the MacMan name always struck me as odd. I knew Schiller, now Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, came up with “MacMan” in the late ’90s, but never knew what it meant. Now we know. “Actually it was a joke between Steve and I,” Schiller tweeted over the weekend. “It started after he said he wanted a name as great as Walkman.” Ironically, Sony’s Walkman, a portable audio player line that ruled the electronics world at the time, would soon fall victim to Apple’s iPod. The MacMan mystery: Solved! The MacMan name was an in-joke at Apple. Photo: Phil Schiller/Twitter Schiller’s explanation came in response to a tweet about my book, The Apple Revolution, in which I relate the story of the MacMan’s name. “We already have a name we like a lot,” Jobs told the team of creatives working on the original iMac, “but I want you guys to see if you can beat it.” He then dropped “MacMan” on the group — and they immediately raced off to come up with a better alternative. The one thing I’d still love to know is whether Jobs actually liked the code name. Maybe he realized of how terrible it was, and simply MacMan it to motivate Segall and his colleagues to come up with something better. I suspect the latter — especially since Jobs’ instructions for coming up with a commercial name for the iMac G3 included “don’t make it sound like a toy, and don’t make it sound portable.” Still, given that the iMac G3 was the computer that signaled Apple’s turnaround as a company, it’s fascinating to contemplate what (if any) difference it would have made had it launched as the MacMan G3 instead of the iMac.

Photographer: Jason Henry for Bloomberg Businessweek Dexcom Inc. is working with Alphabet Inc.'s health unit, Verily, to deliver smaller, cheaper versions of its glucose monitoring devices.  The alliance may calm investors after Dexcom slipped last week when CNBC reported Apple has a small team of biomedical engineers developing sensors that can noninvasively and continuously monitor blood sugar levels to better treat diabetes. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.  "A product here would require a significant scientific breakthrough," Doug Schenkel, an analyst at Cowen & Co., wrote in a note about the Apple news. "Companies have been trying to develop products here for decades [and] no one has succeeded." Verily knows this well. Its first effort, a smart contact lens originally designed to continuously measure glucose in tears, has hit scientific obstacles. (The latest issue of Bloomberg Businessweek includes a longer look at Verily's business.) Verily's partnership with Dexcom may be more fruitful. The two companies are working to shrink Dexcom's current glucose monitors and aim to start selling a new version next year. But the real showstopper could be a later device roughly the shape of a guitar pick and as thick as mouse pad. Verily, which designed the hardware, is packing a battery, antenna, chip and even a tiny accelerometer inside this gadget, which would measure blood sugar and track physical activity. Dexcom and Verily hope to get this version to market in 2020. They're eager to target patients with type 2 diabetes, a market that is more than 20 times larger than the type 1 market.  Type 1 diabetics, usually diagnosed in childhood, can't create insulin because their immune system attacks the pancreas cells that make it. Without insulin, cells cannot absorb sugar, which is needed for energy. Type 2 diabetics are more typically diagnosed in adulthood, having become insulin resistant over time. Since type-2 diabetes is not immediately life-threatening, that will be a harder sell for Dexcom and Verily. Dexcom's current products can cost $3,500 a year or more without insurance coverage, according to Chief Executive Officer Kevin Sayer. A cheaper product may be attractive for short-term use by type 2 diabetics who are newly diagnosed and learning how to control their blood sugar levels, Sayer said. He declined to comment on pricing for the future devices.  The biotech executive praised his big tech partner, which is working to reduce the size and cost of the monitors. When Verily initially approached Dexcom proposing a partnership, the Alphabet unit "was thinking way bigger than we thought was possible," Sayer said in a recent interview. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Verily could help Dexcom expand into new Asian markets. In January, Verily received an $800 million investment from Temasek Holdings Pte, the Singapore state investment company. The city state does a lot of business in China, where Dexcom is not active. It's an alluring market. Roughly 110 million people in China have diabetes and the rate of type 2 diagnoses has exploded in recent decades, according to the World Health Organization. Schenkel noted that Dexcom's recent share weakness is about competition from medical peers, like Medtronic Plc, not just Apple. The Verily partnership gives Dexcom a shot at addressing the "entire spectrum of diabetes care," the analyst said. "The market opportunity is vast, and there is room for multiple players."

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals iPhone 8 (iPhone 7s?) design drawing shows vertical cameras & Touch ID on the backside Christian Zibreg on April 19, 2017 28 Apple is testing at least ten different iPhone prototypes and Bloomberg said yesterday that one of the designs being considered features an aluminum back rather than a glass one, and slightly larger dimensions. Today, Australian leakster Sonny Dickson tweeted out an image of what appears to be a technical drawing for an aluminum iPhone 8 prototype (could it instead be an iPhone 7s prototype?) that shows vertically aligned dual cameras and a fingerprint sensor on the backside. The drawing definitely appears to depict a dual-camera system on the back that’s aligned vertically for enhanced photography and Touch ID sensor relocated to the backside. This Design Verification Testing prototype could be Apple’s fallback model in case they fail to embed an optical fingerprint reader in the display, as has been rumored. But what if the hole under the Apple logo on the backside is for wireless charging, not the fingerprint sensor? Also, could this actually be an iPhone 7s prototype? Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube Bloomberg’s people familiar with the matter detailed at least three different iPhone prototypes that Apple is thought to have tested with manufacturing partners in Asia: Prototype #1: Flat OLED screen and the cover glass that curves into a steel frame. Design conceptually similar to iPhone 4 with symmetrical, slightly curved glass on the front/back and the curves similar in shape to those on the front of iPhone 7. “An earlier prototype design had a thinner steel band, leaving more noticeable curved glass on the sides,“ reads the article. Prototype #2: The same slightly curved front and steel frame like Prototype #1 with a glass back having “more dramatic curves” on the top and bottom akin to the original iPhone design from 2007. Prototype #3: Basically a tweaked Prototype #2, only slightly larger, with a simpler design with an aluminum back rather than a glass one. This is Apple’s fallback device because suppliers have so far “struggled to reliably produce heavily curved glass in mass quantities.” Japanese blog Mac Otakara said earlier this week that iPhone 8 might feature a stainless steel frame, vertically stacked rear cameras for advanced AR/VR features and other perks. Take Dickson’s leak with a grain of salt because, again, this is just one of the more than ten different iPhone prototypes that Apple has been testing, according to The Wall Street Journal. Given the significance of the so-called Tenth Anniversary iPhone, it wouldn’t surprise me to learn that Apple has been trolling us with various prototypes in an effort to keep the final iPhone 8 design under wraps for as long as possible.

Very unattractive. Christian Zibreg 7s, maybe? Abhijeet Gupta In the name of Christ, this better not be the final design. Sensor on the back, no way, that’s the worst place to put sensor at. I’m fine even if they place it at front like the current line up. In fact a lot of people won’t mind it. But, holy shit,  don’t place it at the back. burge It works on the LG G6 very well and unless you have tried it you don’t no how well it does work. Abhijeet Gupta Had an Life’s Garbage V20. Have a OP3 too, using the seven plus. Sensor on back can never be as good as it’s on the front. burge Its good on the G6. In fact I’m using it right now. No I have not gave up iOS for Android I am reviewing this device (not Android) for my network provider. Abhijeet Gupta Alright. therealjjohnson If my phone is laying on the table with the screen facing up, I would have to pick the phone up in order to unlock it versus just placing my finger on it. I don’t need to have the LG G6 to know that this process will not be ideal for me. Often times my phone is in that position while on the desk at work. Why would I ad an extra step in seeing a message that appears on my phone? burge So you don’t know your unlock code ? You don’t always need to use the Touch ID. And I hate to say this but mobile phone are designed to be held in the hand to be used. Christopher Lim Well, I have a 16 digit alphanumeric code… brymonster How about laying flat on a desk, or in a car dash mount, etc..? Jay Maybe.. I doubt that due because all previous S models use the the same external design as the model it is an upgrade of. This is pretty squared like an iPhone 4 and 5. Benedict seems alot of design changes for a ‘s’ version.. looks like the 8 to me.. Gethro It will be ic0dex Finally flat sides like the iPhone 5/5S. Also that Touch ID sensor is to low, the should use the Apple logo for the Touch ID and unlocking the display. I’m sure we’ll see the Touch ID placed inside the display by next year, eater from Samsung or Apple. That technology is just to new and I feel like they just started looking into it, it was never in their plans. If it’s something they wanted to do from 2-3 years ago then it would have already been done.

MMA Rules Please nooooo no Touch ID on the back, Put it in the Power Button instead therealjjohnson Only way this “looks” good is if you place it in the apple logo. Even then it would still be inconvenient. AwesomeSauce If touch ID is gonna go on the back then they should put it on the Apple logo.

Internet regulators in China’s capital plan to summon Apple to urge the American firm to tighten its checks on software applications available in its Apple Store, the official Xinhua News Agency reported on Wednesday. It also appears that this won’t be the first time government agencies have raised the topic of live streaming apps with Apple … NordVPN The Beijing Cyberspace Administration, together with the Beijing Public Security Bureau and Beijing Cultural Market Administrative Law Enforcement Team, has already met representatives from Apple about the examination of live streaming apps from its app store, Xinhua said. It’s not known which apps are involved, but a wide range of apps provide live streaming capabilities, including Facebook, Periscope, YouTube, Snapchat and Livestream. The Chinese government applies tight controls to its citizens’ access to the Internet, both in terms of the information people can read and the comments they are allowed to make online. Apple, while philosophically opposed to such restrictions, has to face the reality that ultimately the Chinese government can shut down its operations in the country. The move comes at an awkward time for Apple, when CEO Tim Cook has just accepted a Free Expression Award and spoken about the value of free speech.

Following the Note 7 crisis, Samsung’s share  reduced to 17 per cent, according to Cybermedia Research’s data for January and February 2017.  Figures for March were not immediately available.  Apple’s share grew to 80 per cent in January and February 2017, Faisal Kawoosa, principal analyst, telecom and semitronics, CyberMedia Research, said. “The addressable market for Samsung, therefore, in the super-premium smartphone segment has shrunk in the last few months, implying the company would have to work really hard to regain its lost ground,” Kawoosa said. According to experts, the super-premium or Rs 50,000 and above smartphone segment in India is about 4 per cent (or 4.5 million units) of the overall 113-million-unit domestic smartphone market, indicating a tough fight for Samsung. Apple on Tuesday said it was working on new features for its 10th anniversary edition of the iPhone, hinting it has no plans to abdicate the ground it had gained in Samsung’s absence, especially in markets such as India, where it is growing quickly.  But as the new iPhone would be launched only in the second half of 2017, Samsung, experts said, had time to work its way up in the super-premium segment. “There are some interesting features that the S8 has, such as a curved screen, which has been taken to the next level by the smartphone maker. The S8 offers consumers infinite display and this could be a big hook in India, where display plays a key role for buyers,” Niel Shah, analyst at Counterpoint Research said. Samsung has also priced the S8 competitively at Rs 57,900, while the S8+ is available for Rs 64,900.  The iphone 7 was launched in October last year at Rs 60,000 for a 32GB variant.  The 128GB version was available for Rs 70,000, and the 256GB for Rs 80,000.  The iPhone 7 Plus was available for Rs 72,000 for the 32GB variant; Rs 82,000 for the 128GB version, and Rs 92,000 for 256GB. According to Shah, while buyers of super-premium phones are not price-conscious, Samsung’s attempt to keep the S8’s pricepoints within the Rs 57,000-65,000 bracket would help to improve sales.

Apple, on the other hand, saw its share grow to 80 per cent in January and February, said Faisal Kawoosa, principal analyst, telecom and semitronics, at CyberMedia."The addressable market for Samsung, ... Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S8 and S8+ on Wednesday in India, filling the void for a “flagship device”.  Flagship means a  high-end smartphone.  Globally, as well as in India, Samsung is known for these high-end models, available for nothing less than Rs 50,000.  Prior to the Note 7 crisis, which saw users of the device plagued with battery explosions, Samsung commanded around 50-55 per cent share in the Rs 50,000 and above smartphone market in India.  Apple, on the other hand,  occupied a market pie of around 45-46 per cent in this segment — the super-premium smartphone market — according to Cybermedia Research. Following the Note 7 crisis, Samsung’s share  reduced to 17 per cent, according to Cybermedia Research’s data for January and February 2017.  Figures for March were not immediately available.  Apple’s share grew to 80 per cent in January and February 2017, Faisal Kawoosa, principal analyst, telecom and semitronics, CyberMedia Research, said. “The addressable market for Samsung, therefore, in the super-premium smartphone segment has shrunk in the last few months, implying the company would have to work really hard to regain its lost ground,” Kawoosa said. According to experts, the super-premium or Rs 50,000 and above smartphone segment in India is about 4 per cent (or 4.5 million units) of the overall 113-million-unit domestic smartphone market, indicating a tough fight for Samsung. Apple on Tuesday said it was working on new features for its 10th anniversary edition of the iPhone, hinting it has no plans to abdicate the ground it had gained in Samsung’s absence, especially in markets such as India, where it is growing quickly.  But as the new iPhone would be launched only in the second half of 2017, Samsung, experts said, had time to work its way up in the super-premium segment. “There are some interesting features that the S8 has, such as a curved screen, which has been taken to the next level by the smartphone maker. The S8 offers consumers infinite display and this could be a big hook in India, where display plays a key role for buyers,” Niel Shah, analyst at Counterpoint Research said. Samsung has also priced the S8 competitively at Rs 57,900, while the S8+ is available for Rs 64,900.  The iphone 7 was launched in October last year at Rs 60,000 for a 32GB variant.  The 128GB version was available for Rs 70,000, and the 256GB for Rs 80,000.  The iPhone 7 Plus was available for Rs 72,000 for the 32GB variant; Rs 82,000 for the 128GB version, and Rs 92,000 for 256GB. According to Shah, while buyers of super-premium phones are not price-conscious, Samsung’s attempt to keep the S8’s pricepoints within the Rs 57,000-65,000 bracket would help to improve sales.

Referred to, even in metric Australia, as the "9.7 Inch iPad", it provides 24.6cm diagonal screen display, and will appeal to people who don't want to pay for features they won't use. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Apple's latest iPad is leaner and cheaper than its predecessors. Photo: Supplied At $469 for the 32GB version and $599 for 128GB, these new models are $400 cheaper than the equivalent iPad Pro. They are also slower, a little thicker at 7.5mm, and at 469g around 30g heavier. You won't be able to use an Apple Pencil or attachable keyboard, and there's no anti-reflective coating. But are these issues for you? If you're saying 'so what' to all of the above, then you've just saved a whack if you're in the market.  The speakers aren't as good as the iPad Pro, but movie trailers and all my apps from Solar Walk to Garage Band sound superb and look crisp. Both have the same screen resolution (2048 x 1536 pixels), and both have reasonably good battery life, lasting at least a day or so before recharging. The most surprising thing is that there is a headphone jack, since Apple apparently introduced the 'no jack' policy in the iPhone 7. The new iPad has an  eight‑megapixel camera. It would be nice to have the double 12-megapixel wide-angle and telephoto cameras of the iPhone 7 Plus, but it's not a big issue, as most people tend to take photos with their phones. If you just use tablets for basic activities such as browsing the web, watching movies and TV, checking out social media, using apps, and playing games, then this is a decent choice at a reasonable price.

She usually doesn't call me directly unless she has a technology problem, and this time, it was a good one. It seems her iPad and her iPhone were both in a state of wanting her Apple ID password, and they were telling her the account was locked and to proceed she needed to reset the password. This wouldn't be a problem for many people, who could jump on a computer and reset the Apple ID password, but in my mother-in-law's case the iPad and the iPhone are her only ways to get online, so she was stuck. There was a link on her screen to reset the password, but for that she'd need to remember her security questions. Let's just say she and I didn't remember the security questions. You can also reset the password through email, so through Apple's website, I was able to reset her password and then log into her email account to make the change. I then called her back to tell her the new Apple ID password and talk her through getting her devices unlocked. Crisis averted. What happened was interesting. Apple released an iOS update, and both her devices had updated and restarted. To complete the update, you are asked to log back into your iCloud account. My mother-in-law didn't remember the password, so she locked the account after trying too many times without success. It didn't help that she really didn't understand what was going on with the update. Navigating a password reset procedure can be challenging, even for me sometimes. Luckily, my wife's iPhone did the same update the day before, and she was also presented with the screen to enter her Apple ID, which she did without incident, so when my mother-in-law called, I quickly recognized she was in the same boat. The take-away is to take your time to read and understand what is being asked in those little dialogue boxes. If all else fails, have a plan for someone who can help you navigate these situations. We've been talking about passwords and how to keep up with them. In this case, a detailed notebook containing your logins and passwords is invaluable.

This is a slot-in replacement for the plug section of a MacBook/Air/Pro charger, allowing it to be used in most countries around the world. An Apple power brick with this permanently attached has lived in my travel bag for the past couple of years, alongside the cables I carry with me. But when Apple slightly changed the design of the charger for the 2016 MacBook Pro, it no longer fit – a problem the company has solved with the latest version … NordVPN It looks virtually identical to the original, but Oneadaptr has modified the shape of the piece that mates with the power brick. As they wanted to make it compatible with both old and new chargers, it’s not a perfect visual fit with either – you do get a slight gap – but the important thing is that it fits easily and snugly to both. You also get four USB-A sockets, which could be useful for those who still have USB 3.0 cables for various devices, though personally I’ve swapped mine out for USB-C ones – and the higher power output of the USB sockets on the 2016 MacBook Pro means these sockets are redundant for me. You can see my video of the original version below, and the new one operates in exactly the same way. I have discovered a couple of drawbacks in travelling with it for two years. First, the way the power brick sits below the plug pins means that you can’t always use it with plug sockets positioned very close to the floor. This hasn’t proven a problem in hotels, but it has been the case in some airport lounges. Second, the weight of the power brick means that if the plug socket is on the loose side, it can fall out. I have sometimes had to resort to sitting the brick on a book or something to lend it support. But the convenience factor of a single unit ready to travel almost anywhere in the world means that I’ve used it on every trip since reviewing it, and the new one is now part of my travel kit too. For those of us in the UK, the company has also launched three different fold-flat USB power adapters. At 18mm thick, and no prongs sticking out, they are far easier to pack than conventional plugs. To use them, you press two buttons, and the three pins of a UK plug pop out. The first model gives two USB-A sockets, the second has four and the third has two plus a built-in 2000mAh battery that allows you to simultaneously recharge your devices and the battery-pack. In that way you can recharge your iPhone later in the day without mains power. The Twist+ World Charging Station is available in a choice of white or black for $44.95. The Flip Duo, with two 3.4A USB sockets, costs $19.99. The Flip Quad, with four sockets, costs $34.99. The Flip Power – two sockets plus power pack – is coming soon at a price to be announced.

Apple's iOS lost 8.9% in the last three months ending in February, marking its lowest share since 2014. Aggressive pricing from China's Oppo, Vivo helped propel these vendors to the top vendors in China pushing Apple to forth. Samsung's J series line came on strong in Q1 2017 to put Samsung back on top of the smartphone volume leaders. Today Xiaomi debuted their new Mi 6 with spec that makes Apple's iPhone SE look behind the times overnight and even gives the iPhone 7 a run with a price tag of only $360 with 64GB or $435 for Xiaomi's high-end Mi 6 edition made of ceramic.   Xiaomi was forced to push the pedal to the metal with this new smartpthone in order to fight their way back into the top four smartphone vendors list in China. The new smartphone offers a 5.5" display, a 12-megapixel dual rear camera like Apple's iPhone 7-Plus and offers a portrait style option with the Bokeh effect too, as our cover graphic illustrates quite nicely.   The new Mi 6 even offers a fingerprint scanner that's technically under the display, something Apple may introduce for the iPhone 8 even though rumors state that Apple suppliers are having problems with that feature. If Xiaomi could pull it off, can't Apple? Then again, Apple's proposed methodology is a little more sophisticated (one and two).     The new Mi 6 offers four-sided 3D glass with subtle curved edges will give the new Samsung S8 a run for its money. Apple's iPhone 8 is bound to be a smash hit in Q4, but the question will be, can they regain any ground against the aggressive Chinese vendors that offering equal quality for more than half the price.   Apple needs to take their second tier iPhone SE to a new level because as it stands, it's becoming a joke in Apple's second largest market in the world. That's as clear as day.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Cook: Apple not backing down on privacy fight By Li Zhou 04/19/17 10:01 AM EDT With help from Margaret Harding McGill and Nancy Scola COOK: APPLE NOT BACKING DOWN IN PRIVACY FIGHT — In a hard-charging speech last night at the Newseum where he accepted a 2017 Free Expression Award, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that defending its customers' abilities to speak freely is "a responsibility that Apple takes very seriously." And while he never uttered the word encryption, the company's fight with the FBI over unlocking an iPhone tied to the 2015 San Bernardino shootings was by all appearances the context for him declaring "we will continue to stand up for human rights, including the right to privacy." Story Continued Below "Companies can and should have values," Cook explained. At Apple, he said, "we have a perspective on major public issues, and we are prepared to take a stand for things that we deeply believe in." And his company, he argued, shouldn't be an outlier: "Hopefully more and more people are coming around to the view that a company is not some faceless, shapeless thing that exists apart from society. A company is a collection of human beings and part of the fabric of our society. A company like ours has a culture. It has values. And it has a voice. Apple has spoken out and will continue to speak out for what we believe as a company." A healthy democracy requires listening, too, Cook added. "We must be open to opposing and alternative points of view — not alternative facts, but alternative opinions, experiences, and arguments," Cook said at the ceremony, whose other awardees included ABC News correspondent Martha Raddatz and Congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis. TECHIES TALK AGENDA FOR H-1B REFORM — Tech groups said they’re prepared to work with the Trump administration following the president’s signing of his "Buy American, Hire American" executive order that includes a review of the efficacy of the H-1B visa program, Ashley reports. However, while tech has expressed broad optimism about the updates that could result from reviewing the H-1B visa program, it’s also coming at the issue with the hopes of promoting specific reforms, some of which Congress has previously faltered on. One change tech is particularly interested in is deterring the use of H-1B visas by low-wage staffing programs, which include outsourcing operations that bring in workers at a lower average pay grade, than the typical wages offered by top tech companies. — The fine print: The executive order, which came out last night, isn’t heavy on the specifics for reforming the H-1B program. It reads: “In order to promote the proper functioning of the H-1B visa program, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, as soon as practicable, suggest reforms to help ensure that H-1B visas are awarded to the most-skilled or highest-paid petition beneficiaries.” — “We should [improve our high-skilled immigration system] in a targeted manner by increasing the wage floor, treating super-dependent companies differently and banning their ability to do third-party placement,” says Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, an immigration advocacy group founded by Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg. Tech:NYC’s executive director Julie Samuels also sounded a note of caution and said she hoped that the proposed review would bolster the talent that the H-1B program attracts, rather than weaken it. “Our tech companies understand that H-1B needs reform and we welcome a review of the program, but we must ensure that those reforms attract more highly skilled workers, not fewer.” For the first time in five years, there was a decline in the number of H-1B visa applications this year. — Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), a longstanding supporter of H-1B reforms, praised the constraints introduced by the order. “I’m grateful that President Trump has taken my suggestions to heart by taking steps today to protect American workers and preserve limited H-1B visas for truly qualified, high-skilled foreign workers,” he said. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was bit more skeptical. He asked Trump to provide a concrete plan for reforms rather than simply conducting a review. “If he’d stop demonizing immigrants and work with us on immigration reform, we could get something done, something real, not just a study,” he said.

MARK YOUR CALENDARS — The Senate Judiciary Committee has a hearing on intellectual property scheduled for next Tuesday, April 25. ** A message from Samsung: Samsung's Vision for Tomorrow is to help enable a world where technology brings people everywhere a better quality of life. Learn more about how we are building on our heritage of innovation to deliver a future powered by connected and elegantly-designed products and services that put consumers firmly at the center. Samsung.com/VisionForTomorrow ** NEXT-GEN TV EMERGENCY ALERTS — POLITICO’s neighbor Sinclair Broadcast Group hosted a demonstration at its WJLA-TV office Tuesday of what emergency alerts for tornadoes or missing children could look like when transmitted using the next-generation TV standard known as ATSC 3.0. Get ready for something pretty different than we have today. Representatives from the Advanced Warning and Response Network, or AWARN Alliance, showed how future alerts with photos, maps, safety tips, hospital wait times and other detailed information could be conveyed over the airwaves to TVs and laptops. The IP-based standard will also allow for geo-targeted alerts that could be used to tell viewers in a tailored location of an impending emergency. Sinclair is a major backer of the technology, and the FCC is mulling a proposal that would allow broadcasters to use the technology on a voluntary basis. A glimpse of the demonstration here, here and here. GATES ON TRUMP ‘PRAGMATISM’ — “Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates says he’s counting on Donald Trump’s pragmatism when it comes to the president’s policies on health spending and foreign aid,” Bloomberg reports. “‘I’ve talked to him about HIV and how the U.S. should be proud of our work there,’ Gates said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Manus Cranny in Geneva, less than a month after meeting with Trump at the White House. ‘This dialog is important: you’ve seen his pragmatism on a number of things, and I’m certainly hoping that these health-related budgets receive some of that attention.’” SILICON VALLEY MUST-READS — — Facebook F8 rundown: Zuckerberg at the tech giant’s annual developers conference highlighted augmented reality as a focus for the company in the future and announced the debut of “Camera Effects,” a feature that’s open to developers and takes direct aim at rival Snapchat. … The bots have it: Facebook vice president David Marcus revealed that there are now 100,000 bots that are active on Facebook messenger. … Zuckerberg also addressed the recent murder that was uploaded to Facebook, expressing his condolences to the family of the victim and saying the company needs to improve its approach to monitoring content. “We have a lot of work and we will keep doing all we can to prevent tragedies like this from happening,” he said, without offering any specifics. — Theranos settles on Arizona refund: The beleaguered blood-testing company will dole out $4.65 million in refunds to all customers in Arizona that used its service, the AP reports. This settlement includes more than 175,000 people who had purchased blood tests, only a small fraction of which were accurate. — Verizon CEO’s merger mentions: CEO Lowell McAdam says he’s receptive to conversations with Comcast Corp., Walt Disney Co. and CBS Corp. about potential mergers, Bloomberg reports. The wireless giant is aggressively pursuing growth of its online advertising business and developing a fiber-optic network that will provide the groundwork for 5G. Verizon’s acquisition of Yahoo’s online assets is expected to close in June, Yahoo noted during its quarterly earnings report on Tuesday. MEANWHILE IN EUROPE — The European Union is looking to hear from its residents about their deepest, darkest fears with regard to the future of the internet, The Guardian reports. The EU has plans to roll out a series of surveys in the next few weeks to take the temperature on people’s views about everything from artificial intelligence to privacy to net neutrality. The Guardian is among the European publications that will share the results of these surveys. “We believe the digital world should respect the same values and rights we enjoy in the physical one,” said Jesús Villasante, a commission official. “We also believe Europe has the potential to be a key player in internet matters even if many important decisions are taken elsewhere.” MORE LAWMAKERS CHIME IN ON BDS — Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Mike Doyle (D-Pa.) leapt into the fray on business data services, urging the FCC to delay its vote on regulations overseeing competition in the business broadband market, via a letter to Chairman Ajit Pai on Tuesday. … Arkansas lawmakers Sens. John Boozman and Tom Cotton and Rep. French Hill, all Republicans, also asked Pai to establish a “reasonable transition period” while imposing the order, to ensure that all affected businesses have the opportunity to adapt to new pricing schemes or purchase necessary equipment. … A vote on the order is scheduled for the FCC meeting on Thursday. TRANSITIONS — Robert McDowell, a FCC commissioner who served under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, heads to Mobile Future as its chief public policy adviser. He leads the telecom group from Cooley LLP, where he works on telecom, media and tech accounts. — “Rubio's longest serving staff adviser leaves for TechNet,” by POLITICO Florida’s Marc Caputo: “Sen. Marco’s Rubio’s longest-serving paid adviser, Alex Burgos, is leaving the Republican’s Capitol Hill office to lobby and plot strategy for the technology industry. Burgos will officially begin work at TechNet — which bills itself as the “national, bipartisan network of innovation economy CEOs and senior executives” — on April 25 as its vice president of federal policy, government relations, and communications.
