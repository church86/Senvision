The Lexus fitted with various sensors is the latest entrant in the quest to make driverless cars commercially viable. Apple, a late comer, likely will face fierce competition from Google’s Waymo, which has carried out millions of miles of road testing, and Uber, which has been testing autonomous cars for months. Apple’s initiative, officially called Project Titan, is driven by hardware developed by Velodyne Lidar, while Apple is expected to develop the software. Based on documents obtained by Business Insider, Apple’s cars sound very much like other self-driving cars. The cars are “capable of sending electronic commands for steering, accelerating, and decelerating and may carry out portions of the dynamic driving task,” according to the documents. As with other driverless cars, humans are still present and can override the self-driving mode at any time. Despite being somewhat late to the game, Apple may find an opening in the way of a potentially lengthy legal battle between Waymo and Uber, with Waymo alleging that Uber stole its trade secrets. On Thursday, Uber executive Anthony Levandowski recused himself from work on driverless cars in the wake of the lawsuit, which alleges he stole intellectual property while employed at Google.   Credit : Voice of America (VOA) | Photo Credit: AP Advertisements Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Skype (Opens in new window) Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) About the Author New Delhi Times Bureau - Related News California Says Oceans Could Rise Higher Than Thought Ebola Vaccine Could Be a Game-changer US: More Pressure on Russia Needed to Halt Syrian Conflict Iraqi Officials: Car Bomb Kills at Least 3, Wounds 8 Tweet Pin It New Delhi Times A-2/59 Safdarjung Enclave New Delhi 110029, INDIA +91 11 26102520 [email protected] Article Submission Contact Us Terms of Use Privacy Policy About Us Copyright © New Delhi Times , All Rights Reserved 2017, [email protected] Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

(Image: REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji) Samsung and Apple maintained their leadership in the smartphone market in early 2017 while Chinese-based Huawei's strong growth cemented its number three position, a market tracker said Thursday. Research firm IDC said overall smartphone shipments grew 4.3 percent in the first quarter, slightly better than its prior forecast, to 347 million units. "The first quarter smartphone results further prove that the smartphone industry is not dead and that growth still exists," said IDC analyst Ryan Reith. sponsored Honor 6X (Grey, 32GB) ... ₹ 12,999.00 Honor 6X (Gold, 32GB) ... ₹ 12,999.00 Honor 6X (Grey, 64GB) ... ₹ 14,999.00 "There is no question that 2016 was a pivotal year for the industry as growth dipped to low single digits for the first time. However, we believe the industry will show some rebound in 2017, and the strong first quarter results certainly support this argument." Also read: Facebook to Step-up Fight Against Misinformation Reith said the 2017 market will feel the impact of the new Samsung Galaxy S8 flagship handset, and a widely expected announcement from Apple for its new iPhone later this year. According to the survey, Samsung led the market in the first quarter with a 22.8 percent share to 14.9 percent for Apple, with little growth for the top two vendors. But Huawei's sales jumped 21.7 percent to give it a 9.8 percent share, and fellow Chinese makers Oppo and Vivo, the number four and five vendors, respectively, also boosted their sales. IDC said the bulk of smartphone growth is likely to come from low-cost handset makers. "Although we have seen an abundance of premium redesigned flagships that just entered the market, moving forward, we still expect most of the growth to come from more affordable models in a variety of markets," said IDC's Anthony Scarsella. "Despite all the popularity and media hype around premium devices, we continue to witness a shift in many companies' portfolios geared towards affordable devices with premium-type styling compared to flagship models." He added that makers "have started to implement a single premium design language that ultimately blurs the lines between the high-end and the low-end, allowing the average consumer to jump on the brand without a hefty upfront investment." The report is based on preliminary quarterly estimates, with Apple due to report sales figures next week.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Prep Baseball: Wilson battles flu, beats Warriors for Agape League lead Friday Apr 28, 2017 at 12:01 AM Apr 28, 2017 at 10:19 PM Matthew Peters Staff Writer @DP_MattPeters APPLE VALLEY — Cameron Wilson had the flu throughout the week. He didn’t attend, let alone play in, Hesperia Christian’s Tuesday game. At various points he said he was on his hand and knees. But he knew he had to be ready to play Apple Valley Christian with first place in the Agape League on the line Friday afternoon. Wilson, a senior pitcher, had enough energy to make it through seven innings and helped the Patriots to a 7-4 victory. And he still had the energy to have his catcher jump into his arms after finishing the game with a strikeout. The Patriots had earned some hugs at that point. The win gives Hesperia Christian (10-2, 8-1 Agape League) the season series against the Warriors and a game lead with three league games remaining in season. It puts the Patriots in prime position to repeat as the league champs because they’ve outscored their next three league opponents (Victor Valley Christian, Bethel Christian and Lucerne Valley Christian) 94-9 so far this season. When asked how he felt Friday morning Wilson paused for a moment before saying, “I knew that I’d be alright, but still feeling real sick.” He got a B12 shot before game and felt good enough to pitch against the Patriots’ chief rival. “All week I was feeling awful,” Wilson said. “I’ve been on antibiotics all week and nausea medication. I was on my hands and knees throwing up in the bathroom. It was pretty bad, but I knew I had to get it together for the all the seniors on this team.” Wilson finished the game allowing four hits, four runs and four walks while collecting 10 strikeouts. He also went 2 for 2 with an RBI and two runs scored. The rivalry between the Patriots and the Warriors (12-4, 7-2 Agape League) has been a spirited to put it mildly. The two teams have gone back and forth in baseball and basketball for years. In baseball, Hesperia Christian won Agape League titles in 2014 and 2016, while Apple Valley Christian held the crown in 2015. On Friday, there was a lot of chatter throughout the game and a brief protest by Apple Valley Christian on Wilson’s pitch count before the end of the game. Wilson transferred from Excelsior in the offseason. Still, it didn’t take him long to get acclimated to the rivalry. “They are like our AAE,” said Wilson, referencing Excelsior’s top rival. “I kind of got the vibe in practice so I went with it.” Munoz said the teams are “kind of sick of each other. They bring out the best in us. And the worst in us and vice versa.” Hesperia Christian beat Apple Valley Christian 9-1 in the first matchup of the season before falling 5-4 in the second. Hesperia Christian took a 1-0 lead in the first inning Friday but couldn’t get to Grant Lyles again until the fourth inning. Connor Scott and Aaron Hough got the Patriots started in the fourth by reaching base on back-to-back errors. Then the top of the Patriots’ lineup did the damage. Jonathan Flores also reached on an error with a pop up to right and that gave Scott enough time to come home for 2-0 lead. Trevor Bragg crushed a double to left field to make it 3-0 and Wilson helped his own cause with a single to center for another run. Zach Schilling, who was 2 for 4 with a run, added another double to make it 5-0. Scott was 2 for 3 with a run and RBI. Bradyon Hampton was 2 for 4 with a run. Apple Valley Christian’s Aidan Delgado went 1 for 2 with a double. After allowing just one hit in the first four innings, Wilson struggled in the fifth inning. Apple Valley Christian got back into the game as he gave up three hits, a walk and four runs to make it 5-4. Hesperia Christian coach Michael Munoz contemplated taking him out of the game, but Wilson eventually recovered. He ended the threat in the fifth with a strikeout. That was the start of a run of four straight strikeouts and six strikeouts in the final seven batters he faced. Hesperia Christian added a run in both the sixth and seventh innings to give Wilson more than enough insurance.

This phrase was first used in 1922, which went on to become ‘An Apple a day keeps the doctor away’ in the 20th century. It gives us the impression that apple is the most nutritious fruit around. While it may be true to some extent, there are fruits like banana, cherries, papaya, oranges and blueberries that are also heavily loaded with nutrients. Then why was apple the only fruit that was made part of the folklore? The reason that this phrase lasted so long is because there is indeed some truth to it. Apples can prevent the buildup of cholesterol and can also manage blood pressure. Some studies even suggest that it can even protect you against some cancers. According to Boyer and Liu, when the adage was created, ‘apples were easy to grow. In fact, they still are easy to grow. And they can be in storage for almost a year after being harvested. Some studies also establish that apple’s nutritional value remains relatively intact for as long as 200 days after harvest.’ Moreover, you cannot deny the convenience of the fruit. It is easy-to-eat and since it consists of 85 per cent water and lots of fibre, it makes you full without burdening you with calories. Apple is among the most nutritious fruits, but it definitely doesn’t keep the doctor away. The key is to have a varied diet. Nutritionists across the globe are recommending 3:4 ratio diet – which means three different colours of fruits and four different colours of vegetables every day. So next time you go shopping, do not forget to pick citrus fruits, seasonal fruits and berries besides apples.

The ultrabook is powered by the Intel Core i7 processor. Reuters/Steve Marcus Both Apple MacBook Pro 15 and Dell XPS 15 are workhorses for professionals who are always on the go. While there is tough competition in the hybrid laptop market, it will be interesting to see how these two will fare against each other. Price is always a deciding factor for most. The MacBook Pro 15 costs US$2,399 (AU$3,200 approx). In comparison, the Dell laptop costs $350 less. The two are almost similar when it comes to size. While Dell goes for a traditional keyboard, it’s still better than the XPS 13. The Apple device uses the Butterfly keyboard, commonly found in MacBooks. The Apple device has retained the headphone jack, though it also offers four Thunderbolt 3 USB ports. The Dell XPS 15 also offers a headphone jack. In addition to that it comes with one USB 3.1 Thunderbolt 3/Type C, two USB 3.0 Type A ports, a Kensington lock port and a full-size HDMI 1.4. When it comes to battery performance, the Apple laptop beats Dell hands-down. The former can play a 4K resolution video at about 255 nits in brightness and Wi-Fi off for about nine hours, before going blank. XPS 15 provides only 5.5 hours, reports PC World. This is surprising for many as the Apple laptop packs a 74-watt-hour battery, as opposed to Dell’s 97 watt-hours. The XPS 15 however has a denser pixel screen, sitting at 3,840 x 2,160 pixels. The Apple device has a 2,880 x 1,600 pixel screen. In terms of gaming performance, the Dell laptop is a clear winner. The laptops are portable workstations for those who are away from office. MacBook Pro track pads have arguably been the benchmark. The MacBook Pro 15 has an unusually large track pad with glass surface and low friction level. On the other hand, the XPS 15’s track pad is equally good, though with a little more friction. In fact, the XPS laptop wins this track pad race because of a full 10-point touch-screen. The Touch Bar on MacBook still needs improvement. A big problem with the traditional keyboard in the XPS 15 is that it is a bit too little. However, upgrading the MacBook Pro 15 is more problematic than the Dell laptop. The CPU, GPU, RAM and even the SSD are soldered down. This is not the case with XPS 15 where the user can drop the 32GB RAM and install a larger 1TB NVMe PCIe SSD. Thus as is evident, Dell has released a laptop that is worthy of giving Apple competition and even emerge as a winner. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Apple MacBook Pro 15 and Dell XPS 15.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive State launches investigation following influx of crime at Bright Futures Academy Friday Apr 28, 2017 at 12:01 AM Apr 28, 2017 at 11:08 PM Charity Lindsey Staff Writer @DP_CharityMatthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — While awaiting a hearing to appeal the town’s intent to revoke its business license, a private school received a sudden visit Friday from investigators with the California Department of Education. In March, town officials received a San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department report that included 132 calls for service at Bright Futures Academy within a nearly 15-month period. Deputies responded to incidents involving a riot, gang activity, assaults, sexual batteries and thefts, among others, which spurred the CDE investigation, according to Assistant Communications Director Robert Oakes. “Because these were serious allegations, our Special Education Division folks got together and immediately sent investigators to the site,” Oakes said. The team flew in this week and, although Oakes expected them “to take formal action” by 4:30 p.m. Friday, he told the Daily Press their investigation would continue into next week. Bright Futures declined to comment on the investigation, but Chief Operating Officer Pamela Lamberth criticized the Sheriff’s report last week, calling it “inflated” for including medical aid, follow-up and after-hours calls, as well as 39 false alarms she said were caused by “faulty sensors” in the school’s alarm system. Lamberth also said she was concerned by the town’s lack of communication with the school prior to announcing its intent to revoke the business license. Bright Futures isn’t a typical private school; it’s a nonpublic, nonsectarian school (NPS), which serves students with “exceptional needs” through authorized state and federal funds, according to California Education Code. About half of the 78 students at the Apple Valley site have autism and intellectual disabilities, according to school officials, while the rest have emotional disturbance or learning disabilities. Twenty-two criminal reports were filed and eight arrests have been made at the school between Dec. 28, 2015, and March 11, 2017, according to Apple Valley station Capt. Frank Bell, who told the Daily Press a call from February 2016 involved “inappropriate touching” between a Bright Futures staffer and an underage student. “That case involved a 28-year-old female teacher’s aide who was also a monitor on the bus,” Bell said in an email. “The victim was a 15-year-old male student. An allegation was made alleging inappropriate touching between the two while riding on the bus, and a report was taken.” Bell said an investigation was submitted to the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s office. Charges haven’t been filed, but DA spokesperson Christopher Lee said the case is pending further investigation. CDE’s current investigation isn’t the first time the department has probed a Bright Futures school. In April of last year, CDE Information Officer Peter Tira confirmed to the Daily Press the school’s Perris site was being investigated by the department. Bright Futures spokesperson Janet Zimmerman said the previous investigation was “based on an anonymous complaint” at the Perris school, one of six Bright Futures locations listed in the CDE school directory. School officials say three are currently in operation — Apple Valley, Twentynine Palms and Riverside. CDE data shows the Perris site was closed within 10 months of opening, which Zimmerman said was due to “too few students” attending. The 20 students were moved to the Riverside location. Zimmerman said investigators “found nothing” in Perris last year; CDE officials have not yet confirmed this. Since an NPS like Bright Futures must be certified by CDE each year, the department’s investigation in Apple Valley has the potential to put a freeze on enrollment, Oakes said, but no action has yet been taken. Bright Future’s appeal hearing before the Town Council is scheduled for June 13, a letter to school officials shows. Charity Lindsey may be contacted at CLindsey@VVDailyPress.com or 760-951-6245.

Front Row: Adrianna Nickell (Fort Morgan High School), Vickie Segelke (Pioneer Elementary), Mary Rodriguez (Green Acres Elementary), Sheri Hulkovich (Baker Elementary), Connie Schingle (Columbine Elementary) and Peyman Javadi (Lincoln School). (Katie Collins / Fort Morgan Times) Fort Morgan Middle School's Crystal Apple Award winner Peggy Edson was presented her honor from Principal Jason Frasco. (Katie Collins / Fort Morgan Times) The best and brightest minds involved in Fort Morgan education gathered at the Country Steak Out last night where, even for a Thursday, teachers and staff managed to unwind with good food, great company and a signature style of humor that seems to spread easily through Fort Morgan schools. The 15th annual Crystal Apple Awards had area educators and employees in fine spirits as they celebrated the night with style, enjoying sensational eats, honors and even stories of strength and staunch hilarity that made the evening a rare opportunity to roast fellow colleagues, as well as bestow honors for those who make extra time and efforts to ensure their students soar. Crystal Apple Award winner Marcia Bledsoel is flanked with mighty superhero sisters as Assistant Director of Personnel for the Fort Morgan School District Ron Plug paints a colorful picture of a day at the Sherman School during last night's presentation. (Katie Collins / Fort Morgan Times) Fort Morgan Re-3 Superintendent Ron Echols was the host for the evening which he framed around the sentiment that all educators have a rare gift at their disposal - the gift of inspiration and change. After starting with a round of trivia for his district teachers, Echols pointed out that even these great events and people who made their mark on history could not hold a candle to the power that teachers have to make memories. After asking some of his area educators to stand and name their most memorable past teachers, Echols said, "My point here is that these great events and individuals helped to shape our country's history, but are still not as memorable to us as our favorite teachers were. Most of these people and places we've already forgotten," he continued, "but great teachers are rare." Advertisement As Fort Morgan High School Principal Ben Bauman noted during his award presentation to FMHS winner Adrianna Nickell, nominations for favorite educators tend to highlight the same efforts each year, so for the 2017 ceremony, hilarity and humor served an essential function; to provide light even in the midst of struggle. "'Goes the extra mile', 'always has a smile'; these are a few descriptions we see every year of our outstanding educators," said Bauman. "So, this year... I'd like to transform this into more of a roast," he exclaimed, much to the delight of the crowd filled with past Crystal Apple honorees as well. Indeed, a unique sense of humor outlined the careers of many 2017 apple honorees, who enjoyed a buffet, centerpiece and even Rockies ticket giveaways, during the event organized annually by the Crystal Apple Committee and Fort Morgan Times staff.

The "Mad Money" host said that with the federal government funded through the next week, investors can finally relax and gear up for yet another earnings-filled agenda. With that in mind, here are the stocks and events on Cramer's radar this coming week: Monday: Advanced Micro Devices, Cardinal Health Advanced Micro Devices: After shares of competitor Intel slid on its earnings miss on Thursday, Cramer is unsure that even the best of earnings reports from this chipmaker will garner a positive market reaction. "As I have repeatedly said, there is nothing wrong with the company AMD," Cramer said. "What can I say? The market's fallen out of love with last year's darlings." Cardinal Health: Once the health care services company reports earnings, Cramer thinks investors will start to notice its monumental acquisition of part of Medtronic's business, which will make it a more streamlined hospital supplier. Tuesday: CVS Health, Mastercard, Apple CVS: The health care retailer's stock has been under pressure lately as even pharmacies are squeezed by the rise of Amazon, but Cramer says there could be a hidden upside to earnings. "All that said, it's hard to really dislike a well run company like this that sells at just 13 times earnings. I say wait and see. Maybe numbers come down, maybe that's your chance," the "Mad Money" host said. Mastercard: Other payment services names like Visa and PayPal have reported great numbers this quarter, so Cramer expects a good report from Mastercard as well. "Here's one where you might want to see if the stock gets hit after it reports so you can come in at a lower price," he said. "That's been the pattern with the stock of this amazing company. It might be a great way to get in on a trend that still has a lot of room to run: the paper to plastic secular growth story." Apple: Expectations are sky-high for the tech titan's after-the-bell earnings report, and Cramer thinks they are justified. "Apple's doing so many things right. It's making the best products, developing a deep ecosystem with a substantial service revenue stream," he said. Plus, Apple's upcoming iPhone release is rumored to have an array of new features that makes the smartphone more functional and easier to handle, which should boost sales and new customer numbers, Cramer said. The company also stands to massively benefit from repatriation if the administration is able to implement it. All said and done, Cramer says investors should own the stock, not trade it, and eager buyers should hope for a post-earnings dip so they can buy it at a discount. Wednesday: Sprint, Facebook, Kraft Heinz Sprint: Cramer likes the stock of this telecommunications player, which will report its quarterly earnings Wednesday morning, but the "Mad Money" host is concerned that it may just be pushing along instead of really growing. T-Mobile CEO John Legere told Cramer he may be open to buying Sprint, but antitrust issues may stand in the way of a merger or acquisition, Cramer warned. "Any merger would lessen the competition for something that's become a modern day necessity," he said. "You really have to own these for fundamentals, not potential deals, and if that's the case, T-Mobile remains best of breed." Facebook: The social media colossus reports earnings after the bell, and unless its numbers are substantially better, Cramer expects a slight sell-off. "I like how competitive Facebook is," the "Mad Money" host said. "If you don't own it now, I think you might as well wait to see if we get that kind of weird sell-off that we usually get even after it reports a great number." Kraft Heinz: Investors will be tuned into the consumer goods name when it reports because it always seems to be on the lookout for a takeover candidate despite botching its proposal to buy Unilever last quarter. Cramer prefers Unilever's stock, but said that if Kraft Heinz floats the idea of a deal, it could get a boost. "We know, though, it takes two to tango, and I'm hard pressed to see who would possibly want to sell in that consumer packaged goods industry as the remaining players seem to have no inclination to let go of the reins," Cramer said. Thursday: Dunkin' Donuts, Activision Blizzard Dunkin' Donuts: Cramer contended that this coffeemaker, which will report earnings Thursday, "has quietly become a better investment than Starbucks over the last year, going from $46 to $55, while Starbucks has only traveled up four points." The "Mad Money" host credited the company's execution for the rise, saying that it has outperformed Starbucks in terms of stemming the U.S. slowdown. Activision Blizzard: The gaming sector is one of Cramer's favorite secular growth stories in the stay-at-home economy, and Activision Blizzard's earnings reports have a tendency to spur selling. "I say the trend's your friend," Cramer said. "This franchise is worth buying if it gets hit." Friday: Non-farm payrolls The Labor Department will release its monthly non-farm payroll data. The hiring statistics could have a detrimental effect on bank stocks if they are low, but Cramer expects the opposite. "If April turns out to have been a robust hiring month, and I think it will be, that gives the Fed breathing room to raise interest rates twice, and therefore the bank stocks will soar," he said. So with Washington policymakers at bay for now and the market digesting this week's madness, Cramer said to focus on the stocks that get unjustly beaten down for chances to buy high quality names next week. "This week we have a couple of stocks that tend to act badly after they report. Those are your best bets for investments. Otherwise, get ready for still one more opportunity to buy some Apple stock as Wall Street's naysayers try to say its best days are behind it. But, of course, they say that to each other on their iPhones," the "Mad Money" host said.

According to Mr. Kelly’s analysis of a Nikkei report, the release date of the “iPhone 8” will be delayed because of a combination of production issues with the curved OLED display and overheating issues in the wireless charging modules. The problem is, he names the wrong device. Mr. Kelly’s article reveals the importance for iPhone news contributors to keep their rumors and facts straight. Various mockups have appeared of the iPhone 8, but the iPhone 7S is supposed to look very similar to its predecessor but with a glass body (Image Credit: BGR One Year, Two Devices In Mr. Kelly’s article, he focuses solely on the upcoming iPhone 7S. However, he seems to think that device will feature the curved OLED display and wireless charging capability. That’s not what we’re hearing from the rumor mill, though, and it doesn’t make sense. We’re hearing that Apple will, in fact, release two new iPhones in 2017, much like the company did in 2016 with the iPhone 7 and SE models. The iPhone 7S will likely be a modest upgrade over the current generation. According to the Nikkei piece that Mr. Kelly references, it will include “minor improvements including a glass body.” It will not, however, incorporate the curved OLED display or wireless charging. Apple is expected to announce the true next-generation iPhone at around the same time. It’s this device that Ming Chi Kuo and Nikkei’s sources say is delayed. Mr. Kelly is right that we don’t know what the future device will be called, but nobody’s thinking it will be the iPhone 7S. Current thoughts include iPhone 8, iPhone Edition, iPhone Anniversary Edition, and iPhone X. A Good Look at History Tells Us a Lot Where Mr. Kelly has failed is in understanding Apple’s pattern throughout history in releasing new iPhones. While it’s true that in odd-numbered years, Cupertino unleashes “S” models, those have always been modest upgrades over their predecessors. With the iPhone 4S, we got Siri. The iPhone 5S saw the addition of Touch ID. When the iPhone 6S came out, it introduced us to Force Touch. All of these new devices had one thing in common, though – they all used the same basic form factor as the iPhone that preceded them. We didn’t see major changes to the handset. We could typically use the same cases and other accessories that manufacturers released for the non-S models. What we didn’t see was a change to the overall shape of the device, like we would notice if the 7S came with a curved OLED display. Again, One Year, Two Devices Just like 2016, when the iPhone 7 and SE came out, we expect to see two new iPhone models in 2017. The iPhone 7S, which Mr. Kelly seems to think will be the major upgrade, will only feature modest updates. Perhaps the glass body, or maybe Apple has another software/hardware feature to introduce that won’t change the form factor of the device. On the other hand, the major upgrade to the iPhone lineup is expected to be one to truly take notice of. The rumors say that device will perhaps be called the iPhone Anniversary Edition to commemorate 10 years of iPhones. It’s expected to feature the curved OLED display and major enhancements to charging and performance. It’s Friday, so Let’s Wrap This Up Mr. Kelly seriously needs to get his rumors and history straight if he’s going to be taken seriously in the Apple news arena. His article, “iPhone 7S Leak Reveals Apple Has Problems,” is both right and wrong at the same time. The article correctly sums up that rumors say next generation of the iPhone is running into design and production snags. Where Mr. Kelly seems tripped up is he incorrectly ascribes those facts to the wrong device. From all that we and others have heard, the iPhone 7S is right on schedule. It’s the iPhone 8 that’s delayed. One year, two devices.

New details to add fuel to the fires of speculation came out recently, and now we’re thinking that Cupertino’s Siri speaker might look remarkably similar to the Mac Pro. There Will Always Be Leaks As secretive as Apple is, there are almost always leaks. This time, though, we actually have a name to the leaker – a certain Sonny Dickson. Mr. Dickson shared details with Mashable’s Jen Ryall, who posted much of the information via Twitter. More claims from @SonnyDickson on Apple’s Alexa competitor: – Think Mac Pro style. – Same style UE boom mesh. – Possible release WWDC. 2/2 — Jen Ryall (@jennijenni) April 28, 2017 This isn’t the first time Mr. Dickson has unveiled Apple’s secrets. The young man from Ocean Grove, Australia seems to have great connections, and was the first to release photographs of the iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C, iPad mini 2, and the fifth-generation iPad. He was also the first person to reveal detailed images of the Touch ID sensor on the iPhone 5S. In 2015, he unearthed and divulged quite a bit of information about the Force Touch feature on the iPhone 6S. All that to say, the kid’s leaks seem to be legitimate. What to Expect from the Siri Speaker Mr. Dickson told Ms. Ryall that Cupertino is currently putting the finishing touches on the design of its Amazon Echo competitor. Expected to be marketed as a Siri and AirPlay device, the project is codenamed “B238” and will supposedly borrow design cues from the Mac Pro. Internally, the speaker is said to feature Beats speaker technology. Mr. Dickson says the B238 is a round, “fat” device with a concave top where you will locate the physical controls. Speaker mesh similar to that used in the UE Boom will cover the round body of the device. Mr. Dickson says we should “think Mac Pro style” when imagining what the Siri speaker will look like. The device would allow you to use Siri without your iPhone or iPad, and I expect it would allow quite a few of the HomeKit features that currently depend upon a fourth-generation Apple TV or newer iPad. Coming Sooner Than You Might Expect Mr. Dickson even revealed when the new Siri speaker is expected to debut. He informed Ms. Ryall of a possible release during Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference, slated to take place from June 5 to June 9 this year. We’ll certainly be waiting.

Emergence of Robots Will, Remarkably, Force a Change in iPad Design iPhone 8 Smokes Samsung Galaxy S8 in Leaked Geekbench Performance Tests 2 Comments Add a comment geoduck April 28, 2017 Very dubious. First Apple has made a great fuss about how much better having your AI with you is than having one over there in the other room. True they have suddenly reversed direction in the past, but this is one area I think they’re right. Second, Siri will need to get a LOT, like a power of ten, better before this would be useful. I don’t need a dedicated speaker in the room that I can ask “Who wrote the song ‘Muskrat Love”. I would like a device I could say ‘I don’t know what to do this weekend’ and it would look at my activity history, and what’s going on locally, my bank balance, and the weather, and suggest something. If Siri was to the point where I could converse with it, not just ask specific questions, then I’d use it a lot more. On my phone and, maybe even on a speaker or in the car, or wherever. April 28, 2017 at 4:18 EDT PM Doug Petrosky April 28, 2017 First, I don’t remember them ever saying such a thing, and second what digital assistant has access to my bank account because everything else you mentioned Siri would have access to. So back to my standard beef when discussions lead to HomeKit bashing. 1) 95% of homes don’t have existing IOT hardware. 2) 90% of the major IOT things are homekit or have a homekit equivalent. 3) Many, (i’d even argue most) homekit devices are more secure because security is a design focus but also, they don’t have an unencrypted foot print. Most IOT devices rely on an external site to allow access, but if you configure as HomeKit, you never make a connection to those sites. You only control locally or through the VPN tunnel created between your device and your 4th gen AppleTV. My Hunter Fan’s are an excellent example. The app wanted me to register with their website for remote access but because homekit handles that for me, I never set this up and my fan’s don’t communicate with that site and are thus not available to attack through that vector.

By: AP | San Francisco | Published:April 29, 2017 9:46 am Apple’s decision to withhold royalties will cost Qualcomm up to 0 million in the current quarter alone, based on revised revenue estimates that Qualcomm released. Apple is refusing to pay any royalties owed to mobile chip maker Qualcomm for some of the features in the iPhone, escalating a patent feud that has turned the former business partners into bitter adversaries. The latest twist in the dispute represents a major blow for Qualcomm, which depends on licensing fees for a large portion of its revenue. Apple’s decision to withhold royalties will cost Qualcomm up to $500 million in the current quarter alone, based on revised revenue estimates that Qualcomm released Friday. “This is getting ugly, the level of hostility just went up another notch,” said technology analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy. As retaliation, Qualcomm could seek a court order halting iPhone sales until Apple pays the royalties that Qualcomm contends it’s owed, Moorhead said. Qualcomm hasn’t threatened to go to that extreme yet, but its top lawyer made it clear on Friday that the San Diego company is girding for a fierce fight with its Cupertino, California-based Apple, the world’s most valuable company. “We will continue vigorously to defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel. Qualcomm now expects its earnings for the period to range from 75 to 85 cents per share. Apple concedes it and its suppliers owe Qualcomm some licensing fees on iPhone sales. But Apple believes Qualcomm has been abusing its power in the mobile chip market to charge for royalties on features that aren’t covered by its patents. Qualcomm, in turn, has accused Apple of breaking contracts in an attempt to lower its licensing fees and also interfering in deals negotiated with iPhone suppliers. The stalemate prompted Apple to sue Qualcomm in January in a federal complaint. Qualcomm denied the allegations and fired back with its own lawsuit against Apple earlier this month. In a Friday statement, Apple said it won’t pay Qualcomm any further royalties until the courts determine the amount, a process that could take several years. “As we’ve said before, Qualcomm’s demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own,” Apple said. Rosenberg reiterated that Qualcomm holds “valid and enforceable” licensing agreements on various features in iPhones. Apple’s suspension of royalty payments marks “the latest step in Apple’s global attack on Qualcomm,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel. Apple isn’t alone in its accusations against Qualcomm. The US Federal Trade Commission also has filed a lawsuit alleging that Qualcomm has been imposing unfair licensing terms on manufacturers. With the loss of iPhone royalty payments, Qualcomm now expects its revenue for its April-June quarter to range from $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion, down from its previous forecast of $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion. Qualcomm now expects its earnings for the period to range from 75 to 85 cents per share. That’s down from an earlier projection of 90 cents to $1.15 per share. Investors shook off the shock of Qualcomm’s lowered guidance after initially driving down the company’s stock. Its stock rose 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $53.74 on Friday. The stock has fallen by about 15 percent since Apple filed its lawsuit.

Is it a retail popularity contest (that it lost to Android long ago)? Nah, it’s a little superficial. Only a little superficial — no, what it really needs is to maintain the brand’s street cache of being the go-to technology that few actually need, but that everyone has to respect for one reason or another. Ah, Macs. But when it comes to the iPhone, does padding out hardware revenues on a big upgrade to trigger a “supercycle” of customers that have been hiding in caves for so long to buy a shinier, newer phone sound like a good idea? Is it all for a new earnings record or two? Proving that it can still master the vertical it has held for nine years as it has extracted the most financial success that any mortal has ever seen? Gosh, you’re getting it now. Importantly to us, is it fair to judge Apple in narrow, enthusiast terms to sate our inferiority complex? Like, “A11 vs. Snapdragon 835” and “SO MUCH RAM“? The overall sentiment I’m getting from the Pocketnow community is that whatever Apple wants to do this fall, doing it “better” won’t validate it from “copying” Samsung’s hardware styling for the Galaxy S8. And from the factory scratchings and analyst yarns we’ve been covering, it seems like we’re due for “The Battle of the Eights”. By the way, we should look into trademarking that phrase for our comparison coverage. Reminder: an iPhone is not made out of playing cards. You don’t magically pull one out or change an ace to a “2” to have everything suddenly fall apart. And yet, the goals that Apple wants to achieve with a given iPhone will endlessly differ, evolve, devolve between the years. With that in mind, it’s these factors being the investors, the competition and Apple that are brewing up, in my view, a storm that could end up disenfranchising savvy consumers that, for one reason or another, will say that great isn’t good enough. They want the best. Some of the things that Apple is reportedly trying to achieve that Samsung could not — such as an on-screen Touch ID sensor, a dual-camera system and an OLED display curving on all four sides — may fail to get on the iPhone 8, at least as ideally envisioned. The rut of R&D and production hell for some of its major components will displace design elements that will make the iPhone 8 an even more foreign departure from what the iPhone 7 was. Sure, crack your jokes at how Chief Designer Officer Jony Ive will play limbo if things fall out, but it does put Tim Cook with some hand wringing as well: should familiar features or those with a fair expectation to be present in the iPhone 8 be abandoned in place of untested alternatives? You shouldn’t compare the chance of the complete removal of Touch ID to the omission of the headphone jack from the iPhone 7. In addition to advancing the technical and qualitative fields in the audio front, it also had financial upside it could ride with the switch to Lightning-connected headphones. If the on-screen fingerprint sensing technology can’t be implemented by prime time, will we be able to consistently rely on, say, a 3D facial scanner to authenticate access into our iPhone 8 devices? There’s a downside to errors and, at best, perseverance of status quo if a successful interchange happens. If screens are designed to “pop” like corn, will most shoppers that have historically been on Apple’s side be able to hold a Galaxy S8 and an iPhone 8 in their hands and honestly keep loyal? On paper, a flatter and smaller display on the second machine would pale against a larger display that comes right up against curved glass. And that S8 wouldn’t that much bigger than such an iPhone, either. With these iffy parts coming in slow and unsteady, this has made all the research and whispering on the iPhone 8 ever so bold: a recent rag claimed that conservative iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models have been shelved, perhaps, in favor of two advanced iPhone 8 models, though we have no intelligence to back that up. “It’s coming,” the town crier said. “Soon enough, you’ll see.” If that’s to be, then remind us how this will help Apple net 80 million unit sales if the parts aren’t shipping in as fast as it’d like? Will the company have sunk too much money into these iPhones to even keep these things competitively priced as UBS would like to think? This sure would be a bad time to introduce a $1,000 iPhone to the market when the more topically appealing communicator in the Galaxy S8. Worst case If the bottom falls out on this situation, then Apple will have failed by appending a needless risk in an environment that pressured it to advance its own standards — when on the whole it was just keeping up with the Jonses — while encountering the tightened constraints of its operations. To rely solely on the iPhone 8, maybe an iPhone 8 Plus, that will stress the supply chain to wits extent to drive revenues is a practice of faith. Business calls faith a fool’s asset. If by necessity we see major features talked up here missing from the final product at a price we’re just coming to grasp, Tim Cook may not wake up one day late in January with a bright voice for the moneymakers. If Infinite Loop has a new, exclusive and attractive approach to software or such a service hidden up its sleeve, it’s certainly doing a good job of keeping it hidden. Stickers? You don’t need an iPhone 8 for stickers. A messaging system that just works? Again, you don’t need an iPhone 8. You don’t even freaking need iOS for that crap.  A GIF maker? Please, child, you’re gonna have to come get a license with big media to make it any bit worthwhile. Actually, with Apple locking itself with media types to feed its TV desires, we wouldn’t be surprised if it came to that. Of course, none of this matters if reality proves friendlier to the corporation. I personally think that we’re not anywhere near such a doomsday prospect, even though I definitely imagined it to be within the realm of possibility. How far down the road we go is currently of public opinion, though, and we’d like to hear yours.   Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

Share this article Share Aerial photographs of the 175-acre campus that cost roughly $5bn show the giant circular structure. The giant saucer-like building will house 13,000 employees across more than 2.8million square feet of office space. The campus will also have nearly 80 acres of parking to accommodate 11,000 commuters in sprawling Silicon Valley. Since Apple unveiled its plans in 2011, the move-in date has slowly receded. Jobs' initial projection was 2015, but this spring is now most likely, according to people involved in the project. The campus was dreamed up by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who died of respiratory arrest caused by a a pancreatic tumor in October 2011 Former Cupertino mayor Gilbert Wong described the moment Jobs unveiled his plans for his spaceship-like campus Wong said: 'I’m sure you’ve watched The Willy Wonka movie.' He added: 'He had this little key and you don’t know what’s behind this door' The main building boasts the world's largest piece of curved glass and will be surrounded by a lush canopy of thousands of trees Professor Louise Mozingo said Apple is 'creating an icon' and added: 'It's not about maximizing the productivity of the office space, it's about creating a symbolic center for this global company' More than $1bn was allocated for the interior of the main building alone, according to a former construction manager. The campus is something of an exception to the trend of radically open offices aimed at fostering collaboration, said Louise Mozingo, a professor and chair of the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning at University of California, Berkeley.  Its central office building - a massive ring of glass frequently likened to a spaceship - could be a challenge just to navigate, she noted. 'It's not about maximizing the productivity of the office space, it's about creating a symbolic center for this global company,' she said. 'They are creating an icon.' The main building - which boasts the world's largest piece of curved glass - will be surrounded by a lush canopy of thousands of trees.  An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. The campus will have a 1,000-seater auditorium, a gym and 300,000 square feet of 'research' space It will also have jogging and cycling trails and more than one thousand bikes will be kept on site at all times Parking for the campus will be hidden from view which will enable 80 per cent of its surface area to be covered in trees The auditorium will be underground and will be where Apple's CEO Tim Cook will present the companies keynotes ahead of product launches The auditorium (not pictured) will be covered with a circular glass pavilion that will also be an access point for employees and guests Technology companies have long favored generic office parks, but the Apple Campus 2 marks a new chapter in Silicon Valley architecture.  Little remains from the cement-laden campus Apple acquired from Hewlett-Packard, though the iPhone maker preserved a century-old barn that remained intact. But what was most striking to those who worked on the project was Apple managers' insistence on treating the construction of the vast complex the same way they approach the design of pocket-sized electronics. Apple's in-house construction team enforced many rules, including one stipulating that no vents or pipes would be reflected in the glass. And guidelines for the special wood used frequently throughout the building ran to some 30 pages.  The company's keen design sense enhanced the project, but its expectations sometimes clashed with construction realities, a former architect said. 'With phones, you can build to very, very minute tolerances,' he said. 'You would never design to that level of tolerance on a building. Your doors would jam.' The building's power will primarily be provided by natural gas and the local energy grid will only be accessed in emergencies The building will stay eco-friendly with natural ventilation that works instead of air-conditioning for 70 per cent of the year The campus will also use both low energy LED lighting where natural light doesn’t reach and on-site recycling The building was described by the San Francisco Weekly as a ‘massive glass doughnut' for its glass-plated walls and circular shape more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Video of Marinna Rollins murdering her service dog Cam Watch video Dog has to SMELL owner to recognise him after drastic weight loss Watch video Energetic puppy does adorable sploot on floor after playing around Watch video Moment officer kills biker by ramming motorcycle off road Watch video Lesson learned?

But Mr de la Torre ultimately saw that Apple executives were not trying to evoke the iPhone per se, but rather following something akin to the Platonic ideal of form and dimension. 'They have arrived at design principles somehow through many years of experimentation, and they are faithful to those principles,' Mr de la Torre said. The circular, four-story building will be around a mile in circumference and a third of a mile wide One of the most vexing features was the doorways, which Apple wanted to be perfectly flat, with no threshold Little remains from the cement-laden campus Apple acquired from Hewlett-Packard Apple preserved a century-old barn that remained intact on the site more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Video of Marinna Rollins murdering her service dog Cam Watch video Dog has to SMELL owner to recognise him after drastic weight loss Watch video Energetic puppy does adorable sploot on floor after playing around Watch video Moment officer kills biker by ramming motorcycle off road Watch video Lesson learned?

Ivanka Trump plays with son Theodore in the park Watch video Backing dancer gropes singer in sick prank on Italian TV show Early in construction, Apple managers told the construction team that the ceiling - composed of large panels of polished concrete - should be immaculate inside and out, just as the inside of the iPhone's audio jack is a finished product, a former construction manager recalled. Each of the thousands of ceiling panels had to win approval from both Apple's in-house team and the general contractor, once at the shop and then again at the construction site. 'The things you can't see, they all mattered to Apple,' the former construction manager said. One of the most vexing features was the doorways, which Apple wanted to be perfectly flat, with no threshold. The construction team pushed back, but Apple held firm.  'We spent months trying not to do that because that's time, money and stuff that's never been done before,' the former construction manager said.  Signage also required a delicate balancing act, as Apple wanted all signs to reflect its sleek, minimalist aesthetic, but the fire department needed to ensure the building could be swiftly navigated in an emergency.  KEY FEATURES OF APPLE'S SPACESHIP-LIKE CAMPUS 2 Appearing as a giant saucer, the Silicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will be home to 13,000 Apple employees. There will be jogging and cycling trails, with more than one thousand bikes kept on site at all times, which staff can use to make their way around. The Spaceship will have 360-degree curved glass fronted walls and central courtyard as well as a 1,000-seater auditorium, a gym and 300,000 square feet of 'research' space. Apple Campus 2 will additionally have underground parking hidden from view, meaning 80 per cent of the site can be covered in trees. The site was previously owned by Hewlett Packard and the majority of the area is currently covered in asphalt. Elsewhere underground, the auditorium will be where Apple's CEO Tim Cook will present the companies keynotes ahead of product launches, for example. This auditorium will be covered with a circular glass pavilion that will also be an access point for employees and guests. The building's power will primarily be provided by natural gas and the local energy grid will only be accessed in emergencies. The glass structure will also be fitted with solar panels.  The circular, four-story building will be around a mile in circumference and a third of a mile wide and was described by the San Francisco Weekly as a ‘massive glass doughnut.' The building stays eco-friendly with natural ventilation that works instead of air-conditioning for 70 per cent of the year, low energy LED lighting where natural light doesn’t reach, and on-site recycling.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > iPhone 7 Plus Qualcomm LTE Modem Outperforms Intel LTE Modem by Significant Margin iPhone 7 Plus Qualcomm LTE Modem Outperforms Intel LTE Modem by Significant Margin Thursday, 20 October 2016 With the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple elected to use LTE modems from two different sources, Qualcomm and Intel. The A1778 and A1784 iPhone models use a GSM-only Intel XMM7360 modem while the A1660 and 1661 iPhone models use a GSM/CDMA-compatible Qualcomm MDM9645M modem. Apple's decision has already caused some disappointment among customers because the GSM-only Intel modem is not compatible with as many carrier networks as the GSM/CDMA Qualcomm modem, and now independent testing conducted by Cellular Insights suggests there are some significant performance differences between the two modems, with the Qualcomm modem outperforming the Intel modem. Using an R&S TS7124 RF Shielded Box, two R&S CMW500, one R&S CMWC controller, and four Vivaldi antennas, Cellular Insights created a setup to simulate LTE performance at different distances from a cellular tower using two iPhone 7 Plus devices, one with an Intel modem and one with a Qualcomm modem. The goal of the test was to measure the highest achievable LTE throughput starting at a Reference Signal Received Quality of -85dBm (a strong signal) and gradually reducing the power level to simulate moving away from a cellular tower where signal is weaker. Three LTE bands were tested: Band 12, Band 4 (the most common band in North America), and Band 7. In all three tests, both the iPhone 7 Plus models offered similar performance in ideal conditions, but as power levels decreased, Cellular Insights saw "unexplainable sharp dips in performance" in the Intel modem, finding a gap "north of 30%" in favor of the Qualcomm iPhone 7 Plus. In the charts, the Qualcomm modem maintains noticeably higher throughput speeds than the Intel modem as signal strength decreases. In real world conditions, this would suggest the Qualcomm modem does better in areas where the cellular connection is weak, with faster throughput speeds. Cellular Insights describes the Band 12 test below: Both iPhone 7 Plus variants perform similarly in ideal conditions. At -96dBm the Intel variant needed to have Transport Block Size adjusted as BLER well exceeded the 2% threshold. At -105dBm the gap widened to 20%, and at -108dBm to a whopping 75%. As a result of such a huge performance delta between the Intel and Qualcomm powered devices, we purchased another A1784 (AT&T) iPhone 7 Plus, in order to eliminate any possibility of a faulty device. The end result was virtually identical. [...] At -121dBm, the Intel variant performed more in line with its Qualcomm counterpart. Overall, the average performance delta between the two is in the 30% range in favor of the Qualcomm Cellular Insights also created a chart that compares the edge of cell performance of several different smartphones. The increasing numbers on the X-axis below represent increasingly poor signal strength, while on the Y-axis, a higher throughput number indicates better performance. The iPhone 7 Plus with an Intel modem demonstrates the poorest performance of all phones tested. According to Cellular Insights, in every single test, the iPhone 7 Plus with a Qualcomm modem "had a significant performance edge" over the iPhone 7 Plus with an Intel modem. For more information on the testing methodology and greater technical detail on the results, make sure to check out Cellular Insights' full comparison article.Related Roundup: iPhone 7 Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Buzz60 - on October 27, 2016< > Embed The iPhone 7 Secret: Is One Model Much Slower? 01:10 Reports show the newest versions of the iPhone 7 are powered by different modems and one is slower.

Amazon just announced the Echo Look, a new camera and style assistant From Google Glass to the Apple Newton, a museum in Sweden is shining a spotlight on some of the tech sector’s biggest misses. The Museum of Failure as it’s known, has products from Apple, Sony, Kodak and Google, as well as several other makers, all of which struggled with consumers. The collection covers over sixty “failed products and services from around the world,” according to a description on the museum’s web page. Samuel West, the museum’s curator, advises companies on how to successfully innovate by learning from failure. “A lot of tech failures are because immature technology is launched [such as] Google Glass, Apple Newton,” West told Fox News in an email. A tech product can be marketed “before it actually works and way before it is useful,” he said. But that’s all part of ultimately coming up with a successful innovation. “Innovation always requires an acceptance of failure…if you’re afraid of failure, innovation is impossible,” West added. Here are some of the notable flops from the exhibition, due to open in June in Helsingborg, Sweden.

That happened with Kodak, an early leader in digital cameras and is probably one of the best examples of innovation that failed. The DC40, manufactured by Kodak, was also branded as the Apple QuickTake 100. (Yes, Apple sold a standalone camera once.) “[Kodak’s] failure was an inability to truly embrace the new business models [that] disruptive change opens up,” according to an annotation attached to the Museum’s DC40 exhibit. “Kodak created a digital camera, invested in the technology, and even understood that photos would be shared online.” What Kodak failed to do was realize that online photo sharing was a new business, “not just a way to expand the [photo] printing business,” according to the annotation. Google Glass Google’s attempt to make smart glasses the next big thing in personal gadgets failed because the technology “still didn’t have any useful applications,” West told Fox News. Privacy concerns, due to the potential for furtive video recording, were also its downfall.

Other notable failures include the Apple Newton, which suffered from poor handwriting recognition, questionable utility, and a high price. (Apple did go on to create the iPhone, however.) Another was the Twitter Peek, “the world’s first dedicated Twitter device,” as described on the product’s package. Gizmodo described it as being “so dumb it makes my brain hurt.” Last but not least was the Sony Betamax, one of the most oft-cited flops. “Sony refused to collaborate with other manufacturers, while JVC focused on building a collaborative ecosystem by licensing the VHS format,” according to an annotation attached to the Betamax exhibit. “The classic story of tech innovation failure demonstrates that technical excellence and being first to market is not enough.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under apple ,  gadgets ,  google glass ,  harley-davidson ,  inventions ,  museums ,  nokia ,  sweden ,  Tech ,  twitter Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Jeff Bezos close to eclipsing Bill Gates as world's riches...

Follow him here. Apr 29, 2017 Share Tweet Image via Twitter Apple wants to be at the forefront of the inevitable rise of the self-driving car. What is perhaps a first stab from the tech giant emerged from Apple’s facility Friday and was spotted driving around Silicon Valley. The car was a souped-up Lexus RX450h SUV. This appears to be the earliest stage of real-world testing, but Apple is not taking its time. They're in an arms race. The company just obtained a permit to test this technology in California April 14. The permit covered "three vehicles, all Lexus RX450h, and six drivers." Related Apple Is Ready to Shake Up the Self-Driving Car Industry Apple Is Close to Testing a Self-Driving Car, Report Says A New York Times Report Shows Apple's Self-Driving Car Could Be in Trouble The SUV was covered with high-tech equipment like optical cameras that made it stand out on the roads juuuust a little bit. The kit included sensors that helped the car observe the world around it, according to Engadget. The sensors came “off the shelf” from third parties like Velodyne—they were not custom, Apple-designed hardware. A New York Times report from September stated Apple was rethinking its strategy in pursuing self-driving cars, but the company's recent actions indicate the tech behemoth is fully committed to seeing this through. Apple is on a mission to be the leader in this realm, but it will face competition, as Alphabet and Tesla are among the companies vying to get self-driving cars—AKA “autonomous-car technology”—on the road. California has granted permits for the testing to 30 companies so far. These companies include startups, car makers, automotive suppliers, and giants like Apple and Google.

Apple’s shot at autonomous-car technology is known internally as “Project Titan.” Steve Wozniak, one of the two Steves who founded Apple and one of the most respected people in the tech sphere, had some fascinating thoughts on Project Titan and how it relates to Apple's early projects.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple Apple may be working on its own money transfer service Apple Apple may be working on its own money transfer service By Bindu Nair - Apr 28, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Apple might be thinking of launching its own money-transfer service later this year, competing with the likes of Venmo to gain dominance in the sector. It’s apparently been thinking of introducing such a platform since 2015 and has started up talks again with payments industry partners. Multiple sources familiar with these discussions told Recode that the service would basically allow iPhone users to send money to other iPhone users digitally. It’ll have to face-off against heavyweights like Venmo, Paypal, and Square Cash, with its main advantage being the in-built convenience of having the service baked into iOS. Apple’s current venture into transactions, Apple Pay, hasn’t been as successful as the firm had hoped it would be. Several sources in US banks believe that usage of the platform has been lighter than expected. The company is reportedly looking to address this by partnering up with Visa for a pre-paid card. Also See: First photos of Apple’s self-driving car surface This alleged pre-paid card may run on Visa’s debit network and be connected with the aforementioned peer-to-peer service. People would be able to send cash to the possibly virtual card via the new platform. This cash could then be spent in offline stores, websites, and apps. Apple has a financial incentive for the card as well. It probably won’t charge its customers for using the money-transfer service, so the only way it can earn money is through its own debit card. However, the card is apparently raising concerns among banking executives who will have to battle with Apple to woo consumers.

Photo / AP Apple is investigating ways to charge iPhones and iPads wirelessly and without contact using the signal emitted by radio frequencies such as Wi-Fi, a patent filing has revealed. The indication the company is working on the system will raise hopes that the end of having to physically plug a cable into a mobile device in order to charge it could be around the corner. Filings reveal Apple is looking at ways to re-power its devices using mobile, Wi-Fi and millimetre wave signals. It proposes directing telectromagnetic frequencies, normally used for data transmission, towards device as a "beam" of energy. Long-range wireless charging isn't a new concept and Apple has been working on different ways to achieve it for a number of years. It first filed a patent for a way to wirelessly recharge an iMac at a distance of one metre back in 2010. Last year, Bloomberg reported that the company was working with partners to develop the system for mobile devices. It said it could be introduced to the iPhone as early as 2017. While the patent filing is the greatest hint yet that Apple is working on the technology, it only covers the theory behind the method rather than an actual way to do it. Rumours suggest that Apple is planning to introduce wireless charging to the iPhone for the first time this year in time for its ten year anniversary. Adding weight to reports, the company joined an industry group called the Wireless Power Consortium in February. However, the method of wireless charging that Apple could use is still unclear. It had been claimed that the iPhone would not feature the short-range "inductive" wireless charging used on the Watch and rival phones. Instead, Apple was said to be waiting to introduce wireless charging on the handsets only when it had developed a long-range system. But the recent patent appears to be too early stage. Apple patented a separate "inductive charging station" concept for the iPhone last Autumn, paving the way for short-range wireless charging on the iPhone 8. The upcoming handset is rumoured to come with a glass case that could support the feature. - Daily Telegraph UK By Cara McGoogan Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Then you may want to buy another app within the upcoming days, as Apple announced a substantial price increase in an e-mail to developers. The minimum price in the App Store will be increased by €0,10 to €1,09. Apple currently uses the pricing, €1,99, €2,99, €3,99 etc. In six days from now those prices will be €2.29, €3.49, €4.49 etc. This is not the first time Apple makes its apps more expensive. We started at €0,79 a few years ago, meanwhile prices have risen by 38%. The price increase will be carried out in all European countries and in Mexico. Apple App Store price increase The number of worldwide iPhone sales stagnates. But the services and apps of the company show a clear growth in revenue. From that point of view, it is understandable that Apple increases its App Store prices. However, Apple has another explanation for its price increase, according to the American manufacturer, the new App Store prices are the result of the exchange rates. Do you have an Apple subscription that is automatically renewed? Then you're lucky, these prices are not going up for now. All in-app purchases will get the new pricing. Luckily, there are still plenty of free downloads available in the Apple App Store.    Next  LG G6 mini phone    Previous  Nintendo 2DS XL game system    News by brand:Apple    News by category:Apps    News by brand and category:Apple Apps Latest Apple announcements 128GB iPad tablet from Apple 32GB iPhone SE preorder sales started Apple headquarters opens April 2017 128GB iPhone 7 Red Apple Clips app for iPhone and iPad Apple iPad 2017 tablet iPhone 2017 Edition RED Apple iPhone 7 Red iPhone 7 Plus Retro Edition Apple iPad Pro 2017 tablet Series Apple iPhone Edition 2017 Content transfer service for Apple smartphones Smartphone with professional healthcare functions Apple Developers Conference 2017 details announced Waterproof protection cases for iPhone 7-series   Latest news headlines LG G6 mini phone Apple increases App Store prices Nintendo 2DS XL game system New Nintendo 3DS XL games Samsung headquarters 2017 financial report Samsung financial report and premium product trends Samsung Mobile device trends and 2017 results Samsung Display trend forecast and financial report Samsung Semiconductor trends and financial results Fidget Spinner the best 2017 gadget Alternative phone for iPhone Red Nintendo Switch 2017 game parties HDR10+ technology explained by Samsung 4K 360-Degree VR action camera with live-streaming Samsung Benelux releases new smartphone app       5G Accessories Android Galaxy iPhone Camera Mobile phones Rumors Premium Smartphones Smartwatches Tablets TV   CES CeBIT IFA Photokina PMA

Apple Users Are In New Merriam-Webster Dictionary Definition By AJ Dellinger On 04/28/17 AT 9:09 PM Close Apple fanboys have always had a reputation for undying loyalty to the brand, but Merriam-Webster is taking that characterization to a new level by using them as an example for new dictionary entry “sheeple.” According to the newly added word, a “sheeple” is an informal term that is used to describe "people who are docile, compliant, or easily influenced" and can be likened or compared to sheep. Read: Apple Vs. Qualcomm: Apple Ceases Royalty Payments Amid Lawsuits, Qualcomm Stock Price Plummets To show the word in action, Merriam-Webster included two example sentences, including one that takes a shot at the folks who prefer Apple’s computers and mobile devices over the alternatives. “Apple's debuted a battery case for the juice-sucking iPhone—an ungainly lumpy case the sheeple will happily shell out $99 for,” the sentence reads. A second, much more innocuous sentence was also included. “James Nichols, who ran the family farm here, stamped dollar bills with red ink in protest against currency and told his neighbors that they were ‘sheeple’ for obeying authority like livestock,” it reads. According to Merriam-Webster’s history for the word, sheeple was first used in 1945—more than 30 years before Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple and 62 years before the company would introduce the device that would apparently help herd the sheeple. Read: iPhone Wireless Charging: Apple Wants You To Charge Your Device Via Wi-Fi In The Future The case referenced in the sentence is the Smart Battery Case Apple introduced in 2015 for the iPhone 6 and 6s. The accessory was the company’s first attempt at cracking the market for battery cases, and its odd, rubbery design with a bump in the middle where the battery was located tended to stand out for all the wrong reasons. It did, however, add an additional 18 hours of continuous internet usage or 20 hours of video streaming to the iPhone, which pretty successfully counters the “battery-sucking” tendencies the popular handset has. And while the example sentence may suggest a blind loyalty to Apple and its products, the company likely isn’t complaining about such a reputation—especially since it pays off come quarterly earnings. The 2017 Customer Loyalty Engagement Index conducted by Brand Keys found Apple generated the most loyal companies in many of the tech categories it offers products in, including computers, tablets, smartphones, online music and headphones via its subsidary Beats by Dre. In addition to “sheeple,” Merriam-Webster also added the term “intersectionality,” which it defines as “the complex, cumulative way in which the effects of multiple forms of discrimination (such as racism, sexism, and classism) combine, overlap, or intersect especially in the experiences of marginalized individuals or groups.” Related Stories New Mac Malware Can Bypass Apple’s Security Tools Apple Wants iPhones To Charge Via Wi-Fi, Patent Shows Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Google indeed did launch their own take in the form of the Google Home, but Apple’s version has yet to surface. We have heard that the company is close to finalizing a design, and now more details have surfaced. In a tweet by Mashable’s Jen Ryall, she shares additional details about Apple’s Echo competitor that were provided by Sonny Dickson. According to those details, Apple’s Echo competitor is expected to feature a design that is in the style of the Mac Pro. Chances are it won’t be quite as big or look exactly the same, but there will apparently be some stylistic similarities. More claims from @SonnyDickson on Apple’s Alexa competitor: – Think Mac Pro style. – Same style UE boom mesh. – Possible release WWDC. 2/2 — Jen Ryall (@jennijenni) April 28, 2017 It will sport a concave top with controls, a speaker mesh portion covering it all that is similar to the UE Boom’s mesh, and that it will most likely be launched at WWDC 2017 which kicks off this coming June. We know that Apple has used WWDC to launch new products before so it wouldn’t really be surprising to see them do it again. We can only assume that it will be powered by Siri, and since it is WWDC, perhaps Apple could even announce and share plans on how developers could potentially help to create “skills” for the device like what is being done with Amazon’s Alexa, but until then take it with a grain of salt.

Apple even alleged that Qualcomm had withheld payments to Apple as a form of “punishment” for cooperating with the Korea Fair Trade Commission. In what feels a bit ironic, a report from Bloomberg has revealed that Apple is now the one who is withholding payments to Qualcomm over royalties for patents used. As a result, Qualcomm claims that they will now have to revise its financials and lower forecasts due to the lack of revenue from the royalties that they were expected to receive. According to Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel, “While Apple has acknowledged that payment is owed for the use of Qualcomm’s valuable intellectual property, it nevertheless continues to interfere with our contracts. Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade.” Apple has also issued a statement which reads, “We’ve been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years but they have refused to negotiate fair terms. Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court.  As we’ve said before, Qualcomm’s demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own.” In the meantime it doesn’t look like this spat between both companies will be coming to a close anytime soon, especially since Qualcomm has filed their own countersuit against Apple.

It’s been not even a month since it was discovered that Apple was granted permission to testing their self-driving technology on California roads and it looks like the company wants to change how things are being done. In a report from Reuters, Apple has sent in a letter to the California DMV and asked them to change their policy when it comes to reporting disengagements with regards to self-driving cars. For those wondering, disengagements is when a self-driving car stops driving itself and controls are handed back to its accompanying human driver. Sometimes this is intentional, sometimes it can be accidental, but California’s rules state that all incidents of disengagement need to be reported. Apple claims that inconsistencies in how disengagements are reported could lead to the public being misled or confused with regards to the safety/viability of the technology. “Apple believes that public acceptance is essential to the advancement of automated vehicles. Access to transparent and intuitive data on the safety of the vehicles being tested will be central to gaining public acceptance.

Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 143.65 -0.14 -0.10% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 924.99 +6.61 +0.72% Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD ▼ 13.30 -0.32 -2.35% Intel Corp INTC ▼ 36.15 -1.28 -3.42% AdChoices "Apple's doing so many things right. It's making the best products, developing a deep ecosystem with a substantial service revenue stream," the "Mad Money" host said Plus, Apple's upcoming iPhone release is rumored to have an array of new features that makes the smartphone more functional and easier to handle, which should boost sales and new customer numbers, Cramer said. The company also stands to massively benefit from repatriation if the administration is able to implement it. All said and done, Cramer says investors should own the stock, not trade it, and eager buyers should hope for a post-earnings dip so they can buy it at a discount. As the busiest week of earnings season came to a close, Cramer breathed a sigh of relief despite Friday's mild pullback caused by a weaker-than-expected GDP number. Read more from CNBC's Jim Cramer The "Mad Money" host said that with the federal government funded through the next week, investors can finally relax and gear up for yet another earnings-filled agenda. On Monday, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reports earnings, and after shares of competitor Intel (INTC) slid on its earnings miss on Thursday, Cramer is unsure that even the best of earnings reports from this chipmaker will garner a positive market reaction. Aside from Apple, Tuesday will bring an earnings report from health-care retailer CVS (CVS), where Cramer says there could be a hidden upside to earnings. "It's hard to really dislike a well run company like this that sells at just 13 times earnings. I say wait and see. Maybe numbers come down, maybe that's your chance," the "Mad Money" host said. On Wednesday, the market will get Facebook (FB)'s results. The social media colossus reports earnings after the bell, and unless its numbers are substantially better, Cramer expects a slight sell-off. "I like how competitive Facebook is," Cramer said. "If you don't own it now, I think you might as well wait to see if we get that kind of weird sell-off that we usually get even after it reports a great number." The gaming sector is one of Cramer's favorite secular growth stories in the stay-at-home economy, and Activision Blizzard's earnings reports have a tendency to spur selling, which may happen when it releases numbers on Thursday. "I say the trend's your friend," Cramer said. "This franchise is worth buying if it gets hit." The Labor Department will release its monthly non-farm payroll data on Friday. The statistics could have a detrimental effect on bank stocks if they are low, but Cramer expects the opposite. "If April turns out to have been a robust hiring month, and I think it will be, that gives the Fed breathing room to raise interest rates twice, and therefore the bank stocks will soar," he said. © Provided by CNBC When Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) reported earnings at the same exact time Thursday night, Cramer found it difficult to compare the two and pick a winner. "The problem is that in some ways, this is a real apples-to-oranges situation," the "Mad Money" host said. Amazon, for example, chooses to promote faith-based investing, assuring shareholders that their India business will flourish and that robots will save time at their fulfillment centers. Alphabet went about energizing investors in a different way. They talked about how their search engines help local businesses and about their cloud operations, which compete with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft (MSFT) Azure. Cramer also spoke with Stephen Milligan, the CEO of Western Digital (WDC), a data storage player and one of the world's biggest hard disk drive manufacturers. Milligan said that the company's longtime partnership with troubled electronics giant Toshiba was worth preserving despite the Japanese giant's current difficulties. "The joint venture that we've had with Toshiba is 17 years running. I would contend that it's probably one of the most successful technology joint ventures in the history of our industry. And so our first goal is let's keep that joint venture healthy," Milligan told Cramer on Friday. While the CEO acknowledged that helping Toshiba could create a bit of an overhang in terms of how investors perceive Western Digital, his main focus remained on growing his own business. "Rest assured, we're going to do our very best to make sure that we protect our interests and advance not only our position, but the stakeholders that Toshiba has, and really come to a resolution that helps us to continue to be successful going forward," the CEO said. Upon the release of BioMarin's (BMRN) orphan drug Brineura, which made headlines for its $702,000-per-year price tag, chairman and CEO JJ Bienaimé said the system will have the final say on whether the sky-high price is fair. "Obviously, the system will have to determine that," he told Cramer on Friday. But I would say that CLN2, the disease that Brineura is being used for, is an absolutely devastating neurodegenerative disorder for which, unfortunately, the patients will lose their life, most of the time by [age] 12." And although Washington lawmakers have knocked pharmaceutical companies for high drug costs, Bienaimé said most policymakers understand the industry's inevitable trial-and-error aspects. "I think, hopefully, ... if there is any kind of regulations coming around health care, that they will make sure that those regulations protect innovation and protect innovative biotech companies," Bienaimé said. Finally, Cramer spoke with AGCO (AGCO) Chairman, President and CEO Martin Richenhagen to understand more about how President Donald Trump's protectionist slant might affect the agricultural landscape. AGCO manufactures agricultural equipment like tractors that require steel to produce. Richenhagen said that if the current administration were to follow through with placing high tariffs on non-U.S. steel, the effects would be felt industry-wide. "For us, of course, if steel's prices would go up because of this kind of protectionism, it wouldn't be so good because finally our customers would have to pay. So that's true for all of us, for the whole industry," the CEO told Cramer on Friday. Richenhagen added that while the move would benefit the steel industry, it was "not really a great strategy" to implement tariffs without explicitly informing consumers of their effects. "All kind of protectionism finally has to be paid for," he said. "And I think consumers should know that." In Cramer's lightning round, he rattled off his take on some caller favorite stocks, including: Bank of the Internet USA (BOFI): "I don't know. Too much risk there, my friend. I'd rather own JPMorgan (JPM). I think that's a little more, let's just say, strong." Agilent Technologies (A): "Oh my, I like Agilent so much. I like the quarter. You can win two ways here: you can win on an acquisition or you can win on earnings. That's how good that quarter was. Terrific." Questions for Cramer?

X Apple’s Jade takes centre stage on final day of jumps season Irish Stallion Farms Mares Champion Hurdle win could be vital for Gordon Elliott about 7 hours ago Brian O'Connor Apple’s Jade ridden by Bryan Cooper clears the last on the way to winning the AES Champion Four Year Old Hurdle at Punchestown last year. Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA          As the curtain descends on a momentous 2016-17 National Hunt season there’s an aptness to Apple’s Jade taking centre stage at Punchestown on Saturday. So many of the main threads in a remarkable campaign are summed up in the fortunes of Apple’s Jade who tries for a third Grade One victory this season in the Irish Stallion Farms Mares Champion Hurdle. A year ago she landed the other top-flight prize on the Punchestown festival’s final card – the AES Champion Four Year Old Hurdle – when trained by Willie Mullins and her route to the top of the senior tree looked straightforward. September’s seismic split between Mullins and Michael O’Leary’s Gigginstown Stud team meant it proved to be anything but. Switched to the champion trainer’s great challenger, Gordon Elliott, Apple’s Jade had Champion Hurdle ambitions ruled out by two initial defeats but her quality rose to the top in a memorable Hatton’s Grace victory and in even more famous Cheltenham success last month.   That she carried O’Leary’s colours to a dramatic defeat of the Mullins pair, Vroum Vroum Mag and Limini, which was vital to Elliott deposing Mullins as the Cheltenham festival’s leading trainer, neatly summed up so much of what has transpired this season. Now she returns to action against four Mullins mares in what is, bar the British outsider, Lady Buttons, practically a private Grade One face off between the sport’s superpowers. Patrick Mullins secures Punchestown festival hat-trick Patrick Mullins completes dream treble with Montalbano Wicklow Brave holds out to win Champion Hurdle On form it’s a relatively straightforward assignment for Apple’s Jade but the intriguing element is Ruby Walsh’s decision to overlook a trio of proven top-flight winners and opt to ride a stable companion who has won two ordinary races in two years. Karalee really could be anything. But just three lifetime starts in all means she has a mountain to climb in terms of experience alone. Apple’s Jade is one of 13 declarations on the card for Elliott who will hope that isn’t an unlucky omen in terms of his trainer’s title ambitions. But considering he has usually had a numerical edge this season it’s noteworthy that Mullins has a massive team of 20 declared for the final day. Headline act That they don’t include Annie Power will be a regret for many and there’s also no denying the absence of the season’s outstanding four year old, Defi Du Seuil, robs the big juvenile prize of a headline act. This could turn into another Mullins-Elliott show and it will be the fifth time that Bapaume and Mega Fortune have clashed this term. Each has finished ahead of the other on two occasions although it has been Mega Fortune who has had an edge the last two times, including when just a short head in front of his rival as they chased home Defi Du Seuil in the Triumph. Mullins’s slight disappointment with Bapaume at Cheltenham – “I thought he might run a little bit better than he did: hopefully he can find some improvement” – is interesting and ground conditions could swing things towards a fifth win in a row for the champion trainer in this race.    Mullins dominates the top of the €100,000 handicap hurdle but could have a value option at the other end of the scale in Pique Sous. The new champion conditional Rachel Blackmore takes 3lbs off Pique Sous who ran here over two miles earlier this week and was predictably outpaced in the closing stages. Britain’s National Hunt campaign also winds up at Sandown on Saturday where Special Tiara flies the Irish flag in the four-runner Celebration Chase. Special Tiara memorably took advantage of Douvan’s flop at Cheltenham to assume the two-mile crown so on quick ground, and over Sandown’s famous obstacles, Henry De Bromhead’s star represents a true test for the star novice Altior. Nicky Henderson’s seven year old is widely expected to be the stable’s successor to Sprinter Sacre and has already put up some huge performances for a novice on official figures. Such theory is one thing but Special Tiara is a proper seasoned two-miler who also has the in-form Noel Fehily on his back. “Altior looks very good but our lad has every chance. He put up a superb performance at Cheltenham and beat Fox Norton. And we’ve seen what he has gone on to do at Aintree and Punchestown,” said De Bromhead.       Topics: Ruby Walsh Noel Fehily Annie Power Rachel Blackmore Brian O'connor Gordon Elliott Michael O'leary Willie Mullins Henry De Bromhead Read More Bacardys takes Champion Novice Hurdle to increase Willie Mullins’ lead Arctic Fire can secure Punchestown Champion Hurdle Willie Mullins closes gap in battle for trainers’ title Unowhatimeanharry turns tables on Nichols Canyon Tony Keenan’s tips: Punchestown Friday Punchestown day three: Previews, analysis and tips Sizing John wins Punchestown Gold Cup for the ages  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Rugby Eddie O’Sullivan’s untouchables offer inspiration to coming men Pro12 0:26 Leinster emerge from the RDS darkness to pip Glasgow Other Sports Ian O’Riordan: Has sport become bad for our health?

Qualcomm says Apple’s refusal to pay royalties related to technology used in smartphones will take a big bite out of its profit and revenue. Apple Inc. has sued Qualcomm, saying the chipmaker is abusing its control over essential technology and charging excessive licensing fees. Qualcomm says Apple has indicated that it won’t pay fees until the dispute is resolved. Representatives for the Cupertino, California-based iPhone did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday, April 28, 2017. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple is refusing to pay any royalties owed to mobile chip maker Qualcomm for some of the features in the iPhone, escalating a patent feud that has turned the former business partners into bitter adversaries. The latest twist in the dispute represents a major blow for Qualcomm, which depends on licensing fees for a large portion of its revenue. Apple's decision to withhold royalties will cost Qualcomm up to $500 million in the current quarter alone, based on revised revenue estimates that Qualcomm released Friday. "This is getting ugly, the level of hostility just went up another notch," said technology analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy. As retaliation, Qualcomm could seek a court order halting iPhone sales until Apple pays the royalties that Qualcomm contends it's owed, Moorhead said. Qualcomm hasn't threatened to go to that extreme yet, but its top lawyer made it clear on Friday that the San Diego company is girding for a fierce fight with its Cupertino, California-based Apple, the world's most valuable company. "We will continue vigorously to defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry," said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's general counsel. Apple concedes it and its suppliers owe Qualcomm some licensing fees on iPhone sales. But Apple believes Qualcomm has been abusing its power in the mobile chip market to charge for royalties on features that aren't covered by its patents. Qualcomm, in turn, has accused Apple of breaking contracts in an attempt to lower its licensing fees and also interfering in deals negotiated with iPhone suppliers. The stalemate prompted Apple to sue Qualcomm in January in a federal complaint. Qualcomm denied the allegations and fired back with its own lawsuit against Apple earlier this month. In a Friday statement, Apple said it won't pay Qualcomm any further royalties until the courts determine the amount, a process that could take several years.

"As we've said before, Qualcomm's demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own," Apple said. Rosenberg reiterated that Qualcomm holds "valid and enforceable" licensing agreements on various features in iPhones. Apple's suspension of royalty payments marks "the latest step in Apple's global attack on Qualcomm," said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's general counsel. Apple isn't alone in its accusations against Qualcomm. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also has filed a lawsuit alleging that Qualcomm has been imposing unfair licensing terms on manufacturers. With the loss of iPhone royalty payments, Qualcomm now expects its revenue for its April-June quarter to range from $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion, down from its previous forecast of $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion. Qualcomm now expects its earnings for the period to range from 75 to 85 cents per share. That's down from an earlier projection of 90 cents to $1.15 per share. Investors shook off the shock of Qualcomm's lowered guidance after initially driving down the company's stock. Its stock rose 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $53.74 on Friday. The stock has fallen by about 15 percent since Apple filed its lawsuit. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

For those who are unfamiliar, Musical.ly is an app that lets users create 15 second music videos with a bunch of effects, allowing users to put together some quirky lip synced music videos to their favorite songs. 🚨🚨 Did you know?? We’ve teamed up with @musicallyapp to bring you full versions of your favorite songs without having to leave the app! pic.twitter.com/3eC21V6cme — Apple Music (@AppleMusic) April 28, 2017 While access to a larger library is no doubt a boon for Musical.ly, it also helps to create awareness and visibility for Apple Music where it could potentially result in more users subscribing to the service. Given Apple’s plans for Apple Music which apparently will have a more video-centric focus in the future, this visibility will no doubt help them gain an audience. As it stands, Spotify is still pretty much the king of music streaming services, although Apple Music appears to be catching up pretty fast. In the meantime for those curious about Musical.ly, check out the video above to get an idea of what the app is about. Filed in Apple >Audio. Read more about apple music, Apps and Music.

Qualcomm said Apple's refusal to pay royalties related to technology used in smartphones will take a big bite out of its profit and revenue. (Kiichiro Sato/Associated Press files) By Associated Press Published: April 28, 2017, 4:44 PM A   A SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is refusing to pay any royalties owed to mobile chip maker Qualcomm for some of the features in the iPhone, escalating a patent feud that has turned the former business partners into bitter adversaries. The latest twist in the dispute represents a major blow for Qualcomm, which depends on licensing fees for a large portion of its revenue. Apple’s decision to withhold royalties will cost Qualcomm up to $500 million in the current quarter alone, based on revised revenue estimates that Qualcomm released Friday. “This is getting ugly, the level of hostility just went up another notch,” said technology analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy. As retaliation, Qualcomm could seek a court order halting iPhone sales until Apple pays the royalties that Qualcomm contends it’s owed, Moorhead said. Qualcomm hasn’t threatened to go to that extreme yet, but its top lawyer made it clear on Friday that the San Diego company is girding for a fierce fight with its Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple, the world’s most valuable company. “We will continue vigorously to defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel. Apple concedes it and its suppliers owe Qualcomm some licensing fees on iPhone sales. But Apple believes Qualcomm has been abusing its power in the mobile chip market to charge for royalties on features that aren’t covered by its patents. Qualcomm, in turn, has accused Apple of breaking contracts in an attempt to lower its licensing fees and also interfering in deals negotiated with iPhone suppliers. The stalemate prompted Apple to sue Qualcomm in January in a federal complaint. Qualcomm denied the allegations and fired back with its own lawsuit against Apple earlier this month. In a Friday statement, Apple said it won’t pay Qualcomm any further royalties until the courts determine the amount, a process that could take several years. “As we’ve said before, Qualcomm’s demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own,” Apple said. Rosenberg reiterated that Qualcomm holds “valid and enforceable” licensing agreements on various features in iPhones. Apple’s suspension of royalty payments marks “the latest step in Apple’s global attack on Qualcomm,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel. Apple isn’t alone in its accusations against Qualcomm. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also has filed a lawsuit alleging that Qualcomm has been imposing unfair licensing terms on manufacturers. With the loss of iPhone royalty payments, Qualcomm now expects its revenue for its April-June quarter to range from $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion, down from its previous forecast of $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion. Qualcomm now expects its earnings for the period to range from 75 to 85 cents per share. That’s down from an earlier projection of 90 cents to $1.15 per share. Investors shook off the shock of Qualcomm’s lowered guidance after initially driving down the company’s stock. Its stock rose 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $53.74 on Friday. The stock has fallen by about 15 percent since Apple filed its lawsuit.

Apple CEO Tim Cook, after all, has clashed with Trump on everything from iPhone encryption to immigration, and was even reportedly on an early short list of potential running mates for Hillary Clinton. But as Trump's first 100 days come to a close, one thing is clear: Apple stock is the biggest winner of his presidency so far. Apple (aapl) shares have returned more than 20% since Trump entered the White House, making the tech company the best-performing stock in the Dow Jones industrial average during the first 100 days. Driving Apple's gains: a great quarterly earnings report, a tax climate that could be a boon for Apple shareholders, and the stock's growing reputation as a haven for dividend-conscious retirement investors. Apple stock has run up about four times as much as the market overall, even as the so-called Trump Bump created one of the best 100-day rallies for any president elected since World War II. Since Trump was elected in November, Apple has risen 29%, eclipsing the Dow's 14% return over that period—though Boeing (ba) just barely scraped ahead, with its shares up nearly 30%. Even though Apple shares sank after Trump announced an immigration ban from several predominantly Muslim countries in late January, the tech company reversed those losses the following day when it revealed in its earnings report that its new iPhone 7 was a hit, and that it sold more iPhones over the holiday season than Wall Street had expected. Trump's proposed policies, though still in flux, have also been a boon to Apple, whose CEO Cook has participated in the President's summits of business leaders. Most notably, Apple would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Trump's promise to cut the corporate tax rate to 15%, which would allow the iPhone maker to potentially bring much of its massive overseas cash hoard back to the U.S. without taking a major hit from taxes. (On the flip side, Trump's tax reform plan has hurt other stocks like Under Armour (uaa), which was the market's worst performer in the first 100 days, in part due to fears that the President's suggested import tax could more than cancel out benefits of a rate cut.) JobsHere’s the Single Biggest Reason Tech Workers Quit Their Jobs Donald TrumpTrump’s First 100 Days Make Him One of the Stock Market’s Best Presidents Under ArmourThis Is Why Under Armour Is the Biggest Stock Loser of Trump’s First 100 Days Goldman SachsHow Goldman Sachs Stock Lost $4 Billion of Its Trump Bump in a Single Day OneTimeDollar Steadies After U.S. Healthcare Bill Pulled Housing marketShould You Buy Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? Stock marketThese Stocks Have Already Decided If Trumpcare Will Pass CommentaryThe Stock Market Has Woken up to the Trump-GOP Divide Still, a flush few months for Apple's stock haven't stopped Cook from openly disagreeing with Trump's agenda, even going so far as to threaten to sue the administration over its immigration ban. It's not just Trump who has given Apple a boost in the last few months. Warren Buffett has been taking bigger and bigger bites of Apple stock lately, a bet that has paid off for the legendary Berkshire Hathaway (brk.a) investor in the form of profits in the range of hundreds of millions of dollars—and helped send Apple shares to new all-time highs. (Click here for more articles from Time Inc.'s Looking Forward series.) The octogenarian stock-picker, after all, has long loved dividend stocks, and Apple's 1.6% dividend yield (relatively high for a tech stock) has made it increasingly popular with yield-seeking investors, especially those planning for retirement. If tax reform, the Trump Bump and the next iPhone continue pushing the stock higher, retirees who bet their entire nest egg on Apple stock might not seem so crazy after all.

The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac The issue with swollen and expanded batteries on first-gen Apple Watch models has been documented online by users experiencing the problem— here on Apple support forums, for example, and here on Reddit— but appears to not be widespread or something that has made mainstream media headlines. Apple normally has a service program that covers all of its devices for repairs related expanded/swollen battery issues for two years (1 year beyond the 1-year Limited Warranty it provides with all devices), so the extension for Apple Watch first-gen extends its coverage an additional year beyond coverage for other products. The change comes as the 1st gen Apple Watch passes the two year mark after having been introduced April 24, 2015. (Thanks, John!)

The iPhone 8’s Battery May Be So Powerful It Could Leave Competitors In The Dust Dan Seitz 04.28.17 12 hours ago 2 Comments Facebook Twitter EMAIL Shutterstock/UPROXX The perpetual complaint about the iPhone has always been battery life. Everybody wants a long-lasting battery, but fitting one in the iPhone’s tiny case has been a challenge. Now, it looks like Apple will finally address the question with the iPhone 8. Business Insider has an overview of analysts talking the iPhone 8’s battery, and while they don’t agree how Apple is going to get there, they do agree that Apple is fitting the iPhone 8 with the battery capacity of the iPhone 7 Plus, which currently leads the pack at about 9 hours (on full blast) before needing a recharge. The iPhone 8 might actually beat that, thanks in part to its smaller and more energy efficient OLED screen and other components that will sip electrons out of your battery instead of guzzling them. In particular, Apple will likely upgrade the processor. In addition, rumors have it, the logic board, which is basically the nerve center of your phone, will be smaller and more efficient as well. Of course, there’s a risk in packing a big ol’ battery into a tiny little space. Just ask Samsung, which has angered the battery gods on more than one occasion. But if any company can pull it off, it’s Apple, and a longer life will only help the iPhone 8.

"Apple's doing so many things right. It's making the best products, developing a deep ecosystem with a substantial service revenue stream," the "Mad Money" host said Plus, Apple's upcoming iPhone release is rumored to have an array of new features that makes the smartphone more functional and easier to handle, which should boost sales and new customer numbers, Cramer said. The company also stands to massively benefit from repatriation if the administration is able to implement it. All said and done, Cramer says investors should own the stock, not trade it, and eager buyers should hope for a post-earnings dip so they can buy it at a discount. Victor J. Blue | Bloomberg | Getty Images As the busiest week of earnings season came to a close, Cramer breathed a sigh of relief despite Friday's mild pullback caused by a weaker-than-expected GDP number. The "Mad Money" host said that with the federal government funded through the next week, investors can finally relax and gear up for yet another earnings-filled agenda. On Monday, Advanced Micro Devices reports earnings, and after shares of competitor Intel slid on its earnings miss on Thursday, Cramer is unsure that even the best of earnings reports from this chipmaker will garner a positive market reaction. Aside from Apple, Tuesday will bring an earnings report from health-care retailer CVS, where Cramer says there could be a hidden upside to earnings. "It's hard to really dislike a well run company like this that sells at just 13 times earnings. I say wait and see. Maybe numbers come down, maybe that's your chance," the "Mad Money" host said. On Wednesday, the market will get Facebook's results. The social media colossus reports earnings after the bell, and unless its numbers are substantially better, Cramer expects a slight sell-off. "I like how competitive Facebook is," Cramer said. "If you don't own it now, I think you might as well wait to see if we get that kind of weird sell-off that we usually get even after it reports a great number." The gaming sector is one of Cramer's favorite secular growth stories in the stay-at-home economy, and Activision Blizzard's earnings reports have a tendency to spur selling, which may happen when it releases numbers on Thursday. "I say the trend's your friend," Cramer said. "This franchise is worth buying if it gets hit." The Labor Department will release its monthly non-farm payroll data on Friday. The statistics could have a detrimental effect on bank stocks if they are low, but Cramer expects the opposite. "If April turns out to have been a robust hiring month, and I think it will be, that gives the Fed breathing room to raise interest rates twice, and therefore the bank stocks will soar," he said. Gary Cameron | Reuters Jeff Bezos When Amazon and Alphabet reported earnings at the same exact time Thursday night, Cramer found it difficult to compare the two and pick a winner. "The problem is that in some ways, this is a real apples-to-oranges situation," the "Mad Money" host said. Amazon, for example, chooses to promote faith-based investing, assuring shareholders that their India business will flourish and that robots will save time at their fulfillment centers. Alphabet went about energizing investors in a different way. They talked about how their search engines help local businesses and about their cloud operations, which compete with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Cramer also spoke with Stephen Milligan, the CEO of Western Digital, a data storage player and one of the world's biggest hard disk drive manufacturers. Milligan said that the company's longtime partnership with troubled electronics giant Toshiba was worth preserving despite the Japanese giant's current difficulties. "The joint venture that we've had with Toshiba is 17 years running. I would contend that it's probably one of the most successful technology joint ventures in the history of our industry. And so our first goal is let's keep that joint venture healthy," Milligan told Cramer on Friday. While the CEO acknowledged that helping Toshiba could create a bit of an overhang in terms of how investors perceive Western Digital, his main focus remained on growing his own business. "Rest assured, we're going to do our very best to make sure that we protect our interests and advance not only our position, but the stakeholders that Toshiba has, and really come to a resolution that helps us to continue to be successful going forward," the CEO said. Mark Neuling | CNBC Jean-Jacques Bienaime, CEO, BioMarin Pharmaceuticals Upon the release of BioMarin's orphan drug Brineura, which made headlines for its $702,000-per-year price tag, chairman and CEO JJ Bienaimé said the system will have the final say on whether the sky-high price is fair. "Obviously, the system will have to determine that," he told Cramer on Friday. But I would say that CLN2, the disease that Brineura is being used for, is an absolutely devastating neurodegenerative disorder for which, unfortunately, the patients will lose their life, most of the time by [age] 12." And although Washington lawmakers have knocked pharmaceutical companies for high drug costs, Bienaimé said most policymakers understand the industry's inevitable trial-and-error aspects. "I think, hopefully, ... if there is any kind of regulations coming around health care, that they will make sure that those regulations protect innovation and protect innovative biotech companies," Bienaimé said. Finally, Cramer spoke with AGCO Chairman, President and CEO Martin Richenhagen to understand more about how President Donald Trump's protectionist slant might affect the agricultural landscape. AGCO manufactures agricultural equipment like tractors that require steel to produce. Richenhagen said that if the current administration were to follow through with placing high tariffs on non-U.S. steel, the effects would be felt industry-wide. "For us, of course, if steel's prices would go up because of this kind of protectionism, it wouldn't be so good because finally our customers would have to pay. So that's true for all of us, for the whole industry," the CEO told Cramer on Friday. Richenhagen added that while the move would benefit the steel industry, it was "not really a great strategy" to implement tariffs without explicitly informing consumers of their effects. "All kind of protectionism finally has to be paid for," he said. "And I think consumers should know that." In Cramer's lightning round, he rattled off his take on some caller favorite stocks, including: Bank of the Internet USA: "I don't know. Too much risk there, my friend. I'd rather own JPMorgan. I think that's a little more, let's just say, strong." Agilent Technologies: "Oh my, I like Agilent so much. I like the quarter. You can win two ways here: you can win on an acquisition or you can win on earnings. That's how good that quarter was. Terrific." Questions for Cramer?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Image Source: YouTube How hard is Apple’s stock going to crash? Chris Mills @chrisfmills April 28th, 2017 at 5:46 PM Share Tweet Another day, another analyst shouting BUY BUY BUY on Apple’s stock, based on the upcoming iPhone 8 launch. This week, Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha raised his estimate for the firm’s stock price to $170, based on his belief that “pent-up demand” for a new iPhone will create a “supercycle” of upgrades, sending Apple’s profits into the stratosphere and investors into a tizzy. No-one’s denying that Apple is going to make a dumpster-truck of money on the iPhone 8, and will continue being the world’s greatest smartphone company, etcetera. But the size of the iPhone 8 launch, and the company’s current valuation, is still being blown way out of proportion. Don't Miss: iPhone 8 schematics leak offers plenty of good news – and some big surprises Cast your mind back to November 2016: a simpler time, when we didn’t know Donald Trump would be President, and Apple’s stock was trading at $104. Today, it’s at $143, and supposed to go to $170. Between then and now, the only significant thing that’s changed is a bunch of rumors about the upcoming iPhone 8 launch. But somehow, based on that, Apple’s perceived value has risen by over $250 billion and counting. Sure, Apple’s services sectors are doing well, and Trump’s tax plans could be more friendly to Apple. But analysts still seem to be betting that the iPhone 8 will create at least $100 billion in extra value over a “boring” iPhone launch. Let’s put that in perspective. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch, the last major iPhone refresh, saw Apple sell 300,000 more iPhones than the year before. During Q4 2016, the quarter in which Apple launched the iPhone 7, Apple collected $11 billion in net income. If the analyst’s prediction is right and Apple’s stock rises to $170, that puts Apple’s market cap at nearly $900 billion. It was $585 billion in November 2016, which means that between November last year and the iPhone 8 launch, Apple will be $300 billion more valuable. So, the conclusion is one of these: Pre-November last year, analysts and the stock market were undervaluing Apple by hundreds of billions of dollars, or; The iPhone 8 and more iTunes sales are going to create $300 billion in extra value, or; The current valuation of Apple is insane and based on gut feel and hype, rather than a sane economic valuation of the company. To be clear, I still think that Apple’s stock is going to go up when the iPhone 8 launches, and the company will remain in rude health for years. But a stock price and a market valuation isn’t meant to be an arbitrary number that goes up and down, based on on quarterly results: it’s meant to represent the value of a company, taking into account current assets, profits, and future perspectives. Unless Apple’s entire future has got 60% better in the last year, analysts are guessing, rather than analyzing anything.

PSA: Again, another reason not to open attachments from strangers By Lory Gil Friday, Apr 28, 2017 at 2:37 pm EDT 1 Comment Don't be scared but be aware, there's a new malware in town and it wants your Mac. Check Point Technologies has released detailed information about a a new malware attack that is directed at Mac users. It's being called Dok and it has the potential to access a user's online communication, including secure sites. According to Check Point, it affects all versions of OS X and is not yet detectable by anti-virus software. This new malware – dubbed OSX/Dok — affects all versions of OSX, has 0 detections on VirusTotal (as of the writing of these words), is signed with a valid developer certificate (authenticated by Apple), and is the first major scale malware to target OSX users via a coordinated email phishing campaign. Why is Dok such a big deal? Check Point says that Dok is the first major scale malware to target OS X users, but that's not the only reason it's a big deal. DoK also appears to have a fake signed Apple developer certificate, which allows it to bypass your Gatekeeper security protection. You and your Mac would be none-the-wiser having a new root certificate in your system. How Dok gets in To calm your fears, this malware isn't something you could accidentally pick up while surfing the net or if your Wi-Fi password isn't secure. For Dok to infect your Mac, you have to invite it into your system. Check Point explains that the initial contact is via a phishing email (currently targeted at European users). When a person downloads an attachment (called Dokument.ZIP) from the email, it copies itself to the Mac and then displays a false message saying the file couldn't be opened because it was damaged. It will then execute itself and send another pop up message that will tell you there is a new update to your Mac's software and tell you to click "Update All" right within the message, at which point you'll be asked to enter your password to continue. That's how Dok infects your Mac. You first have to open an attachment from an unknown source. You then have to perform an action on your computer that is completely different than how Apple does things (Apple doesn't ask you to click on "Update All" in a pop up message). You then have to enter your password to continue, which is the point of attack. If you give away your password to Dok, it gains access to your administrative privileges, where it can quietly redirect all of your web browsing to a proxy. How you can protect yourself against Dok Since this is a phishing attack, it's pretty easy to avoid infection. Simply don't download attachments from unknown sources. If you aren't sure of the legitimacy of an email, you can check the file name of the attachment. If it's called Dokument.ZIP, definitely don't open it. It's always a good practice to check the sender's email address to see whether it is official. If the sender email is something like llk124@ww.edir.4.com, you should probably delete that email right away. What if Dok has already infected your Mac? If you did receive an email from an unknown source, and have already opened the attachment called Dokument.ZIP, and then clicked on a suspicious looking update button, and then entered your password, and now think you might be infected, there are a few steps you can take to delete the malware. First navigate to your Proxy configuration settings and delete the rouge server. Click the Apple Menu icon in the upper left corner of the screen. Click System Preferences from the dropdown menu. Click Network. Select your current internet connection (Wi-FI or Ethernet). Click Advanced at the bottom right of the window. Select the Proxies tab. Select Automatic Proxy Configuration. Delete the URL listed as http://127.0.0.1.5555... Dok also installed two LaunchAgents, which you'll also have to find and delete. /Users/%User%/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Safari.proxy.plist /Users/%User%/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Safari.pac.plist Lastly, you'll need to delete the fake signed Apple Developer certificate. Launch Finder. Select Applicatons. Open your Utilities folder. Double-click on Keychain Access. Select the certificate named COMODO RSA Secure Server CA 2. Right or Control + click on the Certificate. Select Delete Certificate fro the drop down options. Select Delete to confirm that you want to delete the certificate. Remember best practices for staying safe It's very difficult to get the Dok infection. There are a number of red flags you would likely come across that would help you identify that something is wrong. Don't open attachments from unknown sources. Don't click on suspicious looking pop up messages. Check email addresses of senders to see if they are real. You can protect yourself from attacks if you stay aware. If you do, however, end up with malware on your Mac, don't worry. If the steps above seem too complicated, you can call Apple support for help. Someone will be able to walk you through the necessary steps to remove the malware from your Mac. Reader comments PSA: Again, another reason not to open attachments from strangers 1 Comment View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating cuttheredwire I think it's important to reiterate that the thing has to ask permission to infect your Mac. There isn't a new vulnerability here, but it is a fine example of social engineering. To me, this highlights the problem with the Mac App Store. It would be nice if you could get by using just the store, where things are checked and at least somewhat vetted.

As first noted by Reuters, Apple is looking for California to clarify or change its positions on certain testing regulations in order to make easier for self-driving vehicles to reach public acceptance. From Apple's letter: Apple believes that public acceptance is essential to the advancement of automated vehicles. Access to transparent and intuitive data on the safety of the vehicles being tested will be central to gaining public acceptance. However, the current and proposed disengagement reporting requirements do not achieve this result. In particular, Apple takes issue with current rules about disengagement reporting and testing without a safety driver, along with some definitions. In the case of definitions Apple seems to be seeking these changes so that these regulations don't hinder the company's development of additional technologies that could improve self-driving vehicles. Meanwhile, the company says that its proposed changes to the disengagement reporting rules would help "accurately and clearly inform the public about the safety of the automated vehicles being tested".

By Rene Ritchie Friday, Apr 28, 2017 at 3:31 pm EDT 4 Comments Should you buy the 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Pro? Here's how to choose! Apple currently offers the MacBook Pro in two sizes: 13-inch and 15-inch. They differ in ways beyond simply display size though, including the overall weight and footprint, and details of the ports and the potential of their processors. So, how do you decide between them? See our pick for the best Apple laptop. MacBook Pro lineup If you look at Apple's current MacBook Pro lineup, even excluding the 12-inch MacBook and legacy 13-inch MacBook Air, there's still a ton to choose from. Especially when you consider Apple still offers last year's MacBook Pro 13-inch and 15-inch alongside this year's models. For this, I'll be referring to the 2016 MacBook Pro, though many of the points will also pertain to 2015 pros as well. Weight and size With great size comes great weight. Or something like that. What I mean is, those extra 2-inches (diagonal) of display come with a bigger footprint, which means your MacBook Pro will take up more room on the table, from your desk to the coffee shop to the tray on the train or airplane. It'll also weigh more in your laptop bag. The 13-inch MacBook Pro weighs 3.02 pounds (1.37 kg). The 15-inch MacBook Pro weighs 4.02 pounds (1.83 kg). That might not sound like a huge difference, but if you're walking around all day, it might just feel like one. If portability is most important to you, get the 13-inch MacBook Pro. If power beats portability, get the 15-inch MacBook Pro. Displays MacBook Pro was the first Mac to go "Retina", or what Apple calls a display dense enough that you can no longer see pixels at a normal working distance. They remain Retina to this day so, no matter which one you get, the quality will be the same. What about the quantity, though? The 13-inch MacBook Pro has a 2560x1600 16:10 display at 227 ppi. The 15-inch MacBook Pro has a 2880x1800 16:10 display at 220 ppi. More display means seeing either more of the web and more of apps you can cram onto it, including interface and toolbars. Or, if accessibility is an issue, seeing bigger of all the same. Here's how the pixel differences look side-by-side: If size doesn't matter to you, save some space and dollars and get the 13-inch MacBook Pro. If you want the largest possible display, you want the 15-inch MacBook Pro. External displays You can also drive external displays with the MacBook Pro. Due to a difference in the bandwidth supplied to the Thunderbolt 3 ports on both sides of the 2016 MacBook Pro, however, you can't drive as many on the 13-inch. Specifically, the 13-inch MacBook Pro can support up to two 4096x2304 (4K) or one 5120x2880 (5K) display. The 15-inch MacBook Pro, though, can drive up to four 4096x2304 (4K) or two 5120x2880 (5K) displays. If you don't need an external display, or one need a one or two, the 13-inch is fine. If you want to drive four 4K or two 5K external displays, you want a 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016. Processors The central processing unit (CPU) is what powers the MacBook Pro. MacBook Pro 2016 has Intel's Skylake processors for both the 13-inch and 15-inch models. The 13-inch model starts with a 2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 or 2.4GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor for the version without the Touch Bar, and 2.9GHz or 3.1GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, or 3.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor for the version with Touch Bar. The 15-inch has options for a 2.6GHz, 2.7GHz, or 2.9GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor. If absolute power doesn't matter, don't give Intel any more money and stick with the 13-inch MacBook Pro. If you want maximum performance for things like video editing, you want a quad-core 15-inch MacBook Pro. Graphics The graphics processing unit (GPU) handles rendering and pushing the pixels. That includes everything from the macOS interface to photo and video editors to video games. The more powerful the GPU, the more pixels it can render and push, and the smoother and better the animations, apps, and the more realistic 3D you'll get. MacBook Pro 2016 has Intel Iris Graphics 540 for the 13-inch version without Touch Bar and Intel Iris Graphics 550 for the 13-inch version with Touch Bar. The 15-inch version has both Intel HD Graphics 530 for low power and discreet graphics for high performance. There are options for Radeon Pro 450 with 2GB of GDDR5 or 460 with 4GB of GDDR5 on the 13-inch model, or Radeon Pro 455 with 2GB of GDDR5 or Radeon Pro 460 with 4GB of GDDR5 on the 15-inch model. If you graphics needs are casual at best, the 13-inch MacBook Pro can save you some cach. If you want the biggest graphics boost you can get, you want the 15-inch MacBook Pro. Battery Life All versions of the MacBook Pro 2016 are rated for 10-hours of web browsing or iTunes movie playback and 30 days on standby. (iTunes movie playback is hardware accelerated, so YouTube in Chrome will consume way more power, for example.) Those are for base models, though. The higher the processor and graphics options you get, and the harder you push them, the less battery life you'll get. Battery life is pretty much the same on all models, just know that the more and hotter you push them, the more you'll have to charge them. Memory The amount of random access memory (RAM) in your Mac determines how many apps you can keep live at a time, how big your photo or video editing projects can be without having to swap data out back and forth on the drive, and otherwise keeps everything super fast. The 13-inch MacBook Pro 2016 without Touch Bar starts with 8GB of 1866MHz LPDDR3 memory and can go to 16GB. The 13-inch MacBook Pro 2016 with Touch Bar starts at 8GB of 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory and can go to 16GB. The 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016 only comes with 16GB of 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory. If you don't want 16 GB of RAM, you need to go 13-inch MacBook Pro. All MacBooks Pro currently max out at 16 GB, so if that's what you want, get any MacBook Pro you want. Storage Storage used to consist of big, noisy hard drive platters that spun around and didn't take well to bumps or power problems. Now they're solid state — Flash chips with no moving parts. They don't hold as much as old-style hard drives and are still more expensive, but they're ultra-fast and far more resilient. The 13-inch MacBook Pro 2016 comes with 256GB PCIe Flash storage but can go up to 1 TB. The 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016 starts with 256GB PCI Flash storage on the low-end model, 512GB PCIe Flash storage on the high-end model, and both can go to 2 TB. If you want the largest amount of storage possible — 2 TB — you want the 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016. Ports Wired connections like USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 let you connect to high-performance accessories like external displays, drives, networks, and more. The 13-inch MacBook Pro 2016 without the Touch Bar has 2x Thunderbolt 3 ports (USB-C), both the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016 with the Touch Bar have 4x Thunderbolt 3 ports (USB-C), though the two right ports on the 13-inch aren't full speed. If you want the most, fastest ports possible, you want the 15-inch MacBook Pro. Who should get the 13-inch MacBook Pro 2016? If you value portability over power, don't need to drive double the displays, are fine with fewer processor cores and lower end memory and graphics options, and otherwise want a pro without paying top dollar for it, get a 13-inch MacBook Pro. See at Apple Who should get the 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016? If you want power, the biggest display possible, the ability to drive ridiculous amounts of external display, and options for the most memory, processor cores, and graphics chips availale, you want the 15-inch MacBook Pro.

Poisoned Word docs deploy rogue web proxies to hijack your encrypted traffic Russian cyberspies blamed for U.S. election hacks are now targeting Macs Video Why You Lost Your Windows 10 Product Key A new malware program that targets macOS users is capable of spying on encrypted browser traffic to steal sensitive information. The new program, dubbed OSX/Dok by researchers from Check Point Software Technologies, was distributed via email phishing campaigns to users in Europe. One of the rogue emails was crafted to look as if it was sent by a Swiss government agency warning recipients about apparent errors in their tax returns. The malware was attached to the email as a file called Dokument.zip. [ Further reading: How the new age of antivirus software will protect your PC ] What makes OSX/Dok interesting is that it was digitally signed with a valid Apple developer certificate. These certificates are issued by Apple to members of its developer program and are needed to publish applications in the official Mac App Store. Applications signed with an Apple-issued developer certificate can also be installed on the latest versions of macOS without triggering security errors or requiring manual overrides, so it's not hard to see why this would be valuable to a malware program. It's not clear if Dok's creators paid to obtain a developer certificate by joining Apple's developer program with a fake identity or if they stole the certificate from a legitimate developer. Once installed on a Mac, OSX/Dok displays a fake and persistent notification about a system security update that needs to be installed. Users who agree to install the update will be prompted for their administrator password. Once the malware obtains elevated privileges, it will make the active user a permanent administrator so the OS will never ask for the password again when the malware executes privileged commands in the background. Dok will also modify the system's network settings to route web traffic through a proxy server controlled by the attackers and located on the Tor anonymity network. In order for this to work, it also installs a Tor client that's started automatically. The reason why web traffic is routed through a proxy server is to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack and decrypt secure HTTPS connections. This is achieved by installing a rogue root certificate on the system that is then used to decrypt and re-encrypt HTTPS connections when they pass through the proxy. With this method, users will continue to see the SSL visual indicator in their browser when they access HTTPS websites and the browser will not complain about untrusted certificates. The ability to snoop on HTTPS traffic allows attackers to steal sensitive information like passwords for email; social media and online banking accounts; credit card details entered on shopping websites; personal and financial information entered into web forms; and more. With more than half of all web traffic in an average user's browser now encrypted, it's not surprising that attackers are resorting to man-in-the-middle techniques to capture sensitive data. This and other capabilities make Dok one of the most sophisticated malware programs targeting macOS to date, not counting spy programs created or used by nation states and law enforcement agencies. "We have been and still are in direct contact with Apple [employees] who are very helpful and responsive," Yaniv Balmas, Check Point's malware research team leader, said via email. "With Apple’s cooperation, we believe this specific campaign is now futile and does no longer pose any threat to Mac users." Check Point is looking for related attack campaigns and other possible variants of this malware that might have remained undiscovered until now. "The best way to avoid being infected with this and similar type of malware is to stay alert while opening emails and files from untrusted or unknown sources," Balmas said.

James Martin/CNET Car Tech by Shara Tibken 29 April 2017 8:32 am AEST @sharatibken Apple, Alphabet's Waymo, Tesla and dozens of other companies would like some changes to California's self-driving car policies. The companies -- along with dozens of other organizations like Lyft, Uber, Ford and Toyota -- submitted comments to the Department of Motor Vehicles, which were then posted online. The suggestions range the gamut from deciding when a driver should have to take control of the autonomous vehicle to recommending paying customers be allowed to ride in self-driving cars. See also Uber's self-driving cars back in SF, but now they're legal ​Waymo vs. Uber lawsuit: 10 things you need to know Apple receives autonomous-car testing permit in California The DMV told CNET that it's currently reviewing the public comments received on the proposed autonomous vehicle regulations. If it decides to make changes to its regulations, it will hold a 15-day public comment period for organizations and individuals to weigh in. Autonomous car technology has become a big focus for companies such as Google and Uber, and speculation about Apple's self-driving car plans have been swirling for months. It's unclear whether the company wants to build an autonomous vehicle of its own or if it wants to power the infotainment and other systems of a car. Apple obtained a permit earlier this month to test self-driving cars in California. Apple -- in its letter signed by Steve Kenner, its director of product integrity -- said it's "investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation." It wants to see changes to three California policies related to "disengagement reporting," definitions, and testing without safety drivers. Apple's letter One of Apple's criticisms focused on current and proposed disengagement reporting requirements, which explain when a driver has to take control of the self-driving car. Apple said the metric isn't transparent enough to make consumers comfortable with the technology. The company believes the correct metric for evaluating automated vehicles should include data on successfully prevented crashes and traffic rule violations.

Apple wants disengagement to be defined as "an unexpected event or failure that requires the safety driver to take control of the vehicle in order to prevent a crash or traffic violation." It also said disengagements shouldn't be reported for system errors or failures, the end of a test or experiment, or several other scenarios. The other two changes Apple requested relate the definition of development vehicles and testing without a safety driver. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Other comments Waymo, the self-driving car company owned by Alphabet, had some issues with regulations related to driver v. no driver as the key distinction, the definition of "remote operator," liability, and information privacy. "We're encouraged by the DMV efforts to develop regulations for autonomous vehicles that would help California remain a leader in the development of self-driving cars," Waymo said in a statement. "Waymo looks forward to deploying this life-saving technology in the state." Tesla, whose founder -- Elon Musk -- wants to make self-driving semis and buses, argued that vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds shouldn't immediately be banned from testing or deployment on public roads. It also said it shouldn't be prevented from selling a non self-driving car that previously was tested as an autonomous vehicle. "This prohibition appears to have been written without consideration for vehicles that were used as autonomous test vehicles but contain only production hardware and, once loaded with production software, are indistinguishable from production vehicles," the company said. "This is the case with many Tesla autonomous test vehicles." Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Uber, meanwhile, said paying members of the public should be able to ride in autonomous test vehicles with drivers. The ride-sharing service got in trouble with California late last year for putting self-driving cars on the road and for picking up paying customers without permission of the DMV. Within hours of the self-driving car launch in San Francisco in December, California's DMV told the company it was breaking the law and needed to halt the program until it got a permit. Uber refused to back down and said it would keep the cars on the road. After a week of back-and-forth between Uber and the DMV, along with an intervention from California's Office of the Attorney General, the DMV announced it was revoking the registration of 16 of the company's autonomous vehicles. Uber didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Uber's main rival, Lyft, said language requiring autonomous car companies to notify local authorities about tests is "ambiguous" and could create confusion and delays in the testing process. It proposed that the DMV could operate a webpage where manufacturers could post notices regarding their proposed testing areas. "Such a website would not only streamline the notice requirements, but also increase public access to this information," it said in its letter. Lyft didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Car laws The state of California has been working on autonomous vehicle regulations for nearly two years. In mid-December 2015, it released its first draft for review. In September 2016, it released its revised draft. After taking into account feedback, California published its latest proposed regulations on March 10, which set off a 45-day public comment hearing. Along with big tech companies, other commenters during that time included insurers, car dealers' associations, "a concerned citizen" and Fathers Against Drunk Driving. The DMV plans to summarize and respond to all comments when it submits its regulations to the Office of Administrative Law for approval. If the OAL approves the regulations, they become law that go into effect 120 days after their approval. The DMV estimates the regulations could be in effect by the end of November, a spokesperson said. Reuters earlier reported the news. Does the Mac still matter?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: iDropNews Leaked molds shed light on bold new iPhone 8 design Yoni Heisler @edibleapple April 28th, 2017 at 2:02 PM Share Tweet If the onslaught of iPhone 8 leaks we’ve seen in the past few days is any indication, it appears that our worst fears about the iPhone 8’s new form factor are completely unfounded. Specifically, leaked schematics and case moldings suggest that Apple will not place a Touch ID sensor on the back of the device, a design decision which would have arguably negated the utility of Touch ID and Apple Pay altogether. Don't Miss: There’s one more reason I could never ditch my iPhone 7 Plus for a Galaxy S8 Instead, rumor has it that Apple has figured out a way to embed the Touch ID sensor into the OLED display itself, thereby paving the way for a front facing display that is essentially one giant piece of glass. All the more compelling is that the iPhone 8 bezel is said to be just 4mm all around the display. In short, the iPhone 8 may very well be the sleekest smartphone design we’ve ever seen by the time it hits store shelves. The latest iPhone 8 leak supporting this design comes to us via a leaked iPhone 8 mold and diagram originally unearthed by Slashleaks. The most notable thing about the mold above is that there’s no cut-out for Touch ID sensor on the back. Additionally, it’s probably a safe bet at this point that the camera module on the iPhone 8 will be positioned vertically. On a related note, it’s widely believed that the iPhone 8 will incorporate advanced 3D cameras that will be used for brand new augmented reality features. The cameras will reportedly make use of 3D sensing technology Apple picked up when it acquired PrimeSense a few years ago. Recall, PrimeSense was the Israeli company responsible for supplying the technology Microsoft used on its first-gen version of Kinect. Not one to mince words, reputed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has previously stated that Apple’s camera technology on the iPhone 8 has the potential to “reinvent the user experience.” Image Source: Slashleaks And while Apple’s specific plans with augmented reality remain to be seen, some of the iPhone 8 concepts we’ve seen illustrate why augmented reality could be a huge mobile game-changer. As a prime example, the two iPhone 8 concept photos below — from designer Gabor Balogh — are particularly breathtaking. Image Source: Gabor Balogh Incidentally, it’s also believed that the iPhone 8 will include facial recognition technology that is so advanced it can be used for mobile-based biometric authentication. Recall, Apple reportedly acquired a company called Realface, a start-up with impressively advanced algorithms capable of detecting individual faces and even specific emotions in real-time. A demo of Realface’s software in action can be seen below. As for when the iPhone 8 will see the light of day, we may have to wait longer than the typical September launch window. Unfortunately, there have been a chorus of reports pointing to an iPhone 8 release date sometime in October or even November. Still, if the iPhone 8 is anything like the leaked schematics and concept photos we’ve seen, it will be well worth the wait.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Apple Has Stopped Paying Qualcomm Royalties Altogether Qualcomm is cutting its third-quarter revenue guidance by $500 million as a result. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 28, 2017 at 2:11PM Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) didn't see this coming. The mobile chip giant's legal battle with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to dominate the narrative -- and conference calls. When Qualcomm announced fiscal second-quarter earnings earlier this month and issued guidance for the third quarter, it noted that while Apple was interfering with royalty payments between Apple suppliers and Qualcomm, Qualcomm's contracts with those suppliers were still valid and enforceable. It had seemed as if the $1 billion at the heart of Apple's lawsuit was all Apple wanted to withhold by not paying its suppliers, who subsequently pass that cash on directly to Qualcomm. It turns out that Apple has simply stopped paying royalties altogether while the lawsuit remains ongoing. Image source: Apple. Enough is enough Apple has now told Qualcomm that it will be withholding all royalty payments to contract manufacturers, including for sales during the March quarter. Furthermore, the Mac maker plans on continuing to withhold payment "until its dispute with Qualcomm is resolved." Ouch. Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg slammed the move, saying, "Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable" and that Apple is "improperly interfering" with enforceable license agreements. As a result, Qualcomm is being forced to update its guidance for the fiscal third quarter to exclude any royalty revenue from Apple contract manufacturers. We're talking about a $500 million hit at the midpoint of revenue guidance. Fiscal Q3 2017 Guidance Prior Current Revenue $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion EPS (GAAP) $0.67 to $0.92 $0.52 to $0.62 EPS (Non-GAAP) $0.90 to $1.15 $0.75 to $0.85 Data source: Qualcomm. Didn't see this coming On the call earlier this month, Qualcomm mentioned that its guidance had factored in a number of scenarios regarding whether or not Apple would pay, but did not consider the possibility that Apple wouldn't pay anything at all. Here's what CFO George Davis said (emphasis added): Our guidance range for earnings per share is wider than our typical practice, primarily due to the uncertainty around whether Apple suppliers will withhold some portion of the royalty payments they are obligated to pay on other contracts with us. We have considered a variety of scenarios within the range. However, our guidance range does not include the case where no payments are made by Apple suppliers. We will update our guidance if we subsequently learn of any action that would take us materially outside of the announced guidance range. Given Apple's notification, Qualcomm has to update its forecast since it's a pretty material change; Qualcomm now expects to recognize no revenue associated with these agreements. It's true that Qualcomm can and very well may pursue the contract manufacturers directly since technically the agreements are with them (Foxconn had nearly $21 billion on its consolidated balance sheet at the end of 2016), but that strategy may not be successful. The money has always come from Apple, and suppliers are getting pinched in the middle. It's a bona fide web of convoluted legal agreements. What's less clear is how long this will continue to be an overhang. Apple seems to have no intention on settling, and protracted legal battles of this magnitude can easily take years to play out to the end. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

[Photo: Flickr user Kārlis Dambrāns] By Mark Sullivan04.28.17 | 5:48 pm Apple is expected to announce an adequate to half-decent quarter when it reports earnings after market close on Tuesday. Anything that beats analyst expectations (see below) would be pretty much OK with everybody. advertisement Why such low expectations for one of the most valuable companies in the world? The iPhone remains Apple’s bread and butter, and the company will announce two or three new ones this fall, so we expect that lots of people are holding off buying iPhones until then. The first quarter also tends to be seasonally depressed every year. Given those factors—and that Apple’s Q1 last year was not very impressive—the bar is pretty low. Here’s what we expect to see: Phones. Apple will likely sell close to 52 million iPhones for the quarter—a one percent increase over the same quarter last year. Anything above that is gravy. Last quarter Apple sold a surprising 78.3 million devices, ending a three-consecutive-quarter trend of declining sales. Revenue. Apple said early that it expects to report between $51.5B and $53.5B in revenue for the quarter. Yahoo’s analyst consensus calls for just shy of $53B. I’m betting Apple will report revenues just above $53B. Happy days. Services Business. Everybody’s been downright bubbly about the surprising growth of Apple’s services business, meaning all the digital content we can buy from the App Store or iTunes. The services business grew 18% in the final quarter of 2016, contributing $7.2 billion of revenue (CEO Tim Cook said the services business contributed $20 billion in revenue in 2016). Analysts will be looking for a continuation of that growth this quarter. Cook says Apple is trying to double its services business in the next four years, so any setbacks will be looked at harshly. China Market. Everybody’s keeping a nervous eye on China, a market that Apple is counting on for growth but that has been underperforming in the past year. But, as Jason Snell at Six Colors points out, Apple’s China sales have slipped below its European sales in the last three quarters. If this trend continues, CEO Tim Cook will have some explaining to do. Mac. Mac sales slid down for an entire year before growing slightly last quarter, when Apple reported 5.4 million units sold worldwide. Gartner believes Apple sold 4.2 million Macs in the first calendar quarter of 2017, which, if accurate, would mean another quarter of growth (4 million were sold in the same quarter a year earlier). advertisement iPad. We’re expecting more bad news on the iPad front. Sales are likely to continue to falter—we’ve gotten used to it now—as they have for the past couple of years. Apple recently announced (in early April) a competitively priced $329 iPad, but we suspect it’s too early to really see how enthusiastically the market will receive that device. Watch. The Apple Watch doesn’t contribute a whole lot to the bottom line yet, but the device had what I’d call a break-out holiday quarter. Based on some online sales tracking numbers, we’re inclined to believe the Watch sold as many as 5 million units in the quarter. Apple won’t say how many it sold in the March quarter (or any quarter), but we’ll be looking for signs that it sustained those sales figures, thus opening a new chapter in the story of Apple Watch-as-mass-market-device. Apple will announce results after market close on Tuesday and then hold an earnings call with analysts. We’ll be reporting the earnings and listening in on the call. And here’s some CHARTS!

According to CNET, Amazon will reveal the new Echo device, codenamed 'Knight' next month. Earlier this week it introduced Echo Look, a 'style assistant' smart camera priced at $200. Scroll down for video  According to CNET, Amazon will reveal the new Echo device, codenamed 'Knight' next month. Earlier this week it introduced Echo Look, a 'style assistant' smart camera priced at $200.  WHAT IS AMAZON ECHO? Amazon Echo is a voice-controlled smart speaker that works alongside a smartphone app. Using a virtual assistant called Alexa, the speaker can respond to voice commands from the user, such as setting an alarm or ordering a cab. Echo also works with services like Spotify as a 360-degree wireless speaker.  According to CNET, Amazon got a 'wake-up call' last week after Google said its Home smart speakers can now identify multiple users, a feature Echo devices don't have.  Amazon's devices team may now be looking to speed up introduction of these products so they can stay ahead of Google, the person added.  The new device may help Amazon expand and improve the Echo's capabilities in more areas, including video chats and online shopping, making the gadget more of a must-have item for homes. Amazon sold an estimated 8 million Echo devices in the US since the product first launched, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners said in January. Earlier this year Bloomberg, said the new version of the hit speaker will come complete with a 7inch touchscreen.   RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Lockheed Martin unleashes the Fury: First flight tests of...

Share this article Share 'The new device will have a touchscreen measuring about seven inches, a major departure from Amazon's existing cylindrical home devices that are controlled and respond mostly through the company's voice-based Alexa digital assistant, according to two people familiar with the matter,' Mark Gurman of Bloomberg wrote.   'The latest Amazon speaker will be larger and tilt upwards so the screen can be seen when it sits on a counter and the user is standing, one of the people said,'  The speakers innards are also set for an overhaul, with 'high-grade speakers' boosting its sound quality, it is claimed.  ECHO LOOK 'STYLE ASSISTANT' Amazon's Echo Look smart camera is priced at $200. It is not yet available to buy in the UK, and those who want to buy it in the US can do so on an invite-only basis.  Powered by Alexa, the device takes full-length photos and videos from all angles to help users pick the right outfit. Amazon has released the Echo Look, which is an Alexa-powered camera that takes full-length photos and short videos of you and your home. Experts have warned that many Echo Look customers do not fully understand the data that they are handing to Amazon The app lets users create a personal lookbook, browse your outfits, and use computer vision-based background blur to make your outfits pop. The new feature, called Style Check, uses advanced machine learning algorithms and advice from fashion specialists to let users know whether their choice in clothing was a do or a don't.  Amazon's newly-announced Echo Look uses the company's Alexa AI to take photos and videos of you and make judgements on outfits. But experts have expressed concern over the privacy issues surrounding a camera that regularly takes and stores pictures of users and their homes. They say that Amazon must update its privacy policy and better-inform consumers of the technology's risks.   Amazon is increasingly facing competition for the Echo, and figures released yesterday claim over 5.1 million have been sold - although Amazon refuses to reveal the exact number.   The new Amazon device will use an optimized version of Fire OS, the software that runs Amazon's Fire tablets and Fire TV set-top box, which can also use Alexa.  The cylindrical speaker uses Amazon's personal voice assistant called Alexa, which is similar to Apple's Siri. It was recently launched in the UK, and a new white version of the speaker has also been introduced for the European debut, to sit alongside the original black model. Initially only available to Prime subscribers, the Echo was made available to all all US customer in June 2015.  Previously, Amazon has delayed launching the product in other countries because of concerns that Alexa would not understand accents outside of America.  WHAT IS GOOGLE HOME?  Google Home is a small speaker that will be able to play music and access Google Assistant, a new AI system the search giant unveiled at I/O in May. It will harness the power of Google's search engine along with the AI technology the firm developed to beat a grandmaster at the ancient board game Go to create assistants people can talk and text with as if they were a human being.Downl  Google Home (pictured) is the small speaker will be able to play music and access Google Assistant, a new AI system the search giant unveiled at I/O in May. It's believed Apple has been working on their smart-home device for at least 2 years The gadget is also a high quality speaker, Google claims, allowing users to play back music from online services of a phone. It can also control other speakers, forming a voice controlled multi room hifi system, and control other devices such as lights and Google's Nest thermostat. The voice controlled assistant will be able to control devices and answer queries.  The software has since been tweaked to cope with both British and German voices.   David Limp, Amazon's senior vice president for devices, envisions the voice assistant functioning like the 'Star Trek computer', in that it will answer users no matter where they are in their home and right away.  Alexa is the 'wake word' for the internet-connected speaker. Alexa can respond to voice commands with actions such as setting an alarm, or simply by providing a spoken answer to a question.  Shoppers can also ask Alexa to put products on their Amazon shopping list   The smart speaker learns as it goes along, getting to know the user's speech patterns, vocabulary and preferences. The cylindrical speaker, which is also coming to Germany, uses Amazon's personal voice assistant called Alexa, which is similar to Apple's Siri Echo has seven hidden microphones to ensure that it can pick up voice commands from anywhere in the room.  With built-in Bluetooth, the Wi-Fi-connected Echo also functions as a 360-degree wireless speaker.  The speaker enables hands-free voice control from the likes of Amazon Music, Spotify and other streaming services.  Echo also works with a number of other firms such as Uber, enabling users to order a cab with a spoken command. Other firms included for the UK launch are Just Eat, National Rail and Sky Sports.  Alexa can also be used to controlled smart home appliances including Hive, Nest and Hue. To ensure the privacy of Echo users, pressing the mute button will cut all power to the microphones. Users will also be able to delete voice searches from the Alexa app if they choose.  The smaller Echo Dot speaker will launch on 20 October with a price tag of £49.99 ($49.99, €59.99).  This device enables buyers to position the Alexa voice assistant in additional rooms around the house.  Savings will be available for those who buy the Dot speaker in batches of six or 12.  Commenting on the launch, Warwick Business School professor Mark Skilton, a professor of Practice at Warwick Business School said:  'We are a long way off artificial general intelligence where a machine is fully able to think as a human; but the days of the keyboard and mouse are numbered. 'The point that [Echo] does not have a screen is not relevant as when you use it, the voice interaction is natural and the issue is more in learning the range of 'skills' it can do to help you. 'We have grown up with poor voice recognition and error prone requests on our mobile devices but Amazon started a full 12 months before Google on developing a high precision microphone and voice recognition system that is built into its marketplace ecosystem'.   Read more: Amazon Said to Plan Premium Alexa Speaker With Large Screen - Bloomberg Amazon Echo with a built-in screen may be on deck next month - CNET Share or comment on this article e-mail 6 shares Most watched News videos Calm cashier keeps his cool as armed robber threatens him with gun EXCLUSIVE: Woman in burka dragged off bus by undercover police Harrowing footage shows Derry McCann stalking a woman Beatrix the dog and Midge the cat take each other on in 'boxing' The moment a woman in burka is dragged into doorway by police Attached dog and duck form unlikely relationship with one another Gun shots heard during police operation on house in Willesden 'I'm such a different person' Kim K cries over Paris robbery Festival 'FRAUD'!

Business Technology Apple blocks more patent payments to Qualcomm, escalating feud Qualcomm has reduced its third quarter financial outlook after learning Apple will withhold patent royalty payment until a legal dispute is resolved. Reuters Qualcomm has reduced its third quarter financial outlook after learning Apple will withhold patent royalty payment until a legal dispute between the two companies is resolved. Qualcomm has reduced its third quarter financial outlook after learning Apple will withhold patent royalty payment until a legal dispute between the two companies is resolved. (Reuters) Mike FreemanContact Reporter Qualcomm slashed it financial forecast for the current quarter early Friday, blaming Apple for further withholding patent royalties payments in a fierce legal fight over intellectual property licensing. The lower revenue and profit outlook, which Qualcomm hinted at last week when it reported March quarter earnings, highlights the rising stakes in the rocky relationship between the two tech giants that shows no sign of improving. Qualcomm expects revenue of $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion for its fiscal third quarter ending June 30. Earnings are pegged at 52 cents to 62 cents per share under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. For the same quarter last year, Qualcomm posted $6 billion in revenue and GAAP earnings of 97 cents per share. In January, Apple sued Qualcomm, saying it forces smartphone makers to pay too much for use of its 3G/4G standard essential patents, which are required to be licensed under “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” terms. Qualcomm counters that its royalty rates, which top out at roughly 5 percent of the device price, have been negotiated through hundreds of agreements spanning two decades. According to Qualcomm, its licensing business model allowed Apple to enter the smartphone market with little or no investment in core cellular technology. While 3G/4G patent licenses make up about one-third of Qualcomm’s annual revenue, they account for most of its annual profit. Apple is the world’s largest seller of smartphones. In a recent research report, Bernstein Research Analyst Stacy Rasgon estimated that Apple could account for as much as one-third of Qualcomm’s royalty business, or more than $2 billion a year. Apple doesn’t directly license patents from Qualcomm. Instead, Foxconn and other contract manufacturers that build iPhones and iPads have license agreements. Apple reimburses them for royalties. Last quarter, Apple withheld some Qualcomm royalty reimbursements to contract manufacturers, but only up to $1 billion. That’s equal to royalty “rebates” that Apple contends it’s owed by Qualcomm under a separate business cooperation deal. When it reported March quarter earnings, Qualcomm wasn’t sure Apple would block reimbursements beyond the $1 billion amount. But now Qualcomm says Apple indicated that it will continue withholding reimbursements until the legal war between the two companies is resolved. As a result, Qualcomm’s new financial guidance assumes no royalty payments from iPhone/iPad contract manufacturers in the quarter. “Apple is improperly interfering with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm’s licensees,” said General Counsel Don Rosenberg in a statement. “Apple’s continued interference with Qualcomm’s agreements to which Apple is not a party is wrongful and the latest step in Apple’s global attack on Qualcomm.” In a statement, Apple called Qualcomm’s royalty rates unreasonable. “We’ve been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years, but they have refused to negotiate fair terms,” the company said. “Without an agreed upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court.” Qualcomm’s patent licensing business has come under fire worldwide, and the company believes it was instigated by Apple and others. Last fall, the Korea Fair Trade Commission fined Qualcomm more than $850 million for allegedly abusing its market power in the way it licenses patents. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also filed a lawsuit, and Apple launched its legal action shortly afterward. Qualcomm denies the allegations. It has countersued Apple, appealed the South Korea fine and is seeking dismissal of the FTC case on the grounds that it fails to show how Qualcomm licensing practices harmed the smartphone market. Analysts are unclear what might happen next. Rasgon, the Bernstein analyst, said there is a possibility that other smartphone firms could begin withholding royalty payments, too. “We know there is already an additional licensee dispute of $150 million in revenue per quarter, likely Samsung in our opinion, and the threat of contagion remains, especially with Apple now paying essentially nothing at all,” said Rasgon in a research note. Tim Arcuri, an analyst with Cowen & Co., said that Qualcomm’s next move “could be to retaliate on Apple via its contract manufacturers (with whom it has licensing deals) and try to get an injunction to literally halt the manufacturing of iPhones.” But two other analysts interviewed by the Union-Tribune think such a move is unlikely. They contend Apple would not have suspended royalty reimbursements unless it was confident that Qualcomm wouldn’t seek an injunction. Qualcomm announced the lower guidance before markets opened Friday. Investors shrugged off the news. The company’s shares ended trading up 53 cents at $53.74 on the Nasdaq exchange.

In the definition, the word describes “people who are docile, compliant, or easily influenced : people likened to sheep.” Related: iPhone 8 But the usage context offered by the dictionary features an insult to those who love nothing more than taking the wrappers off a brand new Apple accessory, regardless of the price or usefulness. “Apple's debuted a battery case for the juice-sucking iPhone—an ungainly lumpy case the sheeple will happily shell out $99 for,” the quote attributed to a Doug Criss reads. How rude. The quote has naturally been met with ire from the very folks who have helped Apple become, at various points in time, the richest company on earth. Dustin Ravizé in Las Vegas rages: “This is disgusting, complete disrespect to people who use Apple's technology to enrich their lives and the ones around them.” Bill Baz argues: “The word should not be defined by using a quote against a single company. Very derogatory.” While Caleb Kingston replies: “I actually think it helps me understand the word better.” Touché, Caleb. To be honest, Merriam-Webster is hardly the Oxford English Dictionary, so Apple fans shouldn't take that much notice. Are you affronted by the definition? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

Photo / News.com.au When Apple releases a new product, people ignore requests to pre-order and camp on the footpath outside Apple stores for days. They want to be among the first to secure the latest iPhone from the Apple Store and experience the spectacle of being greeted with applause and cheers from the multiple staff lining every floor of the multi-level flagship. When the doors open, the excited customers rush inside and are greeted by a sea of blue shirts, all wanting to get the latest Apple handset into their hands. With the highly-anticipated Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus going on sale to the general public on Friday, Samsung had one security guard outside its mobile flagship store in Sydney's CBD. It made sense to prepare for a hype similar to Apple, given it is one of the biggest smartphone manufacturers in the world. But with Samsung things are a little different. There are no long lines of people who have camped out for days. What could have been a hard day for the security guard turned out to be a peaceful morning, with just four people waiting outside the store to pick up the latest device. Continued below. Related Content Sharemarket buoyed by positive economic data Fran O'Sullivan: PM needs to think about kingmaker BNZ the tenant in Henderson Just like with Apple, the customers were met with cheers from Samsung's staff, but it just didn't have the same feel as the launch of an iPhone. Samsung Australia vice president of IT and mobile Richard Fink said he wasn't surprised by the turn out, given the company's approach to releasing a new device. Instead of encouraging huge crowds, the company tries to get its customers to preorder the device and have it delivered. Doing so comes with a plethora of benefits such as allowing customers to secure their handset a week before it went on sale, the inclusion of a free Gear VR headset and a $A66 voucher for Oculus content. A model Fink said is hugely successful. "We have seen unprecedented demand since the devices were made available for pre-order earlier this month. In fact, Australian pre-sale numbers for the Galaxy S8 and S8+ have set a new benchmark for Samsung in this country," he told news.com.au. "Thousands of Australians have already received their devices through our pre-sale early delivery offer and the feedback so far has been incredible - we believe this highlights the demand that Australians have for a premium and beautifully crafted smartphone experience." The phone, which news.com.au found to be highly impressive, has also been getting praise on Twitter since the release.

It has less to do with the success of Samsung's product and more to do with Apple's cult following, according to cultural historian Erica Robles-Anderson. During the launch of the iPhone 6S, Robles-Anderson suggested everything about Apple's store and release day was proof of its cult following. "It's a cult. Right? It's so obviously a cult," she told Atlas Obscura. Robles-Anderson said it all starts with Apple's flagship, which has parralels with large churches. "The oversized doors are fantastic," she said. "There's no reason for them." "It creates a space that emphasises your smallness when you walk in. You look at something far away, and that makes your body feel like you're entering somewhere sacred or holy." She added that Apple has also managed to make its customers feel like they are part of the exclusive family. "You're always seeing others and being seen by others. And the ways that any employee can serve you feels personal, but it's going on all around you, in a cacophony of like-mindedness." - news.com.au By Matthew Dunn Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Yes, I'll Give Feedback Apple, Uber, Tesla Ask California To Revise Rules For Self-Driving Cars Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple, Uber, Tesla Ask California To Revise Rules For Self-Driving Cars Image courtesy of Waymo April 28, 2017 4:50 pm EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler apple california department of motor vehicles driving just some suggestions proposal rules Self-driving tesla uber waymo Now that California has proposed rules intended to make it easier for tech companies to test self-driving vehicles on public streets, those companies are calling on the state to make additional changes that would further favor the industry. Tesla, Apple, Uber, and other companies delving into the self-driving vehicle market asked the California DMV to revise its proposals related to the type of vehicles allowed under the self-driving programs and reporting systems. The proposed rules require that autonomous vehicle testers include data on the times a car’s self-driving mechanisms are turned off, or disengaged, and put under the control of a human driver. The idea is that this will provide some transparency about the amount of time these cars spend actually driving themselves. However, in its letter [PDF] to the DMV, Apple argues that this requirement is too strict and that it doesn’t provide the public an accurate metric to consider. Apple, which is reportedly prepping to begin testing self-driving tech, lists a number of situations where autonomous systems might be turned off that shouldn’t be factored into these reports. For example, if a system is turned off so that the driver can navigate a construction zone; or when a driver uses their discretion to manually disengage the system because of a possible threat from an approaching vehicle. The letter even suggests that system errors or failures should not be included in these disengagement reports, unless they affect the safety of the vehicle. In fact, Apple only wants to limit these reports to incidents where a driver has to assume control “to prevent a crash or traffic violation.” Seeking to possibly test larger self-driving vehicles, Tesla asked [PDF] the DMV to revise a provision that would bar autonomous testing in vehicles that weigh more than 10,000 pounds. Tesla contends this does not promote safety and stifles innovation. The company also disagreed with a DMV proposal that prevents companies from selling test vehicles to anyone other than another company that is testing self-driving cars. While this rule is intended to prevent prototype vehicles from making their way to the market, Tesla says that many of the cars it currently manufactures have the sensing and computational hardware necessary for full self-driving — they just haven’t had the features activated. As opposed to some cars with obvious mounted sensor rigs, the only difference between a self-driving Tesla and a Tesla you’d see at the mall parking lot is software. Tesla says it should be able to sell test cars because it can “return the vehicles to production condition by re-loading production software… However, if such a vehicle has participated in any testing on public roads in California, the rule-making would prevent Tesla from ever being able to re-sell the vehicle.” Uber, which has had a back-and-forth relationship with California when it comes to self-driving tests, is obviously hoping to have a fleet of self-driving cars to pick up paying customers, but the proposed rule would not allow Uber or anyone to charge for rides in test vehicles. “Paying members of the public should have the opportunity to ride in autonomous test vehicles with drivers,” the company says [PDF]. “Having paying riders is an important part of testing… and the safety represents in the Department’s testing regulations are sufficient to keep passengers safe.” Uber also takes issue with a provision that asks companies to coordinate tests with local law enforcement. While it might be nice to give a heads up that driverless cars are going to be testing in the area, Uber believes it would not provide an accurate testing environment. “The coordination requirement risks created a fractured and inefficient testing regime because local authorities have neither the guidance nor expertise to evaluate the technology.” As for Alphabet Inc’s Waymo, the company asks [PDF] the DMV to provide clarity on what type of permit is required depending on whether or not a driver is present. The company also suggests that the DMV revise its definition of “remote operator,” as the current provision does not recognize that functions of a remote operator can be preformed by multiple people.

Specifically, leaked schematics and case moldings suggest that Apple will not place a Touch ID sensor on the back of the device, a design decision which would have arguably negated the utility of Touch ID and Apple Pay altogether. Don't Miss: There’s one more reason I could never ditch my iPhone 7 Plus for a Galaxy S8 Instead, rumor has it that Apple has figured out a way to embed the Touch ID sensor into the OLED display itself, thereby paving the way for a front facing display that is essentially one giant piece of glass. All the more compelling is that the iPhone 8 bezel is said to be just 4mm all around the display. In short, the iPhone 8 may very well be the sleekest smartphone design we’ve ever seen by the time it hits store shelves. The latest iPhone 8 leak supporting this design comes to us via a leaked iPhone 8 mold and diagram originally unearthed by Slashleaks. The most notable thing about the mold above is that there’s no cut-out for Touch ID sensor on the back. Additionally, it’s probably a safe bet at this point that the camera module on the iPhone 8 will be positioned vertically. On a related note, it’s widely believed that the iPhone 8 will incorporate advanced 3D cameras that will be used for brand new augmented reality features. The cameras will reportedly make use of 3D sensing technology Apple picked up when it acquired PrimeSense a few years ago. Recall, PrimeSense was the Israeli company responsible for supplying the technology Microsoft used on its first-gen version of Kinect. Not one to mince words, reputed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has previously stated that Apple’s camera technology on the iPhone 8 has the potential to “reinvent the user experience.” Read More And while Apple’s specific plans with augmented reality remain to be seen, some of the iPhone 8 concepts we’ve seen illustrate why augmented reality could be a huge mobile game-changer. As a prime example, the two iPhone 8 concept photos below — from designer Gabor Balogh — are particularly breathtaking. Incidentally, it’s also believed that the iPhone 8 will include facial recognition technology that is so advanced it can be used for mobile-based biometric authentication. Recall, Apple reportedly acquired a company called Realface, a start-up with impressively advanced algorithms capable of detecting individual faces and even specific emotions in real-time. A demo of Realface’s software in action can be seen below. As for when the iPhone 8 will see the light of day, we may have to wait longer than the typical September launch window. Unfortunately, there have been a chorus of reports pointing to an iPhone 8 release date sometime in October or even November. Still, if the iPhone 8 is anything like the leaked schematics and concept photos we’ve seen, it will be well worth the wait.

Twitter Facebook Stealthy Mac malware spies on encrypted browser traffic Researchers found a new malware program for macOS that is digitally signed and installs a fake root certificate to perform man-in-the-middle attacks Lucian Constantin (IDG News Service) 29 April, 2017 06:33 - - - - print email Comments A new malware program that targets macOS users is capable of spying on encrypted browser traffic to steal sensitive information. The new program, dubbed OSX/Dok by researchers from Check Point Software Technologies, was distributed via email phishing campaigns to users in Europe. One of the rogue emails was crafted to look as if it was sent by a Swiss government agency warning recipients about apparent errors in their tax returns. The malware was attached to the email as a file called Dokument.zip. What makes OSX/Dok interesting is that it was digitally signed with a valid Apple developer certificate. These certificates are issued by Apple to members of its developer program and are needed to publish applications in the official Mac App Store. Applications signed with an Apple-issued developer certificate can also be installed on the latest versions of macOS without triggering security errors or requiring manual overrides, so it's not hard to see why this would be valuable to a malware program. It's not clear if Dok's creators paid to obtain a developer certificate by joining Apple's developer program with a fake identity or if they stole the certificate from a legitimate developer. Once installed on a Mac, OSX/Dok displays a fake and persistent notification about a system security update that needs to be installed. Users who agree to install the update will be prompted for their administrator password. Once the malware obtains elevated privileges, it will make the active user a permanent administrator so the OS will never ask for the password again when the malware executes privileged commands in the background. Dok will also modify the system's network settings to route web traffic through a proxy server controlled by the attackers andÂ located on the Tor anonymity network. In order for this to work, it also installs a Tor client that's started automatically. The reason why web traffic is routed through a proxy server is to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack and decrypt secure HTTPS connections. This is achieved by installing a rogue root certificate on the system that is then used to decrypt and re-encrypt HTTPS connections when they pass through the proxy. With this method, users will continue to see the SSL visual indicator in their browser when they access HTTPS websites and the browser will not complain about untrusted certificates. The ability to snoop on HTTPS traffic allows attackers to steal sensitive information like passwords for email; social media and online banking accounts; credit card details entered on shopping websites; personal and financial information entered into web forms; and more. With more than half of all web traffic in an average user's browser now encrypted, it's not surprising that attackers are resorting to man-in-the-middle techniques to capture sensitive data. This and other capabilities make Dok one of the most sophisticated malware programs targetingÂ macOS to date, not counting spy programs created or used by nation states and law enforcement agencies. "We have been and still are in direct contact with Apple [employees] who are very helpful and responsive," Yaniv Balmas, Check Point's malware research team leader, said via email. "With Appleâs cooperation, we believe this specific campaign is now futile and does no longer pose any threat to Mac users." Check Point is looking for related attack campaigns and other possible variants of this malware that might have remained undiscovered until now. "The best way to avoid being infected with this and similar type of malware is to stay alert while opening emails and files from untrusted or unknown sources," Balmas said. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

The picture of the supposed iPhone 8 case was uploaded by KK Sneak Leaks and was spotted by 9to5Mac. Read: iPhone Wireless Charging: Apple Wants You To Charge Your Device Via Wi-Fi In The Future iPhone 8 News: Vertical Dual-Cameras The leaked photo of the clear iPhone 8 case suggests the smartphone will come with a dual-camera positioned vertically instead of horizontally, different from how it's currently placed on the iPhone 7. The case backs up a recent Bloomberg report that said Apple was reportedly testing versions of the iPhone 8 for better photos by positioning the dual-camera system vertically. This week, a schematic leak suggested the cameras on the 10th anniversary phone will be vertically aligned. Another rumor pointed to a vertical camera module would make the device ideal for augmented reality games. Here’s the leaked schematic of the iPhone 8 released this week: The leaked picture of the iPhone 8 case also shows a longer power button on the bottom of the device, compared to the current lightning port, which is smaller. iPhone 8 Embedded Touch ID Numerous reports have claimed Apple will release the iPhone 8 with the Touch ID embedded in the screen display. However, an analyst said this month that integrating the new Touch ID onto the display was the feature causing Apple the most trouble. Some reports have said Apple will embed the Touch ID on the back of the phone rather than the front of the display. However, Friday’s leaked iPhone case image suggests the Touch ID will be located on the front of the device.

However, some reports have suggested the iPhone 8 could be delayed because of some features. The 10th anniversary iPhone could come with a price tag exceeding $1,000. The three new models this year are expected to measure 4.7-inches, 5.5-inches and a 5.8-inch version. The 2017 iPhones are rumored to come with True Tone display, which is currently available on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The 10th anniversary iPhone is rumored to come with an array of new features. The iPhone 8, which could also be called the iPhone X, iPhone Pro or iPhone Edition, is rumored to come with an OLED screen display, wireless charging, and a 3D-sensing camera which could allow for augmented reality and virtual reality capabilities. Other rumors suggest the iPhone 8 will feature a Smart Connector for wireless charging and AR and VR accessories.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 28 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Dynemac Expands Commercial Services in Atlanta B2B Sales Increase At Refurbished Tech Distributor Dynemac Dynemac is aiming to help more local businesses make the transition from Windows to OSX. (PRWEB) April 28, 2017 For decades, Windows devices were labeled as “business” computers while Apple products were regarded as “personal” devices. Until very recently, these distinctions shaped the way that businesses made technology purchases. Now that a new wave of millennials are entering the workforce, corporate IT departments are challenging this long-held status quo. For the generation of employees that grew up with iPads and iPhones, the Apple ecosystem is second-nature. While Windows computers were previously heralded for customization and software compatibility, Apple devices seemed to provide a more accessible OS for younger audiences. In IT departments across the country, this trend has sparked new conversations about technology in the workplace. “We are seeing a noticeable difference between the tech preferences of our younger employees and older employees,” says Jeremy Cavalli, director of the IT department at an Atlanta business. “Ten years ago, the clear option was Windows. Today, there is a growing consensus in the business community that Macs can achieve the same results.” One business in particular is seizing this opportunity to expand its B2B division. Dynemac, a supplier of refurbished Apple products like Macbooks and iMacs, is using this upcoming market trend to expand its commercial operations. With the hiring of network specialist Lawrence Williams, the company is aiming to help more local businesses make the transition from Windows to OSX. Traditionally, the company has focused on direct user sales, but has been receiving more and more inquiries in recent years about corporate purchasing options. With special offers on trade-in services, companies can redeem their old devices (whether PC’s or Mac’s) to receive credit on new or refurbished products. Dynemac has also expressed that their new commercial clients often need on-site technical audits. “In order to meet the computing needs of a growing business, we need to assess their tech operations from the ground up,” says Williams. These on-site technical services include a wide range of network troubleshooting, server maintenance, and hardware repairs and replacement. In the age-old question of Mac vs PC, it seems that supporters are still as divided as ever, but more companies are beginning to rethink traditional software roles.

On Friday, lawyers for Qualy blamed the Cupertino iPhone racket for cutting half a billion dollars from its next quarterly forecast due to lower-than-expected royalties. Qualcomm and Apple are in the midst of a licensing dispute over whether the iPhone maker is being overcharged by Qualcomm for patents Apple says it never actually used. Apple is seeking $1bn it says it was overcharged and is now refusing to pay further for the licenses in question. "We've been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years but they have refused to negotiate fair terms. Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court," Apple said in a statement to El Reg. "As we've said before, Qualcomm's demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own." The way Qualcomm tells it, Apple has been underpaying its chip suppliers for parts and telling them not to pay Qualcomm for licensing. The manufacturers then, with Apple's backing, are withholding their payments, and Qualcomm is left to tell investors that it will be missing its revenue targets to the tune of $500m and could see as much as a 21 per cent year-over-year decline. "While Apple has acknowledged that payment is owed for the use of Qualcomm's valuable intellectual property, it nevertheless continues to interfere with our contracts," said Qualcomm executive vice president and general counsel Don Rosenberg. "Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable – the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade. Apple's continued interference with Qualcomm's agreements to which Apple is not a party is wrongful and the latest step in Apple's global attack on Qualcomm." This isn't the first claim by Qualcomm of Apple meddling. Less than two weeks ago, the royalty gap was cited in its last quarterly report. At that time, Qualcomm warned that Apple could further hurt its bottom line if it continued to withhold payment, and now it seems that scenario is going to become reality. ® Tips and corrections 10 Comments MORE iPhone Patents iPad More from The Register Another ZX Spectrum modern reboot crowdfunder pops up FPGA-based project has scored £290k so far 49 Comments ZX Spectrum Vega+ will ship on time, developer claims amid doubts Oi, where's my retro games console? 36 Comments Sinclair fans rejoice: ZX Spectrum Vega+ to launch October 20 Dead-flesh keyboard not included 41 Comments Game authors demand missing ZX Spectrum reboot royalties No cash, slow answers, firm still blames man who quit a year ago 56 Comments Monster crowdfunding total raised for Sinclair ZX Spectrum Vega+ Sir Clive Sinclair's tin rattles to the tune of £366,000 29 Comments ZX Spectrum Vega Plus backers complain of months-long refund delays But mouthpiece then denies he's a spokesman 37 Comments Whitepapers Dynamic Optimization Technology for Infrastructure Resources and Cloud Services Access this Innovation Insight to read Gartner’s recommendations for incorporating dynamic optimisation technology into your infrastructure and cloud initiatives.

We like this definition. Amidst a push for more Apple products in business settings, a leading supplier of refurbished technology seeks to grow its B2B division with commercial sales and on-site hardware service. (PRWEB) April 28, 2017 For decades, Windows devices were labeled as “business” computers while Apple products were regarded as “personal” devices. Until very recently, these distinctions shaped the way that businesses made technology purchases. Now that a new wave of millennials are entering the workforce, corporate IT departments are challenging this long-held status quo. For the generation of employees that grew up with iPads and iPhones, the Apple ecosystem is second-nature. While Windows computers were previously heralded for customization and software compatibility, Apple devices seemed to provide a more accessible OS for younger audiences. In IT departments across the country, this trend has sparked new conversations about technology in the workplace. “We are seeing a noticeable difference between the tech preferences of our younger employees and older employees,” says Jeremy Cavalli, director of the IT department at an Atlanta business. “Ten years ago, the clear option was Windows. Today, there is a growing consensus in the business community that Macs can achieve the same results.” One business in particular is seizing this opportunity to expand its B2B division. Dynemac, a supplier of refurbished Apple products like Macbooks and iMacs, is using this upcoming market trend to expand its commercial operations. With the hiring of network specialist Lawrence Williams, the company is aiming to help more local businesses make the transition from Windows to OSX. Traditionally, the company has focused on direct user sales, but has been receiving more and more inquiries in recent years about corporate purchasing options. With special offers on trade-in services, companies can redeem their old devices (whether PC’s or Mac’s) to receive credit on new or refurbished products. Dynemac has also expressed that their new commercial clients often need on-site technical audits. “In order to meet the computing needs of a growing business, we need to assess their tech operations from the ground up,” says Williams. These on-site technical services include a wide range of network troubleshooting, server maintenance, and hardware repairs and replacement. In the age-old question of Mac vs PC, it seems that supporters are still as divided as ever, but more companies are beginning to rethink traditional software roles.

DUBAI, UAE, 2017-Apr-27 — /EPR Retail News/ — Apple today premiered its newest store in the Middle East, Apple Dubai Mall, with a 186-foot curved storefront and balcony overlooking Burj Khalifa and the Dubai Fountain. Envisioned as a space for the community to gather, learn and be entertained, Apple Dubai Mall will also serve as a venue to watch the spectacular evening fountain shows and will host Apple’s new global in-store experience, “Today at Apple,” also announced today (APRIL 25, 2017). “We view our stores as a modern-day town square, where visitors come to shop, be inspired, learn or connect with others in their community,” said Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president, Retail. “And what better place to come together than overlooking Dubai’s epicenter, where the Dubai Fountain, Burj Khalifa and Dubai Mall meet. We are so honored to have a home at one of the world’s most incredible and dynamic intersections.” At the heart of every Apple Store is the drive to educate and inspire. “Today at Apple“ will launch at Apple Dubai Mall and in all 495 Apple stores next month with new sessions across photo and video, music, coding, art and design, and more, led by highly-trained team members. Apple Dubai Mall will also host high-profile events including live music, intimate conversations with film-makers and photographers, and live workshops with some of the world’s top talent. Events on opening day include Live Art with Myneandyours, and Artist Duos with musician Hamdan Al Abri and artist Sultan Al Ramahi. New Creative Pros, the liberal arts equivalent to Apple’s technical Geniuses, will teach “Today at Apple” sessions and offer individual advice and training to help customers take their creative skills to the next level. All of the store’s 148 employees are ready to welcome customers from around the world and speak a collective 45 languages. Like many of Apple’s other significant stores, Apple Dubai Mall aims to be open and transparent, blurring the barriers between inside and out, to erase the boundaries between the store and the community. To mitigate Dubai’s climate, Foster + Partners designed eighteen 37.5-foot-high motorized “Solar Wings” that respond to the ever-changing environmental conditions. When the sun is at its hottest they cool the store, and in the evenings they open to welcome everyone to the public terrace. Inspired by the the traditional Arabic Mashrabiya, each “Solar Wing” is locally fabricated from 340 carbon fiber reinforced polymer rods, and at 180 feet wide, the 18 panels make up one of the world’s largest kinetic art installations. Apple’s first two stores in the United Arab Emirates have welcomed more than 4 million visitors since opening in Dubai and Abu Dhabi 18 months ago. Apple will reach even more visitors from around the world at Dubai Mall, Emaar’s flagship mega-project and the world’s most-visited retail and lifestyle destination, welcoming over 80 million visitors for the past three consecutive years. Apple’s location overlooking the lake will stay open as late as midnight to everyone exploring the area. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple’s four software platforms — iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple’s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.

The new program, dubbed OSX/Dok by researchers from Check Point Software Technologies, was distributed via email phishing campaigns to users in Europe. One of the rogue emails was crafted to look as if it was sent by a Swiss government agency warning recipients about apparent errors in their tax returns. The malware was attached to the email as a file called Dokument.zip. What makes OSX/Dok interesting is that it was digitally signed with a valid Apple developer certificate. These certificates are issued by Apple to members of its developer program and are needed to publish applications in the official Mac App Store. Applications signed with an Apple-issued developer certificate can also be installed on the latest versions of macOS without triggering security errors or requiring manual overrides, so it's not hard to see why this would be valuable to a malware program. It's not clear if Dok's creators paid to obtain a developer certificate by joining Apple's developer program with a fake identity or if they stole the certificate from a legitimate developer. Once installed on a Mac, OSX/Dok displays a fake and persistent notification about a system security update that needs to be installed. Users who agree to install the update will be prompted for their administrator password. Once the malware obtains elevated privileges, it will make the active user a permanent administrator so the OS will never ask for the password again when the malware executes privileged commands in the background. Dok will also modify the system's network settings to route web traffic through a proxy server controlled by the attackers andÂ located on the Tor anonymity network. In order for this to work, it also installs a Tor client that's started automatically. The reason why web traffic is routed through a proxy server is to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack and decrypt secure HTTPS connections. This is achieved by installing a rogue root certificate on the system that is then used to decrypt and re-encrypt HTTPS connections when they pass through the proxy. With this method, users will continue to see the SSL visual indicator in their browser when they access HTTPS websites and the browser will not complain about untrusted certificates. The ability to snoop on HTTPS traffic allows attackers to steal sensitive information like passwords for email; social media and online banking accounts; credit card details entered on shopping websites; personal and financial information entered into web forms; and more. With more than half of all web traffic in an average user's browser now encrypted, it's not surprising that attackers are resorting to man-in-the-middle techniques to capture sensitive data. This and other capabilities make Dok one of the most sophisticated malware programs targetingÂ macOS to date, not counting spy programs created or used by nation states and law enforcement agencies. "We have been and still are in direct contact with Apple [employees] who are very helpful and responsive," Yaniv Balmas, Check Point's malware research team leader, said via email. "With Appleâs cooperation, we believe this specific campaign is now futile and does no longer pose any threat to Mac users." Check Point is looking for related attack campaigns and other possible variants of this malware that might have remained undiscovered until now. "The best way to avoid being infected with this and similar type of malware is to stay alert while opening emails and files from untrusted or unknown sources," Balmas said. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The iPad Air 3 may be dead, but the new iPad is a worthy successor Image 1 of 6 Share twitter linkedin facebook google+ email Dale Walker Reviews 28 Apr, 2017 5 Price  £282/£391 (WiFi/4G) exc VAT Pros  Cheaper than previous iPads; Strong performance; Generous storage options; Excellent battery life Cons  Screen is a step back; Slightly thicker than the iPad Air 2 Verdict  Apple has taken a sensible approach with the new iPad, sacrificing a fancy screen for a more attractive price point and some meaningful performance upgrades. When Apple revealed it would be releasing a new 9.7in tablet in March last year, it was generally expected that we'd get a glimpse at the new iPad Air 3. Instead Apple revealed the 9.7in iPad Pro, and since then the future of the iPad Air 3 has been in serious doubt. With the launch of Apple's latest tablet (simply called 'the iPad'), it's safe to say Apple has killed off the iPad Air range altogether. On first glance, Apple appears to have made some odd choices with its newest device. What we have now is a hybrid of the original iPad Air and Air 2 that is both thicker and heavier than the previous models, with a screen that isn't as fancy. In other words, it should have been a disaster. See related  Best iPad apps for 2017 Apple iPad Pro 9.7 review Apple iPad Pro 9.7 vs iPad Air 2 Price and competition However, it seems Apple has attempted to deliver an attractive alternative to the rather pricey iPad Pro 9.7. Instead of packing in more expensive tech and bumping the price up, the new iPad is Apple's cheapest tablet on the market. At £339, it's by no means a budget device, but it's a full £60 cheaper than the iPad Air 2, and even offers twice the storage capacity at 32GB. There is also a 128GB version available for £429, and 32GB and 128GB models that include 4G connectivity, priced at £469 and £559 respectively. Even against competing Android tablets, the new iPad's price holds up well. The recently released Samsung Galaxy Tab S3, which is gloriously slim and slight and has a fantastic AMOLED display, is rather pricey at £599. Even the equally fantastic Tab S2 has held its price well at £329. Features and design Designs within the iPad range never seem to deviate too much from Apple's distinct look, and this time is no different. The visual appearance of the new device may look similar to that of its predecessors, but Apple's nailed one of the most popular designs ever - hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. You will find the home button, lightning connector, and headphone jack in all the typical places, and it even features the same 8MP iSight HDR camera on the rear and 720p 1.2MP front-facing camera found on the iPad Air 2. Apple has once again chosen the familiar aluminium casing, and offers the same colour variations as the iPad Pro 9.7: gold, silver, and 'space grey'. Instead of the 'smart' keyboard connector found on the iPad Pro range, Apple has chosen to fit the new iPad with a series of magnets for the attaching of folding cases or compatible type covers, although for the latter you will need to use bluetooth. The downside to this change is that there's no officially supported keyboard cover from Apple, and it also doesn't support the Apple Pencil - but given the price of the tablet these are forgivable omissions. The only tangible change we could see was the added weight and size of the newer model: 7.5mm and 478g over the iPad Air 2's 6.1mm and 437g. However, this is so slight you're unlikely to notice unless you're comparing them side-by-side, and it certainly won't make any difference when thrown into a bag.  Display Sadly, the new iPad's display doesn't quite reach the standards of the iPad Air 2 or the iPad Pro 9.7. The anti-reflective coating found on older devices is missing, and there is a visible gap between the LCD panel and the surface glass, whereas this has traditionally been laminated. Screen vibrancy suffers as a result, and the presence of screen reflections and a poor contrast make on-screen images less impactful. However, it is important to remember that this is not a pricier successor to the iPad Air 2, and for its price you are getting a very capable screen with some impressive features. The 4:3 Retina-class 2,048 x 1,536, 264ppi display has a superb maximum brightness that peaks at 520cd/m2, far superior to the 390cd/m2 on the iPad Air 2. The contrast ratio is a fairly average 861:1, almost identical to the original iPad Air, but the screen is able to cover more of the sRGB colour space, providing colours that are vibrant and highly accurate.  Apple has also included its Night Shift tech, which helps to reduce the amount of blue light generated by the screen. Unfortunately the iPad lacks the 'True Tone' feature found on the iPad Pro 9.7, which helps the screen adapt colour temperatures to match ambient conditions. Performance and battery life In terms of hardware, the big change is the move to an Apple A9 processor, the same used in the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. While on paper it's not as powerful as the A8X processor found in the iPad Air 2, it's superior to the original iPad Air's 1.3GHz A7 chip. Despite the apparent downgrade, the new iPad feels surprisingly nippy. Pinch-zoom and swipe gestures respond perfectly, and there is very little slowdown when running demanding apps. Surprisingly, the new iPad also outperformed both the iPad Air and Air 2 in benchmark tests. It scored higher than both devices in the Geekbench 4 CPU test, reaching 2490 using single-core, over scores of 1803 from the iPad Air 2 and 1321 from the iPad Air. It's also massively more power efficient than previous generations. During our video-playback test, with the screen brightness calibrated to 170cd/m2, the iPad lasted 14 hours 47 minutes in one charge. That's four hours longer than the iPad Air 2, and two hours longer than the iPad Air. Verdict Apple's move to rein in the price of the lower-end iPad is a very savvy one. The iOS software is far better suited to devices of this kind than Android, and offering a more powerful, longer-lasting and more competitively-priced replacement to the previous iPad generation will doubtless help secure the company's place at the top of the pile. Of course, there's a bittersweet element to all this, as it's pretty much the final nail in the coffin for anyone who was hoping to see an iPad Air 3. If you can get over your disappointment, however, you'll find that Apple has produced one of the best tablets on the market once again. If you can't quite stomach the price of an iPad Pro, this is the tablet to buy.

Blog Qualcomm: Apple's Real iPhone Competitor Fred Molinari, Former CEO, Data Translation 4/28/2017 04:00 PM EDT  1 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet Apple has identified who its toughest foe is and is taking action. If you ask knowledgeable people about competition for Apples iPhone, most will say it's Android mobile phones, especially Samsung. This response is acceptable but fails to identify the more prominent aggressor. Yes, Android mobile phones are, worldwide, the largest sellers, but from a profit standpoint, the Apple iPhones pick up the major share. There is one other player that doesn't directly compete with Apple but holds the edge for Android capability: Qualcomm. Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 vs. Apple A10 We're about to see the major rivalry of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the to-be-announced Apple iPhone 8. But under the hood of the S8 is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor versus the Apple-designed A9 or possibly a speculated-about newer model A10. The performance of these new mobile phones will be directly attributable to which processor platform best satisfies mobile users. There's plenty that we don't know yet about which performs better. We do know that the Snapdragon 835 can support Gigabit LTE through its 4x20-MHz carrier aggregation and 256 QAM, as Qualcomm reports: "We are proud to continue our long and productive collaboration with Samsung to help bring the most advanced mobile experiences, such as Gigabit LTE and mobile VR, to consumers with the new Samsung Galaxy S8," said Alex Katouzian, senior vice president and general manager, mobile, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. "Featuring a thin and light design with superior battery life, immersive multimedia, and exceptional photography with Gigabit LTE speeds, the Samsung Galaxy S8 powered by the Snapdragon 835 Mobile Platform delivers the experiences [that] today's mobile users demand." Behind the Scenes There are more maneuvers behind the scenes on a corporate level that also drive the rivalry. For example, Apple has filed lawsuits against Qualcomm in three different countries: China, USA, and now the UK. Essentially, Apple asserts that Qualcomm has charged unfair heightened royalties for the use of its Intellectual Property, including patents, on the selling price of the whole mobile phone. This is an unusual circumstance of a user suing a supplier while still being supplied the goods. In the U.S., Apple is seeking $1B plus other amounts in the other suits. Furthermore, Apple has been a behind-the-scenes driver in the U.S. of the FTC complaint lodged against Qualcomm for using unfair trade practices against other semiconductor suppliers in monopolizing the mobile phone device market. This will likely face court review in May. Meanwhile, these suits by Apple and the FTC have taken a toll on Qualcomms stock price. It has languished about 15% below the price at the time of the lawsuits in January 2017. From afar, it would appear that Apple has identified Qualcomm as their most pressing competitor, with Qualcomms processor and internet connectivity allowing mobile phone manufacturers around the world to challenge Apple with high performance, off-the-shelf device selection, and lower prices. That's demonstrated by the 115 Chinese manufacturers that Qualcomm supplies. Profitability Both Apple and Qualcomm are formidable profit machines. Thus, both companies have plenty of economic weapons at their disposal. We'll watch this rivalry play out over the next several months. Expect the FTC to overturn the ruling against Qualcomm now that the Trump administration is in charge, but the existing lawsuits will play a continuing role. In the end, the outcome of how these new mobile phones perform in the market is in the hands of consumers. Place your bets now!

A US patent granted to Apple this week shows that its engineers are experimenting with wireless charging, a feature that's found its way to many phones and tablets but not Apple's iPhones and iPads. The patent, spotted by Apple Insider, would deliver power using signals in the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, among others. Those frequencies are the same ones used by Wi-Fi routers, which means Apple's invention could pave the way for your phone to charge wherever there's a strong-enough Wi-Fi signal. Once your phone gets enough juice, it could also provide power to other devices around it using the same frequencies. Related Truly Wireless Charging Edges Closer Truly Wireless Charging Edges Closer Like all patents, there's little chance of this technique showing up in consumer devices in the immediate future, nor is there a guarantee it will ever make it to market. But Apple appears to be preparing for the long-term future, because it notes in the patent filing that the power signals could also come from millimeter wave antennas, which make extremely high-frequency transmissions. Many companies, including Facebook and Verizon, are eyeing millimeter wave antennas as a way to blanket cities with super-fast internet without having to spend large sums on new fixed infrastructure. Verizon is planning a 5G home router, for example, that could be an ideal delivery vehicle for Apple's wireless charging signals. Apple's patent was awarded a little more than a month after Sony received one for a similar wireless charging concept, which envisions charging antennas embedded in a wide variety of consumer devices. Wireless charging ideas also seemed to be everywhere you looked at this year's CES, some of which could even charge cars.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Cars Image Source: Håkan Dahlström Apple joins Tesla in letter begging California to change its self-driving car rules Mike Wehner @MikeWehner April 28th, 2017 at 3:17 PM Share Tweet Apple hasn’t publicly stated that it’s working on self-driving vehicle technology quite yet, but it’s giving the world plenty of reason to think it’s doing just that. Earlier this month, Apple scored a permit to test self-driving vehicles in California, and now the company is showing its hand once again by joining the likes of Tesla, Uber, Ford, and Alphabet-owned Waymo in formally requesting that the state rethink its rules and regulations regarding driverless car testing. Don't Miss: Leaked molds shed light on bold new iPhone 8 design As Reuters reports, Apple’s letter addresses a number of what it sees as flaws in the state’s proposed autonomous vehicle testing policies. Writing to the California Department of Motor Vehicles, Apple’s Director of Product Integrity, Steve Kenner, asks the agency to change its proposed handling of “disengagement reporting,” which the company says can lead to misunderstandings and confusion among the general public when reading about instances where self-driving systems have handed control back to a human driver. Apple’s stance is that only the most crucial disengagement reports should require reporting, and that instances where an autonomous system disengages without serious consequence or risk of a crash or traffic violation should simply be chalked up to the developmental nature of the technology. Apple still agrees that disengagements that could have resulted in a crash or traffic violation should be reported, even if the human driver successfully intervened. “Apple appreciates the opportunity to comment on the proposed amendments to the testing and deployment language,” the letter concludes. “Apple looks forward to partnering with the California DMV and other stakeholders so that rapid technology development may be realized while ensuring the safety of the traveling public in the State of California.” Tags: Apple, California, government, Tesla View Comments Trending 1 Tech Samsung won’t stop saying weird things about the Galaxy S8’s design 2 Tech New Mac malware has an evil way of taking over your entire computer 3 Business Get ready for all the wireless carriers to get worse 4 Tech New iPhone 8 leak suggests Apple won’t use the design everyone hates 5 Tech There’s one more reason I could never ditch my iPhone 7 Plus for a Galaxy S8 Picked For You There’s one more reason I could never ditch my iPhone 7 Plus for a Galaxy S8 By Zach Epstein April 27th at 10:08 AM Chrome adds support for a newer GIF-killing format By Chris Mills April 28th at 10:03 PM NASA’s Cassini survived its first Saturn dive, and delivered some mind-blowing photos By Mike Wehner April 27th at 1:39 PM Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use ad

Microsoft is developing a worrying habit of neglecting its hardware products. Peter Bright - Apr 28, 2017 7:17 pm UTC At first glance, it's easy to mistake the Surface Pro 4 for the Surface Pro 3. reader comments 166 Share this story Microsoft's third-quarter financial results were published yesterday, and they had many high points: cloud revenue is growing well (though we have some misgivings about how the numbers are reported), Windows outperformed the PC market, and Office 365 passed 100 million corporate seats. But there were a couple of significant black marks: Phone revenue has dropped to effectively zero, and Surface revenue was down sharply year on year, with a 26-percent drop in revenue. The phone revenue is no big surprise: Microsoft has all but abandoned the market, and the last phones to sport a Microsoft logo—the Lumia 950 and 950 XL—are no longer sold. The company has been winding down its phone operation, writing off the entire value of the phone business it bought from Nokia and laying off thousands of former Nokia employees in the process. But the story with Surface is more unsettling. In its analyst call, Microsoft ascribed the drop in Surface revenue to "product end-of-lifecycle dynamics," whatever that means. The company's 10Q filing used rather clearer language: Microsoft simply didn't sell as many Surface systems. The Surface range has two main products: the Surface Pro 4, a tablet-style two-in-one, and the Surface Book, a laptop with a detachable screen. These systems were launched in November 2015. The Surface Pro 4 available today, about 18 months later, is unchanged. Surface Book has been slightly updated—a variant with a better GPU was added in November 2016. But it, too, is little altered. These portable systems were joined late last year by the Surface Studio, a fascinating but flawed desktop system. With its high price—it starts at a dollar shy of three thousand bucks—and niche utility—it's compelling if you're in the market for a Wacom digitizer, but otherwise something of a curate's egg—Surface Studio is not designed to be a big seller with mainstream appeal. Microsoft didn't offer numbers, but we'd imagine that the majority of Surface sales are of the portables. The march of technology Eighteen months is a long time to wait for systems to be refreshed. The Pro 4 and Book were early adopters of Intel's Skylake processors, but Skylake is now a generation old. Kaby Lake, which started shipping last autumn, is not a huge advance over Skylake, but it's a more power-efficient design that offers meaningful improvements in battery life, improved encoding and decoding support for 4K video, and, for the low-power Y-series parts, meaningful improvements in performance. Surface Pro 4 uses a Y-series part in the cheapest model, and it would stand to make big gains from a Kaby Lake upgrade. Microsoft wouldn't even have to do much work to make such a switch; Kaby Lake is pretty much a drop-in replacement for Skylake. Enlarge / Microsoft's Surface Book. Nathan Fitch The last 18 months have also seen significant growth in the adoption of USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3, which offer standardized single-cable charging and docking. While Thunderbolt 3 is still young, hardware companies are experimenting with concepts such as Thunderbolt 3 monitors that charge laptops over the same cable used to carry the display signal, external GPUs, and docking stations that are no longer specific to particular hardware models (or even OEMs). Indeed, it feels like a natural fit for a revised version of the existing Surface Dock, or even, dare we dream, a standalone version of the mouth-wateringly beautiful touch screen of the Surface Studio. USB Type-C is rapidly gaining adoption; it has already become the norm for phone charging (for Android, at least) and increasingly is being favored for laptop charging. The slimline ports enable thinner PCs, and the ability to use a single port for power, USB connectivity, and video output is compelling. No Surface product supports either technology. The Surface portable line-up, the bread and butter of the Surface brand, is looking very neglected. Further ReadingSurface Book with Performance Base: A lot more graphics in a little more weight At their release, the Pro 4 and Book were both arguably class-leading machines: 18 months later, they look sad and stale. Last November, we felt that we couldn't recommend the Surface Book's version with the updated GPU to most buyers—we couldn't justify buying a Skylake system with Nvidia 900-series graphics when the state of the art was Kaby Lake and 1000-series GPUs. Six months later, the machine looks even less appealing. With this stagnation, falling sales are inevitable. Until Microsoft shows the brand some love, the decline will only continue. We're not expecting to see that love any time soon, either; the company's guidance for the current quarter is that Surface sales will continue to fall. Microsoft is holding an event next week, and we expect there to be some hardware element, but we've also heard from sources close to the matter that there won't be updates to the Surface Pro or Surface Book. Either do hardware properly, or stop pretending If Microsoft wants to make PC hardware, it needs to do so properly and commit to the same kinds of updates as other PC OEMs. Almost every other PC OEM has refreshed its systems for Kaby Lake. Almost every other PC OEM has adopted, at least for machines in the premium space that Surface occupies, USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3. Surface Pro—a machine which, in its early generations, arguably defined that particular style of two-in-one systems—is no longer unique. HP, Dell, Lenovo, Samsung, and others all have solid two-in-one offerings. These machines are modeled after the Surface Pro concept, but they now embody that concept better than Microsoft's own system. The Surface has been out-Surfaced. The failure to do anything with Surface for so long makes us wonder just what Microsoft is up to. If the company is serious about its hardware ambitions—and officially, at least, it still says that its intent is to produce market-leading systems under the Surface brand—then it has to take its hardware seriously. That means refreshing it to keep pace with the competition. Further ReadingImagining a new Mac Pro, the “iMac Pro,” and the future of Apple’s desktops One hardware company has a similarly lackadaisical approach to updating: Apple. In recent years, refreshes of Mac laptops and desktop systems across the lineup have slowed down. While the company has been quick to pick up Thunderbolt 3 and USB Type-C on at least some of its machines, the broader failure to keep pace with the state of the art is a continued source of frustration for Apple loyalists. But Apple's hardware sales remain robust, because Apple, in a very important way, is not like Microsoft or any other PC OEM: if you want to run macOS in a legal and supported way, you simply have no option but to buy Apple hardware. There's no corresponding necessity when it comes to buying Surface. Microsoft is but one Windows OEM of many, and if Microsoft's hardware isn't offering the right feature mix, a system from HP or Dell or Lenovo or Samsung or some other company probably will. It's fine for Microsoft to take inspiration from Apple's close cooperation between hardware and software development; it's not fine for Microsoft to mimic Apple's unpredictable and inconsistent system refresh policies. The PC market dynamics don't allow it. Enlarge / Instead of a full refresh, Microsoft released the Surface Book with Performance Base. The base is a little fatter, its battery is bigger, and its GPU is faster. Peter Bright When Microsoft first started making hardware, there was widespread uncertainty as to what the company was hoping to do. General consensus was that Redmond's aim was to serve as a kind of trailblazer, building the kinds of systems that the company wanted to see in the world while pushing the PC market in the direction it wanted. But this kind of hobby approach is a problem. Without assurances of a long-term commitment to hardware development, many would-be customers will avoid the systems. This is particularly acute in the corporate space: support lifecycles and extended system availability are essential when buying a fleet of systems. Microsoft recognized this concern and took action to address it. Surface systems were offered through the usual corporate channel partners like Ingram Micro and through cloud subscriptions, and the company promised that Surface Pro 3 peripherals would remain compatible with Surface Pro 4. The message was clear: Microsoft wasn't merely dabbling in hardware, it was investing in building a serious hardware brand. After some early missteps, the hardware was solid and well-received, revenue grew steadily, and Surface looked like it was becoming an integral part of Microsoft's ecosystem. That feels like it's now in jeopardy. Troubling precedent It doesn't help that Microsoft's hardware track record is more than a little shaky, and skepticism about its commitment and seriousness to hardware is well-earned. After a difficult start, Windows Phone was finally on an upward trajectory, especially in the EU where, in some countries, it had broken double-digit market share. But lackluster hardware—including a complete failure to offer a competitive new flagship phone in 2014—and lack of clear messaging saw a complete reversal of fortunes. The ultimate result was felt this quarter: Phone revenue is now essentially zero, even as work on the mobile version of Windows 10 continues. Enlarge / The last high-end phones Microsoft released were the Lumia 950 (pictured) and 950 XL, which came out in November 2015. Peter Bright Surface RT and Surface 2, Microsoft's ARM-based two-in-one machines, similarly raise questions about the company's commitment to hardware. Although Windows 10 itself has been built for ARM systems (and a version of Windows 10 for ARM is on the market in the Internet of Things guise), Microsoft opted not to offer a Windows 10 upgrade for Surface RT or Surface 2. This leaves the machines basically orphaned. Microsoft's inaction has taken a promising prestige PC brand and turned it into a borderline embarrassment. The question of whether Microsoft cares about hardware and is in it for the long haul is once again a live one. We've seen similar levels of neglect before. It was ruinous for the Nokia phone business and devastating for Windows Phone. Windows on the desktop is, of course, going to prove more robust—it doesn't live and die on the fortunes of Surface in the way that Windows Phone hinged on Nokia and Lumia. But everything invested in building the Surface brand is now in doubt. That's bad for anyone who likes the machines, including those corporate buyers who have made the leap to Microsoft hardware. It's even worse for the software company's future ambitions: later this year, we're going to see a new generation of ARM machines running Windows. But with the way the company has treated its other hardware endeavors, who would want to take the gamble? Microsoft has developed a habit of ignoring and abandoning its niche hardware platforms; what reason is there to believe that Windows 10 for ARM will be any different?

News & Analysis Apple Stops Royalties to Qcomm Figures suggest that Apple pays ~$8 per device Rick Merritt 4/28/2017 03:00 PM EDT 2 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. — Qualcomm is lowering its third-quarter guidance by about $500 million, claiming that Apple said it will not pay patent royalties. The disclosure suggests that Qualcomm receives a whopping $2 billion a year, or roughly $8 per device, in royalties for Apple products. Specifically, Qualcomm lowered its third-quarter guidance from a range of $5.3 to $6.1 billion to a range of $4.8 to $5.6 billion. Apple said that it will withhold Qualcomm royalty payments starting in the first calendar quarter until the patent dispute between the companies is resolved, Qualcomm said in a press statement. Apple filed suit against Qualcomm in January, claiming that Qualcomm’s royalties were exorbitant and the chip vendor pressured it to remain silent. In a countersuit filed earlier this month, Qualcomm said that it paid Apple to refrain from asserting patents and revealed that it gets royalty payments for iPhones and iPads through Apple’s contract manufacturers including Compal, Foxconn, Pegatron, and Wistron. “Initial indications are that any [royalty] payment [from Apple’s contract manufacturers in the quarter] would likely be insignificant,” said Qualcomm’s statement. Using rough estimates based on trends in Apple’s annual unit shipments of iPhones and iPads, Apple pays about $8 a system in patent royalties to Qualcomm. Apple sold more than 211 million iPhones last year, more than 231 million the prior year, and hit peak quarterly sales for the iPad of 26 million units in 2013, one online source reported. Market researchers estimate that most iPads are sold without cellular, a dominant technology in Qualcomm’s patent portfolio. "Apple is improperly interfering with Qualcomm's long-standing agreements with Qualcomm's licensees," said Don Rosenberg, general counsel of Qualcomm, in a statement. "We will continue vigorously to defend our business model and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry." Suits between the two companies are the tip of a legal iceberg. In late December, Korea regulators levied a nearly $1 billion fine against Qualcomm, charging unfair patent practices. Less than a month later, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a suit against Qualcomm for similar charges. The suits were far from the first for Qualcomm, which makes a significant portion of its profits from patent royalties. Korea fined Qualcomm about $208 million and imposed corrective orders in July 2009 after an investigation into its practices in CDMA patents. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid $975 million as part of a settlement over patent disputes in China. The deal also cut royalty rates that Qualcomm was charging in China. — Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times Related posts: Qcomm Returns Fire in Apple Suit Q'comm Feels Smartphone Squeeze Korea Fines Qcomm Nearly $1B Patent Suits Hit Qcomm Profits Email This Print Comment More Related Links 400G Deals Winning Hand for Data Centers NI, AT&T Team on mmWave Channel Sounder for 5G Legal Woes Overshadow Qualcomm's Results Bcom Clocks 10G Ethernet in Real Time Smart Semi Fiber Does It All Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank Author Cash cow Gondalf   4/28/2017 6:07:14 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Slowly slowly Qualcomm main cash cow is ending....this is the reason they puchased NPX, they know hard times for easy gains are ahead.

Apple has filed lawsuits against Qualcomm in countries like the U.S., U.K., China and Japan, accusing the chipmaker of using its dominant market position to overcharge licensing fees. The iPhone maker itself doesn't pay licensing fees directly to Qualcomm. The fees are paid by partners like Foxconn, which makes the iPhone and iPad for Apple. Qualcomm is now accusing Apple of interfering with the licensing payments owed by those partners. Its revenue forecasts for the third quarter are affected, Qualcomm said. The chipmaker on Friday revised its revenue projections for the third fiscal quarter. It is projecting revenue to be between US$5.3 billion and $6.1 billion. That range runs between a decrease of 12 percent and an increase of 1 percent, compared to the same quarter last year. The forecast removes royalty revenues from Apple's contract manufacturers. In a second quarter earnings call, Qualcomm president Derek Aberle said the company's third quarter would be hurt by lower licensing revenue from Apple's partners, but he couldn't pinpoint an exact amount. Apple is a big customer of the chipmaker. In the most recent quarter, Apple suppliers underpaid royalties to the tune of $1 billion, Qualcomm said. But the chipmaker didn't take a loss those underpayments because the amount was similar to a sum held up by Qualcomm but owed to Apple in a separate agreement. Apple in January filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm in a California court, claiming the chipmaker was overcharging for royalties. Apple said Qualcomm was charging royalties for a portfolio of technologies, and not for the price of the baseband chip used in mobile devices. Qualcomm countersued Apple earlier this month for breach of contract and failure to negotiate licensing terms in good faith. The Apple's lawsuit came after an investigation by the South Korean government resulted in Qualcomm being fined $853 million for unfair licensing practices. Qualcomm accused Apple of cooperating with the South Korean government in its investigation. Apple is one of Qualcomm's largest customers, with the chipmaker's modems used in iPhones. A small number of iPhones have Intel's modems. Intel is now ramping up its modem product and is making a run at 5G radios, and Apple could move more of its iPhones and iPads away from Qualcomm's modems. For now, Qualcomm has a lead in modem technology and was the first vendor to offer gigabit modems. Qualcomm has also said outside of the lawsuits, it will continue to maintain a strong supplier relationship with Apple. Samsung continued making chips for Apple's iPhones even though the companies were previously embroiled in lawsuits. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

In a letter made public Friday, Apple made a series of suggested changes to the policy that is under development and said it looks forward to working with California and others "so that rapid technology development may be realized while ensuring the safety of the traveling public." Alphabet's self-driving car unit Waymo (googl), Ford Motor (f), Uber Technologies, Toyota Motor (tm), Tesla Motors, and others also filed comments suggesting changes. Apple (aapl) said California should revise how companies report self-driving system "disengagements" and said the state should change a proposal "that may restrict both the design and equipment that can be used in test vehicles to further develop autonomous technologies." Tesla (tsla) said California should not bar autonomous vehicle testing of vehicles that are 10,000 pounds (4,535 kg) or more, saying it is "inappropriate" and adds "there is no regulatory reason." Tesla said it could "stile innovation" and would bar a company from testing a heavy autonomous vehicle to haul parts on private property but could not operate on any public roads and will "force innovators in this space to leave the state." Tesla also said California should not prohibit the sale of any non-self-driving vehicle that was previously used for autonomous vehicle testing, an issue that could affect the company because of company software. Uber said California should allow paying members of the public to ride in autonomous vehicles with drivers. "There is no reason to deny those riders an opportunity to travel in an autonomous test vehicle and provide honest feedback," Uber said.

Apple CarPlay. Apple asked the state of California to make changes in its proposed self-driving car policies, the latest sign the company is pursuing driverless car technology. In a letter made public Friday, Apple made a series of suggested changes to the policy that is under development and said it looks forward to working with California and others "so that rapid technology development may be realized while ensuring the safety of the traveling public." Alphabet self-driving car unit Waymo, Ford Motor, Uber Technologies, Toyota Motor, Tesla Motors and others also filed comments suggesting changes. Apple said California should revise how companies report self-driving system "disengagements" and said the state should change a proposal "that may restrict both the design and equipment that can be used in test vehicles to further develop autonomous technologies." show chapters This NYU grad student went undercover at an Apple factory in China    11 Hours Ago | 05:08 Tesla said California should not bar autonomous vehicle testing of vehicles that are 10,000 pounds (4,535 kg) or more, saying it is "inappropriate" and adds "there is no regulatory reason." Tesla said it could "stile innovation" and would bar a company from testing a heavy autonomous vehicle to haul parts on private property but could not operate on any public roads and will "force innovators in this space to leave the state." Tesla also said California should not prohibit the sale of any non-self-driving vehicle that was previously used for autonomous vehicle testing, an issue that could affect the company because of company software. Uber said California should allow paying members of the public to ride in autonomous vehicles with drivers. "There is no reason to deny those riders an opportunity to travel in an autonomous test vehicle and provide honest feedback," Uber said.

Crops>Orchard Crops Lack of winter chill temps a concern for fruit growers Apple growers in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona say winter chill hours, loosely defined as the number of winter hours the temperature lingers between 32 and 45 degrees, are critical in order for trees to bud. Peaches also at risk. Logan Hawkes 3 | Apr 28, 2017 If an apple a day really keeps the doctor away, the waiting rooms of physicians may get a little more crowded this summer thanks to unusually warm weather across the Southwest this past winter. Apple growers in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona say winter chill hours, loosely defined as the number of winter hours the temperature lingers between 32 and 45 degrees, are critical in order for trees to bud. No buds, no fruit is the general rule. While the variety of an apple, for example, determines the number of chill hours required each year, generally ranging between 250 to 500 hours a winter season, other factors come into play. For example, the number of winter days that temperatures exceed 60 degrees during daytime hours and the number of hours each night temps remain in the “chill hour zone,” are factors. Here's how it works: As the days become shorter and cooler in fall, deciduous plants stop growing, store energy, lose their leaves and enter a state of dormancy which protects them from the freezing temperatures of winter. Once dormant, a deciduous fruit tree will not resume normal growth, including flowering and fruit set, until it has experienced an amount of cold equal to its minimum “chilling requirement,” followed by a certain amount of heat. In parts of all three states where apples are grown across the Southwest, chill hours were sufficient on a few orchards, especially those located in northern regions of each state, but overall producers are worried the number of chill hours required by many varieties simply did not happen—not for apples, and certainly not for peaches. RECORD HIGH TEMPS TO BLAME Dr. Larry Stein, AgriLife Extension horticulturist in Uvalde, says fruit trees, such as peach and apple, depend on adequate chill hours in the winter to promote proper physiological growth in the spring, and that simply did not happen across many fruit production areas this year. He said if plants don’t receive the required number of chill hours, the plants are slow to leaf out and this typically leads to poorly developed fruit or no fruit at all. Multiple seasons of inadequate chill hours can kill plants. This past winter has been one of the warmest on record in many areas, especially across Texas according to Texas State Climatologist Dr. John Nielsen-Gammon. Stein says fruit trees go dormant for the winter months, but chill hours help to promote hormones that dilute growth inhibitors throughout the winter months. In the spring, when temperatures begin to rise, the tree breaks dormancy and begins to bloom, followed by fruit set. But without the proper number of chill hours, the trigger mechanism that ends dormancy and wakes the tree up in the spring does not work as nature planned. "Hormones in the buds are telling trees to remain dormant because the inhibitors are still there," Stein says. In such cases, bloom is delayed and fruit set becomes happenstance. In worst case scenarios, fruit set simply does not occur and the spring and summer growing season is lost until another winter season. Too many warm winters in a row, and fruit trees can actually die. PEACH CROP IN JEAPORDY In the Texas Hill Country, peach production is big business, especially in Gillespie County where Fredericksburg and Stonewall peaches are known far and wide for their sweet taste and flavor. Jim Kamas, AgriLife Extension horticulturist in Fredericksburg, said this past winter was the warmest he can remember in Central Texas, some say the warmest on record since 1906. Generally by this time of year the countryside explodes in color as the pink of the blooming peach trees contrast with the blue and yellow and red of the abundant crop of wildflowers that can be found there most years. Most peach varieties in Gillespie County require 800 to 850 chill hours in order to bloom and produce a good crop, but this past winter chill hours across the area hovered around the 520 to 540 hour mark. As a result, Kamas says so far this spring trees are slow to bloom; in fact, many local growers are applying a growth regulator designed to replace winter chill and induce uniform bud break.  But he says it is too early after initial application to know if the regulator will produce the desired result. Local growers say they remain hopeful that low-chill varieties may still produce some fruit this year, but the higher-chill varieties, which includes most of the sweeter peaches, is a wait-and-see project at this stage in the season. He said within a few weeks producers can open up some of the young peaches that do produce to find out if viable seeds have formed. On the positive side, area grower Gary Marburger reports strawberries are already bearing fruit, and blackberries are expected to follow in the weeks ahead. He reports both berry varieties are not subject to the same chill requirements as his peaches. Marburger operates a highly successful pick-your-own farm not far from the Pedernales River. Loyal customers from San Antonio and Austin, both over an hour drive away, generally clean him out of fruit, berries and vegetables in the morning hours. Those customers, along with Marburger, are still hoping peach trees will bloom and set fruit in anticipation of the early variety season, which usually begins in May. He warns, however, as a result of a mild winter, ripening schedules, if they happen at all, will be delayed. Pecan growers in Texas say it is too early to know if minimum chill hours were reached to produce a good nut crop this year. Pecan growers in the Hill Country say recent rains have spawned hope that adequate ground moisture will bring trees out of dormancy. Nut growers in far West Texas and in Southern New Mexico say more rain is needed as spring temperatures continue to climb.   TAGS: Weather Fruit 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

Indeed, previous rumors have suggested we may see a Siri speaker launch before long, and now reports are saying that Apple might reveal it before the end of the year. Specifically, Apple could be ready to introduce this speaker by the time its Worldwide Developer’s Conference rolls around in June. That’s according to Sonny Dickson, who claims that Apple is currently in the process of finalizing the speaker’s design. This speaker would be matched against other smart speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Home, putting Siri front and center. Unsurprisingly, Apple will look to Beats to supply the speaker’s audio hardware, and Dickson also says it could utilize some variant of iOS. That last claim is an interesting one, because it suggests that Apple could plan to open this speaker up to developers. Amazon does the same thing with Alexa and Alexa skills, and we’re sure there’ll be no shortage of developers ready to develop for a Siri speaker. Obviously Apple may have other reasons for wanting to put iOS on a smart speaker, but this seems to be a safe bet. In a follow up with Mashable’s Jen Ryall, Dickson paints a clearer picture of what the speaker will actually look like. Ryall reports that the speaker will feature a concave top, which is where the controls will be. The speaker will also be entirely covered by mesh, so Apple is going for a different style than what we see in the Echo and Google Home. Developing a smart speaker seems like the next logical step for Apple, especially if it wants to transition Siri from a phone-based AI to the center of IoT systems. If Apple wants Siri to keep pace with Alexa and Google Assistant, we’ll likely see a speaker sooner rather than later – the only things we need to know now are what, exactly, this speaker will do and when it’ll be available. Obviously, take this all with a grain of salt, but stay tuned nonetheless because this probably isn’t the last we’ve heard of a Siri speaker.

Or, at least, that someone spotted a self-driving vehicle that Apple looks to be testing on California roads, and sent a photo to Bloomberg News. Here's the car that #Apple's using to test its autonomous car technology. Story with @mhbergen. https://t.co/jHLnJDRjoS pic.twitter.com/zTezUmcZwC — Alex Webb (@atbwebb) April 27, 2017 The white Lexus was seen leaving an Apple facility in Silicon Valley this week, according to Bloomberg, which noted that the equipment on the vehicle appeared to include Velodyne Lidar’s top-of-the-range 64-channel lidar and a bunch of cameras. The sighting comes a couple of weeks after Apple secured a permit to test self-driving technology in California, finally confirming the longtime rumor that the company is working on a self-driving car. If you follow self-driving car news, you’ll notice that the vehicle is a Lexus RX450h, the same make and model Google’s Waymo uses to test its self-driving technology. When Apple got its permit, the DMV said it was for three such vehicles, and six drivers. This is who Apple, which has yet to comment publicly about any of this, has down as the six drivers for the cars. (The names were inadvertently released by the DMV, Business Insider reported this week.) Shilpa Gulati, a former NASA engineer David Gadda, a former Tesla engineer Paul Hebert, a former NASA engineer David Rosas, who has a Ph.D. in control systems Victor Hwang and Jeremy Ma, Apple engineers Apple’s self-driving action comes after many reports about the company’s purported Project Titan project over the past couple of years. At one point, the company was reportedly working on building its own car but changed its mind.

An unnamed source gave the news outlet photos of the Lexus and claimed it emerged from an Apple facility known to be part of Project Titan. That’s Apple’s self-driving car project. The car is a  Lexus RX450h SUV, and it has a sporty, “top-of-the-range 64-channel LIDAR, at least two radar and a series of cameras.” One must extend a measure of trust to the unnamed source, but it seems reasonable to imagine this is an Apple vehicle. If not, it’s going to be very like the kind of system Apple would be using to develop its self-driving technology. Apple veteran (legend) Bob Mansfield has refocused and pared down the Project Titan team. Its exclusive focus as of now is thought to be developing a self-driving system before moving on to an actual car. The long and the short of this story, however, is that people care what Apple is doing, even if it’s just testing technology using off-the-shelf components and a nice SUV. Bloomberg has more pics and a GIF of the car.

Apple said it was suspending payments until the courts decide how much Apple owes. “Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed,” Apple said in a statement to Reuters, “we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court.” Unsurprisingly, Qualcomm criticized the move. Qualcomm’s general counsel, Don Rosenberg, said in his own statement, “Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade.” Apple Qualcomm Patent Royalties At issue are royalty rates Apple pays on components that utilize Qualcomm patents. In the bottom-feeding world of open licensing, Qualcomm’s royalty rates have been based on the total price of a device. Apple wants to change that because its devices are priced vastly higher than most competing products. The company has argued in this case that it’s unfair that Qualcomm benefits from the extra value Apple brings to market. To Qualcomm’s point, however, Apple’s licensing is covered by contracts that have been in place for a very long time. Unilaterally suspending payments is a major escalation of the fight between the two companies. Note that it’s a non-trivial amount of money. Qualcomm on Friday lowered its third fiscal quarter revenue estimates from US$5.8-$6.1 billion to $4.8-$5.6 billion, just because of Apple’s lack of payments. The news sent Qualcomm’s stock south. As of this writing, $QCOM traded at US$52.40, down 0.81 (1.52%). $AAPL traded at $143.81, up $0.02 (0.01%).

Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard - At The Northwestern Kellogg Public-Private Interface Conference On "New Developments In Consumer Finance: Research & Practice" Date 28/04/2017 Watch Live We can learn a lot from the evolution of smartphones as we try to envisage where the fintech ecosystem--and banks' role within it--might be heading in the future. Smartphones have ushered in an age when different companies can easily work with each other's products to seamlessly provide services to consumers. Today I want to reflect on what we might learn from that model about the increasingly interconnected world of financial services. On the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, a Wired.com article revealed that even Steve Jobs hadn't predicted the smartphone's potential as a platform.1 Apple was just trying to design an iPod that made phone calls. Today, the average American spends five hours a day on their phone, unlocking it an average of 80 times daily.2 Even the Supreme Court has noted that smartphones are now "such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important feature of human anatomy."3 Of course, we aren't using these appendages primarily to make phone calls. Instead, we mainly use our smartphones to access applications (apps).4 In June of last year, Apple announced that over 2 million apps were available on its App Store.5 For the most part, these apps were not created or even envisaged by Apple. These apps have been downloaded 130 billion times, generating over $50 billion in revenue for third-party developers.6 The iPhone is a key platform on which that app ecosystem operates. How did that happen? Apple essentially made the smartphone a toolkit for third-party developers to experiment, innovate, build, and scale new apps. It did so by investing heavily in developing open application programming interfaces (APIs) that provided third-party developers clear instructions and open access to the iPhone platform. This strategy enabled those outside developers to build new applications that delivered Apple's customers additional value by taking advantage of the existing functionality of the iPhone. Specifically, this open architecture makes available to outside developers clear instructions that enable them to use the iPhone's various sensors, processors, displays, and other interfaces in combination with their own code to develop new products. On top of that, a robust secondary layer of developers use the APIs of other developers in their technology stacks to quickly assemble new business models. Take ride-sharing services, for instance. They have built multibillion-dollar businesses that are, in large part, dependent on combinations of APIs from different companies. They may use Google Maps' APIs for location services, Stripe or Braintree's APIs for payments, Twilio's APIs for text messaging, and Amazon Web Services' or IBM's APIs for computing power. All of these products, and more, work seamlessly together in real time to provide products that are so ubiquitous that we now use them as verbs for how we navigate the world. We "Uber" to the store or "Snapchat" a friend. Risks and Opportunities in an Increasingly Interconnected World There is every reason to expect financial services to make a similar transition to an increasingly interconnected digital world. By now, we've all heard estimates of the thousands of fintech companies that have launched in the past few years and the billions of investment dollars that are flooding into this sector.7 But for all of the talk of "disruption," I want to underscore an important point: More often than not, there is a banking organization somewhere in the fintech stack. Just as third-party app developers rely on smartphone sensors, processors, and interfaces, fintech developers need banks somewhere in the stack for such things as: (a) access to consumer deposits or related account data, (b) access to payment systems, (c) credit origination, or (d) compliance management.8 For instance, account comparison services rely on access to data from consumers' bank accounts. Savings and investment apps analyze transactions data from bank accounts to understand how to optimize performance and manage the funds consumers hold in those accounts. Digital wallets draw funds from payment cards or bank accounts. Marketplace loans most often depend on loan origination by a bank partner. And payment innovations often "settle up" over legacy payment rails, like the automated clearinghouse system.9 In short, the software stacks of almost all fintech apps point to a bank at one layer or another. So as fintech companies and banks are catching up to the interconnected world, the various players are sorting out how best to do the connecting. Much of the work so far has been focused on the technical challenges, which are notable. Most banks' core systems are amalgams of computing mainframes built decades ago before the Internet or cloud computing were widely available and, in many cases, stitched together over the course of mergers and consolidations.10 It takes a lot of investment to securely convert that infrastructure to platforms that can operate in real-time with ready access for Internet-native third-party developers. But important policy, regulatory, and legal questions also demand attention. And that is where the smartphone analogy loses its power. On balance, bank activities are much more highly regulated than smartphones. Those regulations enable consumers to trust their banks to secure their funds and maintain the integrity of their transactions. While "run fast and break things" may be a popular mantra in the technology field, it is ill suited to an arena where a serious breach could undermine confidence in the payments system. Indeed, some of the key underpinnings of consumer protection and safety and soundness in the banking world--that consumers should be exceptionally careful in granting account access, that in certain conditions banks could be presumed to bear liability for unauthorized charges, and that banks can be held responsible for ensuring that service providers and vendors do right by their customers--sit uneasily alongside the requisites of openness, connectivity, and data access that enable today's app ecosystem.11 For instance, before entering an outsourcing arrangement, a bank is expected to consider whether the service provider's internal processes or systems (or even human error at the outside party) could expose the bank and its customers to potential losses or expose the bank's customers to fraud and the bank to litigation; whether the service provider complies with applicable laws and regulation; and whether poor performance by that outside party could materially harm the bank's public reputation. The smartphone app ecosystem developed without the regulations or associated guardrails pertaining to institutions that people trust to hold their life savings. For instance, when Pokémon Go was first launched, its creator, Niantic, used an outdated Google API to verify consumer identities. This created confusion about whether millions of consumers had unwittingly granted Niantic full access to their e-mails, contact lists, and calendars.12 However, it did not stand in the way of Pokémon Go subsequently being downloaded a half billion times.13 In contrast, these kinds of mistakes in the banking sector could raise grave concerns about consumer data privacy and security and the integrity of consumer transactions data. That's why banks are expected to conduct extensive risk assessments and due diligence of their service providers, extending even to operations and internal controls, among other requirements.14 While that helps ensure a safe and sound banking system, that also makes it more challenging for both the banks and fintech companies to harness safely the interconnectivity that has powered other parts of the digital world. Different Approaches to the Fintech Stack Because of the high stakes, fintech firms, banks, data aggregators, consumer groups, and regulators are all still figuring out how best to do the connecting. There are a few alternative approaches in operation today, with various advantages and drawbacks. A number of large banks have developed or are in the process of developing interfaces to allow outside developers access to their platforms under controlled conditions. Similar to Apple opening the APIs of its phones and operating systems, these financial companies are working to provide APIs to outside developers, who can then build new products on the banks' platforms.15 It is worth highlighting that platform APIs generally vary in their degree of openness, even in the smartphone world. If a developer wants to use a Google Maps API to embed a map in her application, she first must create a developer account with Google, agreeing to Google's terms and conditions. This means she will have entered a contract with the owner of the API, and the terms and conditions may differ depending on how sensitive the particular API is. Google may require only a minimum amount of information for a developer that wants to use an API to display a map. Google may, however, require more information about a developer that wants to use a different API to monitor the history of a consumer's physical locations over the previous week. And in some cases, the competitive interests of Google and a third-party app developer may diverge over time, such that the original terms of access are no longer acceptable.16 The fact that it is possible and indeed relatively common for the API provider--the platform--to require specific controls and protections over the use of that API raises complicated issues when imported to the banking world. As banks have considered how to facilitate connectivity, the considerations include not only technical issues and the associated investment, but also the important legal questions associated with operating in a highly regulated sector. The banks' terms of access may be determined in third-party service provider agreements that may offer different degrees of access. These may affect not only what types of protections and vetting are appropriate for different types of access over consumers' funds and data held at a bank in order to enable the bank to fulfill its obligations for data security and other consumer protections, but also the competitive position of the bank relative to third-party developers. There is a second broad type of approach in which many banks have entered into agreements with specialized companies that essentially act as middlemen, frequently described as "data aggregators." These banks may lack the budgets and expertise to create their own open APIs or may not see that as a key element in their business strategies. Data aggregators collect consumer financial account data from banks, on the one hand, and then provide access to that data to fintech developers, on the other hand.17 Data aggregators organize the data they collect from banks and other data sources and then offer their own suite of open APIs to outside developers. By partnering with data aggregators, banks can open their systems to thousands of developers, without having to invest in creating and maintaining their own open APIs. This also allows fintech developers to build their products around the APIs of two or three data aggregators, rather than 15,000 different banks and other data sources. And, if agreements between data aggregators and banks are structured as data aggregators performing outsourced services to banks, the bank should be able to conduct the appropriate due diligence of its vendors, whose services to those banks may be subject to examination by safety and soundness regulators.18 Some banks have opted for a more "closed" approach to fintech developers by entering into individual agreements with specific technology providers or data aggregators.19 These agreements often impose specific requirements rather than simply facilitating structured data feeds. These banks negotiate for greater control over their systems by limiting who is accessing their data--often to a specific third party's suite of products. Likewise, many banks use these agreements to limit what types of data will be shared. For instance, banks may share information about the balances in consumers' accounts but decline to share information about fees or other pricing. While recognizing the legitimate need for vetting of third parties for purposes of the banks fulfilling their responsibilities, including for data privacy and security, some consumer groups have suggested that the standards for vetting should be commonly agreed to and transparent to ensure that banks do not restrict access for competitive reasons and that consumers should be able to decide what data to make available to third-party fintech applications.20 A third set of banks may be unable or unwilling to provide permissioned access, for reasons ranging from fears about increased competition to concerns about the cost and complexity of ensuring compliance with underlying laws and regulations. At the very least, banks may have reasonable concerns about being able to see, if not control, which third-party developers will have access to the banking data that is provided by the data aggregators. Accordingly, even banks that have previously provided structured data feeds to data aggregators may decide to limit or block access.21 In such cases, however, data aggregators can still move forward to collect consumer data for use by fintech developers without the permission or even potentially without the knowledge of the bank. Instead, data aggregators and fintech developers directly ask consumers to give them their online banking logins and passwords. Then, in a process commonly called "screen scraping," data aggregators log onto banks' online consumer websites, as if they were the actual consumers, and extract information. Some banks report that as much as 20 to 40 percent of online banking logins is attributable to data aggregators. They even assert that they have trouble distinguishing whether a computer system that is logging in multiple times a day is a consumer, a data aggregator, or a cyber attack. For community banks with limited resources, the necessary investments in API technology and in negotiating and overseeing data-sharing agreements with data aggregators and third-party providers may be beyond their reach, especially as they usually rely on service providers for their core technology. Some fintech firms argue that screen scraping--which has drawn the most complaints about data security--may be the most effective tool for the customers of small community banks to access the financial apps they prefer--and thereby necessary to remain competitive until more effective broader industry solutions are developed. Clearly, getting these connectivity questions right, including the need to manage the consumer protection risks, is critically important. It could make the difference between a world in which the fintech wave helps community banks become the platforms of the future, on the one hand, or, on the other hand, a world in which fintech instead further widens the gulf between community banks and the largest banks. Tradeoffs The different approaches to integrating banks into the fintech stack represent different risks and tradeoffs. Connectivity solutions that require intermediaries such as data aggregators and rely on screen scraping potentially create repositories of consumer credentials for hackers to target. Banks argue that if such a repository is breached, thousands of banks could be impacted.22 Further complicating things, because screen scrapers operate without contractual relationships with the banks from which they pull information, banks have little leverage or ability to vet the security of the screen scrapers' systems and methods or their overall risk. In these circumstances, some commentators have noted that if a data aggregator or third-party developer is breached, it may not be clear who would bear responsibility for any losses--the bank, the data aggregator, the fintech developer, or the consumer. Some third-party developers have included terms and conditions that specifically limit their liability to consumers.23 It is not clear the extent to which many consumers understand the risks involved with sharing their banking credentials, the more limited liability accepted by many third-party developers relative to their bank or credit card issuer, and the fact that the third-party developers may in turn provide those credentials to others in some instances. On the other side of the debate, fintech companies are concerned that banks could use their control over consumer data access in the context of bilateral contracts with data aggregators to leverage their position in order to impede competition elsewhere in the stack. This argument about access and competition echoes similar concerns in the smartphone arena.24 Further, third-party developers argue that open standards for data access can help banks meet consumers' expectations for mobile banking by providing access to the fintech apps that best serve their needs. The relatively open architecture of the iPhone platform means that Apple profits from outside developers' products without having to design or invest in them directly. For instance, Apple didn't include a home-grown mapping app during the first few years of the iPhone.25 Instead, it relied on Google to provide that important function for its smartphones before trying to build its own mapping tool--a process that took a number of iterations before getting it right. Open platform strategies may mean that banks can essentially outsource product development to fintech firms.26 This could be a boon--particularly for small community banks that would not have to worry about developing the best consumer interface, mobile app, digital wallet, or lending product. The bank would only have to worry about getting the connections to an open API right and then reap the benefits of the innovation by third parties. Regulatory Developments As regulators, we have a responsibility to ensure that the institutions subject to our supervision are operated safely and soundly and that they comply with applicable statutes and regulations. More broadly, we have a strong interest in permitting socially beneficial innovations to flourish, while ensuring the risks that they may present are appropriately managed, consistent with the legal requirements. We do not want to unnecessarily restrict innovations that can benefit consumers and small businesses through expanded access to financial services or greater efficiency, convenience, and reduced transaction costs. Nor do we want to drive these activities away from regulated banks and toward less governed spaces in the financial system. Regulators in the United Kingdom and continental Europe have recently outlined new approaches to facilitate connectivity in financial services, while attempting to mitigate the associated risks. In August 2016, the UK Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) released a package of mandates aimed at increasing competition for consumer and small business current accounts (akin to U.S. checking accounts).27 This year nine of the country's largest banks were required to create open APIs to share nonsensitive, non-consumer-specific information, like pricing, fees, terms, and conditions as well as branch and automated teller machine locations.28 This initial limited sharing of information has started communication and collaboration across the industry on areas like data standards and organizational governance, which will facilitate work on more contentious questions. Before March 2018, the CMA is scheduled to enforce a broader package of reforms, including mandating that the nine banks create APIs that allow third-party banks and nonbanks to access consumer accounts for reading transaction data and payment initiation. In the European Union, beginning in 2018, member states will be required to start implementing the European Parliament's revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).29 Among other elements, PSD2 created licensing regimes for third parties that access bank accounts for purposes of initiating payment orders or consolidating information with consumers' consent.30 The directive mandates that banks allow these licensed third parties to access their consumer accounts (with consumer permission) without premising such access on contractual agreements with the banks. Indeed, PSD2 requires that credit institutions not block or hinder access to payment accounts and that licensed third parties have access to credit institutions' payment accounts services in an objective, nondiscriminatory, and proportionate manner. When credit institutions do reject access, they are required to provide the relevant authorities detailed reasoning for the rejection. The directive attempts to mitigate the attendant data-security and consumer-protection risks with a number of measures that, by and large, are not readily available policy options in the United States. Importantly, third parties that access bank accounts will be subject to licensing and registration requirements, as well as associated capital and insurance requirements. Moreover, the directive envisions that electronic payments will be authorized by two-factor authentication--for example "something you know" and "something you are."31 The United States is likely to address these issues in a different way, at least initially, given that regulatory authorities are more broadly distributed, and the relevant statutory language predates these technological developments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued a Request for Information last fall to explore issues surrounding consumers' granting access to account information to third parties.32 Of course, safety and soundness regulation--and with it, concerns about data security, cyber security, and vendor risk management--is distributed among a number of regulators. For instance, there may be value to examining the vendor risk management guidance so that it facilitates banks connecting more securely and efficiently with the fintech apps that consumers prefer.33 Similarly, it could be useful to periodically assess whether and how authority under the Bank Service Company Act might pertain to developments in the fast evolving fintech sector. In addition, the private sector is continuing to actively experiment with a variety of different approaches to the connectivity question and may itself move toward one or more widely accepted standards. Accordingly, efforts to craft approaches that enhance connectivity while mitigating the associated risks will likely benefit from the engagement of multiple agencies, along with input from the private sector and other stakeholders. Separately, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which is responsible for administering national bank charters, has announced that it is exploring offering "special purpose national bank charters" to fintech companies.34 As envisioned by the OCC, obtaining a special purpose charter would have the practical effect of allowing certain fintech companies (companies that make loans, make payments, or accept deposits) to potentially bypass the need for connecting to a bank for certain purposes in favor of becoming licensed as banks themselves. The OCC's proposal raises interpretive and policy issues for the Federal Reserve regarding whether charter recipients would become Federal Reserve members or have access to Federal Reserve accounts and services, such as direct access to payment systems. If the OCC proposal is finalized, the Federal Reserve would have to closely analyze these issues with respect to any fintech firms that express an interest in moving forward with an application. When Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, who could have predicted that it would net billions from a game like Pokémon Go, which involved no investment, development, or advertising on Apple's part beyond opening its platform to developers? It is still too early to have any confidence that we know which fintech innovations will prove to be the most long-lasting or widely adopted. By the same token, the fintech industry is still figuring out the fundamental questions of the best ways to make the necessary connections to the banking platforms to facilitate consumers' ability to better monitor and manage their financial lives, while providing the level of data security and protection they have come to rely on from their banks.35 Change is surely coming, as financial products and services move onto interconnected platforms. As the sector evolves, it's important that all parties involved pay close attention not only to the technical questions, but to the requisite regulatory, policy, and legal considerations to ensure continued trust and confidence in the financial system.   1.

See, e.g., Center for Financial Services Innovation, "Consumer Data Sharing Principles: A Brief on the Framework for Industry-Wide Collaboration," October 20, 2016. Indeed, many of the developers that make use of the bank data obtained by data aggregators are actually other banks. Steven Boms, "Yodlee Response to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Request for Information Regarding Consumer Access to Financial Records," Docket No. CFPB 2016-0048, February 21, 2017. ("Over our almost two-decade history, Yodlee has built a client base that includes 12 of the 20 largest banks in the United States and the largest banks in more than 20 countries.")  21. See, e.g., Envestnet, Inc., 2016 Annual Report, March 24, 2016. ("[O]ne or more of our current customers could decide to limit or block our access to the data feeds we currently have in place with these customers due to factors outside of our control such as more burdensome regulation of our or our customers' industry, increased compliance requirements or changes in business strategy.

The legal environment surrounding data scraping and similar means of obtaining access to information on third-party websites is not completely clear and is evolving, and one or more third parties could assert claims against us seeking damages or to prevent us from accessing information in that manner.")  22. According to one banking trade organization, "[t]his is a rich reward for a single hack, either of an aggregated database of personally identifiable information or of a single consumer's multiple accounts, makes data aggregators an attractive target for criminals. [Hackers would] obtain the key not to just a single room, but the key ring with keys to all the rooms."

See, e.g, "Personal Capital Terms of Use" (last updated February 22, 2017), www.personalcapital.com/content/terms-of-use/ (last visited April 16, 2017). ("TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LIABILITY OF PERSONAL CAPITAL, ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS AND AGENTS TO YOU SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100).") Further, Personal Capital requires that consumers submit to pre-dispute arbitration agreements and waive any rights to pursue relief in a class action proceeding as part of its terms of use. This would mean that if a data breach were to occur, each affected consumer would have to seek relief on his own, with a maximum possible recovery of $100. In addition, Personal Capital's terms and conditions specify that the arbitrator can require that the consumer pay Personal Capital's legal fees, if Personal Capital is to prevail.  24. When the iPhone first launched, for instance, one phone provider paid a premium for exclusive access to the smartphone. This meant that, for several years, consumers that wanted the iPhone also had to enter relationships with the only Internet service provider platform that offered the phone. See, e.g., Saul Hansell, "Why AT&T Wants to Keep the iPhone Away from Verizon," New York Times, April 22, 2009, https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/why-att-wants-to-keep-the-iphone-away-from-verizon/ ("AT&T is paying Apple an unusually high subsidy on top of the $199 and $299 paid by iPhone buyers. But it appears to be getting quite a return on that investment.") At the same time, Apple has used its own iPhone platform to affect the development of products further up the stack. While much of the iPhone is an open platform for third-party developers, developers do not have access to the iPhone's secure element and Near Field Communication (NFC) antenna--key components of digital wallet technologies. This means that Apple Pay is the only "tap-to-pay" NFC digital wallet available for iPhones--and that Apple Pay competitors, like Android Pay and Samsung Pay, are unable to access 40 percent of the smartphones in the United States. See, e.g., Philip Elmer-DeWitt, "About Apple's 40% Share of the U.S. Smartphone Market," Fortune, February 11, 2016, http://fortune.com/2016/02/11/apple-iphone-ios-share/. When a group of Australia's largest banks recently petitioned the country's antitrust authority to allow them to band together to require Apple to unlock access to the NFC antenna, for use by their digital wallets, their request was denied. See, e.g., Simon Sharwood, "Banking Group Denied Access to iPhones' NFC Chips for alt.Apple.Pay," Register, April 3, 2017, www.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/03/banking_group_denied_access_to_iphones_nfc_chips_for_altapplepay/. 25.

For example, small business lender Kabbage, Inc. has entered agreements with large banks, where Kabbage licenses its data analysis-heavy customer acquisition platform to banking partners who then go on to originate, fund, and service the underlying loans.

Qualcomm's Apple battle Qualcomm's legal battle with Apple shows no signs of slowing as the chipmaker cut its current-quarter profit and revenue forecasts today, Reuters reports. Apple is suing Qualcomm for $1 billion, amidst claims that the mobile chip giant charged it improper royalty fees and intentionally withheld $1 billion in promised rebates. Along with Samsung, Apple accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm's revenue in its latest fiscal year, Reuters said. But an Apple spokesperson reportedly told Reuters that "without an agreed-upon rate" to determine how much Apple is owed by Qualcomm, the Cupertino smartphone giant has suspended payments to the chipmaker "until the correct amount can be determined by the court". Meanwhile, Qualcomm's general counsel Don Rosenberg is quoted by Reuters as saying that  Apple has "unilaterally declared" contract terms between the two vendors "unacceptable". These are the "same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade", Rosenberg is said to have added. DR's cloud move Disaster recovery (DR) is the most popular application that IT organizations plan to migrate to the cloud, according to the latest research from business continuity vendor Zetta. The research finds that 36 percent of respondents cited DR as the first app they plan to take off premise, followed by file sharing at 30 percent, data backup also at 30 percent and data storage at 29 percent. Zetta's Cloud Adoption in 2017 report also found that reasons why IT departments are planning to migrate applications to the cloud include the reduction of IT staff burden at 61 percent, reduced maintenance efforts at 55 percent, scalability at 47 percent, more attractive features and functionality at 46 percent and reduced cost at 42 percent. The vendor said this resulted in an "active adoption of cloud-based applications", with the research finding that 88 percent of organizations are using cloud-based services or applications today, with nearly 60 percent saying they plan to move more applications to the cloud in the next 12 months, according to Zetta. The report included results from 385 IT professionals in over 13 countries from companies with between 50 and 1000-plus employees. Bitdefender's console Bitdefender has launched Bitdefender GravityZone for xSP, a platform that enables partners to provision customer or partner accounts, while remotely managing security for multiple companies, the vendor said. The offering enables partners to support customers across private, public and hybrid cloud, Bitdefender added, also noting that the new console allows for monthly, pay-as-you-go licensing. Citrix partners will benefit from a new layer of security with Hypervisor Introspection, according to Bitdefender, who added that this feature will uncover and block advanced persistent threats at the hypervisor level.   Tweet   Facebook   LinkedIn   Google plus   Send to   Topics Channel Business Channel Rundown Apple Gigamon Qualcomm Cloud Bitdefender More on Channel Business Channel Business Today's channel rundown - 27 April 2017 27 Apr Channel Business Today's channel rundown - 26 April 2017 26 Apr Channel Business Today's channel rundown - 25 April 2017 25 Apr Channel Business Today's channel rundown - 24 April 2017 24 Apr Channel Business Today's channel rundown - 21 April 2017 21 Apr Channel Business Editor's voice: The week's channel chatter - 21 April 2017 21 Apr Channel Business Today's channel rundown - 20 April 2017 20 Apr Channel Business Today's channel rundown - 19 April 2016 19 Apr More news Channelnomics' top five stories of the week - 28 April 2017 Check out which articles grabbed the most attention this week Research 28 April 2017 Today's channel rundown - 28 April 2017 Daily tech news and analysis channel partners need to know now, including Gigamon's CMO, Qualcomm's Apple battle, Bitdefender's console and more Channel Business 28 April 2017 Ransomware demands hit 266 percent spike - Symantec Reliance on cloud fueling ransomware success Security 28 April 2017 MSPs must stay on the hunt for new prey The 2112 Group discusses channel partner sales challenges at Channelnomics Conference: MSP Solution Provider 28 April 2017 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The battle between the two tech firms began earlier this year when Apple filed lawsuits accusing Qualcomm of withholding $1 billion in patent royalties, allegedly as a punishment in response to Apple’s cooperation with Korean antitrust regulators. A subsequent lawsuit filed in Beijing by Apple claimed that Qualcomm had abused its position in the chip industry and failed to deliver on its promises to inexpensively license “standard essential patents.” Qualcomm followed those filings up its own countersuit earlier this month, accusing Apple of breaching its contract and asking for an unspecified amount in damages. According to Qualcomm, Apple has now stated that it will be withholding all future payments until the legal matters between the two companies are resolved. Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg added that “While Apple has acknowledged that payment is owed for the use of Qualcomm’s valuable intellectual property, it nevertheless continues to interfere with our contracts,” and that “Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade.” In a statement to The Financial Times, an Apple spokesperson responded “We’ve been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years but they have refused to negotiate fair terms. Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court.

Qualcomm: Apple Ceases Royalty Payments Amid Lawsuits, Qualcomm Stock Price Plummets By Denisse Moreno On 04/28/17 AT 12:51 PM Close The feud between Apple and Qualcomm escalated as the chip company announced Thursday Apple is completely withholding payments for royalties amid lawsuits filed by both companies. “Qualcomm Incorporated today announced that it has been informed by Apple Inc. that Apple is withholding payments to its contract manufacturers for the royalties those contract manufacturers owe under their licenses with Qualcomm for sales during the quarter ended March 31, 2017,” the chip supplier said in a release. Read: Apple Vs. Samsung: Apple Sees Flat 2017 Q1 Sales Despite iPhone SE, RED iPhone 7 Release After Apple told Qualcomm it would cease all royalty payments, the chip supplier cut its prior 2017 third quarter forecast figures. Qualcomm now estimates a revenue of  $4.8 billion-$5.6 billion, down from the previous numbers predicted before Apple’s move, $5.3 billion-$6.1 billion. Qualcomm also saw its stock price plummet on Thursday. Executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, Don Rosenberg, said in a statement on Thursday: “Apple is improperly interfering with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm’s licensees. These license agreements remain valid and enforceable. While Apple has acknowledged that payment is owed for the use of Qualcomm’s valuable intellectual property, it nevertheless continues to interfere with our contracts. Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade.  Apple’s continued interference with Qualcomm’s agreements to which Apple is not a party is wrongful and the latest step in Apple's global attack on Qualcomm.  We will continue vigorously to defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry.” History Of Apple And Qualcomm’s Feud The feud between both companies started when Apple filed lawsuits against Qualcomm. Apple claimed Qualcomm, which has a chipset business and licensing business, was charging royalties for technologies “they have nothing to do with.” Qualcomm, a major chip supplier for Apple and its rival Samsung, said the Cupertino company’s accusations were “without merit” when the lawsuits were filed. In response, Qualcomm countersued the iPhone seller earlier this month. The chip supplier is currently seeking damages from Apple over breached agreements and negotiations with the chip supplier. Qualcomm also accused Apple of interfering with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with its licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPad. Read: Qualcomm Sues Apple, Says iPhone Success Wouldn't Have Been Possible Without Its Technologies Apple used chips from Qualcomm for its iPhones until last year’s iPhone 7. In Apple’s filing, the company said it signed a 5-year exclusivity agreement with Qualcomm. However, in the lawsuit Qualcomm filed against Apple, the company said there was no exclusivity between both companies. After Qualcomm announced it was counter suing Apple, Rosenberg said Apple would not have been able to build the iPhone franchise without the chip company. “Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm's fundamental cellular technologies,” said Rosenberg earlier this month. Apart from the accusations made by Apple in its lawsuits, Qualcomm is also being investigated in other countries for anticompetitive and monopolistic trade practices.

Research firm IDC said overall smartphone shipments grew 4.3 percent in the first quarter, slightly better than its prior forecast, to 347 million units. "The first quarter smartphone results further prove that the smartphone industry is not dead and that growth still exists," said IDC analyst Ryan Reith. "There is no question that 2016 was a pivotal year for the industry as growth dipped to low single digits for the first time. However, we believe the industry will show some rebound in 2017, and the strong first quarter results certainly support this argument." Reith said the 2017 market will feel the impact of the new Samsung Galaxy S8 flagship handset, and a widely expected announcement from Apple for its new iPhone later this year. According to the survey, Samsung led the market in the first quarter with a 22.8 percent share to 14.9 percent for Apple, with little growth for the top two vendors. But Huawei's sales jumped 21.7 percent to give it a 9.8 percent share, and fellow Chinese makers Oppo and Vivo, the number four and five vendors, respectively, also boosted their sales. IDC said the bulk of smartphone growth is likely to come from low-cost handset makers. "Although we have seen an abundance of premium redesigned flagships that just entered the market, moving forward, we still expect most of the growth to come from more affordable models in a variety of markets," said IDC's Anthony Scarsella. "Despite all the popularity and media hype around premium devices, we continue to witness a shift in many companies' portfolios geared towards affordable devices with premium-type styling compared to flagship models." He added that makers "have started to implement a single premium design language that ultimately blurs the lines between the high-end and the low-end, allowing the average consumer to jump on the brand without a hefty upfront investment." The report is based on preliminary quarterly estimates, with Apple due to report sales figures next week.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Apple Music in iOS 11 Will Focus a Lot on Video By Uzair Ghani 16 hours ago 10Shares Share Tweet Submit A new report has surfaced, painting a rather interesting picture for Apple Music’s future as well as Cupertino’s upcoming mobile operating system, iOS 11. Apple Wants to Focus More on Video with the Release of iOS 11 and Apple Music Update Apple Music is Cupertino’s hub for streaming music content. Apart from that, users will occasionally run into music videos as well. But if a new report is anything to go by, then it seems as though Apple’s focus on video will expand greatly after the release of iOS 11. Related Apple Music Introduces ‘Up Next’ To Promote A New Artist Every Month The latest report from Bloomberg reveals that Apple will be focusing a lot on original content, with up to 10 original series set for release later this year. If you aren’t aware, Apple is focusing on two major original content series already – Planet of the Apps as well as Carpool Karaoke: The Series. The latter is already seeing a bunch of delays, with Apple itself suggesting that the show will go live ‘later this year.’ Advertisement Apple Music could release as many as 10 original series by the end of the year, including will.i.am’s Planet of the Apps and several documentaries. Iovine won’t say what they are, but people familiar with the matter say two are about the legendary hip-hop labels Bad Boy Records and Cash Money Records while another is about music impresario Clive Davis. “For a music streaming service,” Iovine says, “we’re building a very decent slate.” Regarding iOS 11 and Apple Music, here’s what the report has to say: Related Facebook Messenger Is Getting An Apple Music And Spotify Extension When Apple introduces the next version of its smartphone software iOS later this year, the company plans to unveil a new edition of the Music app that better showcases video. To wrap things up, Apple wants to take things beyond music by the end of this year. And it’s quite obvious this will happen after the launch of iOS 11 as well as the new Apple Music update. But it remains to be seen whether or not we will end up seeing a demo of the newfound venture at this year’s WWDC, which will serve as the stage for Apple’s iOS 11 announcement. We will keep our readers posted regarding this news.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apple’s Siri Powered Amazon Echo Competitor is in Final Stages of Design By Uzair Ghani 15 hours ago 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple’s rumored Siri-powered Amazon Echo competitor is said to be in the final stages of design. Apple’s New Gadget Will Feature Siri as well as AirPlay Capabilities – Ready to Take on Amazon Echo and Google Home It’s been rumored for quite a while that Apple will be following Amazon and Google’s footsteps in creating a dedicated device for its virtual assistant Siri. Using that device, users will be able to resolve simple queries, control HomeKit etc. Now, it appears as though this mythical device from Apple is actually in its final stages of design, if a tweet from Sonny Dickson is anything to go by. Related iPhone 8 Aluminum Mold and Detailed Diagram Leaked With a Larger Than Usual Power Button Sonny Dickson also goes on to state that the device will feature some sort of Beats technology under the hood, and it will run a variant of iOS. Given Apple’s entire mobile device lineup runs one form of iOS or the other, it’s not surprising that this one will too. It is believed to carry some form of Beats technology, and is expected to run an variant iOS Advertisement — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 27, 2017 Interestingly, apart from the obvious Siri tie-in, it has come to light, courtesy of the above tweet, that the device will have AirPlay capabilities as well. This means you will be able to throw music onto the device for a bigger sound. This also suggests that Apple’s new device will have a high-quality speaker built right in. Maybe this is the ‘Beats technology’ Sonny is talking about here. Maybe I’m wrong. Related Plastic iPhone 8 Protective Case Suggests A Vertical Dual Camera Setup; No Rear Fingerprint Sensor Although the device sounds too good to be true, it should be kept in mind that Google and Amazon are currently miles ahead when it comes to this arena. Amazon, for instance, has been pushing out the Echo for a long time now, while Google, on the other hand, packs the brains of its mighty Assistant. But, the biggest edge Apple might have is support for HomeKit, along with a better tie-in with the rest of the iOS ecosystem. But of course, at this time, anything we say is pure speculation, so take everything with a pinch of salt at least. We will let our readers know if there’s any more development in this area, so stay tuned. Meanwhile, make sure you drop a comment below and let us know what you think about this news.

Jeff Bezos is almost richer than you Hey, Bill Gates! Jeff Bezos is almost richer than you Posted on Friday, April 28, 2017 by CNN in Business News Move over, Bill Gates. You might lose the title of world’s wealthiest person. The net worth of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos rose nearly $2 billion to about $80.5 billion on Friday after Amazon reported strong earnings and sales and its stock gained 2%. Bezos is now slightly behind Spanish retail magnate Amancio Ortega, whose Inditex firm owns the Zara clothing stores. Ortega is worth $81 billion. Bezos has at least moved ahead of Berkshire Hathaway CEO — and Oracle of Omaha — Warren Buffett. And Bezos is a “mere” $7 billion behind Gates for the title of earth’s richest carbon-based life form. The rankings are based on figures from both Forbes and Bloomberg. Don’t shed any tears for Gates. Microsoft stock was up a bit Friday following that company’s solid earnings report. Gates is now worth $87.2 billion. The tech industry continues to dominate the market. Google parent company Alphabet reported solid results on Thursday, and that helped lift the net worth of co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin by about $1.7 billion apiece in the process. Two other tech titans, Apple and Facebook, will report their earnings next week. The surge in Facebook’s stock this year has pushed CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth up to $62.6 billion, putting him in a tie for fifth-wealthiest person with Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim Helu. And while Apple CEO Tim Cook isn’t as wealthy as many of his fellow tech CEOs — he’s not a company founder — he still is in charge of the world’s most valuable company. Apple is worth three-quarters of a trillion dollars. And it has $246 billion in cash. Much of that is held in overseas bank accounts. Ditto for other tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Oracle and Cisco. And that cash pile is steadily growing. Both Microsoft and Alphabet reported an increase in their cash levels in earnings reports Thursday. Microsoft now has $126 billion, and Alphabet has $92.4 billion. Tech companies will soon have an incentive to bring a chunk of that cash back to the United States if President Trump succeeds in getting tax laws changed. He’s offering a one-time tax break for companies that repatriate cash parked overseas. Hopes for tax reform are one reason tech stocks continue to lead the market higher. Silicon Valley doesn’t exactly see eye-to-eye with Trump on a lot of things. But investors are excited about repatriation. The strong earnings don’t hurt either, of course. “Tech us pushing the market higher. And it’s about more than Trump,” said Kate Warne, an investment strategist with Edward Jones. “But Trump’s policies should have positive impact when they get implemented.” But should investors be worried about how much influence the tech sector has on the overall market? Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook are collectively worth $2.8 trillion. These companies will have to continue to innovate to maintain strong earnings and sales growth. Investors won’t tolerate missteps. Just look at what happened to Intel, another tech giant that reported its latest earnings Thursday. Results were disappointing, and the semiconductor company’s stock fell 4%. But it seems that many investors have faith in the tech sector’s Big Five and those company’s respective leaders. Bezos, Zuckerberg, Cook and Page have earned Wall Street’s respect. So has Satya Nadella at Microsoft, who has pushed the company further into the cloud computing market as well as social networking with its purchase of LinkedIn. “Higher quality tech companies continue to get bigger,” said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners. “The probability of any of these companies having a hiccup from our perspective seems small.” Bailey’s firm owns stakes in Facebook and Alphabet. And he notes that, unlike in 2000, when tech stocks were trading at insane valuations, nearly all the big tech companies are reasonably valued. Amazon is the main exception. But it’s been trading at a high valuation for almost two decades. Any investors skeptical of Amazon have either missed the rally — or lost lots of money betting against it. James Wang, an analyst for ARK Invest, thinks tech will continue to dominate. His firm runs the ARK Web X.0 ETF, which has big stakes in Amazon and Facebook, as well as tech leaders Netflix and China’s Alibaba. “Tech is an area that should be more immune from regulation and politics than many others. And it is benefiting from genuine shifts in the economy,” Wang said. So it looks like Bezos will keep getting richer. But he’ll have some company. Gates, Zuckerberg, Page and Brin may also see their bank accounts swell as the tech sector continues to surge.

A serial leakster has suggested he’s seen designs for a device that’s a possible rival to Google Home and Amazon Echo. Reuters 2 The Apple product could rival the Amazon Echo, a voice-controlled virtual assistant 2 Leakster Sonny Dickson said an Apple insider claimed the new device will look ‘fat’ like Google Home In September 2016, Bloomberg reported that Apple was working on a smart home device which would ship with facial recognition cameras. And now Sonny Dickson, who is famed for leaking gadgets and gizmos while they are still in development, said Apple is currently finalising designs for their Echo competitor. “It’s expected to be marketed as a Siri or AirPlay device,” he said. It’s likely to be in the style of the Mac Pro and have boom mesh around the speakers.

This marks a record dating back to when the firm began collecting data on this in 2008. Investors are the most underweight materials and energy shares. Lauren Thomas | @laurenthomasx3 14 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Qilai Shen | Bloomberg | Getty Images Customers look at the Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus at an Apple Store in Shanghai, China. Money managers are more heavily invested in technology stocks than they have been in at least nine years, a survey of portfolios shows. "[Fund] managers appeared to have doubled-down on their winners," increasing exposure to technology-related stocks in portfolios by more than 14 percent for the year-to-date period, according to a new report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Managers are 24 percent more overweight the tech sector relative to its weighting in the S&P 500, marking a new record in the firm's data history dating back to 2008, equity analyst Savita Subramanian explained in a Friday note to clients. Amazon, Alphabet and Apple offer some of the best examples of tech companies that continue to rip higher in the market, posting earnings after earnings report that blow past Street expectations. On Thursday, Google's parent company, Alphabet, reported better-than-expected first-quarter profit and sales, which were fueled by growth in mobile search and ongoing strength in YouTube ad sales, the company said. On Friday, both the Nasdaq and the Nasdaq 100 indexes reached all-time intraday highs, with Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft having the most positive impact on the Nasdaq 100 through morning trading. For the year, the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) has risen more than 12 percent, compared with the S&P 500's nearly 7 percent gain. That's the best return among the market's major sectors. But the equity strategist believes this is not necessarily a good thing for tech investors. "Buying the 10 most underweighted stocks and selling the most overweight stocks ... has generated alpha in past years," Subramanian wrote. This implies that, despite the excitement in the sector, it might be time to for a sell-off in tech. "[S]o far performance in 2017 has bucked the trend," she added. 'Overowned stocks' Source: BofA Merrill Lynch The Bank of America report said that managers are at least 10 percent overweight discretionary stocks today, following tech, the highest level seen across portfolios in seven months. Investors are most underweight materials stocks — about 8 percent — since 2010, and are the most underweight energy equities since before the U.S. presidential election, Subramanian said. Some of the most "neglected" stocks relative to the S&P 500, as tracked by the investment research group, include Alliant Energy, Advanced Micro Devices and H&R Block.

This new malware, dubbed OSX/Dok, was first identified by security firm Check Point. It is capable of affecting all versions of MacOS and has yet to be identified by Mac virus protection software. Read: Mac Malware: McAfee Reports Huge Increase In Malware On MacOS OSX/Dok has been able to bypass most Mac protection—including Apple’s own Gatekeeper, a tool that check the validity of every app installed on a device—because it is signed with a valid developer certificate authenticated by Apple. The particularly nasty malware is being spread through a targeted phishing campaign which has so far primarily targeted European users. Many of the emails containing the malicious software have baited users into downloading OSX/Dok by claiming there was an inconsistency in their tax filing. A .zip file attached to the email contains the malware. Once a user had downloaded and opened the file, OSX/Dok gets to work installing itself on the machine. It generates a fake pop-up message stating the supposed tax file cannot be opened, then creates a login item for itself with the innocuous name “AppStore.” This allows OSX/Dok to launch immediately when the computer boots up. Next, the malware produces another fake pop-up, this time telling the user a security issue has been identified and an update to MacOS is available to download. The supposed update requires users to enter their system password to allow the install. If the user enters their password, OSX/Dok can gain administrative privileges on the machine. Read: Remove Mac Ransomware: How To Tell If You're Infected By KeRanger And Recovery Steps With its newfound administrative access, OSX/Dok begins performing its most malicious act yet: hijacking a user’s internet activity. It accomplishes this by effectively executing a man-in-the-middle attack, directing the user’s activity through a proxy that allows the attacker to see every bit of sent and received data. The malware even installs a false security certificate, which allows it to impersonate any website—including HTTPS sites that should be secure and offer an encrypted connection between the user and the site. The fact that OSX/Dok operates with a valid developer certificate makes the attack a particularly difficult one to stop once it gets started. Luckily, it also means it should be easy for Apple to shut it down once it identifies the certificate, which was likely stolen in the first place. Once Apple invalidates it, Gatekeeper should keep the malware from ever being installed on a machine. The existence of OSX/Dok shows the evolution of Mac malware in recent years. While the number of malicious attacks targeting Macs is still a miniscule fraction of those designed to infect Windows machines, there has been more focus on hitting MacOS than ever before. Earlier this year, security firm McAfee reported MacOS malware increased by 744 percent over the course of 2016, with a total of 460,000 instances of MacOS-targeted malware detected in the wild.

Jeff Bezos is almost richer than you Posted: Friday, April 28, 2017 12:33 PM EDT Updated: Friday, April 28, 2017 5:03 PM EDT Move over Warren Buffett! Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is now the second richest person on Earth. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Move over, Bill Gates. You might lose the title of world's wealthiest person. The net worth of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos rose nearly $2 billion to about $80.5 billion on Friday after Amazon reported strong earnings and sales and its stock gained 2%. Bezos is now slightly behind Spanish retail magnate Amancio Ortega, whose Inditex firm owns the Zara clothing stores. Ortega is worth $81 billion. Bezos has at least moved ahead of Berkshire Hathaway CEO -- and Oracle of Omaha -- Warren Buffett. And Bezos is a "mere" $7 billion behind Gates for the title of earth's richest carbon-based life form. Don't shed any tears for Gates. Microsoft stock was up a bit Friday following that company's solid earnings report. Gates is now worth $87.2 billion. The tech industry continues to dominate the market. Google parent company Alphabet reported solid results on Thursday, and that helped lift the net worth of co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin by about $1.7 billion apiece in the process. Two other tech titans, Apple and Facebook, will report their earnings next week. The surge in Facebook's stock this year has pushed CEO Mark Zuckerberg's net worth up to $62.6 billion, putting him in a tie for fifth-wealthiest person with Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim Helu. And while Apple CEO Tim Cook isn't as wealthy as many of his fellow tech CEOs -- he's not a company founder -- he still is in charge of the world's most valuable company. Apple is worth three-quarters of a trillion dollars. And it has $246 billion in cash. Much of that is held in overseas bank accounts. Ditto for other tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Oracle and Cisco. And that cash pile is steadily growing. Both Microsoft and Alphabet reported an increase in their cash levels in earnings reports Thursday. Microsoft now has $126 billion, and Alphabet has $92.4 billion. Tech companies will soon have an incentive to bring a chunk of that cash back to the United States if President Trump succeeds in getting tax laws changed. He's offering a one-time tax break for companies that repatriate cash parked overseas. Hopes for tax reform are one reason tech stocks continue to lead the market higher. Silicon Valley doesn't exactly see eye-to-eye with Trump on a lot of things. But investors are excited about repatriation. The strong earnings don't hurt either, of course. "Tech us pushing the market higher. And it's about more than Trump," said Kate Warne, an investment strategist with Edward Jones. "But Trump's policies should have positive impact when they get implemented." But should investors be worried about how much influence the tech sector has on the overall market? Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook are collectively worth $2.8 trillion. These companies will have to continue to innovate to maintain strong earnings and sales growth. Investors won't tolerate missteps. Just look at what happened to Intel, another tech giant that reported its latest earnings Thursday. Results were disappointing, and the semiconductor company's stock fell 4%. But it seems that many investors have faith in the tech sector's Big Five and those company's respective leaders. Bezos, Zuckerberg, Cook and Page have earned Wall Street's respect. So has Satya Nadella at Microsoft, who has pushed the company further into the cloud computing market as well as social networking with its purchase of LinkedIn. "Higher quality tech companies continue to get bigger," said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners. "The probability of any of these companies having a hiccup from our perspective seems small." Bailey's firm owns stakes in Facebook and Alphabet. And he notes that, unlike in 2000, when tech stocks were trading at insane valuations, nearly all the big tech companies are reasonably valued. Amazon is the main exception. But it's been trading at a high valuation for almost two decades. Any investors skeptical of Amazon have either missed the rally -- or lost lots of money betting against it. James Wang, an analyst for ARK Invest, thinks tech will continue to dominate. His firm runs the ARK Web X.0 ETF, which has big stakes in Amazon and Facebook, as well as tech leaders Netflix and China's Alibaba. "Tech is an area that should be more immune from regulation and politics than many others. And it is benefiting from genuine shifts in the economy," Wang said. So it looks like Bezos will keep getting richer. But he'll have some company. Gates, Zuckerberg, Page and Brin may also see their bank accounts swell as the tech sector continues to surge.

Most of the growth was driven by Samsung, OPPO, vivo, Gionee, and Motorola, Counterpoint said.Danish Khan  |  ETTelecom  |  Updated: April 28, 2017, 20:26 IST X Newsletter A A         Apple and Samsung are going toe-to-toe in a patent dispute, which mirrors a fierce battle for industry supremacy between two rivals. New Delhi: Samsung Electronics displaced Apple in India’s premium smartphone segment in the January-March quarter and maintained its leadership in the country’s handset market, while No. 2 Xiaomi narrowed the gap with the South Korean company, research firms said. In the overall handset market, Samsung stayed on top, China’s iTel was at the No. 2 spot with a 9% share and Micromax Informatics was third (8%), according to Counterpoint Technology Market Research. Samsung had a 26% share in both the smartphone and overall handset segments, as per Counterpoint. Samsung’s smartphone share remained unchanged at 22% sequentially, although shipments fell to 6 million in the quarter from 6.2 million a year earlier, Canalys said. Xiaomi jumped to the second spot in the smartphone segment for the first time with a 13% market share, Counterpoint said. The Chinese handset maker enhanced its market share by 3 percentage points sequentially to 14% in the January-March quarter, as per Canalys data. Xiaomi shipped 3.8 million handsets in the first quarter of calendar 2017, up from 3 million in the previous quarter, when it had a 10% share. It had a 3% share in the first quarter of 2016. Xiaomi’s success in India is underscored by its online go-to-market strategy. “Demonetisation seems to have had no impact on it as its target customer is young, internet-enabled and primarily buys online,” Canalys research analyst Ishan Dutt said in a note dated April 27. Vivo, Oppo and Lenovo (including Motorola) made up the rest of the top five, as per both agencies, although not in the same order. Samsung replaced Apple as the top premium (Rs 30,000 and above) smartphone vendor with a 48% market share in January-March, up from 31% in October-December. Apple’s share dropped to 43% from 62%, Counterpoint Research said. Samsung brought in new inventory of S7 Edge smartphones after withdrawing the Note 7, which led to an increase in its premium market share, according to Tarun Pathak, senior analyst at Counterpoint. “There was a price cut for S7 Edge, which along with the introduction of C7 Pro smartphone, helped the vendor,” Pathak said, adding that Apple’s share declined due to a seasonality issue. The research firms noted that there was a shift in distribution strategy by major handset companies. Offline brands Oppo, Vivo and Gionee have started focusing on online channels as well to gain market share, while online-only brands Xiaomi and Motorola are moving into offline markets to widen their reach. Canalys said the Indian market may be headed for an upheaval with the government set to implement the new Goods and Services Tax regime from July 1. “We will see a change in vendors’ channel strategies as new distribution models become more cost-effective. Pure online players are likely to suffer and those that react quickly to the new regulations will benefit,” Dutt said. Analysts at Counterpoint said the new tax regime will affect domestic manufacturing and the government will need to continue incentives to push the local ecosystem. India’s smartphone market grew 12% year on year in the first quarter of 2017, with over 27 million units shipped and no new names in the top five, Canalys said, adding that shipments fell sequentially from 28.1 million units in the fourth quarter of 2016. As per Counterpoint, smartphone shipments in India grew 15% to 29 million units in the quarter. Overall mobile handsets witnessed a healthy growth of 6% year-on-year. The firm said smartphones and feature phones contributed equally to overall mobile handset shipments. During the quarter, LTE-capable smartphones contributed 96% of total smartphone shipments. LTE, a 4G mobile communications standard, is now the default feature for smartphones in India. The average selling price of smartphones in India increased by Rs 2,000 year-on-year during the quarter, Shobhit Srivastava, a research analyst at Counterpoint Research, noted, as a growing number of users upgraded to high-end specifications offered in the Rs 8,000-Rs 20,000 price segment. iTel shipped 5.2 million handsets, largely feature phones, in the quarter. “iTel leveraged its successful low-cost strategy, effective distribution and scale,” Counterpoint Research said. The premium segment grew 35% from a year earlier. OnePlus, Oppo and Google made the top five in this segment, each with marginal market shares.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | April 28, 2017 -- 16:32 GMT (09:32 PDT) | Topic: Processors Qualcomm issued a profit warning Friday stemming from its escalating legal with Apple. The chipmaker said that Apple has decided to withhold royalty payments to contract manufacturers that are owed to Qualcomm until the legal dispute between the two companies is resolved. must read Digital transformation: Making it work in the real world It takes more than shiny new technologies to remake business processes. Here are a few ideas on how to make digital transformation projects work in your organisation. Read More In January, Apple filed a suit against Qualcomm accusing the semiconductor giant of overcharging for chips and withholding nearly $1 billion in contractual rebate payments. The suit also charges that Qualcomm is "attempting to extort" Apple into obstructing an investigation by South Korean regulatory investigators into Qualcomm's monopolistic practices. Additionally, the suit claims that Qualcomm has created an "abusive licensing model" that lets the company demand excessive royalties. In its earnings report last week, Qualcomm noted that its guidance range did not include "the case where no payments are made by Apple suppliers." With Apple's latest move, Qualcomm says it now expects revenue of $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion for its third fiscal quarter, down from the $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion it had previously expected. Qualcomm also lowered its Q3 profit forecast to a range of 75 cents to 85 cents per share, down from 90 cents to $1.15 per share. Qualcomm said Apple's contract manufacturers could end up making some form of partial payment, but that those payments would likely be insignificant. "Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade," Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's general counsel, said in a statement. "We will continue vigorously to defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry." Earlier this month, Qualcomm was forced to pay BlackBerry $814.9 million in an arbitration settlement. The two companies had agreed to arbitrate a contract dispute over whether Qualcomm's royalty cap program applied to payments made by BlackBerry under a licensing deal. The arbitrator determined that BlackBerry had indeed overpaid royalty fees between 2010 and 2015.

Photo: CNA Apple Inc has held talks with payments industry partners about launching a money-transfer service, technology news Web site Recode reported on Thursday. The service would allow iPhone owners to transfer money digitally to other iPhone users, Recode reported, citing sources familiar with the talks. One source told Recode that Apple is to announce the new service later this year, while another told the Web site an announcement and launch date might not be set. If launched, the service would compete with digital money transfer services such as PayPal’s Venmo and Square Inc’s Square Cash, as well as services from big banks. Apple was also in talks with payments network operator Visa Inc to create its own prepaid cards to run on the Visa debit network, and to be tied to the new peer-to-peer service, the Recode report said. Apple is looking for ways to boost usage of Apple Pay, its mobile payments service, and the debit card could be one way to do that, Recode said. Apple Pay usage has been lighter than expected since its launch two and a half years ago, the Web site said, citing sources from big US banks. Separately, almost two weeks after Apple secured permission to test its autonomous car technology in California, the first images of the vehicle have been captured on Silicon Valley roads this week. The white Lexus RX450h SUV emerged from an Apple facility and was fitted with an array of sensors, a person who saw the vehicle and provided photos to Bloomberg News said. The sensors included Velodyne Lidar Inc’s top-of-the-range 64-channel lidar, at least two radar and a series of cameras. The sensors appear to be products bought off the shelf from suppliers, rather than custom-made, an industry expert who saw the photos said. Apple declined to comment.

The company is reportedly close to finalising the device's design ahead of a public reveal at its WWDC developers event in early summer. Respected Australian Apple leaker Sonny Dickson shared details about the long-rumoured device with news site MacRumors in an article published today. Although the claims have not been verified, they corroborate earlier reports on Apple's plans for its own smart speaker. The device will be based on the same principles Google has employed for the Home. It'll be minimalist and designed to blend into your house while carrying its own distinctive look. As is typical of other Apple products, it's likely to be noticeable but simultaneously unobtrusive. Dickson described the overall look as "fat" with a similar base to the Google Home. It has a concave top that houses the integrated control panel. The speaker will be available in two different sizes, enabling you to buy the model that best suits your home. This is an approach also favoured by Amazon which offers its Alexa-powered Echo in two different forms. Apple's take on the smart speaker category is believed to include facial recognition sensors for use when identifying the user. Previous reports have revealed Apple's focusing on four key development areas: Siri integration, proactive assistance, speech recognition and web searches. This depicts the overarching aim for the project as a bid to create a credible rival to Amazon and Google's popular existing products. Google Home Google Dickson also revealed Apple's planning to add "some form of Beats technology" to the finished device. Whether this will be purely for marketing purposes or a more sophisticated unique voice recognition system isn't clear. The speaker will run on a specially customised version of iOS, the same operating system currently used on the iPhone and iPad. The product will offer similar functionality to the Echo and Google Home. Controlled primarily through voice commands, you'll be able to check the news, get weather alerts and manage your calendar. There'll also be strong support for connecting to Internet of Things devices, letting you dim the lights or send commands to home appliances using only your voice. Back in September, Bloomberg revealed Apple had begun production of prototype smart speaker units. Now over six months on, the project is likely to be nearing completion, making a public unveiling at WWDC likely. The company has launched hardware at its Worldwide Developers Conference before, although it is primarily a software event. Apple will also use the time to debut new versions of its iOS and macOS operating systems. Assuming the reports are accurate, an Apple smart speaker would give the company a presence in the Internet of Things. It is currently conspicuously absent from the market, leaving rivals Amazon and Google to dominate the space. At present, Amazon is taking Apple's regular seat in the competition against Google. Apple will now use its Siri-powered device to disrupt the status quo and add a third major ecosystem to the list of popular smart speakers.

A new leak has revealed that the Cupertino company is 'currently finalizing' its own smart speaker, which is said to be marketed as a 'Siri/AirPlay device'.

Scroll down for video  Apple is getting closer to unleashing its secret weapon to take on Amazon's Echo. A new leak has revealed that the Cupertino company is 'currently finalizing' its own smart speaker, which is said to be marketed as a 'Siri/AirPlay device' APPLE'S SIRI-DRIVEN SMART SPEAKER Sonny Dickson, who is known for sharing inside information in the tech world, revealed that Apple is 'currently finalizing' its smart speaker that will be marketed as a 'Siri/AirPlay device'. Adding Airplay support to the device would let users push music, radio, and podcasts to the Apple hardware over Wi-Fi, which typically offers better quality than Bluetooth.  He also revealed details that it could 'carry some form of Beats technology and is expected to run on variant iOS'. Dickson also told Mashable that it would have a 'concave top' with the controls, 'Mac Pro style.' Although it is not clear if the rumors are true, if Apple's smart speaker does hit the market 'it would be Apple's most significant piece of new hardware' since debuting the Apple Watch in 2014'. The latest rumor regarding Apple's secretive smart speaker was shared to Twitter by Sonny Dickson, who is known for sharing inside information in the tech world. Not only did he mention the device is near completion, but he also revealed details that it could 'carry some form of Beats technology and is expected to run on variant iOS'. Dickson also told Mashable that it would have a 'concave top' with the controls, 'Mac Pro style.' But that is all of the information the well-known leaker had to share. Adding Airplay support to the device would let users 'push music, radio, and podcasts to the Apple hardware over Wi-Fi, which typically offers better quality than Bluetooth,' Apple Insider reported.

It could also 'carry some form of Beats technology and is expected to run on variant iOS' Dickson's news is not the first time Apple's smart speaker has made its way to the masses. Last September, two people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that Apple is attempting to differentiate itself from the other firms with more advanced microphone and speaker technology. And some of the technology in the prototype includes facial recognition sensors, another source revealed. These tips coincides with Apple's purchase of the facial recognition startups Faceshift and Emotient over the past two years.  However, Apple has yet to make an official announcement regarding their Siri-enabled smart speaker, so it is not clear when or if it will be released. But the tech giant is known for unveiling new technologies at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, which has some speculating the firm could show off the smart speaker then The two firms appear to play key roles in creating a device that adapts to a room or a person's emotional state. Users would also have the ability to use the same Siri features with the device that they enjoy with their iPhone. Apple has also considered integrating mapping information into the speaker, another person said, which could notify users when it is time to leave their house for an appointment. News about a 'Siri speaker' was first brought to light in May by Amir Efrati of The Information who wrote, 'Apple is upping its game in the field of intelligent assistants'. Dickson's news is not the first time Apple's smart speaker has made its way to the masses - reports surfaced last year that suggested Apple has a secret weapon to take on Amazon's Echo (pictured) 'After years of internal debate and discussion about how to do so, the company is preparing to open up Siri to apps made by others. 'And it is working on an Amazon Echo-like device with a speaker and microphone that people can use to turn on music, get news headlines or set a timer.' Apple showed its interested in the smart-home space with the launch of HomeKit in 2014, which lets third-party smart-home accessory makers integrate with Siri. This was also the same year Apple began its work with the Siri-powered speakers.

Apple has informed Qualcomm it will be withholding payments from contract manufacturers such as Foxconn as the royalty row hits new heights. Up to this point, the two tech giants had traded blows with each other, but now the violence is expanding as innocent suppliers get caught up in the mess. Over the course of the last few months, the pair have traded blows accusing each other of lying, making threats and harbour monopolistic ambitions. Apple claimed Qualcomm abused its dominant position, though as Apple is in the unusual position of not having a direct contract with Qualcomm, the chipmaker has told it to mind its own business. It’s a disjointed, dysfunction relationship which seemed to work until recently, but it would appear there is no going back now. It’s also a tricky position for the suppliers; with both hands feeding them, which one should be bitten? On one side they are dependent on Apple for contracts, however to honour those contracts they are dependent on Qualcomm intellectual property. It’s a lovely catch-22 situation, and you have to feel a bit sorry for a few of them. “Apple is improperly interfering with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm’s licensees,” said Don Rosenberg, General Counsel at Qualcomm.  “These license agreements remain valid and enforceable.  While Apple has acknowledged that payment is owed for the use of Qualcomm’s valuable intellectual property, it nevertheless continues to interfere with our contracts.” “Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade.  Apple’s continued interference with Qualcomm’s agreements to which Apple is not a party is wrongful and the latest step in Apple’s global attack on Qualcomm. We will continue vigorously.” Although the battle has been intensifying, it would appear Qualcomm was confident of getting some readies out of the deal, but no longer. Following Apple’s announcement, Qualcomm cut its financial forecasts range from $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion to $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion, which also saw a decline in the share price. At the time of writing share price dipped 3.5%. It is difficult to pick sides between two organizations which are showing their ugly side as greedy executives claw for a few extra dollars to fund their bonuses.

Business Technology Apple blocks more patent payments to Qualcomm, escalating feud Qualcomm has reduced its third quarter financial outlook after learning Apple will withhold patent royalty payment until a legal dispute is resolved. Reuters Qualcomm has reduced its third quarter financial outlook after learning Apple will withhold patent royalty payment until a legal dispute between the two companies is resolved. Qualcomm has reduced its third quarter financial outlook after learning Apple will withhold patent royalty payment until a legal dispute between the two companies is resolved. (Reuters) Mike FreemanContact Reporter Qualcomm slashed it financial forecast for the current quarter early Friday, blaming Apple for further withholding patent royalties payments in a fierce legal fight over intellectual property licensing. The lower revenue and profit outlook, which Qualcomm hinted at last week when it reported March quarter earnings, highlights the rising stakes in the rocky relationship between the two tech giants that shows no sign of improving. Qualcomm expects revenue of $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion for its fiscal third quarter ending June 30. Earnings are pegged at 52 cents to 62 cents per share under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. For the same quarter last year, Qualcomm posted $6 billion in revenue and GAAP earnings of 97 cents per share. In January, Apple sued Qualcomm, saying it forces smartphone makers to pay too much for use of its 3G/4G standard essential patents, which are required to be licensed under “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” terms. Qualcomm counters that its royalty rates, which top out at roughly 5 percent of the device price, have been negotiated through hundreds of agreements spanning two decades. According to Qualcomm, its licensing business model allowed Apple to enter the smartphone market with little or no investment in core cellular technology. While 3G/4G patent licenses make up about one-third of Qualcomm’s annual revenue, they account for most of its annual profit. Apple is the world’s largest seller of smartphones. In a recent research report, Bernstein Research Analyst Stacy Rasgon estimated that Apple could account for as much as one-third of Qualcomm’s royalty business, or more than $2 billion a year. Apple doesn’t directly license patents from Qualcomm. Instead, Foxconn and other contract manufacturers that build iPhones and iPads have license agreements. Apple reimburses them for royalties. Last quarter, Apple withheld some Qualcomm royalty reimbursements to contract manufacturers, but only up to $1 billion. That’s equal to royalty “rebates” that Apple contends it’s owed by Qualcomm under a separate business cooperation deal. When it reported March quarter earnings, Qualcomm wasn’t sure Apple would block reimbursements beyond the $1 billion amount. But now Qualcomm says Apple indicated that it will continue withholding reimbursements until the legal war between the two companies is resolved. As a result, Qualcomm’s new financial guidance assumes no royalty payments from iPhone/iPad contract manufacturers in the quarter. “Apple is improperly interfering with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm’s licensees,” said General Counsel Don Rosenberg in a statement. “Apple’s continued interference with Qualcomm’s agreements to which Apple is not a party is wrongful and the latest step in Apple’s global attack on Qualcomm.” In a statement, Apple called Qualcomm’s royalty rates unreasonable. “We’ve been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years, but they have refused to negotiate fair terms,” the company said. “Without an agreed upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court.” Qualcomm’s patent licensing business has come under fire worldwide, and the company believes it was instigated by Apple and others. Last fall, the Korea Fair Trade Commission fined Qualcomm more than $850 million for allegedly abusing its market power in the way it licenses patents. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also filed a lawsuit, and Apple launched its legal action shortly afterward. Qualcomm denies the allegations. It has countersued Apple, appealed the South Korea fine and is seeking dismissal of the FTC case on the grounds that it fails to show how Qualcomm licensing practices harmed the smartphone market. Analysts are unclear what might happen next. Rasgon, the Bernstein analyst, said there is a possibility that other smartphone firms could begin withholding royalty payments, too. “We know there is already an additional licensee dispute of $150 million in revenue per quarter, likely Samsung in our opinion, and the threat of contagion remains, especially with Apple now paying essentially nothing at all,” said Rasgon in a research note. Tim Arcuri, an analyst with Cowen & Co., said that Qualcomm’s next move “could be to retaliate on Apple via its contract manufacturers (with whom it has licensing deals) and try to get an injunction to literally halt the manufacturing of iPhones.” But two other analysts interviewed by the Union-Tribune think such a move is unlikely. They contend Apple would not have suspended royalty reimbursements unless it was confident that Qualcomm wouldn’t seek an injunction. Qualcomm announced the lower guidance before markets opened Friday. Investors shrugged off the news. The company’s shares ended trading up 53 cents at $53.74 on the Nasdaq exchange.

The lower revenue and profit outlook, which Qualcomm hinted at last week when it reported March quarter earnings, highlights the rising stakes in the rocky relationship between the two tech giants that shows no sign of improving. Qualcomm expects revenue of $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion for its fiscal third quarter ending June 30. Earnings are pegged at 52 cents to 62 cents per share under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. For the same quarter last year, Qualcomm posted $6 billion in revenue and GAAP earnings of 97 cents per share. In January, Apple sued Qualcomm, saying it forces smartphone makers to pay too much for use of its 3G/4G standard essential patents, which are required to be licensed under “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” terms. Qualcomm counters that its royalty rates, which top out at roughly 5 percent of the device price, have been negotiated through hundreds of agreements spanning two decades. According to Qualcomm, its licensing business model allowed Apple to enter the smartphone market with little or no investment in core cellular technology. While 3G/4G patent licenses make up about one-third of Qualcomm’s annual revenue, they account for most of its annual profit. Apple is the world’s largest seller of smartphones. In a recent research report, Bernstein Research Analyst Stacy Rasgon estimated that Apple could account for as much as one-third of Qualcomm’s royalty business, or more than $2 billion a year. Apple doesn’t directly license patents from Qualcomm. Instead, Foxconn and other contract manufacturers that build iPhones and iPads have license agreements. Apple reimburses them for royalties. Last quarter, Apple withheld some Qualcomm royalty reimbursements to contract manufacturers, but only up to $1 billion. That’s equal to royalty “rebates” that Apple contends it’s owed by Qualcomm under a separate business cooperation deal. When it reported March quarter earnings, Qualcomm wasn’t sure Apple would block reimbursements beyond the $1 billion amount. But now Qualcomm says Apple indicated that it will continue withholding reimbursements until the legal war between the two companies is resolved. As a result, Qualcomm’s new financial guidance assumes no royalty payments from iPhone/iPad contract manufacturers in the quarter. “Apple is improperly interfering with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm’s licensees,” said General Counsel Don Rosenberg in a statement. “Apple’s continued interference with Qualcomm’s agreements to which Apple is not a party is wrongful and the latest step in Apple’s global attack on Qualcomm.” In a statement, Apple called Qualcomm’s royalty rates unreasonable. “We’ve been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years, but they have refused to negotiate fair terms,” the company said. “Without an agreed upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court.” Qualcomm’s patent licensing business has come under fire worldwide, and the company believes it was instigated by Apple and others. Last fall, the Korea Fair Trade Commission fined Qualcomm more than $850 million for allegedly abusing its market power in the way it licenses patents. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also filed a lawsuit, and Apple launched its legal action shortly afterward. Qualcomm denies the allegations. It has countersued Apple, appealed the South Korea fine and is seeking dismissal of the FTC case on the grounds that it fails to show how Qualcomm licensing practices harmed the smartphone market. Analysts are unclear what might happen next. Rasgon, the Bernstein analyst, said there is a possibility that other smartphone firms could begin withholding royalty payments, too. “We know there is already an additional licensee dispute of $150 million in revenue per quarter, likely Samsung in our opinion, and the threat of contagion remains, especially with Apple now paying essentially nothing at all,” said Rasgon in a research note. Tim Arcuri, an analyst with Cowen & Co., said that Qualcomm’s next move “could be to retaliate on Apple via its contract manufacturers (with whom it has licensing deals) and try to get an injunction to literally halt the manufacturing of iPhones.” But two other analysts interviewed by the Union-Tribune think such a move is unlikely. They contend Apple would not have suspended royalty reimbursements unless it was confident that Qualcomm wouldn’t seek an injunction. Qualcomm announced the lower guidance before markets opened Friday. Investors shrugged off the news. The company’s shares ended trading up 53 cents at $53.74 on the Nasdaq exchange.

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals What you need to know about OSX/Dok malware Christian Zibreg on April 28, 2017 4 A new type of man-in-the-middle attack has been detected in the wild, targeting Apple’s Mac. Dubbed OSX/DOK, it relies on a new strain of macOS malware which leverages a bogus security certificate to bypass Apple’s Gatekeeper protection. Popular anti-virus programs are currently unable to detect OSX/DOK. The Hacker News and researches at CheckPoint explain that the malware affects all versions of macOS by using a valid developer certificate signed by Apple. Here’s what OSX/DOK does, how it works, how to tell if you’re affected and what you can do to protect yourself and avoid these kinds of attacks in the future. What is OSX/DOK? OSX/DOK is a new type of malware distributed via an email phishing campaign. It’s been designed to specifically target Mac owners. OSX/DOK affects all macOS versions and can avoid detection by most anti-virus programs. It’s signed with a valid developer certificate authenticated by Apple, meaning it avoids detection by macOS’s Gatekeeper security feature. How does OSX/DOK infest your Mac? The malware bundle is contained in a .ZIP archive named “Dokument.zip.” Once executed, the malware first copies itself to your Mac’s /Users/Shared/ folder before executing itself from that location. It then proceeds to install a new root certificate which lets it intercept your traffic with a man-in-the-middle attack. To ensure the malware finishes installing its payload before a reboot, it adds itself as macOS Login Item named “AppStore”. Next, the user is greeted with a persistent window designed to look like a valid macOS warning, as you’re seeing on the screenshot below. The window informs the user of a supposed security issue in their Mac which requires an update. The message prevents the user from doing anything on their computer until they accept the fake update prompt. Clicking the Update All button puts up another prompt asking for your password. Once the password is supplied, the malware gains administrator privileges on your Mac. Using those privileges, it installs command-line tools that allow connection to the dark web. It then changes your Network Settings to redirect all outgoing connections through a malicious proxy server which lets the attacker eavesdrop on your communications. Some phishing messages used to spread the malware appear to mostly target users in Germany, but that doesn’t mean that only European users are at risk. For what it’s worth, the malware code supports messages in both German and English. What damage does OSX/DOK do? OSX/Dok redirects your traffic via a malicious proxy server, giving nefarious users access to all your communication, including that encrypted by SSL. Because it installs a compromised root certificate on the system, the attacker is able to impersonate any website to fool users into providing their passwords for banking apps and popular online services. How to know if you’re affected? If you’ve recently opened a ZIP file in an email message you weren’t expecting, and are now seeing suspicious-looking prompts asking for your Mac password, your system may have been infected with OS X/DOK. Because the malware redirects your network traffic to a rogue proxy server, you should venture into System Preferences → Network. From there, select your active network connection in the lefthand column (like Wi-Fi, Ethernet and so forth), then click the Advanced button. Now click the Proxies tab. If Automatic Proxy Configuration has been enabled in the lefthand column and the field underneath the heading Proxy Configuration File points to the URL that begins with “127.0.0.1:5555”, the malware is already routing all your traffic through a rogue proxy server. Simply delete this entry to prevent traffic routing. The malware installs two LaunchAgents that will start with system boot: /Users/YOUR USERNAME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Safari.proxy.plist /Users/YOUR USERNAME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Safari.pac.plist If you find these files in the above locations, delete them immediately. Lastly, check for the existence of the bogus securest certificate named “COMODO RSA Extended Validation Secure Server CA 2” in the System section of the Keychain Access app in your /Applications/Utilities/ folder. If the certificate is installed on your Mac, delete it. How to protect yourself? OSX/DOK is the first major-scale malware to target Mac users via a coordinated email phishing campaign. The first point of attack relies on the user opening a maliciously-crafted attachment in an email message. Don’t open suspicious attachments, especially if the attached file is named “Dokument.ZIP”. Beware of phishing messages bearing animated GIFs or those regarding supposed inconsistencies in your tax returns. Always check the headers to confirm the validity of the sender. If the malware file has found its way on your system, do not interact with and suspicious-looking prompts pretending to be valid macOS dialogs, especially if they ask for your root password for no apparent reason. Apple never puts up warning messages if your Mac requires a software update. All macOS software updates are distributed exclusively via Mac App Store. If you use an anti-virus app, update its signature database manually. At the time of this writing, no anti-virus vendor has updated their signature database with DOK OS X malware, but that will change soon. This malware issue will be fully resolved as soon as Apple revokes the bogus security certificate that its author has abused to bypass the Gatekeeper security feature.

Introducing some new concepts not previously shared, Dickson believes that the speaker could see its debut at this year’s WWDC. According to a supposed insider at Apple, Dickson was told that Apple is currently working on finalizing the designs that will become the Siri speaker. Dickson wrote that it is “expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device,” and that it would “carry some form of Beats technology.” AirPlay functionality in the Siri speaker has been reported before, alongside a potential Siri SDK release. However, the the alleged device including “Beats technology” is new. Dickson’s tweet doesn’t expound on that, but it could mean that Apple might bring some of the audio company’s tech into its own upcoming speaker. It is believed to carry some form of Beats technology, and is expected to run an variant iOS — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 27, 2017 Dickson mentions that the speaker will sport a concave top with controls, and a mesh speaker covering the entire device. He shared with Mashable that it will take design cues from the Mac Pro, and the UE BOOM’s mesh styling. UE MEGABOOM Speaker What remains to be answered by the leak is what Dickson means by “variant iOS”. A new product from Apple that isn’t an iPhone or iPad most likely won’t see iOS as we know it today, but something more akin to watchOS or tvOS. If Apple were to build a custom OS platform for the speaker, the company would be able to open the device to third-party developers and apps. This latest leak comes after Dickson recently shared iPhone 8 schematics and mentioned that iOS 10.3 beta 1 would feature “Theatre mode” (which didn’t end up happening). With both Amazon and Google opening their assistant technologies up to developers, now is as good of a time as any for Apple to release its home assistant speaker competitor.

Business Technology Apple blocks more patent payments to Qualcomm, escalating feud Qualcomm has reduced its third quarter financial outlook after learning Apple will withhold patent royalty payment until a legal dispute is resolved. Reuters Qualcomm has reduced its third quarter financial outlook after learning Apple will withhold patent royalty payment until a legal dispute between the two companies is resolved. Qualcomm has reduced its third quarter financial outlook after learning Apple will withhold patent royalty payment until a legal dispute between the two companies is resolved. (Reuters) Mike FreemanContact Reporter Qualcomm slashed it financial forecast for the current quarter early Friday, blaming Apple for further withholding patent royalties payments in a fierce legal fight over intellectual property licensing. The lower revenue and profit outlook, which Qualcomm hinted at last week when it reported March quarter earnings, highlights the rising stakes in the rocky relationship between the two tech giants that shows no sign of improving. Qualcomm expects revenue of $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion for its fiscal third quarter ending June 30. Earnings are pegged at 52 cents to 62 cents per share under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. For the same quarter last year, Qualcomm posted $6 billion in revenue and GAAP earnings of 97 cents per share. In January, Apple sued Qualcomm, saying it forces smartphone makers to pay too much for use of its 3G/4G standard essential patents, which are required to be licensed under “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” terms. Qualcomm counters that its royalty rates, which top out at roughly 5 percent of the device price, have been negotiated through hundreds of agreements spanning two decades. According to Qualcomm, its licensing business model allowed Apple to enter the smartphone market with little or no investment in core cellular technology. While 3G/4G patent licenses make up about one-third of Qualcomm’s annual revenue, they account for most of its annual profit. Apple is the world’s largest seller of smartphones. In a recent research report, Bernstein Research Analyst Stacy Rasgon estimated that Apple could account for as much as one-third of Qualcomm’s royalty business, or more than $2 billion a year. Apple doesn’t directly license patents from Qualcomm. Instead, Foxconn and other contract manufacturers that build iPhones and iPads have license agreements. Apple reimburses them for royalties. Last quarter, Apple withheld some Qualcomm royalty reimbursements to contract manufacturers, but only up to $1 billion. That’s equal to royalty “rebates” that Apple contends it’s owed by Qualcomm under a separate business cooperation deal. When it reported March quarter earnings, Qualcomm wasn’t sure Apple would block reimbursements beyond the $1 billion amount. But now Qualcomm says Apple indicated that it will continue withholding reimbursements until the legal war between the two companies is resolved. As a result, Qualcomm’s new financial guidance assumes no royalty payments from iPhone/iPad contract manufacturers in the quarter. “Apple is improperly interfering with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm’s licensees,” said General Counsel Don Rosenberg in a statement. “Apple’s continued interference with Qualcomm’s agreements to which Apple is not a party is wrongful and the latest step in Apple’s global attack on Qualcomm.” In a statement, Apple called Qualcomm’s royalty rates unreasonable. “We’ve been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years, but they have refused to negotiate fair terms,” the company said. “Without an agreed upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court.” Qualcomm’s patent licensing business has come under fire worldwide, and the company believes it was instigated by Apple and others. Last fall, the Korea Fair Trade Commission fined Qualcomm more than $850 million for allegedly abusing its market power in the way it licenses patents. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also filed a lawsuit, and Apple launched its legal action shortly afterward. Qualcomm denies the allegations. It has countersued Apple, appealed the South Korea fine and is seeking dismissal of the FTC case on the grounds that it fails to show how Qualcomm licensing practices harmed the smartphone market. Analysts are unclear what might happen next. Rasgon, the Bernstein analyst, said there is a possibility that other smartphone firms could begin withholding royalty payments, too. “We know there is already an additional licensee dispute of $150 million in revenue per quarter, likely Samsung in our opinion, and the threat of contagion remains, especially with Apple now paying essentially nothing at all,” said Rasgon in a research note. Tim Arcuri, an analyst with Cowen & Co., said that Qualcomm’s next move “could be to retaliate on Apple via its contract manufacturers (with whom it has licensing deals) and try to get an injunction to literally halt the manufacturing of iPhones.” But two other analysts interviewed by the Union-Tribune think such a move is unlikely. They contend Apple would not have suspended royalty reimbursements unless it was confident that Qualcomm wouldn’t seek an injunction. Qualcomm announced the lower guidance before markets opened Friday. Investors shrugged off the news. The company’s shares ended trading up 53 cents at $53.74 on the Nasdaq exchange.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile New iPhone 8 leak suggests Apple won’t use the design everyone hates Image Source: Vianney le Masne Zach Epstein @zacharye April 28th, 2017 at 10:56 AM Share Tweet We’re still more than four months away from seeing Apple unveil its next-generation iPhone 8, but you wouldn’t know it. There’s already a ton of buzz surrounding Apple’s upcoming new iPhones, which will reportedly include three different models this time around. In addition to the completely redesigned iPhone 8, we’re also expecting Apple to launch updated iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models. Interestingly, the updated “S” iPhones this year may feature major hardware updates for the first time ever; Apple typically reuses its iPhone housings for “S” devices, but the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus may get new glass backs to facilitate wireless charging. Of course, no one really cares about the iPhone 7s or iPhone 7s Plus right now. That’s right, everyone’s attention is focused on the completely redesigned iPhone 8. Apple’s new design, however, is a hotly debated topic right now. Don't Miss: There’s one more reason I could never ditch my iPhone 7 Plus for a Galaxy S8 While nothing is confirmed at this point, it’s safe to say the iPhone 8 will in fact sport a new design. Solid sources with very good track records report that the new phone will feature 2.5D glass on the front and back, with a stainless steel mid-frame sandwiched between them. The front will feature a new OLED display with a vastly improved screen-to-body ratio, but things get a little hazy after that. We know with near certainty that, like Samsung, Apple will do away with the iPhone 8’s physical home button. According to some leaks, the next-gen iPhone will feature a fingerprint sensor that’s embedded beneath the screen. But other leaks suggest Apple will relocate the Touch ID fingerprint scanner to the back of the phone because it won’t be able to mass-produce enough iPhones with embedded sensors. A Touch ID scanner on the back of the phone would probably be easier to manufacture, which means Apple would likely have no problem launching the phone in September. The only drawback, of course, would be a massive step backward in terms of user experience. As we recently saw, everyone hates the iPhone 8 design with the fingerprint scanner on the back. The more desirable scenario that has been suggested by leakers is that Apple will indeed embed the Touch ID sensor beneath the iPhone 8’s display, but it will delay the phone’s release until October or possibly November as it works through manufacturing issues. Having to wait an extra month or two would certainly annoy eager Apple fans, but it’s still probably a better option than an iPhone with the fingerprint scanner on the back. Today, a new leak from a reliable source may bring good news. Twitter user KK Sneak Leaks has several genuine leaks under his belt, and on Friday he posted a new photo of a third-party iPhone 8 case. As you can clearly see, there is no opening on this case for a rear-facing fingerprint reader. While there’s nothing to say that the design of this case accurately depicts Apple’s iPhone 8, this particular Twitter user has well-connected sources. As such, it’s entirely possible that we’re looking at Apple’s final iPhone 8 design. It’ll be a while before anything is confirmed, but this new leak could definitely be good news.

Musical.ly users who happen to also pay for an Apple Music subscription are now able to play full songs from Apple’s catalog of 30-some million within the Musical.ly app. Users will also be able to save their favorite songs as part of a Musical.ly playlist, and the Musical.ly team will begin to curate its own playlists within Apple Music. There’s no word yet on further promotional tie-ins, but we shouldn’t be too surprised to see Apple Music make good use of being on Musical.ly: A source with knowledge of the partnership told Variety that we might some additional efforts once Apple launches its version of “Carpool Karaoke” on Apple Music. “Carpool Karaoke,” which is based on the celebrity-laden music format from “The Late Late Show with James Corden,” was originally scheduled to debut on Apple Music in April. However, earlier this week, Apple revealed that it had to delay the launch of the show without announcing a new launch date. With Musical.ly, Apple is potentially getting access to a much younger customer base for Apple Music. The app, and its live streaming sibling Live.ly, have been a huge hit with teenagers in particular.

Apple is looking into the possibility of charging iPhones through medium to long distance wireless charging technologies, a U.S. Patent and Trademark filing named "Wireless Charging and Communications Systems With Dual-Frequency Patch Antennas" made public Thursday shows.

The patent also points to power transfer via “WiGig communications [millimeter wave IEEE 802.11 ad communications in a communications band at 60 GHz].” The filing shows two devices are required for the power transfer, a transmitter and a receiver. Each gadget may include one or more antennas coupled with wireless circuitry that can make phase and/or magnitude adjustments to signals that are received and transmitted.© Photo: USPTO Apple is looking for a way to charge iPhones via Wi-Fi, patent shows Again, the idea is just a patent, and Apple could choose to move forward with the technology or not. Also, it could have been a patent associated with Apple’s AirPort routers, on which the company reportedly stopped production. A November Bloomberg report said Apple shut down the wireless router division and transferred engineers from that team to other product development groups, including the one dedicated to Apple TV. iPhone 8 To Come With Wireless Charging While we wait to see if Apple moves on with the technology described in the patent filing, numerous reports have claimed the company will release the iPhone 8 with wireless charging capabilities. A schematic of the iPhone 8 leaked Wednesday shows the device sporting a wireless charging feature. A previous report by the Verifier said the iPhone 8 will come with Apple’s “Smart Connector” for augmented reality and virtual reality accesories, as well as wireless charging technology. The Smart Connector is currently used on the iPad Pro. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also suggested in February the 2017 iPhone lineup will feature wireless charging. It’s also worth noting Apple joined the Wireless Power Consortium this year, joining companies like Sony, Samsung, LG and Verizon. The move fueled more rumors about the iPhone 8 featuring wireless charging. Meanwhile, a report this week said the iPhone 8 release date could be delayed because Apple and its suppliers are working to fix overheating problems with wireless charging components. The 10th anniversary OLED display iPhone is expected to be released this fall alongside two LCD versions, the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus.

Business Technology Apple blocks more patent payments to Qualcomm, escalating feud Qualcomm has reduced its third quarter financial outlook after learning Apple will withhold patent royalty payment until a legal dispute is resolved. Reuters Qualcomm has reduced its third quarter financial outlook after learning Apple will withhold patent royalty payment until a legal dispute between the two companies is resolved. Qualcomm has reduced its third quarter financial outlook after learning Apple will withhold patent royalty payment until a legal dispute between the two companies is resolved. (Reuters) Mike FreemanContact Reporter Qualcomm slashed it financial forecast for the current quarter early Friday, blaming Apple for further withholding patent royalties payments in a fierce legal fight over intellectual property licensing. The lower revenue and profit outlook, which Qualcomm hinted at last week when it reported March quarter earnings, highlights the rising stakes in the rocky relationship between the two tech giants that shows no sign of improving. Qualcomm expects revenue of $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion for its fiscal third quarter ending June 30. Earnings are pegged at 52 cents to 62 cents per share under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. For the same quarter last year, Qualcomm posted $6 billion in revenue and GAAP earnings of 97 cents per share. In January, Apple sued Qualcomm, saying it forces smartphone makers to pay too much for use of its 3G/4G standard essential patents, which are required to be licensed under “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” terms. Qualcomm counters that its royalty rates, which top out at roughly 5 percent of the device price, have been negotiated through hundreds of agreements spanning two decades. According to Qualcomm, its licensing business model allowed Apple to enter the smartphone market with little or no investment in core cellular technology. While 3G/4G patent licenses make up about one-third of Qualcomm’s annual revenue, they account for most of its annual profit. Apple is the world’s largest seller of smartphones. In a recent research report, Bernstein Research Analyst Stacy Rasgon estimated that Apple could account for as much as one-third of Qualcomm’s royalty business, or more than $2 billion a year. Apple doesn’t directly license patents from Qualcomm. Instead, Foxconn and other contract manufacturers that build iPhones and iPads have license agreements. Apple reimburses them for royalties. Last quarter, Apple withheld some Qualcomm royalty reimbursements to contract manufacturers, but only up to $1 billion. That’s equal to royalty “rebates” that Apple contends it’s owed by Qualcomm under a separate business cooperation deal. When it reported March quarter earnings, Qualcomm wasn’t sure Apple would block reimbursements beyond the $1 billion amount. But now Qualcomm says Apple indicated that it will continue withholding reimbursements until the legal war between the two companies is resolved. As a result, Qualcomm’s new financial guidance assumes no royalty payments from iPhone/iPad contract manufacturers in the quarter. “Apple is improperly interfering with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm’s licensees,” said General Counsel Don Rosenberg in a statement. “Apple’s continued interference with Qualcomm’s agreements to which Apple is not a party is wrongful and the latest step in Apple’s global attack on Qualcomm.” In a statement, Apple called Qualcomm’s royalty rates unreasonable. “We’ve been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years, but they have refused to negotiate fair terms,” the company said. “Without an agreed upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court.” Qualcomm’s patent licensing business has come under fire worldwide, and the company believes it was instigated by Apple and others. Last fall, the Korea Fair Trade Commission fined Qualcomm more than $850 million for allegedly abusing its market power in the way it licenses patents. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also filed a lawsuit, and Apple launched its legal action shortly afterward. Qualcomm denies the allegations. It has countersued Apple, appealed the South Korea fine and is seeking dismissal of the FTC case on the grounds that it fails to show how Qualcomm licensing practices harmed the smartphone market. Analysts are unclear what might happen next. Rasgon, the Bernstein analyst, said there is a possibility that other smartphone firms could begin withholding royalty payments, too. “We know there is already an additional licensee dispute of $150 million in revenue per quarter, likely Samsung in our opinion, and the threat of contagion remains, especially with Apple now paying essentially nothing at all,” said Rasgon in a research note. Tim Arcuri, an analyst with Cowen & Co., said that Qualcomm’s next move “could be to retaliate on Apple via its contract manufacturers (with whom it has licensing deals) and try to get an injunction to literally halt the manufacturing of iPhones.” But two other analysts interviewed by the Union-Tribune think such a move is unlikely. They contend Apple would not have suspended royalty reimbursements unless it was confident that Qualcomm wouldn’t seek an injunction. Qualcomm announced the lower guidance before markets opened Friday. Investors shrugged off the news. The company’s shares ended trading up 53 cents at $53.74 on the Nasdaq exchange.

There’s already a ton of buzz surrounding Apple’s upcoming new iPhones, which will reportedly include three different models this time around. In addition to the completely redesigned iPhone 8, we’re also expecting Apple to launch updated iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models. Interestingly, the updated “S” iPhones this year may feature major hardware updates for the first time ever; Apple typically reuses its iPhone housings for “S” devices, but the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus may get new glass backs to facilitate wireless charging. Of course, no one really cares about the iPhone 7s or iPhone 7s Plus right now. That’s right, everyone’s attention is focused on the completely redesigned iPhone 8. Apple’s new design, however, is a hotly debated topic right now. Don't Miss: There’s one more reason I could never ditch my iPhone 7 Plus for a Galaxy S8 While nothing is confirmed at this point, it’s safe to say the iPhone 8 will in fact sport a new design. Solid sources with very good track records report that the new phone will feature 2.5D glass on the front and back, with a stainless steel mid-frame sandwiched between them. The front will feature a new OLED display with a vastly improved screen-to-body ratio, but things get a little hazy after that. We know with near certainty that, like Samsung, Apple will do away with the iPhone 8’s physical home button. According to some leaks, the next-gen iPhone will feature a fingerprint sensor that’s embedded beneath the screen. But other leaks suggest Apple will relocate the Touch ID fingerprint scanner to the back of the phone because it won’t be able to mass-produce enough iPhones with embedded sensors. A Touch ID scanner on the back of the phone would probably be easier to manufacture, which means Apple would likely have no problem launching the phone in September. The only drawback, of course, would be a massive step backward in terms of user experience. As we recently saw, everyone hates the iPhone 8 design with the fingerprint scanner on the back. The more desirable scenario that has been suggested by leakers is that Apple will indeed embed the Touch ID sensor beneath the iPhone 8’s display, but it will delay the phone’s release until October or possibly November as it works through manufacturing issues. Having to wait an extra month or two would certainly annoy eager Apple fans, but it’s still probably a better option than an iPhone with the fingerprint scanner on the back. Today, a new leak from a reliable source may bring good news. Twitter user KK Sneak Leaks has several genuine leaks under his belt, and on Friday he posted a new photo of a third-party iPhone 8 case. As you can clearly see, there is no opening on this case for a rear-facing fingerprint reader. While there’s nothing to say that the design of this case accurately depicts Apple’s iPhone 8, this particular Twitter user has well-connected sources. As such, it’s entirely possible that we’re looking at Apple’s final iPhone 8 design. It’ll be a while before anything is confirmed, but this new leak could definitely be good news.

Business Technology Apple blocks more patent payments to Qualcomm, escalating feud Qualcomm has reduced its third quarter financial outlook after learning Apple will withhold patent royalty payment until a legal dispute is resolved. Reuters Qualcomm has reduced its third quarter financial outlook after learning Apple will withhold patent royalty payment until a legal dispute between the two companies is resolved. Qualcomm has reduced its third quarter financial outlook after learning Apple will withhold patent royalty payment until a legal dispute between the two companies is resolved. (Reuters) Mike FreemanContact Reporter Qualcomm slashed it financial forecast for the current quarter early Friday, blaming Apple for further withholding patent royalties payments in a fierce legal fight over intellectual property licensing. The lower revenue and profit outlook, which Qualcomm hinted at last week when it reported March quarter earnings, highlights the rising stakes in the rocky relationship between the two tech giants that shows no sign of improving. Qualcomm expects revenue of $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion for its fiscal third quarter ending June 30. Earnings are pegged at 52 cents to 62 cents per share under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. For the same quarter last year, Qualcomm posted $6 billion in revenue and GAAP earnings of 97 cents per share. In January, Apple sued Qualcomm, saying it forces smartphone makers to pay too much for use of its 3G/4G standard essential patents, which are required to be licensed under “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” terms. Qualcomm counters that its royalty rates, which top out at roughly 5 percent of the device price, have been negotiated through hundreds of agreements spanning two decades. According to Qualcomm, its licensing business model allowed Apple to enter the smartphone market with little or no investment in core cellular technology. While 3G/4G patent licenses make up about one-third of Qualcomm’s annual revenue, they account for most of its annual profit. Apple is the world’s largest seller of smartphones. In a recent research report, Bernstein Research Analyst Stacy Rasgon estimated that Apple could account for as much as one-third of Qualcomm’s royalty business, or more than $2 billion a year. Apple doesn’t directly license patents from Qualcomm. Instead, Foxconn and other contract manufacturers that build iPhones and iPads have license agreements. Apple reimburses them for royalties. Last quarter, Apple withheld some Qualcomm royalty reimbursements to contract manufacturers, but only up to $1 billion. That’s equal to royalty “rebates” that Apple contends it’s owed by Qualcomm under a separate business cooperation deal. When it reported March quarter earnings, Qualcomm wasn’t sure Apple would block reimbursements beyond the $1 billion amount. But now Qualcomm says Apple indicated that it will continue withholding reimbursements until the legal war between the two companies is resolved. As a result, Qualcomm’s new financial guidance assumes no royalty payments from iPhone/iPad contract manufacturers in the quarter. “Apple is improperly interfering with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm’s licensees,” said General Counsel Don Rosenberg in a statement. “Apple’s continued interference with Qualcomm’s agreements to which Apple is not a party is wrongful and the latest step in Apple’s global attack on Qualcomm.” In a statement, Apple called Qualcomm’s royalty rates unreasonable. “We’ve been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years, but they have refused to negotiate fair terms,” the company said. “Without an agreed upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court.” Qualcomm’s patent licensing business has come under fire worldwide, and the company believes it was instigated by Apple and others. Last fall, the Korea Fair Trade Commission fined Qualcomm more than $850 million for allegedly abusing its market power in the way it licenses patents. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also filed a lawsuit, and Apple launched its legal action shortly afterward. Qualcomm denies the allegations. It has countersued Apple, appealed the South Korea fine and is seeking dismissal of the FTC case on the grounds that it fails to show how Qualcomm licensing practices harmed the smartphone market. Analysts are unclear what might happen next. Rasgon, the Bernstein analyst, said there is a possibility that other smartphone firms could begin withholding royalty payments, too. “We know there is already an additional licensee dispute of $150 million in revenue per quarter, likely Samsung in our opinion, and the threat of contagion remains, especially with Apple now paying essentially nothing at all,” said Rasgon in a research note. Tim Arcuri, an analyst with Cowen & Co., said that Qualcomm’s next move “could be to retaliate on Apple via its contract manufacturers (with whom it has licensing deals) and try to get an injunction to literally halt the manufacturing of iPhones.” But two other analysts interviewed by the Union-Tribune think such a move is unlikely. They contend Apple would not have suspended royalty reimbursements unless it was confident that Qualcomm wouldn’t seek an injunction. Qualcomm announced the lower guidance before markets opened Friday. Investors shrugged off the news. The company’s shares ended trading up 53 cents at $53.74 on the Nasdaq exchange.

This is according to analyst firm IDC and its quarterly mobile report released today April 28. Samsung regained its position as number one in the world dethroning Apple, taking 22.8 per cent, while the a American firm recorded 14.9 per cent. However, compared to last year both companies saw market share losses, Samsung had 23.8 per cent and Apple 15.4 per cent market share. The Korean manufacturer may be back on top but it saw flat growth. Apple’s placement in second saw it ship 51.6 million, compared to 51.2 million in Q1 2016. Land of the rising sun Chinese vendors Huawei, Oppo and Vivo saw market share rises. Huawei almost hit double figures with 9.8 per cent from 8.4 per cent in the same quarter last year. With the P10 and P10 Plus releasing soon he figure could rise, but it faces competition from rivals such as Samsung who released the S8 today (April 28). Oppo took 7.4 per cent market share, up from 5.9 per cent shipping 25.6 million units. Vivo recorded 5.2 per cent market share, rising from 4.4 per cent and shifting 18.1 million smartphones. Oppo and Vivo occupied fourth and fifth last year forcing Lenovo and Xiaomi out of the top five. Growth still exists IDC program vice president Ryan Reith said: “The first quarter smartphone results further prove that the smartphone industry is not dead and that growth still exists. “There is no question that 2016 was a pivotal year for the industry as growth dipped to low single digits for the first time. However, we believe the industry will show some rebound in 2017, and the strong first quarter results certainly support this argument.” TAGS Apple Huawei IDC OPPO Q1 Samsung Vivo report SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleSamsung Galaxy S8 hits UK stores Manny Pham RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Samsung Galaxy S8 hits UK stores LG G6 available across all major networks MPD: The re-release of Nokia 3310 looks set to be worth all of the hype NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply The leading news source for the mobile communications industry 8-10 Godson Street Islington London N1 9GZ Editorial Team Telephone: 020 7278 0795 Email: editorial@mobilenewscwp.co.uk Advertising Kimberley Glover - 020 3122 0871 Stephen Watson - 020 3122 0872 POPULAR POSTS Reaction: Can Huawei really overtake Apple and Samsung?

Tensions were cranked up to eleven back in January, when Apple accused Qualcomm of forcing unfair licensing fees onto it. Suing the company, it accused it of having “unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with.” “Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards,” Apple’s claims continued, “Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.” According to the allegations, there’s more to it than just profits in mind, too. Apple alleges that Qualcomm withheld $1bn in payments in retaliation for the Cupertino company cooperating with law enforcement in an investigation into the chip manufacturer that ended up costing it $835m in fines. Qualcomm fired back a few months later, arguing that in fact Apple was trying to misrepresent its business and the performance of Qualcomm’s LTE modems. Tensions between the two firms have escalated, and now Qualcomm says that Apple is interfering with its patent licensing process with other licensees. In a statement today, the firm said it had been notified that Apple would be “withholding payments to its contract manufacturers for the royalties those contract manufacturers owe under their licenses with Qualcomm for sales during the quarter ended March 31, 2017.” The policy will, Apple informed Qualcomm, continue until the legal dispute has been resolved. Unsurprisingly, Qualcomm isn’t happy. “While Apple has acknowledged that payment is owed for the use of Qualcomm’s valuable intellectual property, it nevertheless continues to interfere with our contracts,” Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, said today. “Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade.” Though Qualcomm says it plans to fight back, it’s nonetheless warning investors that this newest phase of the battle will have a potentially huge impact on the next financial quarter. Before now, it had estimated revenues of between $5.3bn and $6.1bn for Q3 of the 2017 financial year, which would work out somewhere in the range of a 12-percent decrease to a 1-percent increase, year-on-year. With royalty revenues from Apple’s contract manufacturers excluded, though, the outlook is a lot more grim. Indeed, Qualcomm is predicting a $4.8bn to $5.6bn range, which means a decrease of between 7- and 21-percent year-on-year. Although some contract manufacturers may make some payments, it’s expected to be “insignificant” compared to what Qualcomm was expecting. The situation might be even more dire, in fact; the company warns that it hasn’t included the impact of possible “future asset impairments or for pending legal matters, other than future legal amounts that are probable and estimable.” Story Timeline Qualcomm fined $853M in South Korea for unfair practices The FTC just sued Qualcomm for being anti-competitive Apple files 2 suits VS Qualcomm in Beijing, Qualcomm responds Qualcomm to refund BlackBerry $815 million in patent royalties Tags AppleBusinesslegalpatentQualcomm Must Read Bits & Bytes Google’s Android updates policy needs a big makeover New Nintendo 2DS XL: Five things to know Uber’s self-driving expert off project amid Waymo lawsuit BlackBerry KEYone release date and pre-order details revealed Why Google Pixel 2 might come early Latest Headlines Merriam-Webster’s ‘sheeple’ definition uses Apple fanboys example Apr 28, 2017 Galaxy J3 Prime arrives at T-Mobile: 5″ HD display, 5MP camera, Nougat Apr 28, 2017 Samsung Galaxy S8 bug causes phone to keep restarting Apr 28, 2017 NASA showcases inflatable greenhouse for future Mars astronauts Apr 28, 2017 T-Mobile tipped to launch its own ‘value based’ phone with high-end features Apr 28, 2017 Latest Reviews Synology RT2600ac Router Review Apr 28, 2017 2017 Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 Review: Uncompromising track star Apr 26, 2017 Rigiet handheld stabilizer review Apr 26, 2017 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV Review: Electric all-rounder Apr 24, 2017 2017 Ford Flex Limited Review: Twin-turbo road trip king continues to deliver Apr 20, 2017 Search © 2005-2016 SlashGear, All Rights Reserved.

(AAPL) iPhone Sales Fall Flat, China’s Huawei Grabs Market Share Apple and Samsung smartphone sales are stagnating, while Chinese manufacturers surge By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 28, 2017, 9:33 am EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     View All   Popular Posts: Apple Inc.

(AAPL) Could Kill Venmo With Money Transfer Service “Apple Cash” Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Wants to Dress You With Echo Look View All Posts IDC’s Q1 2017 smartphone sales numbers are out. It shows an unexpected growth in global smartphone demand, but the top two manufacturers were left out. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw just a minor bump in iPhone sales compared to last year, while Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) was completely flat. However, Chinese smartphone manufacturers were on a tear, led by Huawei, which continues to gain ground on AAPL. Source: Huawei According to IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker data, the global appetite for smartphones rose 4.3% in Q1 2017. That’s stronger growth than expected in a market that has largely matured. And that growth is not being driven by the two top players. Apple iPhone Sales Underperform the Market AAPL’s iPhone sales were nearly flat, up just 400,000 units compared to Q1 2016, totaling under 1% growth. IDC says that number was helped by pent up demand for the iPhone 7 Plus (which had seen stock shortages after its launch), a refreshed iPhone SE and the special edition (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7. Samsung saw no increase in smartphones sales, but is back on top with 22.8% of the market. That performance was predictable, given the hit the company took over the Galaxy Note 7. Huawei: Chinese Smartphone Makers Are On a Tear The big story was the double-digit growth of Chinese smartphone manufacturers. Third place Huawei posted 21.7% year-over-year growth, OPPO was up 29.8% and vivo’s smartphone sales increased by 23.6%. Those numbers, combined with zero growth by Samsung, put Huawei’s third-place marketshare at 9.8%, inching closer to AAPL’s 14.9% second place. IDC points out that the trio of Chinese smartphone makers continue to dominate the Chinese market, but that they are continuing to expand into other Asian, Middle Eastern and African countries. They also have a presence in Europe, but have yet to crack the U.S. in a meaningful way. The Real Battle Is Coming Huawei has big ambitions. In February, company executives speaking to Fortune said: “We are going to take [Apple] step by step, innovation by innovation,” while predicting they would surpass iPhone sales in 2018. The goal is to topple Samsung from its number one position by 2021. Huawei’s smartphones are seen as premium quality devices, able to withstand direct comparison to flagships from Samsung and Apple. And the company is determined to crack the U.S. market, where the real profit margins — through sales of those premium smartphones — are waiting.

The indication the company is working on the system will raise hopes that the end of having to physically plug a cable into a mobile device in order to charge it could be around the corner.   The filing reveals Apple is looking at ways to re-power its devices using mobile, Wi-Fi and millimetre wave signals. It proposes directing the electromagnetic frequencies, normally used for data transmission, towards device as a "beam" of energy.  Long-range wireless charging isn't a new concept and Apple has been working on different ways to achieve it for a number of years. It first filed a patent for a way to wirelessly recharge an iMac at a distance of one metre back in 2010. Wireless charging Last year, Bloomberg reported that the company was working with partners to develop the system for mobile devices. It said it could be introduced to the iPhone as early as 2017.  While the patent filing is the greatest hint yet that Apple is working on the technology, it only covers the theory behind the method rather than an actual way to do it.  Rumours suggest that Apple is planning to introduce wireless charging to the iPhone for the first time this year in time for its ten year anniversary. Adding weight to reports, the company joined an industry group called the Wireless Power Consortium in February.   However, the method of wireless charging that Apple could use is still unclear. It had been claimed that the iPhone would not feature the short-range "inductive" wireless charging used on the Watch and rival phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S8. Instead, Apple was said to be waiting to introduce wireless charging on the handsets only when it had developed a long-range system. But the recent patent appears to be too early stage. Apple patented a separate "inductive charging station" concept for the iPhone last Autumn, paving the way for short-range wireless charging on the iPhone 8. The upcoming handset is rumoured to come with a glass case that could support the feature.  What will the iPhone 8 look like?

Kelly's 'Trapped in The Closet' Sequel Coming to Apple Music? 4/28/2017 by Carl Lamarre FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Noam Galai/Getty Images R. Kelly performs at Kings Theatre on Dec. 17, 2016 in New York City.   R. Kelly might be dusting off his robust series "Trapped in the Closet" for Apple Music.  According to Bloomberg Businessweek, Apple Music chairman and CEO Jimmy Iovine is looking to add a sequel to the famed series. Iovine has reportedly spoken to Warner Bros. Television and is working diligently on making his dream a reality. For the streaming conglomerate, the addition of Kelly's R&B opera will help bolster their video content.  "A music service needs to be more than a bunch of songs and a few playlists," says Iovine. "I’m trying to help Apple Music be an overall movement in popular culture, everything from unsigned bands to video. We have a lot of plans. We have the freedom, because it’s Apple, to make one show, three shows, see what works, see what doesn’t work until it feels good."  Last year, Kelly teased avid fans in an interview with the Atlanta-Journal Constitution, revealing that he had an extra 35 chapters locked away in the closet. "I have my R&B hip-hop album -- I haven’t named it yet, and "Trapped in the Closet," I have 35 more chapters of that done," he said. "I’m very excited about that. It will absolutely be out next year. I’ll tour if it’s a major deal, but if not I might just chill and just finish writing my movie scripts." In 2013, IFC ran a marathon of the entire series.  Billboard has reached out to reps for R. Kelly and Apple Music for comment.  FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Comments Magazine Customer Service Subscribe Buy this issue Billboard biz The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Qualcomm Lowers Q3 Fiscal 2017 Guidance due to Apple Holding back Royalty Payments | Main | Apple Provides Feedback on Proposed Autonomous Vehicle Testing to California's DMV Deputy Director » April 28, 2017 Smartphone data for Q1 2017 shows that the big Story is the Stunning growth from Oppo, Huawei and Vivo Earlier this month Patently Apple posted a report titled "Samsung Tops Smartphone Shipments Chart in Q1 due to Flooding the Market with Massive Low-End Model Shipments." While TrendForce was first out of the gate with smartphone data for Q1 2017, we always like to cover IDC's reports for the record. Today, according to preliminary results from IDC, smartphone companies shipped a total of 347.4 million smartphones worldwide in the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17). In light of what might seem like a slowing market, consumers continue to show demand for smartphones and OEM flagship hype seems as strong as ever. Worldwide smartphone shipments grew 4.3% in 1Q17, which was slightly higher than IDC's previous forecast of 3.6% growth.   According to IDC, "Apple remained essentially flat with shipments reaching 51.6 million units in the first quarter, up slightly from the 51.2 million shipped last year. The strong holiday fourth quarter carried into the month of January as the larger iPhone 7 Plus returned to stock across most channels in numerous regions. Apple introduced a refreshed iPhone SE with more storage capacity (32GB and 128GB) that puts the mid-tier device in line with the rest of the iPhone portfolio. The Cupertino-based giant also refreshed its flagship smartphone by bringing (Product)Red over to the iPhone which paints both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in a new red finish. Finally, rumors of a special edition 10th anniversary iPhone continue to grow as a pending new design, screen size, and performance upgrades all look to be in the works for the fall."   The report further noted that "Samsung regained control as the leader in the worldwide smartphone market despite a flat first quarter (0% year-over-year growth). Substantial discounts on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge helped move last year's flagships as they make way for the new S8 and S8+. Outside of the high end, the product mix continues to shift toward more affordable models. The J-Series and A-Series drove significant volumes in both emerging and developed markets thanks to flagship-like design at more affordable price points. A refreshed A7, A5, and A3 earlier this quarter, along with a recently updated J-Series, and new flagship S8/S8+ should give Samsung a well-balanced portfolio across all regions in the second quarter. An early positive response to the recently launched S8 and S8+ looks promising as it may have finally put Samsung's Note 7 fiasco to bed."   In February Patently Apple posted a report titled "Local Chinese Smartphone Brands Kick Apple to fourth Spot in Q4 and it'll be Tough for Apple to Reverse." Yesterday we followed up with a report titled "For Q1 2017, Apple Remains Stuck in Fourth Place in China's Smartphone Market." The big three smartphone vendors in China, Huawei, Oppo and Vivo are now rapidly rising in the global race.   IDC's chart shows us that only the big three in China showed tremendous growth year-over-year with Oppo at 29.8%, Vivo at 23.6% and Huawei at 21.7%. In contrast Samsung broke even and Apple grew 0.8%. Ouch!   Huawei entered the U.S. market in January and we'll have to see how this will help Huawei's growth for all of 2017. Apple may be able to hold onto second place this year with a strong line-up of iPhones for Q4. They'd likely do better if they make the iPhone SE a little more competitive by adding a 5" display like 99% of their competitors are selling these days in their mid-tier and low-end models.   But in the end, the story is really about the big three Chinese vendors growth and how they may roll over today's leaders in the not too-distant-feature. All of this quarter's smartphone growth came from China's big three vendors leaving Apple and Samsung close to registering growth losses. In unit numbers Apple is still in second place with a sizeable lead over Huawei. But it's the Year over Year growth stats that are threatening. Apple at 0.8% vs. Huawei at 21.7%   Apple's move into Augmented Reality and new form factors may be able to keep the iPhone in the race if not in the top five for years to come. But they better hurry because the growth rates from these Chinese vendors are collectively becoming a tidal wave that may be too strong to stop.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

autoevolution cars moto news car reviews spyshots driven cars newspaper green Compare Cars BAC Calculator   Editorial Coverstory Motorsport Testdrives archive Auto Shows Tuning Car Finder Photo of the Day Glossary of automotive terms Masthead RSS Feeds Apple's Self-Driving Lexus RX450h Spotted In Traffic With Aftermarket Gear   28 Apr 2017, 12:50 UTC · by Sebastian Toma / Home / News / Car Profile Apple got the DMV’s permission to test self-driving vehicles on public roads about two weeks ago. It did not take long for the Cupertino giant’s fleet to get spotted on the street. Fortunately for us, journalists saw it, and the Lexus RX450h was carefully observed in slow moving traffic. As you can see in the photo from Bloomberg, whose editors saw this SUV leave a facility that belongs to the American tech giant, the Japanese model was equipped with many aftermarket sensors. The mentioned devices were applied to the body as sleek as one could, whenever possible, but this is clearly an example of function over form. Please remember that this is an early prototype of a self-driving car, and nobody expects the finished product to have all of those sensors out in the open. It is evident that no government authority would allow cars with a bar full of tools on their front end potentially jeopardize the safety of pedestrians. Furthermore, nobody would buy a vehicle that looks like this, with all of the sensors out in the open. Similar prototypes were employed by Google when it tested its fleet of Lexus and Toyota hybrids. If you are curious about an inventory of the additional equipment fitted to this SUV, it appears that Apple went for the top-of-the-line LIDAR from Velodyne, which works on 64 channels. It also has at least two radar sensors, along with several cameras. All of the products were so easy to identify because they were off-the-shelf parts, an unnamed industry expert told Bloomberg. The state of California has let 30 companies test self-driving vehicles on its public roads, and legislation is in work to allow the sale and use of this technology when it is ready for consumers. Until then, these are prototypes with experienced people behind the wheel who are prepared to take control in case something goes wrong. apple car Apple self-driving cars autonomous vehicle project titan Lexus SUV   The End of Sedans is Nigh!

Yes making out to me maybe that's a good pace may use the word gay here but making up to me is more intimate in the actual deaths could work act itself would you say yet another some hookers. Making up yet yes that and I think that there aren't particularly well there there's the work issues. Never management and everything containment if they are right you kissed a guy if you stumble. On them wrath the only other. Yeah I guess I think anything mile police and since we're council he transition that if I don't listen I'm about it I listened to the podcast with Roemer I was good I like Barkley two outs or about. Oral single to a floor. Look out to a two outs it was excellent out of the original name which actually was pitchers and catchers the ones now. You know like that's a baseball and today that we'd like little nuance into us is really really it was excellent and buck. Didn't know what he's doing the time did that they eat he did provide healthy test promotion. That any new podcast in the stations overhead when he said Bill Simmons outed him almost tried forced. In two albums to promote himself. Russell Simmons was writing from his Boston sports guy column for digital city park hills and has yet. And other Roy talked about this before but that the bill during that period made several references to my sexual orientation and what do you mean by that. All the counties as with all bottled up O'Donnell got remiss voices on knowing when he's on student and another podcast academy he dreamers voice. If he was goodness that were in revelry is a bad rap is so comfortable in his own skin out of the other day auriemma tried like host the show it was just that didn't seem genuine. It's really still be sorry for hours as people wanna know what Simmons did the buckle tumbled to is that you don't build the media stars movie and you Simmons and Buckley. Okay he. Made several references my sexual orientation and what do you mean by that polish woman who popular sports writer in Provincetown weak link. Who wasn't like I did Vegas which I wrote a column in the way people can turn around and say. What do you during a column saying gay because this well I wanted to control story I wanted to be OK look I'm gay. And I don't wanna move on and just that that's part of why am and I wanted to prevent the next Bill Simmons from trying to help me so this way I dealt with that. And I moved on other sports guys forced buck out of the claws on the news or should read a match outright and that USA today again. Yeah that was a weird out of the guy and here's a day. Notice about this might fear this podcast is going to be ups and downs to retirement but now extreme discount on I read Hartnell read about deflation story you mean he's not an hour Roemer is you'll see protege Woolsey we will cycle I look forward to it though I was in every week and this whole thing was good. And and and again the ball very. The reason works is that both very content. They're both comfortable around scan the ball think dean is a lot more on the green and did you get that right to planets are closed transition I don't know. Or instinct really well Aaron Hernandez in jail thank you on the show Q are there. Sausage things show killer fraud. You don't think you'd be better they had only a third man it was confused about his sexuality wasn't quite sure exactly how it was would you you volunteer and I was saying inadequate and he said he wanted to and as if every candidate came out of nowhere else would you say they're 35 year old single confirmed that an honorary bachelor angry. Angry textures and tweeters and -- just really about you because those bad career move market and probably about it save you would never got a B and it shall be the ridiculously what's the ace and candy duo debut against gay duo you know. You know like Roemer. Like yeah that's why I do extreme right or Hillary were in New Hampshire and meticulous disease because we elect them and Kirk Watson and -- the time you wanna you wanna and shop how we need to remember I'm going what I want and all the time. We talked about it a week in my I want Watson I am looking for us we hear like I had a gross. I wanna meet pro and you won't Jew or eight feet right what do you want us you know like you know one trying to because chick. One month I want my little hairy and that. Was beat rip in yesterday's bomb killing real life why I've known that it was important don't have a personal two was uncomfortable with what you want me. That you can tell him throw at this thing and however they say I gotta stop texting every. He was encouraging guys not this government today but don't break music Christian arcade tomorrow really. Why hasn't really were both like sure why beat you on six nights away first of all he only has no desire. Opposite Al. Our kids say what you want like around like I always get as it finish he's right and works Mort rightly considered as a you know he's their thereof it's actually true right gets on the hours are you week if you if they're the Red Sox are playing if there are race axis point EU three here and if these airline ownership by forty hours forty hours of the week his work since New Year's Day that's more radio than me you'll do with 2007 and he doesn't care he's solid now contentious. He said he probably inherited some though he's happy yes he's human arena league football games. That by play whatever else what else is doing well sponsors something. PC in the spring and does that thing where it goes to that. Placement of the Japanese Baseball games. I was on the Stanford out of Africa that I'd take it back he's the go getter is where he could care but I love them party. Everybody can you do this you do especially art and art show are you due to what he wanted to make one up iTunes is their way out no bush were crushed but you did more involved here with Christian market. Even one minute and I want anything to stabilize its that no there supposed to supposed to do what donut guy. Draft talk not a brash talk and shutter the draft usually have to correct everybody Chris starts are must watch TV than just the opposite these. Watch Chris Sale in the flip over the top was much better woes Israel's stock while strike threats such it was the lifeless and and boring and it felt like over like to brief edit all of it was good to get it over with the market for sale I all the years you know like these you'd think that's when I yam and maybe that's a good theories any. You know why then hit for this one in the have a small sample size would you say what you want you are seeing before. Teams all with a heart it races really. Yes they prefer that yes Pedro sort of Roger that it stretches where you don't it what it is is you exhausts are usually don't have for the fourth start now it's worse for aces of any proof that yes I do Wear which is fine I found a lot of people say it's like the old golf ball focus baseball adjudicate on all due respect and I don't quite a job soon a baseball respond piece of it hit for the east and don't elect delegates estimate if the east and they don't get toward. Subliminal thing. Some attention here as he proved that statistic at the other a suspicion for the other team that's why it's not White House as a Christian god don't say it's probably pocket after opening they don't hit as always the other race is pay by the usual yes the five wise I don't gorgeous and I wonder how wet one rain out one day off and that's all right it changes everything you don't. Match up your ace against theories we think it's the right a couple of the captains sit down and match up guys on what works is headed down to save that for a Fargo street. We'll do I. Basis that's that the reason happens is that subconsciously. Disobeying the be better explanation I don't think I've I've I've written about this of talk to players aren't written about it. Yes I don't want to play protective baseball. All play a lot earlier this I heard the Maloney played in the major leagues I know you. He played the big leagues talk about this yesterday subconsciously. You don't think you have to score how did as well as subconsciously. And this to kind of helps me know that subconscious. We mean no question that caught deceiving no. How do you know which subconsciously. Or who found out it's also can't understate what a doctor and what my doctor I discovered they nose on the mound doctor Marty Barrett yet who over the years doctor doctor Trot Nixon. Because I don't shoot. I did it I don't think it's done all they were just a little bit off. It's small sample size it's not a small sample size just like Freddie how I start and would Pedro and play and Roger lambs it happened with applauded it was a third starter and he called facts or start it happens with Felix Hernandez all the time that can all get paid attention it is not quite that what do you what do that with Roger Cohen in open in nineteen sets and 91 that's you know like it just all samples I've. And we get all the dumb old baseball best look at all the good clemens' numbers it was 4439. Didian Gutierrez I didn't produce form. And the but but Malone spears probably better is that they press. That they said we've got to score from as we didn't last time it just snowballs and they continue. To feel the pressure to produce for him and they tried to guard to produce that might have been what happened last night. It could be next restarts the score twenty runs for maybe one event that's corporate office. Department had eleven home runs the page and number one I want him but he did not he's hurt is it tied they tied the names and Red Sox. With eleven yes the Milwaukee Brewers have forty. The Red Sox have eleven. That's weird are co workers are too small sample is yes this time a year too small sample there have to wait them want. Valero a missing K let's get to the draft and some regardless of where it was the last year's figure reform which pictures of the most on support baseball it's not accurate to say rip ourselves out of curiosity I would say Austria. Refiner Chris we're gonna guess who is we have to get to. You'd think that the patriots are not trading I'm not ever. I think that trading them I was gonna say the exact same thing I'm more convinced than ever. Belichick once pointed straight at their goal to trade him Belichick once again has played brilliantly placed. When we talked about this two months ago hurt when we talk we talked about. By the way I went to offer. He is is probably glad they laid him off he couldn't have been more wrong members and they were gonna get a first round pick which put buffalo right now as we sit here. The price starts at two who. First round picks Jimmy grapple. And it just so happens that the Cleveland Browns have 21 round picks next year and three seconds leaving Gruntal and this year the patriots now he's got to the gonna portray history picks before the draft or trade him nick for next is 21 round is where and none of them. One of next few stupid intentional saying they Q Dmitry when it when it equally to trade betrayed him a June June -- Asian injury tonight or perhaps going on moving picks in the as grappled with a plate you're going to trade now they're gonna trade him this year after the draft. Why is that legal against the rules to legal way to address over and and trade him for patient actually answer because the oil and he's largest Cuban team next year. Because that you'd. If you wanted to basically hear when you don't have any revert to check around six what sort of explain what's stupid. Because he's gonna play for Cleveland in 2007 table while the page present rather have this guy for this year and trade. Talk about the Cleveland Papa. I asked I would draft but did you watch the draft legislative do you agree with me that was good in the Ritz Hotel also say this people and those of the the anti Twitter take. Our Chris Berman sucks a lot of things but he's good in the -- I missed sperm and usually when the subject I'm travelling dog track when it was wet blanket that got re hydrated opponent like the rest I hate is a bore hate to agree. That was one of the things that Berman did well he brought a sense the only proud impacts. Now there were things that he did you said that shall matters because fuhrman's on a home run derby or not that's not thanks empathetic as a matter and all that it won't highlights he's good at this is good football highlight shows. And you're right I'm actually mr. Berman you looked. Do you watch I don't have any interest in watching them on Sanders no none zero as in no time I saw some of them on June. Aidid now none. I was strictly because it was posted an ESPN and trembling like a great tees were at the beginning in the first it was after the first Texas we gonna have no commercials for the next our revenue that was a great team which you do want to the national council on all comers just I don't and I also don't like when it. This thing now they we we all know they know who get paid that he and a smarts and a what do you think here whatever whoever gruden he's like that Michael wide receiver a year in the medical examiner when we get we and it was a very exciting first round even at the home town team wasn't wall. The Cleveland Browns. Senate all ops of today. Or maybe today maybe tomorrow maybe a month from. But the fix that in the trade forum are next year is absolutely not and I trading why would they want it this year Jerry when they don't have any in the first two rounds while when they traded for picks this year on the top U. Can you imagine you get Cleveland's first round pick. This year. Now next year why touchdowns Viagra has been made I know it's all wireless entry in the same class and I what did you trade Centre right side because the price of quarterbacking went up Cleveland stockpiled so they could meet you guys yeah look at this way to value is so obvious now for quarterbacks that Belichick says I've won whose great. Who's younger. And I don't wanna get rid of them I think Russell is great yes I think at this point the script as it does do you think he's such ratings are out there for the set while he supports. For 41 round picks and obviously Belichick thinks this guy is great I'm always going oh you don't you think. Belichick would say no of Cleveland from war first complex now because that's about three. Noted prodigy a K two and LT and helped through first rattled if you do it by the way. One of them could be Sam Arnold I think you'd think apple is the quarterback of the future you know with the club drop lowers he's already got three years under his belt which she didn't play. He's a year away from getting franchised or becoming free so Belichick might Sam Donald they draft them and. For five years just might think that grapples better for this team and he might he might actually probably don't you just admission that he knows how you end this year if Brady gets hurt the possibility or misses time which is a possibility. You have a guy you can go to the Super Bowl with if Jimmy grapples quarterback of the patriots right now Brady retires or moves on to life with huge Robinson he'd know. Well I should that tell it we will which is another which is another troubling thing if you're part of a team Brady. You know our. When you are shore. Jimmy grapple right now would be the favorite in the pages to win the AFC you just had direct would you David disagree without problems. You just admitted that there is a price that is a price of politics and it's not like a price for everybody's praise for Brady is right right of the surprise for and everybody will there is a price for Tom Brady is their price for a Clayton Kershaw yes of course I was there is certain areas that they call and that they have a posting an offer. Another is surprised LeBron James. Enough probably an unclear who knows there's no conversation for couple guys but that's beside the point there is a prize for Barack below that. For once and it wouldn't trade at and TCU don't believe that. No but I don't believe any bit of rough from four number ones who doesn't hey they just acquired another number one they're number one of Texans and their own action I don't think I think it was a great trade for Houston and in touch on what's the best quarterback in the draft I can't imagine him enough that you watch on film clip. I watched him play in the biggest games might be much and he has great watching these other us he went 32 and three I understand which major procedure is key player ever know conceived play play thirteen games. But of sanctions that the bears from trading for Patrick yet my homes went five and send them last year and as mom died Arab. I've shuffled into that to Pakistan were allowed to get tonight but first I thought it was a great. But the second pick happened became great fascinating agency Gerri tell them bears such idiots honest ago you know for op I mean some of these guys it depends on where they go. If the Shawn Watson with things going to be great when the Cleveland. I'd say he's gonna fail right. It was a puppy was this close to go to Cleveland no doubt he got lucky that's what it looked so happy because he went to Houston. That's a perfect spot that's where one of the goat that's wearing when he just saved the O'Brien's job when he's from and second ticked about that fourteenth or fifteenth pick when he went nine or eight and nine guys had twelve were either running backs quarterbacks wide receiver that was good note that was awesome want to watch lots of skill position guys white running back this guy a guy who who was accused of rape in a local woman a couple weeks ago in Ashland to guess where the Oakland Raiders I mean that Vegas rate paid to traders yes peppers with the drug test detector or security always Cleveland. Athletic great. Raft if they can flip that for Gruntal analyst Gazprom and kids on stage and Miguel guy at the crazy guy and his grandmother's picture who was that. I missed that who who's he with now. Two. We got to play his sound. Now little note that was an odd moment I would say it is grandmother's picture and he promised to earnings and play in the NFL and now we ease. But writes obviously doing his own music the thing did. The price to fix the price of quarterbacking went up in a remote there I don't question the price from homes and in Indy reasons no fool. Is cable pay first and third correct yes and each have a group of the first and second to move up one spot. Right yes. Which means the price of corn Beckham went up which means the price grapple away. Is that that number mean you think there's a number that that at which point Belichick pulled the trigger what is the bears think was going to go to the second spot to take him. Well I think what you don't think that Fazio designer take that that I have the could use a quarterback may take one. Amount but they fooled them a wrist is a great day for Atlanta for time lynch. There really atlas or maybe Rodman's another team must be stricken concussion Jews to grows at work. It was a great day for the niners are absolutely they're I think against Stanford as it wants as you know it's necessary for us three that's true it's because the whole thing. But well that's funny or more commits an effort to grapple not be treated essentially one valued Chrysler back are you having a valuable one and that shows that the most important position and you supported by far. Prejudice today tomorrow month from now. We hear that they've finally pull the trigger and again two firsts. And two seconds to voters he could take coach offered to reverse this point for Guatemala which of course he has one of which could be. The first tactically right yeah he Cleveland Browns. The Cleveland Browns team that the first pick last night. Next year you think the browns who have a lot of talk of course Apple's lead tuck and top five pick. And another picked the Houston panic and then a second or third coaching thing talking like four picks. I'm talent and they're waiting until now to make this offer that inmate on guys get on Friday they only did they offer to check wisely sent it out from knowing this would happen to for ship for grapple. One of which is Cleveland's yes I do we'll do that the first pick in the draft no but I gap of twelve K well next year he might be able to get the first. Pick as a grass act and they're not. Across advocate and how much like Brady cry apple is staying here Belichick is made that's stupid that's clear passage crap Natalie with the picture watched right now little footnote. What's that falcons falcons he's made his loser Belichick is made up his mind when Brady is dominant this year and did you just say one journalist. And don't Democrat he's the one realist he knows how old Brady is he knows and ends it's going to and fast. If he has the guys in line what's a good idea. No no no that's to be doing great so we'll address it did you that you get a quarterback and they don't like as opposed to describe we always agreed the Belichick as thinks long term and he doesn't panic exactly why is grapple yes and you tell -- he could trip straight a backup quarterback who won't play as that they wanted to back I really he doesn't think of as a backup quarterback what's he gonna start at wide -- nobody knows a year or two weeks how would you start and he's a really good vote yea I here in a year to I turbulent right now I don't know checkered grapple brothel alt crop is going to be either freeagent the end you don't branch franchise guy and paid twenty million to get a kick out purchased 42 minutes and got two number ones this guy that's a conventional vehicle until a special they -- they haven't turned out to know more is Mike Garrett to their attitude I guarantee you there. I don't understand who's he talked so Clinton processor Cleveland Erica time for the twelve of the future number one Mary Kate habits and so that's right there. You know what. The price went up yesterday. So next year's who's gonna happen you're gonna get the the first round we know we've heard this year it's like in China could be the Olympic runner assuming an idiot Houston's first round pick probably 151820. In the a couple of seconds in the third and he's using now are gonna be able to read load. To the point where this team won't go away from it decade and one of them. My pick I'm include an out of my first pick in the draft this year. The opportunity here maybe they did you go after the patriots the first pick I don't know maybe they did my point 8% they offered to first why would they offer the first pick so setting off the first picnics in the pages anyway they did not do it this year is doing differently why did you turn it down this year because it economists say one more time bella tries to just the way it is aware that the price just went there to fix the price from the first overall pick to lead us over the price just went embrace. Which is a quiet Houston's first round pick Kristin did you did you notice that they did been averted a good first overall pick the first overall vision like a lot of talented tenor of some of the was wrong Jerry's been saying all along it's that we gonna happen explaining how things holdings last night we can we that we understand fully Jimmy probably won't watch the mills burger that that well we're contracted last night at 8 o'clock on you watching the sabres caps. I know that but in the weight at one moment and I think they played their alleged that yes right Alex social or try to do have some good number we had eight we do have some good news is that pertains to the and it's a place else we have to get that to not good news. Re really rates. Great news friends. I would mind going to some random funerals they don't have some grieving family members that the greatness to look yes we're gonna do right 617779. 7937. The question is simple it's key to to grapple portrait. I think they're gonna keep them Jerry basically trademark and keeper tree keep again that he's just suck and I'm not so I know Sarah Palin as some might show he knows you hate him. And he wants to be different Turkey anonymous is reduced traffic police say he had gotten asked that coach you said that the that. A DA testing at as about forty minutes I was 320. Minutes of predates. As it shed. Well yes. Sure do good I don't I find that there's nothing a nothing wrong with the first of all fourteen months. EE make an accidental way it's it's a brave new world here and some people we things out by accident was his issue was saying he's it was a password issue it's a bit of tact and of course when I was hesitant to kind of changed my passport and there was no big deal acts as a single to right. Has a girlfriend and now. I needed earlier I think is really sure what this says yeah. Poses Eisner hotel in Minneapolis at our at 617779. 790 threesome will take your calls election papers keep crop low or trade him if a lot of stuff to get on the draft up some Red Sox stuff as well. Some Celtics stuff involving Isiah Thomas. And Tom Brady is getting new friend Anthony Robbins Paul when he Robbins. About this eagle is a venture. I might feel I don't know we'll give you details of that owns sounds uplift your breakthrough awaits currently. Kirk Allen it's all dark I was spared you know 2580. Goats available we'll be right back. We're almost four decades the man sitting in this seat was named Chris Berman he made the draft. Live event he made it interesting and entertaining. And boom in your honor we're gonna keep that tradition going tonight and his longest we've continued. Could do this draft. That's touching. Gonna say sure permanent home unit particularly when he big names are completely whacked Chris Berman that saves and some money they did five million bucks us. And brick McHenry yeah. On. View the broom you know Jim Capel and Capel. Jayson stark James it was the other big name is for improvement Henry in Somalia and the owner Andy Katz easy perhaps werder was posted a two feet. Brackets with Obama now it is one. Oh well it's being an ode to a little. SP and wax strip Dilbert Vinnie can I know Jason stargate that order but the apparently you Liz Lemon tart blow lap I had rain still. Stealing. ESPN money and the sense of still and stealing our dollar signs that you and I am yeah. Am. An X games you know he's always on top of multi what does this before we get the other stuff. I don't know install of legs and I know he tweets about these officers are yet if you want to fight she wants to fight you which you wish I encourage that wholeheartedly and or see that if he had ever watched their show I've never watched that showed her last I checked in and cardinal fan yeah I was so bad it's it's just all should watch it you can have an opinion about him once since it's apparently in my life terrible I watch it last night just chicken it's worse than ever and only got worse. When they talk and hip hop with a speaking recycler in which Google gets passed as Smith he's. Awful he's leaflets and it's sounds so forcefully. Embarrassing. I wanna go on there and I go on there. I want to be on the sixth against him in the Wear sneakers the have been aware ironic T shirt in this and it Covert yeah it's right good move them and talking dance around like that it. And you gonna. Well prey or attempt to appease draftees here is welcome can knock a hole but I'm enough to keep me occupied we keep talking like this eventually and we'll play some of that now on ethics and Ken has been awesome and it's Friday. If you're mailing and trailing. This bureau mails and emails and welfare system is fair or is they've got re tweet that tweet that you wrote about how bad that chose to retreated to my house in 2000 times the figure deal and she wants to confront you cannot she went on the earth and she keeps tweeting of people is now all the peoples in the show. Are tweeting her she's still respond. Am a big issue and knows the thermonuclear. Don't click despite an opportunity to say that I'm not about the Ryder Cup reports that I'm happy to take I'll have my mom mom mom and my wife from them yet. Elements that sells off so forced to sell me can you imagine being one of these Jerome on as laid off from the east to four odds of making three million a year that are trying to miles a variety. Off would be painful you would be like. Steve Buscemi in that that there. Adam Sandler holder announced. You can. Lot of the computer and plus plus years I wonder how much you don't train window makes he's so he can replace him with anybody. Yet let me ask you can do that last Wall Street went. Well general we've reported that was the cause for Puerto Chris Fowler a society four million or something it's thirty million dollar contract for ten years I mean thirty million everybody television set under the watch it is crisp dollars to the event actually in the acres our lineup relationship typical guy and I I can. I least none of the difference between Fowler and windows were part of a so they could put final word Nazi sure differ which put an. Nancy they also didn't layoff anybody's making very big money I mean. You know you look down the list through called hockey writers it's all the other birds are fun guys don't write us front again million bucks he's probably the highest paid out of yeah I got tired and I mean God's heart doesn't make I Cheney can knows who okay. On the radio or radio that I had from a couple underground. But your notes okay now for me saint forgot I am not. And but apparently they're not done do you think Britain McKinley who's hot. Blonde you think she would again laid off she didn't scream at the park now and the now that was a that was it for that LLC she's. She. I don't know I mean. Yes but if she didn't operate the parking lot of them were easy tonight that I visited suggest you perhaps behind the scene should it be a handful yes so there's not. It is well he's been given their land of people or handful why did you if you had to see you just down to two people one is a one isn't right amount as older ones a pain in the ass she's probably hotter than a lot of chips that were on the she's she's. Does he know to eat. Had no idea as PS don't you let I've. Hash tag at the hands. Who was Serena and around that is that is between a man with no job and I happened to do that its local. He tit McConnell I know she's from Boston has been this mean I guess she's cute she's whatever doesn't move the needle. I don't know of another person how to he'd describe her go with the as a sort of over caffeinated white with Serena who tries way to hard to reporters that two or do we know which one that this. They try to. Sing well and so. So freedom around as I imagine that's when you have ever heard the name and nothing going on who. I mean he watches against. See you a minute a minute short shorts and overcast and Thomas. That ice. That's her I don't you know this year and watch them on the he is a matter rephrase the question could you keep sand. That they're not commensurate drop maybe not maybe not I don't imagine these are not trading him OK not trading OK if I agree with that kind of change the question. Should day yet again. 6177797937. Should be priced one out. I can tell you Cleveland is ready to deal. We have the source for all things Cleveland Mary Kate kaput right pointing out that they're collecting epics in one final attempt. Two pride corruption all right should not report to do that you but she's actually up just let me do the show his apartment that's how much of that show you credible argument. Did you report they're getting those picks in what gets us Richard. That's eluded re the whole staff Eric Olsen worry the subtext is it you know a meter but that's not that's true. That's not true shot. I want shot that defined word marriage has just add up correctly issued him. She points soiled by you in trading down the browns picked up an extra 20181. Round ignoring them. 21 round is the next season to go along with 32. Round as it than anything we know about Belichick you like second round was right particularly high second he's a good picks. I'm and it's thrown out there it would pay off for the 21 round picks. One which one of which might be number one by giving the offered for Diana's lockyer to. The problem in every time with him. Also keep an advocate franchise because I suppose and he's gonna make a ton of money but you're right you don't pay you back up quarterback 23 mile you're also digest your own right does value. He's not to be as much as the ones you're right the everybody whether you value goes down Krajicek get the first pick in draft form October. Yes you aren't it's over Japanese is very. You lost the war it's OK I united eventually it was an article keep up. Over the actually win this argument this one robotic keeping crop OK I just said I agree with you the key and oracle can we move along. He wants to my question while I should say keep the route yes he's he's the right move cities I see no. And I'm laying the deal out here for. 21 round picks and two seconds. Cleveland's first round pick Houston's first round pick to stick around picks and with the help a fourth as a it's gonna be it alcohol. Will go black and look at the hall they got for rob Weiner I don't have done I think that's a real epic that's what you pay for quarterbacks and what we saw last night. Is that guys like Andy Reid I think. Indeed we can read. Will panic will overpay. They understand. It is not worth playing the game you don't look I've never been more Cleveland's I've never took advantage of every story filibuster Gerry a now more convinced than ever. The page to keep grapple Belichick realize the value of the position. Knows what he thinks is a great but don't you guys have since October and why it was anybody else. They are keeping Jimmy grapple he's going nowhere will be Mondays or Jimmy G as. 2000 in nineteen. Milk hyper points and Cleveland needs a quarterback he says but Cody Kessler was decent and his rookie as a rookie. He's likely gonna take the most snaps in 2007 team to be in the market next you were quarterback.

For a Philly now and another very good friends. Just like Saint Louis with the open. In the lower so that was Fleming's thinks she is right or she left of the plans on hysterically. Because this thing who could doubt she stocks got a future that. Everybody boos could dale. Right yeah. That's what you kind of a thing I mean everyone does no matter what CDs in the matter what market it is my analysts even if it's a placement protein crystal bowl don't you put the commissioner anyway to do it and all the time.

New photos leaked Apple Car finally spotted in the wild? New photos leaked by Sean Keach 16 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments A car using driverless technology built by Apple has been snapped driving around California, according to a new report. Bloomberg has published an article showcasing photos of a Lexus RX450h SUV being driven on Californian roads. The report details how a person saw the vehicle emerge from an Apple facility, captured images of the SUV, and then sent the photos to Bloomberg HQ. The images come just days after Apple received a permit to test autonomous vehicles on California roads, confirming that – despite rumours to the contrary – the company hasn’t given up on its driverless car ambitions. Image credit: Bloomberg The documents filed by Apple were acquired by Business Insider, and revealed how Apple would be using six drivers to test out three Lexus RX 450h SUVs. That’s the same model of car revealed in Bloomberg’s report, albeit one kitted out with an array of sensors, including Velodyne Lidar Inc.s 64-channel lidar, as well as two radars and a number of cameras. Importantly, as Bloomberg notes, these sensors appear to have been bought from third-party manufacturers, rather than custom-built by Apple itself. Image credit: Bloomberg So what does this mean for the long-rumoured Apple Car? Details of a mysterious vehicle being built at Apple HQ under the codename ‘Project Titan’ have been circulating for years, but latest rumours suggest the project has been scaled back. While Apple’s early ambitions reportedly centred on building an entire vehicle, Project Titan is said to be much more streamlined now. Apparently, the main focus for the time being is to develop working autonomous driving software. Pending the success of this project, there’s still a chance that Apple could move back into entire-car development. Image credit: Bloomberg We’ve asked Apple for comment and will update this article with any response. Related: iPhone 8 What would you like to see from an Apple Car?

The company is losing to a rival by a 2-to-1 margin. Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Apr 28, 2017 at 10:01AM For a brief time, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) dominated the music market as the company's iTunes music store disrupted the traditional business of selling CDs, moving the business into the digital world. That model actually remained the top source of revenue for the industry until 2015, when, for the first time, streaming topped it, according to the Recording Industry Association of America's (RIAA) 2015 year-end report. That trend continued and accelerated in 2016, when streaming provided over half (51.4%) off all recorded music revenue, up from 34.3% the previous year. The explosive growth of streaming came largely at the expense of digital downloads, which dropped from 34% of the market in 2015 to 24.1% in 2016. That's bad news for Apple, which was a late player to the streaming game partly because it was so successful with iTunes and digital downloads. Now, new research from LendEDU suggests Apple may have an even bigger problem. That's because while the company has fallen behind streaming leader Spotify by a 2-to-1 margin (roughly 50 million subscribers to more than 20 million as of March, according to 9to5Mac), the gap may be larger among millennial users. Apple dominated digital downloads, but has struggled with streaming. Image source: Getty Images. Why millennials matter Millennials, people born between the early 1980s and early 2000s, are now America's largest generation. On top of that, the group trails only baby boomers and Generation X when it comes to spending power by household, according to the United States Department of Labor. Going forward, though the timeline is hard to predict, millenials should become the economically dominant generation. That makes their current actions, while not of immediate importance, a strong bellwether of things to come. The LendEDU report showed that nearly half of all millennials (47%) get their music from Spotify. That's triple the 14% who named iTunes (which for the purpose of this report includes Apple Music and traditional downloads) as a source for music. "Apple Music appears to be Spotify's biggest competitor in terms of social sharing, but even they are lagging behind," wrote LendEDU, which was started in 2014 and calls itself "a marketplace for student loans and student loan refinance." "They differ in that Spotify allows users to share a track, artist, or playlist on their personal Spotify, Twitter, or Tumblr feed, while also being able to share through Facebook, email, text message, WhatsApp, or Google Hangouts. Spotify also gives users the option to 'follow friends,' which shows what their friends are listening to on a continuous feed," wrote LendEDU. Why is Spotify winning? Social sharing may be a driving factor for younger users, or it may be that Apple simply has not been able to overcome Spotify's early lead. Spotify, which began in Europe, came to the U.S. in 2011 while Apple Music did not launch until June 2015. That roughly four-year head start made Spotify the incumbent and once a person signs up with a music service, it's hard to get them to change if they are already having a good experience. The social aspect of Spotify likely enhances loyalty as well because a happy customer using the same service that their friends use has very little reason to switch. Apple does have an edge with older customers late to the streaming party. Those people know Apple and may be swayed simply by the fact that the company already has their credit card number and the Apple music app is already installed on iPhones and iPads. But that audience may be a declining source of growth going forward as the amount of consumers who lack a streaming subscription becomes negligible. What's next for Apple and Spotify? Both Apple and Spotify offer the same basic product -- unlimited streaming music from a vast catalogue -- for the same price ($9.99 a month). Apple has an edge in that it can load its service onto its devices, but that's only a value when it comes to attracting customers who don't have Spotify or who, for some reason, do not like it. For Apple to make major inroads growing outside of the undecided or non-committed category, it's going to have to offer more that Spotify does not have. The company does plan to do that with an upcoming television-style show based on late-night host James Corden's popular Carpool Karaoke segment. That series, along with a few others being planned, will be exclusive to Apple Music. It's hard to know whether perks like that will eventually get millennial customers who are satisfied with Spotify to switch. But it's very clear that Apple has to do something if it wants to attract millennials. Daniel Kline owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

By Oliver Cragg April 28, 2017 15:53 BST Is Apple making a Siri-powered smart speaker?iStock Following the high profile launches of Amazon Echo and Google Home, the smart speaker market has become a hot topic in the tech sphere. While the respective Alexa and Google Assistant-powered devices arguably represent the best of the tech's grand debut, it has yet to be seen if other industry giants with their own digital assistants will follow suit. Despite prior reports to the contrary, prolific Apple leaker Sonny Dickson has suggested that the Cupertino company is building a rival device built on a variant of its mobile operating system iOS and its chatty iPhone, iPad and Mac assistant, Siri. Dickson made the claim in a series of tweets on 27 April, stating that Apple is "finalising designs" for an "Alexa competitor... expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device." The tipster also alleged that the product will "carry some form of Beats technology," referencing the hugely popular audio brand Apple purchased in 2014. On the surface, Dickson's claims sound credible – Apple clearly has the infrastructure, software and financial might to wade into the smart speaker market without any qualms. However, it would appear to contradict a recent report citing talks with unnamed Apple executives who denied such rumours, categorically stating that Apple has "no apparent interest in copying" Amazon and Google's efforts. The report also claimed that Apple sees Siri's future as an "omnipresent platform" that delivers "an AI assistant that's with you all the time, rather than tethered down to a single device." In lieu of an official Apple announcement or any confirmed interest from its upper echelon, it is worth taking all speculation on the topic of Siri smart speaker with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, with the emergent smart-speaker market estimated to become a multi-billion dollar market by 2020, the mere suggestion that Apple has broader plans for Siri appears to fit the idea of a hub-like AirPlay device that expands the assistant's reach to cover multiple Apple products. Considering Siri is already nestled in Macs, iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and Apple TVs across the world, a voice-activated hub making use of AirPlay – and potentially HomeKit for smart home control – is something many Apple fans would no doubt love to see.

Apple sued Qualcomm in January, accusing the company of overcharging for its patented technology. Qualcomm said on Friday it would defend its right to receive "fair value" for its "technological contributions". The licence agreements had been in place for a decade, it said. "These licence agreements remain valid and enforceable," Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, said. Qualcomm's share price dropped 3% following the latest update, which came less than two weeks after the company reported quarterly earnings. Qualcomm said its forecast at that time involved scenarios with reduced payments - not their complete absence. Qualcomm derived 40% of its revenue from Apple and Samsung Electronics in its most recent financial year. In a statement, Apple said: "Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court." Apple's legal action in January followed a complaint by the Federal Trade Commission, a US regulator, alleging Qualcomm had used "anticompetitive practices" to maintain a monopoly over key technology. Apple has also sued Qualcomm in China and in the UK.

Notably, Apple doesn't pay Qualcomm royalty payments directly; rather, it pays contract manufacturers who then pay Qualcomm. The move could result in a multi-billion dollar shortfall for Qualcomm over the coming years if the legal fight isn't resolved quickly. Suppliers likely won't be able to pay Qualcomm out of their own pocket and would risk their relationship with Apple if they did so. In January, Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion alleging that the company has been 'charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with'. The lawsuit follows one from the FTC which charges Qualcomm with using anticompetitive tactics to maintain its monopoly in the supply of baseband processors used in cellular phones. Apple said Qualcomm is withholding 'nearly $1 billion in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them.' Qualcomm countersued Apple in April accusing the company of failing 'to engage in good faith negotiations for a license to Qualcomm’s 3G and 4G standard essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms'. Following Apple's latest move in the rapidly escalating battle, Qualcomm is slashing revenue guidance for the current quarter by $500 million. “Apple is improperly interfering with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm’s licensees,” said Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm. “These license agreements remain valid and enforceable. While Apple has acknowledged that payment is owed for the use of Qualcomm’s valuable intellectual property, it nevertheless continues to interfere with our contracts. Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade. Apple’s continued interference with Qualcomm’s agreements to which Apple is not a party is wrongful and the latest step in Apple's global attack on Qualcomm. We will continue vigorously to defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry.” "For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with", says Apple. "The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations. Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties. Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined." A protracted legal battle with Apple may be just the start of problems for Qualcomm as it appears likely that Apple will shift to using an increasing number of Intel modems in its next generation devices.

It's news that will have Apple fans in the region rejoicing: The tech giant's first store in Southeast Asia is expected to open in May, according to CNBC sources. The launch of the Singapore store has been shrouded in the company's usual veil of secrecy. Nearly two years ago, word of the addition to the company's beloved retail empire leaked in an email sent by the gym Pure Fitness to its clients, announcing it was leaving its sprawling space in a mall on Orchard Road. Since then, the project has been beset by problems related to the construction in a busy part of central Singapore. A sign outside the building site originally said the expected completion date was October 31, 2016. Then it was changed to January 30 of this year. And then the date was wiped off completely. A sign previously indicating when the Apple store expected to open has had that section blanked out (circled). CNBC | Craig Dale The reasons for the apparent delay are somewhat opaque. Singapore's Ministry of Manpower issued a stop work order to the contractor for the worksite, Legend Interiors, an interior fit-out specialist. According to a statement sent to CNBC by MOM, that stop work order was issued "for unsafe conditions relating to work at height, traffic management, scaffolding, electrical installation and lifting operations that were observed during an inspection at the worksite." The order went into effect on October 24, 2016 and was lifted on November 16, 2016. Someone who answered the phone at Legend Interiors — which says its clients include Dolce & Gabbana, Christian Dior, Marriott, Credit Suisse, and Cathay Pacific — said they were uncomfortable answering questions about any issues that may have come up with the Apple store, especially a query about whether there had been any legal wrangling between Legend and Apple. That person said discussing any issues would be "treading on dangerous ground," and referred all questions to project manager Madeline Tan. Reached by phone, Tan declined to comment on the project and even refused to give her exact title. No comments Apple is notoriously guarded when it comes to its products, projects, and people. Staff at DP Architects PTE, the architect for the Singapore project, also declined to comment to CNBC, citing nondisclosure agreements. Employees with the civil and structural engineer, Rankine & Hill, and the mechanical and electrical engineer, J. Roger Preston, also waved away questions. A source with knowledge of the project told CNBC about problems with a neighbor — the Grand Royal Orchard Singapore hotel. That source said there had been a conflict over logistical and infrastructure issues related to the construction. "I think it's all gone legal," the source said, without specifying who brought or threatened action against whom. A manager of a retail store close to the site told CNBC she, too, was aware of a conflict. But the source with knowledge of the project said "it has all been resolved and [is] expecting to open in May." CNBC also reached out to the Grand Royal Orchard Singapore hotel. Elaine Heng, assistant director of marketing communications at the Park Hotel Group, the hospitality group that manages the hotel, said she could not comment on the matter. A 'critical' launch Apple's predilection for secrecy is perhaps unsurprisingly in action for the Singapore site. Legal documents that have come to light in the past detail strict non-disclosure agreements for the company's contractors and suppliers, including $50 million payouts for each breach. "Apple by nature is a very secretive company, particularly when it comes to products," said Bryan Ma, vice president at IDC Asia Pacific. "So I wouldn't be surprised that's also why they're keeping quiet about their expansion in retail stores." Ma added that it was "critical" for Apple to have a presence in the Southeast Asian market: "Not even from the perspective of selling products; more from the perspective of marketing." CNBC | Jessica Wa'u Pedestrians walk by an Apple store under construction in Singapore. "In many ways, Apple stores are shrines to their fans," he said. "It allows them to experience and touch the products. Singapore is a hub that also attracts a lot of tourists. That's why it is strategically important for them to be here." Katrina Tran, Apple's head of corporate communications for Southeast Asia and India, dismissed any notions of a delay or friction. Over the phone, she said the project was proceeding as planned and noted that Apple had never given a date for the opening. In an email, Tran told CNBC, "We don't have any new announcements about Apple retail." At the site on Thursday afternoon, a phalanx of workers was busy laying paving stones and bringing materials in and out of the building, which was covered by a white tarp. Multiple people wearing shirts marked "Legend Interiors" declined to speak about the project. One worker, though, seemed comfortable saying a few words at the end of his shift. When asked when the Apple Store in Singapore would open, he seemed quite confident. May 22 he said – twice. Calls and emails to Apple to confirm that date went unanswered.

Starting on Friday, Apple Music will be one of the services that supplies the songs. (Update: An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported that Apple Music would replace music distributor 7digital; Musical.ly will continue to work with 7digital and recently renewed an agreement with the company.) Connecting with Musical.ly gives Apple a new marketing venue: The app will promote Apple’s paid service to its own users, and will allow paying Apple Music subscribers to listen to full songs within the app. Reps for both Apple and Musical.ly declined comment. Musical.ly is a three-year-old Shanghai-based company that saw a huge spike in popularity last year, primarily among U.S. teens and tweens, many of whom use it as a social network. The company has also launched Live.ly, a livestreaming app. Last year, Musical.ly reportedly raised $100 million at a $500 million valuation, and said it had more than 100 million users. It’s possible that the service has peaked, though; while the main app spent much of last year at the top of Apple’s App Store rankings, it is currently at No. 89.

By Shan Wang @shansquared April 28, 2017, 9:59 a.m. April 28, 2017, 9:59 a.m. What happens if you preinstall a news app on millions of new Samsung phones in Europe, in the way that Apple “gifted” U2’s 2014 album to unsuspecting iTunes users? RELATED ARTICLE More distributed content is coming: Axel Springer is partnering with Samsung on mobile news September 1, 2015It appears so far that people have responded much better to that offering than iPhone users did to the much-maligned U2 giveaway. News aggregator app Upday, an Axel Springer brainchild on which the company has placed big hopes for European ubiquity, comes already installed on new Samsung — and only Samsung — smartphones in Germany, France, Poland, and the U.K. The app boasts more than 8 million unique monthly users, according to Upday editor-in-chief and chief product officer Jan-Eric Peters, thanks in large part to that exclusive arrangement with Samsung. The app will now also be preinstalled on Samsung’s new S8 phones, which become available on Friday in Europe, and expand into 12 additional countries, broadening its Android-only domain. Upday has been in four countries since it launched March of last year, and the deal with Samsung, which despite being responsible for a certain variety of spontaneously combusting phones is the dominant smartphone maker in Europe, has given it an immediate and apparently attentive audience who spend more than five minutes per day on average browsing the app. (Just swipe left from your new Samsung phone homescreen, and it’s right there.) The app itself has two components: a top news section maintained by journalists who select top stories and which news organizations to link out to, and a personalized section determined by an algorithm the Upday team built that serves up stories based on a user’s reading history. Upday positions itself as a platform through which any publisher can distribute stories — an Apple News counterpart for Android that is up against the likes of Google Newsstand and Flipboard — and sees itself as a more open alternative that just takes various publishers’ RSS feeds, then rewards them with respectable mobile traffic and ad views. About 3,000 publishers’ feeds, vetted by a “content quality team” for technical criteria such as whether pages are mobile-optimized, will be available through Upday with the expansion. Peters has also been negotiating with other publishers who have hard paywalls, to get some of their stories into Upday as well. Sweden’s Svenska Dagbladet has already been integrated so that Upday users won’t be hitting the metered paywall. Newsweek Polska is in process of integrating a separate RSS feed. An Italian paywalled daily will be added sometime in May. Peters would not disclose on the record what percentage of users who automatically got the app on their phones continued to use it on a regular basis, nor did he share the terms of the deal with Samsung. But from the outside, there appears to be continued investment and confidence. Upday doubled its editorial staff to 50 journalists, spread throughout eight cities (Berlin, London, Paris, Warsaw, Milan, Madrid, Amsterdam, and Stockholm) who can deal with the various languages spoken across Europe (Upday itself doesn’t do any translation). It has 40 additional staff among developers, sales, and management. “I can only say, why does Samsung want to have us on their phones? It’s not for a business benefit; it’s that they want to have the best possible news service on their phones, to have people keep buying their smartphones,” Peters said. “Instead of trying to start that themselves, they have a partnership with a publishing house.” Upday editorial staffers put together collections compiling different news organizations’ pieces — for instance, around major events like the French election — but otherwise don’t intend to produce original reporting. “We won’t publish our own stories. We want to be a platform — and specifically, a publisher’s platform,” Peters said. “We don’t force publishers into a closed system, like Apple News, or Facebook’s Instant Articles.” RELATED ARTICLE After a slow start, Apple News is emerging as a significant traffic driver for some news orgs November 7, 2016Readers click into around 5 to 10 percent of articles to read the full story on the publishers’ page, Peters told me, and Upday has sent more than 3 million visits to publishers based on metrics from the four initial countries Upday launched in. Peters also said that most of the “quality media” from the app’s main countries are starting to see between 3 to 5 percent of their total mobile traffic coming from Upday, with the occasional publisher getting up to 20 percent of its mobile traffic from Upday. Peters wouldn’t specify which publishers were getting the highest referrals, but said generally that it was the well known brands “who have their base in the digital world.” He did mention HuffPost and Business Insider (which is owned by Axel Springer) as publishers that were getting good traffic from Upday. (I emailed a bunch of other large news organizations I knew were on the platform, including The New York Times, but haven’t heard back from any of them.) Upday itself is not yet a profitable venture but clearly has quite a bit of runway is planning to generate revenue entirely through advertising. Ads will appear within the Upday stream, and Upday will take 100 percent of the revenue. “We have to prove this works, but we are optimistic,” Peters said. I wondered aloud whether, in the long run, this bet on Samsung phones would lead to a cap on Upday’s growth — Samsung phone sales were weaker in Western Europe at the end of last year, according to Gartner, and analysts predict this fall’s iPhones to be blockbusters. “When I’ve talked to publishers or editors-in-chief, and I must have had hundreds of visits to publishers, I’d say 99 percent of them have iPhones only. They’ve never even see Upday on a phone,” Peters said. “This is so different from the real world. Samsung users are additional to the iOS users the media industry usually concentrates on.” The reach extends beyond an auto-install on smartphones. Upday sends relevant wellness, fitness, and health stories to a dedicated section of the Samsung phone’s health app. Samsung also makes fridges with connected monitors on the doors, and an Upday stream is integrated into those fridges in five countries in Europe. Yes, your fancy Samsung fridge will read you Upday headlines as you put away groceries. (In the U.S., those fridges play NPR news.) “People usually renew their phones every two to three years. There are lots of people with S6 phones without Upday, but when they upgrade to an S8 or S7, they will get Upday,” Peters said, adding that one goal was to surpass the BBC News app in Europe. “This guarantees more growth. The market is for now definitely big enough for us.” POSTED     April 28, 2017, 9:59 a.m. SEE MORE ON Aggregation & Discovery SHARE THIS STORY      TWITTER   FACEBOOK (0)   EMAIL   TUMBLR   LINKEDIN   SHARE ON FACEBOOK (0)   TWEET aggregation Axel Springer distributed model Facebook Germany Jan-Eric Peters mobile news apps platforms Poland Samsung United Kingdom Upday Show comments  Hide comments Show tagsHide tags   What’s the best way to follow how the news is changing?

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Michael Kan More like this 30 tasty tips for Android Nougat 15+ tips for better iPhone photography 9 next-level tips for your Google Pixel phone Video Mingis on Tech: Energy microgrids, what's up with Apple TV -- and drones! I write about Apple every day. I write opinions, news analysis, tips, features – all sorts of stuff. Today I thought you might enjoy this collection of 20 lesser-known iPhone tips, which I do hope are of use to you. Here we go: Fickle fingers Does Touch ID sometimes fail to recognize your finger as fast as you like? You can improve its accuracy by registering the same fingerprint two or more times in the system. You can improve it even more if you register the same fingerprint on a cold day, and when it is damp, as both can impact your print slightly. Add (and name) fingerprints in Settings>Touch ID & Passcode. Don’t waste data If you share images using Messages (and most of us do), and keep hitting your data allocation every month why not try to reduce the size of the attachments you share? You can do this easily in Settings>Messages>Low Quality Image Mode, which you toggle to on (green). Now the images you send will be less high quality, but they’ll take a lot less space. Silence and light Camera mode is interesting because: You can turn off the flashlight just by launching the Camera app when the light is on; You can connect your iPhone silently to power if you launch the app on your device before plugging it in. AirPlane Mode Your iPhone will recharge much faster in AirPlane mode. Cursors Writing on your iPhone gets a lot easier once you realize that if you hard press the virtual keyboard it will become a touch sensitive cursor you can easily direct to a specific part of your email, Message, or anything else. Selection Like the cursor tip? Then don’t forget that you can select text by word, sentence, or paragraph. Press deeply once for a word, twice for a sentence and three times to select a paragraph. Don’t worry if this doesn’t work initially – it takes a little time to get the rhythm right. Apple turnover Silence Siri and Notifications while in a meeting the easy way: just turn you iPhone face down and the proximity sensor will keep them quiet. Calculator How to delete a mistyped character in calculator: When we accidentally type the wrong number when creating a calculation many of us delete the whole thing and start again, because it’s not obvious how to delete the mistyped number. All we really need to do is swipe a finger left or right in the input field to delete the last typed number. Easy touch Press your finger firmly on the far left of the display and swipe to the middle to get to App Switcher, or swipe all the way across the screen to get to the previously used app. Where? When someone gets in touch it’s frustrating when you don’t know which of the telephone numbers or email addresses to use to get back to them. It’s easy to figure this out, just open up their page in your Contacts app and look for the word ‘Recent’, that will be the number they last used to make contact with you. Call wrangling When you get a call you can’t deal with don’t just ignore it – tap the Remind Me or Message icons to get back to people with an automatic response or to set a reminder to call someone back. You can change these automated message responses in Settings > Phone > Respond With Text. Space extenders You’re short of space and you know it, so visit the Movies/Films section of the iTunes Store, find a movie that is larger than your available capacity, and click rent. The rental should not be initiated as you lack the space, instead choose Settings in the dialog that appears. iPhone will automatically flush as much digital stuff as it can, creating you more space, which you can use until you get the chance to create more space manually. Gimme my… RSS? To subscribe to a site’s RSS feed in Safari just tap the Bookmarks button, then tap the @ button at the top. At the bottom of the page tap the Subscriptions item – then, at the bottom of the next page tap ‘Add Current Site’. The site will be added to Safari’s built-in RSS reader. You’ll be able to monitor newly published items in the @ field. Apple Pay If you use Apple Pay you may have missed this: When paying for items at checkout you do not need to wake up your iPhone and get to Wallet: Instead, just put your Touch ID-registered finger on the Home button and place your iPhone near the reader. Your phone will wake itself up automatically and deal with the rest. Make a PDF almost anywhere I recently wrote about this elsewhere, because it’s useful. To make a PDF from almost any iOS app, just tap Share and choose Print. In the Printer Options screen that appears you will see an image of the item you want to print. Use two fingers to expand the image and you’ll enter a preview mode that has its own Share button. Tap this new Share button and you can send it to apps, share it, and do all sorts of other things that may not have been possible using the original app. Traditional stopwatch I’m sure you know about the stopwatch feature in the Clock app, but did you know that when you use it you can access a more traditional stopwatch clock face just by swiping your finger left? Tackle the Tabs Safari’s ability to handle unlimited tabs is brilliant, but there are three things you may not have noticed: Got a load of open tabs and can’t find the one you need? Turn your iPhone to landscape view and tap the Tabs button at the lower right. You’ll see a new view, at top left you’ll see a search bar. You can use this to search through the webpages and contents you have open in Safari. Closure: Tap and hold the Tab button in any Safari page and you’ll be able to close all your open Tabs in the next item. Reopen: Or tap the Tab button, then tap and hold the + icon to access your Recently Closed Tabs. Low Power Mode If you know you want to get more time out of your iPhone one day, don’t forget you can manually switch it to Low Power Mode in Settings>Battery>Low Power Mode. Doing so reduces power consumption by disabling Hey Siri, background app refresh, visual effects, and no longer automatically downloading email, but you’ll get better battery life. Apple Music You’ll get more using 3D Touch on Apple Music. When scanning any playlist view a long press on a song title lets you easily access a bunch of useful controls, including Create Station, Love, Dislike, Share and a variety of playback options. Mail right Threaded messages are useful, but you may not like the default order in which messages are placed. You can choose whether to show old or new messages first in Settings>Mail. NB: Unfortunately some of these tips will only work on iPhones with 3D Touch.

In a rare outside partnership, Apple Music will be one of the services delivering songs to the popular short music video creation app. _______________________________ Starting today, Apple Music will begin delivering song snippets to popular music video app Musical.ly. As of last year Musical.ly had more than 100 million users and raised 100 million at a $500 million valuation. "Connecting with Musical.ly gives Apple a new marketing venue: The app will promote Apple’s paid service to its own users, and will allow paying Apple Music subscribers to listen to full songs within the app," according to Recode who first reported the partnership. UPDATE: "A number of other companies have reached out to us, understanding that it would be very valuable for them to partner with us, and we believe it would be very valuable to partner with them," Musical.ly President Alex Hoffmann told Billboard when asked whether the company would explore similar partnerships with Spotify, Pandora and other streamers. "So we are going to have these conversations. But it was important to us to work with a partner we had worked with before - we've worked with Apple on other occasions - and there are other Apple-Musical.ly partnerships on the horizon." Early this month, the UK's 7Digital announced a renewed deal with Musically doubling the number of territories that it provides music for the app from 30 to 60. That deal is apparently unaffected by the Apple Music partnership. “To confirm the announcement we made two weeks ago, we’ve just re-signed a deal with Musical.ly, extending the number of territories,” 7digital CEO Simon Cole told Music Ally. “We are unaffected by any other deals they may be doing with third parties, and that we will earn more money from Musical.ly this year than we did last year.” Related articles Apple Music To Relaunch With More Video, Original Programming [REPORT] - hypebot 'Carpool Karaoke: The Series' Delayed Again: Apple Pushes Back Premiere Date To 'Later This Year' Who Are Instagram's Biggest Competitors In 2017?

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « ARM Confirms that Microsoft-Qualcomm Notebooks and 2-in-1 Devices for Windows 10 will hit the Market in Q4 | Main | Smartphone data for Q1 2017 shows that the big Story is the Stunning growth from Oppo, Huawei and Vivo » April 28, 2017 Qualcomm Lowers Q3 Fiscal 2017 Guidance due to Apple Holding back Royalty Payments   In January Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Sues Qualcomm for $1 Billion Claiming Unfair Exclusionary Tactics and Charging Excessive Royalties." Other Patently Apple reports followed covering both companies suing each other (One, two and three) and last week we posted a report titled "Qualcomm's Sales Decline for Baseband Modems for the iPhone 8 will hurt their Bottom Line." Today Qualcomm put out a press release titled "Apple Continues to Improperly Interfere with Qualcomm's Agreements with Contract Manufacturers."   Qualcomm's press release in part states that "Qualcomm Incorporated today announced that it has been informed by Apple Inc. that Apple is withholding payments to its contract manufacturers for the royalties those contract manufacturers owe under their licenses with Qualcomm for sales during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Apple has indicated it will continue this behavior until its dispute with Qualcomm is resolved.   'Apple is improperly interfering with Qualcomm's long-standing agreements with Qualcomm's licensees,' said Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm. 'These license agreements remain valid and enforceable. While Apple has acknowledged that payment is owed for the use of Qualcomm's valuable intellectual property, it nevertheless continues to interfere with our contracts. Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade. Apple's continued interference with Qualcomm's agreements to which Apple is not a party is wrongful and the latest step in Apple's global attack on Qualcomm. We will continue vigorously to defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry.'"   Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Guidance Update   The press release added that "As a result of the above developments, we are updating our financial guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 to exclude royalty revenues from Apple's contract manufacturers.   The contract manufacturers may make some form of partial payment, but initial indications are that any payment would likely be insignificant. As a result of these actions, we are adjusting our financial guidance to assume that no payment is made, and therefore no revenues are recognized, in the quarter. This differs from our prior guidance, which considered a variety of payment scenarios (and related revenues) within the range, but did not include a scenario where no payment was made (and no revenues were recognized)."   Qualcomm's stock is down 2.74% this morning on the news. Whether the stock will be able to rebound later today is unknown at this time.   Coincidentally yesterday a report surfaced hinting that Apple's iPhone 8 may not have Qualcomm's next-gen Gigabit LTE modem putting the iPhone at a disadvantage over Samsung's S8 and other major vendors adopting the new modem later this year. Whether that was a targeted threat to Apple sent through the press is unknown at this time.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

This is the latest escalation in Apple’s multi-part lawsuit against Qualcomm, which it claims has been charging excessively high patent licensing fees for years. “Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable.” The legal battle was sparked by the Federal Trade Commission, which began suing Qualcomm for anti-competitive licensing practices back in January. Apple filed suit in California just days later and has since added lawsuits in the UK and China. Apple’s plan is to withhold royalty payments until the courts determine how much it actually owes. It’s an aggressive move that suggests Apple believes it’s going to come out on top. "Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court," an Apple spokesperson told Reuters. Qualcomm isn’t thrilled about the decision. In a release, Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg says that Apple’s licensing agreements remain “valid and enforceable” and that the company is “improperly interfering” with its agreements. Qualcomm had to adjust its revenue guidance Apple technically doesn’t make these payments directly to Qualcomm. Instead, it pays royalties back to iPhone and iPad manufacturers, which then pass the fees on to Qualcomm. But since Apple won’t be providing that money, the manufacturers won’t be able to pay. “Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade,” Rosenberg says. As a result, Qualcomm has had to adjust its guidance for how much revenue it expects to make this quarter. Qualcomm initially expected to make between $5.3 billion and $6.1 billion in revenue; it’s now expecting between $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion — a dip of $500 million because of Apple.

Its shares hit a low for 2017. Apple Inc. sued Qualcomm earlier this year, saying that the San Diego chipmaker has abused its control over essential technology and charged excessive licensing fees. Qualcomm said Friday that Apple now says it won’t pay any fees until the dispute is resolved. Apple confirmed Friday that it has suspended payments until the court can determine what is owed. “We’ve been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years but they have refused to negotiate fair terms,” Apple said. “As we’ve said before, Qualcomm’s demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own.” Qualcomm said it will continue to vigorously defend itself in order to “receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry.” But the effect on Qualcomm, whose shares have already slid 15 percent since the lawsuit was filed by Apple in January, was immediate.

Known as the Touch Bar, the interface provides useful contextual controls How to Try the New MacBook Touch Bar for Free Right Now How to Try the New MacBook Touch Bar for Free Right Now Apple's fancy new Touch Bar is only available if you spend $1,800 or more on the new MacBook Pro. Here's how you can try it for free on your Mac or via your iPad instead. Read More and Touch ID support for logging in with a fingerprint. When these MacBook Pro models first launched in the fall of 2016, most of the first apps to offer Touch Bar support were Apple’s own. Thankfully many third-party apps have now been updated to support the feature. 1. Adobe Photoshop CC Given the popularity of the MacBook Pro among creative types, it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that Adobe Photoshop CC was one of the first non-Apple apps to receive Touch Bar support. Furthermore, it was also one of the few apps to get a demonstration at Apple’s MacBook Pro event in October 2016. With the Touch Bar and Adobe Photoshop CC, you can access features and controls How to Identify Any Font Using Adobe Photoshop How to Identify Any Font Using Adobe Photoshop Have you ever come across a font in an image and wondered what it was?

Modes include Default, which lets you work with layer properties and related functions; Brushes, which includes Brush and paint properties; and Customize, which allows you to add your favorite Photoshop controls. You can purchase Adobe Photoshop CC for as little as $9.99 per month. 2. 1Password Already one of the most popular password management apps on the market, 1Password for macOS continues to remain relevant thanks to its Touch Bar integration for MacBook Pro. Using the OLED panel, you can unlock 1Password with your fingerprint, just as you can on iOS devices using Touch ID. You can also use Touch Bar to switch password vaults or categories, create new entries, locking vaults, searching your database, and more. 1Password is available across multiple platforms, including macOS and iOS. It’s available for as little as $3 per month. 3. Microsoft Excel All of Microsoft Office’s apps are compatible with Touch Bar. Perhaps the most important of these is Microsoft Excel. Using Touch Bar, you can more quickly access recently used functions when typing an equals sign into a cell. For example, with a tap (for the formula) and another tap (for a named range) in the Touch Bar, you can sum a range in your spreadsheet with ease. The Touch Bar with Excel also provides quick access Be The Smartest Person At Work With These Excel Tricks Be The Smartest Person At Work With These Excel Tricks Excel is a powerful tool.

Like Adobe Photoshop CC, it too was demoed at the October 2016 MacBook Pro event. With the Touch Bar for djay Pro, you can manually control the crossfader, scrub through tracks, set marker points, and access effects. You can also use the tool to manipulate two decks simultaneously, manually select the active deck, and navigate the library to preview and prepare songs. The $49.99 djay Pro is available to purchase through the Mac App Store. 5. PDF Expert Readdle’s PDF Expert for Mac makes the annotating and editing of PDF files simple. Touch Bar integration allows you to focus on the content in full-screen mode.

Other features include the ability to highlight text, underline, or strikethrough text, insert text, or comments, and other options. PDF Expert is available as a free trial. You can buy the full version for $59.99. 6. Pixelmator The folks behind the popular Photoshop alternative Pixelmator for Mac say that Apple’s Touch Bar adds a “completely new way to interact” with the software.

Priced at $29.99, you can purchase Pixelmator on the Mac App Store. A 30-day free trial is also available. 7. Evernote In developing its Touch Bar tools for macOS, Evernote looked to screen-based devices for inspiration. In doing so, it determined: “In some ways, the Touch Bar is a sleeker, more stylish take on the soft buttons seen on screen-based devices, like mobile phones and cash machines. In other ways, the Touch Bar is more like your favorite keyboard shortcuts that you won’t need to memorize.” Evernote Touch Bar tools include the ability to one tap to a new note (just like on your phone), access tags at your fingertips, and the color picker (which offers a multi-color spectrum to find that perfect shade for text, table borders, and table cells). Evernote is available as a free download across multiple platforms. Non-basic packages include Evernote Plus ($34.99 per year) and Evernote Premium ($69.99 per year). 8.

Business Technology Digital Life The making of a 62-year-old cord-cutter Cutting-the-cord: Q&A So far in this series we've discussed the basic steps for cutting the cord. This week, we're going to hit the pause button and revisit some reader questions that may not have been answered yet. So far in this series we've discussed the basic steps for cutting the cord. This week, we're going to hit the pause button and revisit some reader questions that may not have been answered yet. Jennifer Van GroveContact Reporter Who wants a total TV makeover? That simple question, posed in March as part of my ongoing digital life column on the ever-changing streaming TV landscape, caused a bit of a frenzy as more than a hundred readers wrote in pleading for help. One such reader, Carol Manifold of La Jolla, seemed readier than most. A nontraditional viewer with just a few network TV show must-haves, Carol sounded like the kind of person who used her cable subscription more out of habit than necessity. Carol Manifold, 62, of La Jolla has decided to "cut the cord" and go without a cable television. | David Brooks / San Diego Union-Tribune Carol Manifold, 62, of La Jolla has decided to "cut the cord" and go without a cable television. | Carol Manifold, 62, of La Jolla has decided to "cut the cord" and go without a cable television. | (David Brooks / San Diego Union-Tribune) Over the next several weeks, Carol and I exchanged phone calls and emails, and met in person two times. Truthfully, she didn’t need me. She already owned an Apple TV and was using it to stream shows on Netflix and Amazon Video. Really, then, I just gave her a nudge in a direction she was already headed. That’s why, today, Carol is a happy cord-cutter. This is her story. The new Carol Currently, Carol subsists on four paid services: CBS All Access, PBS, Netflix and Amazon Video. Because she was already a subscriber to the latter two services before we started this process, her streaming additions amount to an incremental $15 per month — $10 for the ad-free version of CBS All Access and $5 for what’s called “KPBS Passport.” Her total monthly bill, including internet service with Spectrum, is now around $84, compared to a former balance of $185, for an average monthly savings of about $100. From time to time, Carol may dip into that piggy bank with one-off purchases of something called a “season pass.” This would be to stream shows, such as “Feud” on FX, that she can’t otherwise access through one of her other services. Season passes are available to purchase through iTunes, Google Play, Amazon and YouTube and cost around $20 a pop. The fee includes downloads for all episodes for a single season of a show, with episodes available as they’re released on TV. Perhaps even more fascinating than Carol’s reprogrammed TV diet is the total transformation of her viewing behaviors. The 62-year-old isn’t entirely consuming entertainment like someone 40 years her junior — smartphone viewing isn’t her new normal — but her habits are becoming more millennial-like. “I think more actively about what my options are and about what I want to watch,” she told me. That means no longer turning on the TV for background noise, flipping through channels to see what’s on or watching what’s on the DVR just because there’s stuff there. Basically, she’s making active choices instead of passive ones; no longer conflating someone else’s programming choices with her own. Carol’s media metamorphosis wasn’t the result of an intentional choice to act more like a youngster, nor does it feel completely comfortable just yet. Rather, the loss of the familiar cable TV format forced this new level of consciousness. “Our TV habits, I think, are very ingrained and so it’s taking a while to change over … but it’s better to be more mindful. I’m making different choices. I’m less in the habit of just watching TV. Sometimes I just read a book or go out in the yard.” And when she does watch “TV,” it’s not always TV. Take her new found appreciation of YouTube. “I sing in a couple of choirs and I was looking for things (on YouTube) that I could learn my music from … and I came across a documentary about Benjamin Britten, the composer, and it was fascinating,” Carol said. “I never even would have looked for that.” How we got here When I first met Carol, via e-mail, she said she wanted to cut her bill by at least 50 percent, and she expressed interest in “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” “Masterpiece Classics” on KPBS, “Feud” on FX, as well as movies on Turner Classic Movies. She also called out favorite shows such as “Grace and Frankie” and “House of Cards” on Netflix, and “Mozart in the Jungle” on Amazon Prime, as she was already a customer of those two subscription video services. I selected her for a TV makeover because I knew she was overspending with Spectrum, and I felt like she would be just as happy without traditional cable, and likely even without a streaming alternative such as Sling TV or PlayStation Vue. The one line in her email that stood out: “Most other things I watch just because they’re there and it’s easy, but I wouldn’t miss them all that much if I didn’t have them.” So Carol’s initial homework was to check out two streaming options: CBS All Access, an all-you-can-stream app from CBS, and Warner Archive, a lesser-known subscription service for classic movies and TV shows. CBS All Access turned out to be a winner while Warner Archive was not. The latter just didn’t appear to offer enough value, especially considering her existing Netflix subscription. Meanwhile, feeling antsy and ambitious, Carol found the free PBS app on her Apple TV, and signed up for the members-only “KPBS Passport” service, which requires a $5 monthly donation, to unlock the full catalog of PBS programming. With the digital foundation laid, I met Carol at her La Jolla home and we determined that, though she was experiencing streaming hiccups with the CBS app, she was definitely ready to cut the cord. The very next day, she returned her cable box to a nearby Spectrum facility. When I went back for a second visit, Carol was satisfied with her new setup save for some internet buffering issues, which we went on to troubleshoot. At the center of all: CBS All Access Part of the reason Carol’s TV makeover went so seamlessly — and, realistically, I don't expect the other two to go as smoothly — is because of the aforementioned CBS All Access app, which the broadcast network released around two years ago. The service, which costs $6 a month with ads or $10 a month without, is closing in on 1.5 million subscribers, according to statements made by CBS CEO Leslie Moonves at a February conference. As far as content goes, All Access offers everything CBS currently broadcasts, plus the network’s past material going back more than 50 years, for a total of 8,500 on-demand episodes. Subscribers also get a live stream of their local CBS affiliate, which includes NFL games. Originally designed for CBS super fans (as opposed to cord-cutters), All Access is the only way to get the new series, “The Good Fight,” the digital-only spin-off of “The Good Wife,” as well as the upcoming “Star Trek: Discovery” series, slated for a fall debut. “The product originated from the realization that there were different levels of CBS fans,” Jim Lanzone, the CEO of CBS Interactive, told me. “For some people, it’s OK to have the last five episodes, but for others … they wanted more from us. This product is for them.” All Access is a bit of an outlier in the streaming universe, as the network’s broadcast rivals originally opted to put their content libraries online through Hulu, whereas CBS was initially a holdout. Now Lanzone describes All Access as a hybrid between CBS and Showtime. Or, in other words, a premium cable channel that lives in a digital TV utopia where there are no rules or ratings. What went wrong Of course, All Access becomes useless if load times and other hiccups destroy the quality of the stream, particularly when watching live TV. And Carol was rightly perplexed, especially as the Spectrum representative upsold her on a faster internet package at a 12-month promotional rate of $45 per month — download speeds up to 100Mpbs versus 20Mpbs — when she went to return her cable box. That rate will jump to $65 a month in a year, so she might evaluate other internet options at that time. Realistically, she had sufficient speed to stream before the boost, so we went through a WiFi router checklist: Is the router outdated? Nope. Carol's Apple Airport Extreme supports the latest WiFi standards, but she did need to update her firmware, which was an easy software fix. Is the router in the center of her home? No. This, I suspect, was the real culprit of her buffering issues. Carol had the router tucked away on the floor in a remote part of her home. The quickest remedy was to get the router off the floor. Now it’s on a desk. Is the router out in the open? Not exactly, but now that it’s off the floor, the router seems to be performing as expected. The end result is that the mid-stream freeze Carol was experiencing is now a thing of the past. Carol’s seemingly happy-go-lucky story did involve one nearly disastrous hurdle. When she canceled her cable TV subscription, she also had to switch the account to her name. Her late husband had been the primary account holder and she had put off changing the account for fear of complications. Unfortunately, in the process of the account transition, the email account included with her Spectrum service was shuttered and Carol found herself without access to more than 4,000 email messages, some of high-level significance. Thankfully, after several visits to multiple Spectrum stores, Carol’s email account was restored and her deleted messages were retrieved. All’s well that ends well, right? Perhaps. This TV makeover is complete, but Carol’s story isn’t exactly over. She must now continue her cable-free lifestyle without my hands-on assistance. I’ll check back in with her in a few months to see if this new entertainment diet sticks or if cable finds it way back into her home. Before — $185.38 p/mo.

Meet the other guinea pigs In addition to Carol, I’m helping two other households cut the cord. Steve and Alice Hire, 66 and 63, Allied Gardens, Steve and Alice are high-volume TV viewers. Unlike Carol, they will definitely need a cable alternative such as Sling TV or PlayStation Vue to satisfy most of their viewing requirements. As far as networks go, they enjoy USA, FOX, NBC, CBS, ABC, PBS, TNT, A&E, FX, SPIKE, GOLF Channel, HGTV, AMC, TRAVEL, SCI-FI, Animal Planet and TMC. They’re currently paying $217 per month for cable and internet service through Cox. They’re ultimate goal is to save around $70. Randy Ward, 55, University Heights Randy is a total sports nut who watches everything, including college baseball games, professional football, and lots and lots of soccer. He has a Samsung smart TV but primarily relies on his cable box after work to tune into whatever sports he can find. On the weekend, he’s also sports, of course. Otherwise, Randy watches TV Land for classic shows, as well as local and national news programs. Even though he knows he can negotiate a better deal, Randy has been reluctant to haggle with his provider, Cox, and has been paying $225 per month for cable TV, phone and internet.

Qualcomm says Apple’s refusal to pay royalties related to technology used in smartph... By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Technology Writer SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Apple is refusing to pay any royalties owed to mobile chip maker Qualcomm for some of the features in the iPhone, escalating a patent feud that has turned the former business partners into bitter adversaries. The latest twist in the dispute represents a major blow for Qualcomm, which depends on licensing fees for a large portion of its revenue. Apple's decision to withhold royalties will cost Qualcomm up to $500 million in the current quarter alone, based on revised revenue estimates that Qualcomm released Friday. "This is getting ugly, the level of hostility just went up another notch," said technology analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy. As retaliation, Qualcomm could seek a court order halting iPhone sales until Apple pays the royalties that Qualcomm contends it's owed, Moorhead said. Qualcomm hasn't threatened to go to that extreme yet, but its top lawyer made it clear on Friday that the San Diego company is girding for a fierce fight with its Cupertino, California-based Apple, the world's most valuable company. "We will continue vigorously to defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry," said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's general counsel. Apple concedes it and its suppliers owe Qualcomm some licensing fees on iPhone sales. But Apple believes Qualcomm has been abusing its power in the mobile chip market to charge for royalties on features that aren't covered by its patents. Qualcomm, in turn, has accused Apple of breaking contracts in an attempt to lower its licensing fees and also interfering in deals negotiated with iPhone suppliers. The stalemate prompted Apple to sue Qualcomm in January in a federal complaint. Qualcomm denied the allegations and fired back with its own lawsuit against Apple earlier this month. In a Friday statement, Apple said it won't pay Qualcomm any further royalties until the courts determine the amount, a process that could take several years. "As we've said before, Qualcomm's demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own," Apple said. Rosenberg reiterated that Qualcomm holds "valid and enforceable" licensing agreements on various features in iPhones. Apple's suspension of royalty payments marks "the latest step in Apple's global attack on Qualcomm," said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's general counsel. Apple isn't alone in its accusations against Qualcomm. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also has filed a lawsuit alleging that Qualcomm has been imposing unfair licensing terms on manufacturers. With the loss of iPhone royalty payments, Qualcomm now expects its revenue for its April-June quarter to range from $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion, down from its previous forecast of $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion. Qualcomm now expects its earnings for the period to range from 75 to 85 cents per share. That's down from an earlier projection of 90 cents to $1.15 per share. Investors shook off the shock of Qualcomm's lowered guidance after initially driving down the company's stock. Its stock rose 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $53.74 on Friday. The stock has fallen by about 15 percent since Apple filed its lawsuit. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

According to Qualcomm, Apple will continue with this until its dispute with Qualcomm is resolved. This follows a counter-suit brought by Qualcomm in an ongoing legal battle with Apple, in which it said Apple crippled its chips in iPhones so they would not perform better than Intel chips. Apple first sued Qualcomm in January, refusing to pay around $1 billion in rebates, stating that Qualcomm was overcharging for its chips and charging royalties for technologies it had nothing to do with. Qualcomm said it expects revenue in the most recent quarter to be $4.8 billion-$5.6 billion, down from the $5.3 billion-$6.1 billion it had expected. Qualcomm also cut its adjusted profit forecast for the quarter to 75-85 cents per share, down from 90 cents-$1.15 per share.
