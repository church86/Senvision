News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Records show history of incidents at Bright Futures Sunday May 7, 2017 at 12:01 AM May 7, 2017 at 10:35 PM Charity Lindsey Staff Writer @DP_CharityMatthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — Local law enforcement continues to respond to a private school here following an initial report of 132 calls for service that triggered suspension of the school’s state certification. Between March 12 and April 24, San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department deputies responded to an additional 10 calls at Bright Futures Academy, according to Apple Valley Station Capt. Frank Bell. While at least two incidents required deputies’ presence, according to Bell, half of the 10 calls were either false alarms or unmerited 911 calls from students, which Bright Futures Chief Operating Officer Pamela Lamberth previously said “inflated” the initial report. The report led the town to announce its intent to revoke the school’s business license, which Bright Futures appealed. The April 11 appeal letter states school staff “have called numerous times in the evening when our building was broken into (or) vandalized,” adding to Lamberth’s claim that the initial report “looks like there’s more calls.” The letter also proposes a plan to reduce calls for service to the school by hiring a deputy and an after-hours security guard for the campus, regularly attending Town Hall meetings and preemptively addressing concerns with the Sheriff’s Department each month. Meanwhile, Bell detailed a March 14 incident that involved a 14-year-old student throwing rocks from atop a building at the Apple Valley campus. “Four units and a fire engine had to respond with a ladder,” Bell told the Daily Press. “He ended up complying and was upset over some kids that had picked on him.” The incident follows a similar one in February 2016 during which a separate student broke his leg after jumping off a roof at the campus, according to a previous Daily Press report. Bell said it “seems kids get on their roof on a regular basis.”    Bright Futures is a nonpublic, nonsectarian school (NPS) that uses state funds to serve students with various disabilities. The California Department of Education suspended the school’s certification, effective April 28, citing conduct “harmful” to students with exceptional needs, though Bright Futures President Betti Colucci is confident that the Department’s ongoing investigation will reveal “nothing close” to the allegations made. A 2015 lawsuit also alleges harmful conduct at Bright Futures’ now-closed Victorville site in July 2013. The suit claims a school employee left Willie Walker, a 13-year-old student, unattended while they left to turn on the air conditioner, returning to find he’d suffered a seizure and a third-degree burn on his left leg, Riverside County court documents show. Attorneys for the school deny all allegations, including those of negligence and battery. A trial is scheduled to begin in June, court records show. But the gravest incident remains the death of 18-year-old Anthony Corona, a non-verbal, autistic student at Bright Futures’ main campus in Riverside, who became unruly while aboard a bus on Dec. 9, 2016, according to CDE documents. Corona isn’t named in CDE documents; however, the date and nature of the incident, which led to an investigation of the Riverside campus, parallel those found in a San Bernardino Police Department report. The driver stopped the bus to assist two aides who were attempting to calm Corona, CDE documents show. They implemented “emergency interventions,” which included the driver climbing onto Corona’s seat and pushing his back forward as Corona bit and scratched staff. At some point during the intervention, however, Corona became unresponsive, and staff called 911 and administered CPR. Corona was later transported to St. Bernardine Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead, according to a San Bernardino County Sheriff-Coroner report that listed the cause of death as “positional asphyxia while being restrained” and ruled it a homicide. A case was turned down, though, due to “insufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,” San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office spokesperson Christopher Lee. CDE investigation documents from March show that the “NPS acknowledged the emergency restraint used by the bus driver was an improper restraint,” and certification of the Bright Futures Riverside campus was suspended. Dale Nowicki, attorney for Corona’s family, said he hoped to work with Bright Futures to “get some closure” for the family, but he added school officials “have not been receptive to informal discussions.” But Colucci said the school immediately reached out to Corona’s family and offered support following “the tragic accident,” including making arrangements for the funeral. “We held a ceremony at school where we released balloons in his honor, and this summer installed a portrait of Anthony in our conference room as a reminder to our staff and students,” Colucci said. “While nothing we say or do can ever bring Anthony back, Bright Futures Academy has provided comfort and aid to his family, while we in the school community mourn the loss of our student and classmate.” Just as with its more recent investigations at the Apple Valley and Riverside sites, in March of last year CDE made an unannounced visit to Bright Futures’ now-shuttered campus in Perris in response to concerns of multiple alleged violations of special education law. A June 2016 letter from CDE shows evidence did not support allegations that a staff member physically abused students and encouraged them to “beat each other up.”   However, interviews between CDE, school staff and students showed “student behaviors were out of control on multiple occasions.” The letter states there was no incident report for a third grade student who, according to the interviews, sustained minor injuries on one occasion. CDE demanded Bright Futures provide a “plan of action” for correcting its noncompliance by August, but days before the plan was due, Colucci sent an email to the Department to state its Perris site would close effective August 31, 2016. “The students have either been transitioned to the BFA Riverside school or back to public school as determined by the (Individualized Education Program) team,” Colucci wrote in the email. “The closure of the Perris campus did not have anything to do with a CDE investigation,” Colucci told the Daily Press last week. “We closed Perris because it only had 20 students, and it was not cost effective … It was strictly a financial decision.” Charity Lindsey may be contacted at CLindsey@VVDailyPress.com or 760-951-6245.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 8 May 2017 | MYT 12:44 PM Apple starting US tech manufacturing fund with US$1bil Apple planned to borrow money for the new fund despite having a fortune in coffers overseas because of the tax hit that the company would suffer if it brought profit home, according to Cook. — Reuters SAN FRANCISCO: Apple chief Tim Cook announced Apple is creating a fund to get more people in the US to do “advanced manufacturing,” kicking it off with a billion dollars.  Apple investing in high-tech manufacturing in the United States would come as rare common ground with US President Donald Trump, who hammered away at the theme during his campaign for office last year.  ”We are creating an advanced manufacturing fund,” Cook said in an interview broadcast on CNBC.  ”We are initially putting one billion dollars in the fund.”  Cook pointed out that Apple spent more than US$50bil (RM216.70bil) in the US last year – buying from suppliers such as Corning Glass, working with developers behind applications for the California company’s devices and more.  Apple has about 80,000 employees in the US and plans to hire thousands more “in the future,” according to Cook.  ”A company should have values because a company is a collection of people, and people should have values,” Cook said.  ”One of the thing you should do is give back.”  Apple planned to borrow money for the new fund despite having a fortune in coffers overseas because of the tax hit that the company would suffer if it brought profit home, according to Cook.  And while Cook has been among Silicon Valley stars critical of Trump when it comes to limiting immigration, he endorsed a push for comprehensive tax reform.  ”To invest in the US, we have to borrow,” Cook said.  ”Comprehensive tax reform is so important to this economy.”  The first investment of the new fund will be announced later this month, according to Apple.   Showing up  Cook described it as wise to explore common ground with the administration while standing up when there are disagreements.  ”Most people, if you disagree and say why, you have a good chance at influencing things,” Cook said  ”You look to find common ground; if you don’t show up, I think that is the worst scenario because then you are quiet, and it doesn’t do your cause any good.”  Taiwan’s tech giant Foxconn in January announced a US$7bil (RM30.33bil) investment to make flat panels in the United States in a joint project with Japan’s SoftBank.  Foxconn is the world’s largest contract electronics maker and is best-known for assembling products for international brands such as Apple and Sony.   Apple last week reported a rise in quarterly profits, but logged weaker iPhone sales ahead of a 10-year-anniversary model on the horizon.  During a conference call with analysts, Cook said Apple was seeing a “pause” in iPhone purchases that he felt was caused by unconfirmed “reports about future iPhones.”  Still, the company contended that iPhone sales were better than it had expected, and skewed toward large-screen iPhone 7 models that have higher margins of profit.  It is a sign of Apple’s success but also a thorny problem: its cash stockpile has hit a staggering US$256.8bil (RM1.11tril), sparking debate on what do with such massive reserves.  Apple’s quarterly report Tuesday showed its cash holdings – the vast majority held overseas – jumped to a sum that tops the entire economic output of Chile.  The tech giant has resisted the idea of bringing the cash home, because of disincentives in the US tax code – it allows multinational firms to defer profits while they are held overseas but taxes income at up to 35% when repatriated. — AFP Related Stories You May Be Interested New phone?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 8 May 2017 | MYT 12:37 PM Apple’s dilemma: what to do with US$256bil cash pile Apple’s situation has highlighted the growing stockpiles of cash held overseas by US multinationals, now estimated to be between US$2.5tril (RM10.83tril) and US$3tril (RM13tril). — AFP WASHINGTON: It is a sign of Apple’s success but also a thorny problem: its cash stockpile has hit a staggering US$256.8bil (RM1.11tril), sparking debate on what do with such massive reserves.  Apple’s quarterly report showed its cash holdings – the vast majority held overseas – jumped to a sum that tops the entire economic output of Chile.  The tech giant has resisted the idea of bringing the cash home, because of disincentives in the US tax code – it allows multinational firms to defer profits while they are held overseas but taxes income at up to 35% when repatriated.  Proposals by President Donald Trump and lawmakers could lower the tax rate for repatriated earnings, an incentive for Apple and others to put the money to work in the United States.  While any company would gladly be in Apple’s shoes with its cash hoard, “there’s something not quite healthy about it,” said Roger Kay, analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates.  ”Normally, you would expect cash to fund investment opportunities, but obviously Apple doesn’t have any use for that much cash.”   Apple has become the most valuable and profitable company of the current era. But the unique challenges it faces because its earnings come mostly from the iPhone, which faces increasingly tough competition in a saturated smartphone market.   Long-term strategy  Apple faces periodic pressure to return more cash to shareholders with higher dividends and more share buybacks, and has already spent some US$200bil (RM866.70bil) doing this.  Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights >amp; Strategy argued that returning all the cash to shareholders “doesn’t help further anyone’s strategic interests” and that Apple needs to find ways to diversify its business.  One way to do this would be “going vertical,” or acquiring a chipmaker such as AMD to supply all Apple devices, Moorhead said.  Netflix, he said, could complement Apple’s business by offering content for Apple’s ecosystem of devices.  Moorhead said that if Apple – which has a permit to test its self-driving car system – is serious about autonomous vehicles “it would need to buy a car company” such as Tesla to ensure “the Apple experience.”  Bob O’Donnell of Technalysis Research said Apple has a staggering amount of cash and “could make enormous entries and completely rewrite industries” with it.  ”The challenge is culturally and organisationally, how do you integrate something that big,” O’Donnell said.  He said Apple has always sought to minutely manage details of its operations, “so making an enormous purchase goes against their culture.”   The tax conundrum  Apple’s situation has highlighted the growing stockpiles of cash held overseas by US multinationals, now estimated to be between US$2.5tril (RM10.83tril) and US$3tril (RM13tril).  Lisa De Simone, a Stanford University professor who specialises in international taxation, said the current code creates “incentives for companies to shift as much of their profits as they can offshore.”  But De Simone said a temporary tax “holiday” as Washington tried in 2004 would only increase the incentives.  ”Companies like Apple have only increased their income shifting in expectation they could get another holiday later on,” she said, arguing for a permanent tax change.  Georgetown University finance professor Lee Pinkowitz said companies with cash overseas are essentially holding the funds hostage to US policymakers.  ”The government already revealed in 2004 they were willing to negotiate with the hostage takers,” he said. “What you would expect is that more hostages will be taken.”  The Trump administration is seeking to encourage firms to bring those earnings home for investment and job creation in the United States.  But Pinkowitz said a major stimulus from repatriated assets is unlikely.  With Apple, much of the funds are held nominally by its Irish subsidiary but are invested in US assets.  ”Apple has almost US$50bil (RM216.67bil) in US Treasury and agency securities, so technically that US$50bil (RM216.67bil) is already here. It just hasn’t been taxed.”   Made in USA?  Could Apple use some of the cash to bring large-scale manufacturing back to the United States?  Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research said this is unlikely because of Apple’s manufacturing and supply process.  ”We simply don’t have the work force to support this scale of manufacturing,” he said. “No tax break is going to offset that entirely.”  But Kay said he sees potential for Apple to bring factories home if the conditions are right.  ”I could see a happy solution where contract manufacturers and Apple partner and train American workers to be as efficient as the Chinese,” he said.  ”It would take quite a bit to make it come true but it could bring down the myth that Chinese workers are more efficient.” — AFP Related Stories You May Be Interested Turkish court rejects Wikipedia's appeal over website's blocking Porsche opens digital centre in Silicon Valley Samsung Gear 360: All-round winner Apple starting US tech manufacturing fund with US$1bil New phone?

GDP is down, employment is up. Apple confounds the analysts with a financial report worthy of corporate envy, but the analysts were not happy, and seem to blame Apple for the analysts bad guesses! And then there’s printing shipments: let’s change the subject… it seems many printers are doing just that by changing the process. Do policies in your company insulate you from the detection of market changes and opportunities? It’s not always denial, it’s procedure. That’s not a good thing. By Dr. Joe Webb Published: May 8, 2017 Gee, the Economy is Slow... … but if you’ve been following this column and the webinars, you’re not surprised. Real GDP for the first quarter came in at +0.7%, lower than economist estimates and lower than trend. We prefer to look at the year-to-year comparisons rather than quarter-to-quarter, and to also look at the data without inventories. The fluctuations in inventories can make the underlying pattern in the data harder to see. Indeed, there was an inventory correction in the last quarter, and taking that into account the economy is still in the unsatisfying +2% range.  For those who like to compare how their business is doing against the economy, to equal GDP you need to grow at the rate of about +4.25% unless you adjust for inflation, and that would be about a +2.2% growth rate. Our recovery indicators had a slowdown in two of its six factors. The one item to be concerned about is our small business indicator or proprietors’ income, up +1.3% at an annual rate, which is actually negative after you subtract inflation. The NASDAQ is probably overdone in relation to various economic but its driven mainly by Apple and FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google). Much was made about the NASDAQ being at all-time highs, but it actually needs another 500 or so points for it to be there after inflation. A while ago we showed that investing in the NASDAQ starting at its true peak on a dollar-cost-averaging basis, ignoring dividends, through all those years of decline and its slow rise, the average annual return was 8%. It’s yet another case of ignoring the indexes and avoiding the quest for “the right time” to invest turning out better than it seems. Printing Shipments: Should “Everyone” be Worried? March shipments were not good. March has a history of being the best month of the year or among them. On a current dollar basis, it was barely over $7 billion, down more than $500 million compared to last year. That’s a -6.7% decline, and -8.9% after factoring in inflation. The negative pattern really got going with September’s shipments. The chart shows the period of October through March for the last five years. The latest period is down -4.9% in current dollars and -6.9% adjusted for inflation. I’ve been poking around the industry over these last weeks, and looking at various data sources. There are businesses doing well, absorbing the volumes of their deceased and struggling brethren, and the stream of “tuck-in” activities. It does seem that big and long-run printers are having another round of demand declines. Because they still represent a large share of industry shipments, declines there may overstate what small and mid-size print businesses are going through. It’s in those sectors of the market where I get positive reports from data-immersed digital printing operations. Traditional offset operations are in more trouble lately than they already were. There is the question about whether print in general is having problems, or if volume is just going elsewhere like corporate offices (no, more digital communications), inplant departments (many are closing, others are changing their services and print offerings), office superstores (many stores closing or about to), copy shops (not growing here either), and other places.  This is a chart of the year-to-year percentage change in CPI-adjusted US paper shipments. It’s not the best measure because it includes all paper, not just paper used in printing, but it does show that the value of shipments has been contracting every month since Spring of 2015. The steadiest sector of commercial printing has been screen printers. For some of the projects we’ve been working on lately, we’ve actually had to exclude the screen printing data from the industry wide data to work through the details of our analysis because it’s been so resilient compared to the rest of the industry. A lot has to do with their adoption of ink jet processes like wide format for some of their applications, but also because many corporate communicators are staging events and using with a lot of branded promotional goods. As for offset taking it on the chin, many of the digital printing businesses are doing better. Digital print smartly mingles in the expanding culture of marketing automation and analytics. These businesses should not be worried, but they should stay out in front of the trends. Everyone else should be worried, perhaps. The next big date for shipments data is May 18 when the Commerce Department issues revisions that may date as far back as but probably as far back as 2013. Revisions to other data series seem to indicate that the statisticians are raising 2015 and lowering 2016 data. All of this activity leads to revisions to historical GDP at the end of July. Managers can’t wait for the statisticians to get 2014 right. They have to make decisions about today. Employment Continues an Upward Muddle; Printing Consolidates The press made a big deal about payroll increasing by +211,000 after a bad prior month that was revised down. Long-term payroll employment is still mired in the +150,000 to +175,000 range, which affirms a slow and sluggish economy.  The unemployment rate fell to 4.4%, but as we have written previously that is no longer a good measure of the health of the labor market. What was good news, not reported, of course, was that full time employment was up by +480,000, and the household survey of all jobs was up by +314,000. Therefore, about 166,000 part time positions were replaced by full time ones. That tempered some of the negative aspects of the report, such as -162,000 leaving the workforce, one of the factors that nefariously improves the unemployment rate calculation. For the last 12 months “no longer in labor force” has averaged only -28,000 per month, so this reading was considerably higher. The labor participation rate, which is where we will see true labor market improvement (if and) when it occurs fell back to 62.9%. It’s been range-bound between 62.4% and 63.0% since April 2014. When the recession started it was 66.0%, more than nine years ago.  Commercial printing employment is down -10,500 workers since last year (-2.3%) and is now at 437,700. Non-production workers continue a general long term trend of declining faster than production workers (-2.2% vs. -2.8%), mainly the result of consolidation whether acquisition or closure. Growth in public relations employment looks like it's topping out, perhaps the result of more companies taking charge of their content marketing initiatives by bringing it inside and hiring freelance writers on their own. Ad agency employment is up, in recent months. Graphic design employment seems to be in growth mode again. Data, Expectations, and Reactions Apple’s financials were interesting, as usual, but what always fascinates me is the reaction of the markets and the stock analysts. The company’s stock price is often penalized because the analysts make incorrect guesses about the company’s sales and costs and seasonal patterns. Their same silly act goes on every quarter. Does your business run on hard data or guesses? Every manager has rules of thumb or assumptions based on their experiences, but these stock analysts seem to be in a much different place. As managers, when our rules of thumb or assumptions are not correct, our interest is piqued, and we find out what’s different. The stock analysts seem to blame Apple for not meeting their analyst numbers. That’s strange. Remember, as managers, we look at economic data because they are available, and we want a sense of whether what we are seeing is what’s happening elsewhere. What we do with our own businesses and our own customers and prospects is what really matters. Strongly held assertions create opportunities when businesses and their executives stick with their assumptions even though realities indicate otherwise. This creates a misallocation of resources and opportunities for competitors. One might say that about entrepreneurship. There is a strongly held assertion about an opportunity in the marketplace that others cannot see. But even entrepreneurs allow for those risks and the natural lag before data start to affirm their direction. The real problem is in larger businesses where there are organizational territories to protect and procedures and policies that reinforce out-of-date market assumptions. Yes, that’s you, company bonus and commission programs, built on existing products and capabilities that put blinders (sorry, I meant to say “encourage people to focus like laser beams on their jobs”). When marketplaces change, one of the first places that problems arise is in the compensation of bonused and commissioned workers. Sales fall, so those workers and top executives focus more on the jobs and customers they know. Difficulties in making forecasts are blamed first on the quality of the efforts and skills of those workers. By the time the business realizes that something else is the cause, they have already wasted time and resources trying to solve a problem for which they did not diagnose a proper cause. Yes, people need to focus on their jobs, but they also need to be encouraged to learn things from their interactions with the marketplace. They might not be able to interpret them, but they need to be able to report them to management. Both sides need to make sure that the information is not an excuse for poor performance but data that when added with other news and information helps management do their jobs better. Sometimes sales problems are sales problems, but sometimes sales problems are the company producing and selling the wrong things. Many printers and businesses misdiagnose changes business levels as fluctuations in general economic conditions. Media markets are changing: be aware and open to the reasons why and the extent of those changes, and what opportunities and challenges they bring to your business and your staff.

We'll show you! Apple Watch is like a shuttlecraft to iPhone's starship, but it's a shuttlecraft that still holds your data and is bound to your Apple ID. Before you sell, give away, or otherwise divest yourself of an Apple Watch, you need to unpair it first. That not only deletes all your private data, it removes the device from your account, and Activation Lock along with it. Unpairing and repairing can also be extremely useful for troubleshooting issues that have resisted every other type of fix. Important: Unpairing using the Watch app on iPhone creates a current backup that's stored on your iPhone. Unpairing by resetting your Apple Watch directly does not create a current backup. (The previous night's backup would be the most current.) If you absolutely need a current backup, make sure you unpair using the Watch app. How to unpair you Apple Watch using the Watch app for iPhone Launch the Watch app on your iPhone. Tap the My Watch tab at the bottom, if you're not already there. Tap on the Watch you want to unpair at the top. Tap on the Info button to the right of the Watch details (looks like an i in a circle.) Tap on Unpair Apple Watch. Tap on Unpair [Watch name] to confirm. Enter your Apple ID Password to remove activation lock. It'll take a few moments to backup your Apple Watch and complete the unpairing process. Once it's done, though, the Apple Watch formerly known as yours will be as empty as the day you unboxed it. How to reset your Apple Watch on your Apple Watch If you don't have your iPhone handy you can still wipe your Apple Watch directly from your Apple Watch. Just keep in mind this won't create a current backup on your iPhone and won't remove Activation Lock the way unpairing will. If you want to not only wipe your Watch but wipe it from your account as well, you'll have to do it later via the Find my iPhone app or iCloud.com. Launch the Settings app on your Apple Watch. Tap on General. Tap on Reset. Tap on Erase All Content and Settings. Type in your passcode (if enabled). Tap on Continue to confirm the reset. Any Apple Watch unpairing questions?

X Close Regional Home > News > Regional < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 8 May 2017 | MYT 7:30 AM Foxconn, other Asian suppliers ramp up preparations for iPhone 8 by bien perez Key suppliers of Apple in Asia are poised to ratchet up preparations for the next version of the iPhone, with Taiwanese contract manufacturer Hon Hai Precision Industry expected to handle the most challenging and expensive model to assemble, according to analysts. “While Apple has diversified its supply chain over the last few years, Hon Hai remains responsible for assembling the newest and most expensive model due to its long experience in the business and ability to ramp up production better than other electronics manufacturing services providers,” said J P Morgan Asia technology analyst Gokul Hariharan. “This time around, Hon Hai is handling the model that will have the most new features.” This time around, Hon Hai is handling the model that will have the most new features Gokul Hariharan, technology analyst, J P Morgan Hon Hai, widely known under its trade name Foxconn, is forecast by many analysts to be Apple’s sole supplier for the top-of-the-line iPhone 8 with a 5.8-inch organic light-emitting diode (OLED) touch screen, which is due out in the second half of this year. The two other new iPhones that Apple is anticipated to launch in the third quarter of this year are models with a 4.7 inch and a 5.5-inch liquid crystal display (LCD) touch screen. J P Morgan has reported that the high-end OLED “iPhone Pro” model is likely to have 3D facial recognition, front and back glass casing, a main camera that supports so-called augmented reality applications, wireless charging and a price tag of about US$1,000. Hon Hai, the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, may generate up to 50 per cent of its total revenue from the iPhone this year, according to a Citi Research estimate. The revenue exposure of rival Taiwanese contract manufacturer Pegatron Corp is expected to be larger at up to 55 per cent this year, while Wistron Corp’s is forecast at up to 25 per cent. “Apple continues to differentiate the higher-end models and further segment their higher-end models,” Citi senior analyst Jim Suva said last week. For example, the iPhone 6 super cycle offered larger screens for its 6 Plus model. The iPhone 7 Plus released last September delivered so-called dual camera functionality. “We would expect to see continued differentiation in iPhones with higher average selling price for OLED phones with dual cameras,” Suva said. Counterpoint Technology research director Neil Shah has said the introduction of cutting-edge features augurs well for Apple’s much-anticipated “super cycle” for the iPhone 8, which will see a large base of iPhone 5s, 6 and 6s Plus users upgrade to the new models. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world's largest chip foundry, is expected to start production of Apple’s A11 chip in July, according to Citi analyst Roland Shu. Also ramping up preparations are Hong Kong-listed companies AAC Technologies, for miniature acoustic systems, and ASM Pacific Technology, for the active alignment bonding system used on camera modules. AAC's estimated revenue exposure to the iPhone this year is up to 40 per cent, while TSMC is up to 25 per cent, according to Citi. Other prominent Asian suppliers for the iPhone 8 cycle include Taiwan's flexible printed circuit board maker Flexium Interconnect, camera lens module maker Largan Precision and casing specialist Catcher Technology; Japanese LCD manufacturers Sharp and JDI; and Chinese acoustic components provider GoerTek, touch panel cover glass maker Lens Technology and wireless charging specialist Luxshare Precision Industry. Samsung Display, a unit of Samsung Electronics, was widely reported last month to have agreed to a two-year deal to supply Apple with up to 92 million curved OLED panels for the iPhone 8.   "We believe that Hon Hai and Sharp will [also] spearhead investments in the OLED space," Hariharan said. Hon Hai completed its US$3.8 billion takeover of Osaka-based Sharp in August last year. For the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2017.

Nick Whighamnews.com.au@NWWHIGHAM news.com.au May 8, 20172:44pm Video Image Apple shares fall on surprise dip in iPhone sales1:24 Apple has reported a surprise fall in iPhone sales for its second quarter, indicating that customers may have held back purchases in anticipation of the 10th-anniversary edition of the company's most important product later this year. David Pollard reports May 3rd 2017 5 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during an announcement of new products in Cupertino, California on Wednesday, May 3, 2017. Picture: Marcio Jose Sanchez ARTIFICIALLY intelligent home speakers who talk to you and carry out internet-based tasks at your behest are the new big thing in consumer tech. And Apple is expected to finally join the party in the coming months. According to a report by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (dubbed the “best Apple analyst on the planet” by some), the tech giant is tipped to launch its own version of a smart home speaker with its famous AI assistant Siri at your beck and call. The report speculates that Apple will position the device as a more premium product than others on the market with superior acoustics and computing power, and a higher price tag to match. KGI’s report was reticent to speculate on an exact release date but said it could be as early as next month. Meanwhile Melbourne-based Apple leaker Sonny Dickson has predicted the company would launch the Siri speaker at its annual developers conference in early June, for the device to go on sale in the second half of the year. Apple has been working to majorly overhaul Siri and it's capabilities, for all devices, but most notably their upcoming smarthome device.— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) May 1, 2017 The potential home speaker — the likes of which are designed to be the focal point of a connected lounge room — would directly compete with Amazon Echo and Google Home which have carved out a dominant stake in the emerging market. And this week, we got a hint that Apple’s potential offering might look rather different to the home speakers put out by Google and Amazon. A young boy plays with an Amazon Echo. Picture: Ian CurrieSource:News Corp Australia Google Home had a strong focus on design.Source:AP In an interview with Gadgets360, Apple executive Phil Schiller espoused the benefits of having a voice-controlled smart assistant which includes a screen in the design — a feature missing from the Amazon Echo and Google Home speaker. “There is a lot of talk in the industry about voice-driven assistants and we believe deeply in voice-driven assistants that’s why invest in Siri,” he said. But the senior vice president of worldwide marketing at Apple said in terms of user experience, he didn’t think such products functioned optimally without a screen. “There’s many moments where a voice assistant is really beneficial, but that doesn’t mean you’d never want a screen. So the idea of not having a screen, I don’t think suits many situations,” he said. “For example if I’m looking for directions and I’m using Maps, Siri can tell me those directions by voice and that’s really convenient but it’s even better if I can see that map.” Apple’s developers conference, known as WWDC, will take place on June 5 to 9, 2017 in California.

The opportunity lies in a Trump administration tax holiday proposal aimed at bringing offshore earnings home. But because Wall Street only speaks the language of day trade, all eyes are on a Citigroup analysis released Friday that suggests Apple could use the windfall to purchase another mega-corporation like Disney or Netflix. It’s as if Apple, which has dodged tens of billions of dollars in taxes by stockpiling cash overseas, would have no choice but to use its newly domesticated cache to make rich people richer. We know that’s what giant mergers and acquisitions tend to do, not to mention the layoffs that go hand-in-hand with consolidation. It’s an opportunity to bring as much as $500 billion in overseas cash back home, and the same talking heads who were shocked by the housing crisis are now allowed to engage in a self-indulgent vision quest that presents a false choice and no benefit to average Americans, innovation or long-term economic gains. Here’s a better idea: Why not put the collective pressure of the media, Silicon Valley and Washington on Apple to establish the largest venture fund in the world to bolster companies that push the boundaries of what’s possible? Apple’s $250 billion in offshore cash could fuel hundreds or even thousands of the most promising companies in life science, transportation, cybersecurity, agriculture and more. This model has already been successfully pioneered by Google Ventures, the venture capital arm of Alphabet Inc. Citigroup’s analysis states that suggested acquisition targets by Apple — including Tesla, Netflix and Disney — were screened for five criteria: global scale, strategic fit, transaction size, having few non-strategic assets and a positive impact on Apple’s share price. I think there’s one more criteria — headlines. But no one is talking about what we’ve learned from the past. Fourteen years ago, former President George W. Bush enacted the Homeland Investment Act, a one-year holiday for repatriations of overseas profits that were required to go toward creating jobs and paying for research and development. But a study by three economists, including a former Bush official, concluded that, “Repatriations did not lead to an increase in domestic investment, employment or (research and development), even for the firms that lobbied for the tax holiday stating these intentions.” Instead, the study concluded, the money benefited shareholders at those companies because businesses were able to “reallocate funds internally to bypass the publicly stated goals of the Act.” History is going to repeat itself unless we stop framing the conversation as “cash of the titans.” Unless the American people wake up and start holding the empty suits and bad analysts to account, it’s unlikely that these repatriated funds will ever get past the wallets of moneyed shareholders and into our economy.

Under Apple’s plan, the 114-year-old building would host concerts, performances and education open to the public. (Courtesy Apple) Steve Jobs minted Apple as a top American retailer by designing crisp, modern stores with designs reminiscent of the company’s products. Glass boxes and aluminum panels abounded. But as Apple moves to turn its stores into experiences — places for concerts, art exhibitions and photography classes — the tech giant has begun to pursue distinctive, yet familiar buildings its customers might admire as well. In Washington, the company has set its sights squarely on the Carnegie Library, in Mount Vernon Square. One of thousands of libraries built nationwide with funds donated by steel tycoon and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, it opened in 1903 as the first desegregated public building in the city. There, Apple officials say they plan to restore the building to its original grandeur and outfit Carnegie as a place to hold a slate of free, open-to-the-public concerts, art exhibitions, workshops for teachers and coding classes for children. Trial programs in other Apple stores have included presentations from community artists and photographers, as well as concerts and talks from bigger names, such as when hip-hop producer RZA led an “Art of Beatmaking” session at the company’s Brooklyn store last fall. The company plans to release a fuller slate of events around the country this month. The ultimate goal, of course, is to sell more iPhones and iPads. Where the Carnegie Library once housed the city’s book collection, Apple plans a “Genius Grove,” a tree-lined sales floor where company reps will demonstrate how to maximize Apple products for music, photography or other passions. What long ago were reading rooms would become places to browse and sample Apple products. “This is a way of creating a reason to come to the store, to touch and feel our products, but also to have an engaging experience with someone who is passionate about the same thing,” said B.J. Siegel, Apple Retail’s senior design director. Finding historic buildings with stories rooted in their communities are part and parcel to the experience Apple is trying to create, Siegel said. The company in recent years has opened stores in a former restaurant bay in New York’s Grand Central Terminal, a Depression-era brick storefront in Brooklyn and in a 130-year-old former bank in Paris. Rather than plastering the buildings with the company’s logo, Apple’s designers say they will focus on restoring the building’s historic character. It can take a little work to find the store’s signage and logo — which is the point. “For us, it wasn’t about coming in and leaving our mark,” Siegel said. “It was about bringing the history back out and respecting it.” “We’ve discovered that big garish logos on historic buildings don’t work very well, so often we try to find more subtle ways to brand the building,” he added. Apple plans to introduced a large skylight in the Carnegie’s ceiling and host music, photography and art exhibitions featuring the company’s products. (Courtsey Apple) That couldn’t be further from the failed strategy of the last pursuit of the Carnegie Building. The International Spy Museum proposed moving into the Carnegie Building more than three years ago, but they sought to double the size of the 63,000-square-foot building by building two expansive glass-encased wings. The District’s Historic Preservation Review Board turned the proposal away. Apple does plan on opening up a skylight in the Carnegie Building’s roof above a central events area, and there are bound to be questions about handing one of the city’s more cherished buildings to a corporation. But there is wide agreement among District officials that the Carnegie Building could be better utilized. Despite its visible location south of the city’s convention center, it mainly serves as a office space for the Historical Society of Washington D.C. and a venue for the occasional wedding or reception organized by Events D.C., which manages the building. When Apple signed a letter of intent to lease the building, in December, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser issued a statement saying an Apple store there “could link D.C.’s rich history to our continued economic renaissance, will demonstrate the strength of our retail market, and will tell companies across the globe that the District is open for business.” Even the Historical Society isn’t going anywhere; Siegel said Apple considered it a benefit to have such a unique community institution as a neighbor and that the organization would maintain offices on the second floor. Gregory A. O’Dell, president and chief executive of Events DC, said he was “working to support Apple with its plans as well as our partners in the Historical Society of Washington D.C.” The company is scheduled to present its plans to the neighborhood Advisory Neighborhood Commission Monday evening. In New York, Apple picked up a historic preservation award for its work restoring the sort of buildings that, in Jobs’ era, it would not have considered. Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s current senior vice president for retail, considers it essential to the company’s future that it be more than a place to buy things. “Starbucks figured it out, for being a gathering place, right? ‘Meet me at Starbucks,’ Ahrendts told CBS this morning in a recent interview. “I’ve told my teams, I’ll know we’ve done a great job if the next generation, of Gen Z, says, ‘Meet me at Apple.’ ” Follow Jonathan O’Connell on Twitter: @oconnellpostbiz business capitalbusiness digger true Please provide a valid email address.

While it was originally stated that Apple would cut affiliate rates for apps altogether from 7 percent to 2.5 percent, the company has now confirmed that its original announcement was misinterpreted and the changes aren’t as drastic… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover In a post on the iTunes Affiliate Resources website, Apple confirmed that commissions for in-app purchases will be cut to 2.5 percent, while everything else will remain at 7 percent. This means that affiliate users will still receive 7 percent for music, movies, books, paid iOS apps and TV (via MacStories). We’d like to clarify some changes being made to the Affiliate Program. Commissions for all iOS in-app purchases will be reduced from 7% to 2.5% globally, and all other content types (including music, movies, books, paid iOS apps and TV) will remain at the current 7%. It was originally reported earlier this week that app purchases would stay at 7 percent, but Apple it’s nice that Apple has now confirmed that speculation. iOS app commissions: 7 percent In-app iOS commissions: 2.5 percent Mac apps commissions: 7 percent In-app Mac commissions: 7 percent It’s still unclear as to what exactly happened here. Apple’s original announcement seemed pretty straight forward in saying that all app purchases would be cut to 2.5 percent, so it’s possible that the company backtracked due to outcry from affiliate users. As we explained last week, the move to cut affiliate rates for in-app purchases only makes sense seeing that a lot of in-app purchases are renewing subscriptions. Apple last year reduced its revenue share for subscription purchase from 70-30 to 85-15, and these affiliate rate changes align with that For those unfamiliar, Apple’s iTunes Affiliate Program allows people to create unique links to apps and other content. Then, for every purchase, that user receives a 7 percent cut of the sale. The iTunes Affiliate Program is used heavily by many online media sites.

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Reviews iPhone iPhone 8 Rumor Roundup: Lightning Port, Rear TouchID, Edge-to-Edge Screen & More By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on May 8, 2017 11:34 AM The last couple of weeks the iPhone 8 rumor mill has been busy and chaotic to begin with. Apart from a number of possible new features that the phone might have, there are more reports of contradicting stance. While there have been numerous leaks so far, there are still a lot to be talked about the iPhone 8. Starting with new rumors of an edge-to-edge display that is somehow more similar to the one seen on a Samsung Galaxy S8. iPhone 8 edge-to-edge display Since the very beginning, many analysts and market experts have speculated that the iPhone 8 will feature a micro-bezel screen. Although details at the time were a bit murky at best, in the end, it seems like most analysts have agreed that display will span the entire surface area of the rumored phone. Analysts from Bloomberg, KGI Securities and others have given their pieces on how the phone would look like on release. Now, a new report from JP Morgan discovered by 9to5Mac claims that the iPhone 8 will not have a full-span OLED display that everyone has been talking about. Instead, it will feature a design slightly similar to the Samsung Galaxy S8. iPhone 8 rumored screen layout (via 9to5Mac.com) The screen is said to have an almost non-existent bezel on both sides of the panel. However, the top and bottom will be left untouched by the screen for various purposes. On the flip side, the same form factor and OLED display technology remain. Lightning port all the way When the AirPods was released last year, many have noticed its weirdly-sized Lightning port connector. A number of experts have chimed in that Apple, at some point, must have considered a USB Type-C instead of a Lightning connector. This rumor was further strengthened by Apple’s sudden change of design on the MacBook Pro 2016, in which it featured the new USB connector type. Not long after this, some experts have speculated that Apple is still considering the use of a USB Type-C on the iPhone 8 due to its more obvious performance gains. However, a recent report from Apple Insider suggests that Apple will still be using the Lightning port, at least for this year’s iPhone releases. Lightning port vs USB Type-C (via datapro.net) The article also said that for now, the performance of the Lightning port is not that far compared to a USB Type-C connector. However, it says that the switch to USB Type-C is quite inevitable due to the ever increasing number of devices using it. The iPhone 8 may not have the latest USB type port, but there is a strong likelihood the future iPhone after this year will switch to the said USB version. AirPods for free The recent JP Morgan report, as revealed by 9to5Mac, also claims that the iPhone 8 may come with a pair of Apple AirPods for free. While this may sound like a wild-goose chase, perhaps it really is. For one, the current speculated price of the iPhone 8 is well within the initial reports of $1,000. Adding the AirPods on it will be a bit too much. Even though the report claims it might come for free, but in reality, Apple would want the AirPods covered in its expenses. Furthermore, Apple is currently six weeks behind the shipping of new units of the AirPods. Including the wireless earbuds with the iPhone 8 will create more trouble for Apple in the end. Bigger battery and wireless charging In terms of battery, there have been rumors of late that Apple is trying out a new design for a battery assembly. Instead of the usual rectangular-shaped assembly, the one to be used on the iPhone 8 will be L-shaped. This new design is said to give an extra 30 percent more capacity when compared to traditional designs. Apple AirPods (via apple.com) It should be noted that this is not the first time that an L-shaped design for the iPhone 8 battery was reported. A few months back, KGI Securities’ Ming-Chi Kuo has also speculated the said battery for the upcoming iPhone. In addition to the new battery design, the tenth anniversary iPhone is still said to have wireless charging as reported earlier. However, it is still unclear how this will be achieved if the rumored construction of the iPhone 8 is with stainless steel and glass. Nevertheless, there is a chance that the stainless steel part will be the frame and the glass part is for the backing. There are various reports suggesting that Apple is still perfecting the design for the wireless charging feature of the iPhone 8. Earlier reports claim that the company is still trying to get over the issue of overheating on the said feature. Rear-mounted TouchID sensor On the subject of fingerprint sensing, Hong Kong-based research firm CLSA chimed in and said that it expects the iPhone 8 to have a rear-mounted TouchID sensor. The report also says that current in-display sensing technology is still very juvenile. That is why Apple might opt out of an embedded fingerprint sensor for the iPhone 8, much like Samsung on the Galaxy S8. iPhone 8 rumored design specifications by CLSA (via macrumors.com) Also from the said report, the said sensor will be placed much lower than the way Samsung did on the Galaxy S8. This location is expected to create less cumbersome usage experience as it is far easier to reach than that of the Galaxy S8. Improved water proofing for stereo speakers Finally, the last of the rumors centre on the speaker system of the iPhone 8. Apple has already demonstrated that it can provide speakers that are waterproof, as seen on the Apple Watch Series 2. Rumor has it that Apple will be improving on this technology and bring it to the iPhone 8 as well. According to Mac Rumors, Apple is making improvements on the current speaker design to make it more waterproof. In addition to this, the earpiece will also be enhanced on the iPhone 8. As to what enhancement that will be, the report did not clarify. The iPhone 8 is still months away from its supposed release. Consumers can expect more outlandish reports on the phone to crop up within the next few months. For more updates on the iPhone 8, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Windows 10S  Microsoft tries locking down again Posted on 8-May-2017 15:19 by Bill Bennett | Filed under: Articles : Bill Bennett At first sight Microsoft’s Surface Laptop and Windows 10S launch is all about education. That was the company’s emphasis at the product roll-out in New York. Yet there is more at stake here than putting computers in school bags. The announcement outlines a strategy for the stage of personal computing. If Microsoft pulls this off, it will once again dominate the sector. On the SurfaceSurface Laptop is Microsoft’s most ambitious touch screen hardware product to date. Previous Microsoft devices; Surface Pro tablets, Surface Book, Surface Hub and Surface Studio, are all niche products. They cater for minority tastes. The Surface Laptop is mainstream. It competes head on with hardware from brands like HP, Lenovo and Asus. The Surface Laptop is a direct challenge to Apple’s MacBook range. It doesn’t directly address Google’s Chromebook, but Microsoft developed the Surface Laptop with that product in mind. ChromebookChromebook is a basic, low-cost, easy-to-manage laptop. It has sold well. It is one of the few PC success stories of recent years. Chromebook sales have climbed while sales of most other computer formats have been in free fall. It is more sucessful than Google’s rivals expected. Above all else the Chromebook is strong in education. Yet that’s only part of the story. IDC’s latest market survey says Chromebook are now selling well to commercial customers. We can assume Microsoft understands the Chromebook threatens its PC business. Chrome OSChromebooks run Google’s Chrome OS. In effect, the operating system is the Chrome browser. Chrome OS is light on features. You can’t do everything with Chrome OS. You don’t have as much low-level control. But that’s a good thing for many customers. Lots of users don’t need all the personal computer trimmings. They just want to get a limited set of tasks done in an unfussy way. This applies in spades to young school students. More to the point, school students and their families are not willing or able to pay for a more powerful computer with a full operating system. You can buy a Chromebook in New Zealand for less than NZ$400. Brands like HP, Asus, Acer and Lenovo all have versions. This is less than half the price of a mainstream laptop. It is about one-quarter the price of the cheapest Apple Mac. In many schools Chromebooks have displaced Windows laptops. Microsoft botheredThat bothers Microsoft. Aside from the impact on today’s market share and revenue, there is a risk people will get a taste for Chromebooks. Youngsters growing up with school Chromebooks may stick with them later in life. Or if not Chromebook, something else that doesn’t involve Microsoft Windows. The no Windows habit could rub off on their families, friends and workplaces. Microsoft wants to counter that threat. The Surface Laptop looks great but it is not going to do that. For a start it is too expensive. It sells in the US for $1000. That’s four or five times the price of a Chromebook. It is a premium 13-inch laptop, more a competitor to models like the MacBook, HP Spectre and Dell XPS 13. It’s lighter and thinner than a MacBook Air. It costs less and is more powerful. That comparison is a whole other story that needs closer inspection. Maybe another post. We’re going to look at something more fundamental here. While Surface Laptop is inexpensive compared to, say, a MacBook Pro or Surface Book, it’s not going to shake up the education market. That job goes to Windows 10S. Where Windows 10S fitsThere are, of course, plenty of low-cost Windows laptops to choose from. Asus, Lenovo and Acer all have PCs in New Zealand that sell for under NZ$400. If you can afford a little more, there are plenty of better models for less than NZ$500. Low-cost Windows laptops tend to be clunky and inelegant. They are not powerful by 2017 standards. But, like Chromebooks, they get the job done. At least they would get the job done but for one problem. To claw back the dollars makers don’t earn from hardware sales, they load them with trial software. This often makes more money for the computer maker than they get from the hardware sale. CrapwareSoftware makers pay to have their apps included as standard on PCs. They may call their products trial ware or use some other coy name. We know them as crapware. The name is well deserved. These programs are ugly. They make for an awful user experience. They bombard people with messages. At times they can frighten less experienced or tech-savvy users. Some include marketing messages that border on blackmail. Crapware often slows computers down. It can introduce security risks. More than one of these programs has included a serious malware payload in the past. Other crapware programs report key information back to their owners behind the computer user’s back. Even the best crapware is annoying. It can pop up with a distracting, unwelcome message at an inappropriate moment. In effect, you can get a great deal on a low-end PC in return for accepting a steaming pile of crapware. What a time to be alive. Windows 10SBy locking down the computer, Microsoft says Windows 10S will improve security and performance. It keeps things simple. Windows 10S makes it easy for administrators to manage fleets of computers. And it locks out crapware. If you choose to stick with Windows 10S, and that’s optional, then you’ll only be able to install apps from the official Microsoft app store. Now that may not be what you want from a computer. But there are people who like the sound of this. Remember Windows RT?We’ve been here before. Windows RT was the Microsoft operating system on the first Surface Tablets. It had the same lock-down approach and similar restrictions. It was a commercial flop. RT cost Microsoft hundreds of millions of dollars. In practice, Windows RT was not an awful OS. After all Apple’s iOS is locked down in a similar way and that’s been a winner. The issue is that Microsoft Windows users want different things from their devices to Apple users. One of them is the ability to run tons of obscure, esoteric and, in some cases, poorly written niche apps. Creating a version of Windows that can’t run most Windows apps was a mistake. Unlike Apple, Microsoft failed to make sure the app store was packed with all the must have apps. Using the RT store was like walking into a shop with dusty, empty shelves and few recognisable products or brands. This time is different…?You may ask yourself what’s different this time. The simple answer is that Microsoft will force Windows 10S on the market. Most or at least many future Windows PCs will come with Windows 10S installed at the outset. Customers can upgrade, if upgrade is the right word here, to a full unlocked version of Windows 10 by paying US$50. Inertia and a reluctance to spend any money means many customers will never upgrade. Big guns buy-inAnother difference this time is that Windows hardware makers are joining the lockdown party. Some of the biggest names will have Windows 10S laptops on sale within weeks. It’s going to be hard for PC buyers to ignore these machines. The list of companies already signed up is a who’s who of the hardware business. With Windows 10S users will only be able to get apps from Microsoft’s App Store. That means the company gets to clip the ticket with every purchase. Independent developers may whinge, but the same approach has worked well for Apple. App gapWhen it arrives a lot of popular Windows apps will not be available for Windows 10S. Among the stand-outs are the Chrome browser and iTunes. The pair may not be your favourite apps, but they are popular. What happens when a user, who has paid a bargain basement price for their PC, learns they need to shell out another $50 to run Chrome or iTunes? The deal is worse than that. When you switch to the full version of Windows, you lose a lot of the security benefits. The responsibility of managing your system returns. Again that may not worry you, but it will be a problem for some others. Competition bashingIf you read the above section and thought Windows 10S will cause headaches for Microsoft’s biggest competitors, you’d be right. It’s no accident Chrome and iTunes were mentioned above. Google and Apple need to put their games theory strategists onto this one. Do they invest in creating Microsoft app store versions of their software? If they don’t they run the risk of being cast adrift from large numbers of their customers. Although it’s possible the disconnected customers might be the kind that don’t use their software anyway. EcosystemIf Google and Apple do build app store versions, they help Microsoft create a formidable ecosystem that may bash them again later. Windows 10S is likely to be a hit with schools and organizations that want to impose order on PCs. Otherwise there’s always a chance Microsoft’s customers may walk away from Windows 10S. People don’t have many other places to go. Chrome OS is even more locked down. Apple is less so, but the nuances of its approach aren’t always understood. Microsoft still accounts for the vast majority of PC operating systems. So it looks like it will succeed this time. But there’s always a possibility Windows 10S will be an RT rerun with even high stakes.

Noah Buhayar Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett waves to shareholders at the company-owned Borsheims jewellery store in Omaha on Sunday. Photo: AP Seattle: Underlying the festivities at Warren Buffett’s annual bash for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. shareholders over the weekend was a sobering fact: Finding the next big thing is hard. The Berkshire chief executive officer spoke at length on Saturday about his failure to pounce on opportunities in tech stocks, the challenge of lining up large deals, and his frustration with a cash pile that’s approaching $100 billion. “We shouldn’t use your money that way for long periods,” Buffett said of the cash during his meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. “The question is, ‘Are we going to be able to deploy it?’ I would say that history is on our side, but it’d be more fun if the phone would ring.” It was a notably downbeat moment for the billionaire, who’s spent the past five decades snapping up businesses and stocks. His investments transformed Berkshire from a struggling textile maker into a conglomerate with insurance companies, manufacturers, retailers, utilities and a railroad, as well as an equity portfolio valued at $135 billion. With thousands of adoring fans watching live (and many more streaming video online), Buffett and vice chairman Charles Munger took questions for five hours from the audience, analysts and journalists on topics from investing to public policy. Buffett, 86, said the Republican health plan that cleared the House of Representatives was sure to help the wealthy, and the billionaire reiterated his view that society needs to do more to help people he called “roadkill” because they get left behind by capitalism. The Berkshire CEO also took another swing at hedge funds. Most of all, the billionaire expounded on his company and investments. Buffett said Wells Fargo & Co. mishandled its response to a fake-account scandal. And he predicted that Berkshire could make “a fair amount” on its recent airline investments if carriers keep a stronger grip on fares, while acknowledging “it is no cinch.” Apple, IBM For years, Buffett and Munger have told investors that the company’s size would be an anchor dragging down performance, only to defy their own predictions. But some missteps are now underscoring their warning. Buffett recently scaled back an investment in International Business Machines Corp. and said that he was too optimistic about the company’s prospects in 2011. Berkshire has been piling into Apple Inc. in its latest technology bet. The moves prompted a broader discussion about whether Berkshire had dropped the ball in a sector that’s come to dominate the ranks of the world’s largest businesses. For most of his career, Buffett avoided technology stocks, saying the companies were outside his expertise. On Saturday, however, he issued a mea culpa for being too late to spot their potential. Companies like Apple, Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. don’t require the large sums of capital that were required to sustain the giant industrial firms of an earlier era, Buffett said. In hindsight, he said he could have been quicker to spot Google’s potential. Berkshire’s auto insurer Geico was an early customer of the search-engine firm, and its founders consulted him around the time they were taking the company public. ‘I blew it’ “I had plenty of ways to ask questions, or anything of the sort, and educate myself,” Buffett said. “But I blew it.” Buffett said his analysis on Apple differed from IBM, in part because the iPhone maker is more of a consumer-products company. Munger said the Apple investment was a good sign. “Either you’ve gone crazy or you’re learning,” the vice chairman told Buffett. “I prefer the learning explanation.” Steve Wallman, a money manager based in Middleton, Wisconsin, who’s been attending the meetings for more than three decades, said the remarks illustrated how Buffett and Munger are “fallible, thoughtful, and aware of how much the world has changed.” They went through “a litany of trends they missed, mistakes they made,” Wallman said. “I’ve never seen them exhibit so much vulnerability.” ‘Foot to the floor’ Buffett also expressed frustration on the acquisition front, saying Berkshire hasn’t put its “foot to the floor on anything for, really, a very long time.” The comment prompted an exchange with Munger, who said he thought Berkshire could now entertain deals up to $150 billion. That would represent a giant leap for the conglomerate. Its largest buyout was the 2010 purchase of railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe for about $34 billion. It’s not for a lack of trying. Buffett said on Saturday that Berkshire and 3G Capital were each prepared to put $15 billion into a bid by their Kraft Heinz Co. for Unilever this year. The offer was pulled after the consumer-goods giant rejected the proposal. David Rolfe, who manages about $6.8 billion including Berkshire shares at Wedgewood Partners, said he wasn’t surprised that Buffett is bummed out by the growing cash pile. Stock markets have been rising for years, making it harder to find attractive investments. ‘Cash problem’ “A run-of-the-mill bear market could certainly solve the cash problem” by offering opportunities for Buffett, Rolfe said. Berkshire gained 2.4% this year, trailing the 7.2% advance of the S&P 500 Index. Buffett’s company said after markets closed Friday that first-quarter operating profit slipped 4.8% to $3.56 billion, as insurance units faced claims from a cyclone in Australia. The stream of earnings is a growing challenge. The company’s next CEO may have to allocate far more capital than Buffett ever did, the billionaire said Saturday. That will involve deciding how much to deploy to Berkshire subsidiaries, takeovers and stock picks while also considering whether to return funds to shareholders. Buffett, who hasn’t publicly identified a successor, doesn’t pay a dividend and rarely repurchases stock, arguing that he can do better by retaining earnings. But investors pressed him about whether the record cash pile would force him to rethink his approach. “At a point, the burden of proof really shifts to us, big time,’’ Buffett said. “There’s no way I can come back here three years from now and tell you that we hold $150 billion or so in cash.’’ Bloomberg Noah Buhayar Topics: Warren Buffett Berkshire Hathaway Berkshire CEO Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meet Tech stocks More From Livemint READ MORE The people who will run France after Emmanuel Macron’s win India, Philippines to lead Asian growth as workforces rise: Nomura Some of the best firms have NPAs due to slow decision making: Shobana Kamineni First Published: Mon, May 08 2017. 09 15 AM IST Editor's Picks Making sense of Modinomics Is the ordinance empowering RBI the last act of bad loans resolution?

Photo: Jason Quah/TODAY Analysts see Foxconn as sole supplier for top-of-the-line model with 5.8-inch OLED touch screen, due out in the second half of this year mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 11:02 AM, May 8, 2017 HONG KONG — Key suppliers of Apple in Asia are poised to ratchet up preparations for the next version of the iPhone, with Taiwanese contract manufacturer Hon Hai Precision Industry expected to handle the most challenging and expensive model to assemble, according to analysts. “While Apple has diversified its supply chain over the last few years, Hon Hai remains responsible for assembling the newest and most expensive model due to its long experience in the business and ability to ramp up production better than other electronics manufacturing services providers,” said J P Morgan Asia technology analyst Gokul Hariharan. “This time around, Hon Hai is handling the model that will have the most new features.” Hon Hai, widely known under its trade name Foxconn, is forecast by many analysts to be Apple’s sole supplier for the top-of-the-line iPhone 8 with a 5.8-inch organic light-emitting diode (OLED) touch screen, which is due out in the second half of this year. The two other new iPhones that Apple is anticipated to launch in the third quarter of this year are models with a 4.7 inch and a 5.5-inch liquid crystal display (LCD) touch screen. J P Morgan has reported that the high-end OLED “iPhone Pro” model is likely to have 3D facial recognition, front and back glass casing, a main camera that supports so-called augmented reality applications, wireless charging and a price tag of about US$1,000 (S$1,404). Hon Hai, the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, may generate up to 50 per cent of its total revenue from the iPhone this year, according to a Citi Research estimate. The revenue exposure of rival Taiwanese contract manufacturer Pegatron Corp is expected to be larger at up to 55 per cent this year, while Wistron Corp’s is forecast at up to 25 per cent. “Apple continues to differentiate the higher-end models and further segment their higher-end models,” Citi senior analyst Jim Suva said last week. For example, the iPhone 6 super cycle offered larger screens for its 6 Plus model. The iPhone 7 Plus released last September delivered so-called dual camera functionality. “We would expect to see continued differentiation in iPhones with higher average selling price for OLED phones with dual cameras,” Mr Suva said. Counterpoint Technology research director Neil Shah has said the introduction of cutting-edge features augurs well for Apple’s much-anticipated “super cycle” for the iPhone 8, which will see a large base of iPhone 5s, 6 and 6s Plus users upgrade to the new models. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world's largest chip foundry, is expected to start production of Apple’s A11 chip in July, according to Citi analyst Roland Shu. Also ramping up preparations are Hong Kong-listed companies AAC Technologies, for miniature acoustic systems, and ASM Pacific Technology, for the active alignment bonding system used on camera modules. AAC's estimated revenue exposure to the iPhone this year is up to 40 per cent, while TSMC is up to 25 per cent, according to Citi. Other prominent Asian suppliers for the iPhone 8 cycle include Taiwan's flexible printed circuit board maker Flexium Interconnect, camera lens module maker Largan Precision and casing specialist Catcher Technology; Japanese LCD manufacturers Sharp and JDI; and Chinese acoustic components provider GoerTek, touch panel cover glass maker Lens Technology and wireless charging specialist Luxshare Precision Industry. Samsung Display, a unit of Samsung Electronics, was widely reported last month to have agreed to a two-year deal to supply Apple with up to 92 million curved OLED panels for the iPhone 8.   "We believe that Hon Hai and Sharp will (also) spearhead investments in the OLED space," Mr Hariharan said. Hon Hai completed its US$3.8 billion takeover of Osaka-based Sharp in August last year.

All other content types (music, movies, books, and TV) will remain at the current 7% commission rate in all markets. We will also continue to pay affiliate commissions on Apple Music memberships so there are many ways to earn commissions with the program. The drastic cut in the rate on apps and In-App-Purchases and the short notice took participants in the program by surprise. The May 1st deadline came and went seemingly without any change to the payout rate on apps. Apple has since posted a clarification to the iTunes Affiliate Resources website that says: We’d like to clarify some changes being made to the Affiliate Program. Commissions for all iOS in-app purchases will be reduced from 7% to 2.5% globally, and all other content types (including music, movies, books, paid iOS apps and TV) will remain at the current 7%. Anecdotal evidence since May 1st supports the clarification that the change to affiliate commissions affects In-App Purchases only. Links to apps and other content sold by Apple will continue to earn 7%, which is welcome news for websites and developers who rely on that revenue.

The much-anticipated Apple's foray into Andhra Pradesh got a fillip on Saturday following Naidu's meeting with the company's Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams. Naiu told Williams: "This is the right time for Apple Inc to invest in India as it has been growing consistently". "Being a state that has just begun building itself from the scratch post-bifurcation, Andhra Pradesh offered tremendous opportunities. Apple would do well to enter AP which has been adjudged the best state to do business with and has a productive young population," the chief minister said. Naidu will also receive the 'Transformative Chief Minister Award' during the United States-India Business Council (USIBC) West Coast Summit in Silicon Valley. The USIBC has selected Naidu for the award for his efforts to strengthen ties between the countries at the state level. The summit will see the participation of 150 industry leaders from sectors such as information technology, banking, food processing, healthcare, clean energy and digital payment. Texas-based Dell has expressed interest in setting up a data centre in the Andhra Pradesh capital. The technology giant expressed keen interest when Naidu met Srikanth Satya, a top executive of Dell in Dallas. Naidu visited the University of Silicon Andhra after the NRI CEO's meet. Various MoU's were signed with Innova Solutions, I-Bridge Inc and EVX Solutions, which is expected to create over 12,000 jobs. Andhra govt aims to have a computer expert, entrepreneur and artist in every house. Naidu also held a meeting with California Governor Jerry Brown and invited the US state to join hands with AP as "we build a greenfield capital with global opportunities". Among others who met Naidu were Gopi Sirineni, VP, Qualcomm, NIO USA CEO Padmasree Warrior, Mike McNamara, CEO of Flextronics. The leaders expressed their interest in AP's Fiber Grid project, and expansion of their respective companies in the state. Naidu appreciated the innovative efforts taken toward mobility and learnt about various features of the driver-less car at Waymo during Google X visit. On Saturday, Naidu paid humble floral tributes to Mahatma Gandhi's statue at the largest Gandhi Memorial in Irving, near Dallas. Naidu appreciated Prasad Thotakura, the person behind the initiative, and his dedicated management team for their relentless efforts in building huge memorial in 5 months with one million dollar budget and collaboration with Irving city officials. Naidu was later in the evening greeted at the community wide reception by thousands of Indian origin Telugu community members at Irving, Conventions Center. Indian Consul-General in Houston, Anupam Ray, welcomed Naidu at the reception and gave a quick overview of the Telugu community, praising them for their contribution in creating jobs and prosperity. Naidu lauded the Indian Americans and people of Telugu origin for their enormous contributions and said that he was looking forward to make Andhra Pradesh a model state for the rest of the world by garnering strong business alliances in the USA. Naidu is accompanied by his 16-member team comprising Finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu, Government Advisor (Communications) Parakala Prabhakar and senior officials, will visit Washington DC, San Francisco, California, New York, Chicago and other states. Agreements for sister-state relations with California, Illinois and Iowa, and bilateral meetings with 35 CEOs of some of the world's biggest companies will be the highlights of the tour. As per the Ministers US Itinerary from his office, he would visit the offices and manufacturing facilities of companies like Apple, Tesla, CISCO, Oracle and Flextronics. During the visit, he would hold discussions with the Universities of Stanford, Iowa, North Texas and Dallas. MoUs would be signed with some of them, like the one for collaboration in seed science with the Iowa State University.

That's a lot of loose change behind the couch cushions at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino. What should they do with that cash? While money in the bank might warm the cockles of Apple's shareholders' hearts, the best use for cash is doing something useful with it. Here are five things I think Apple should do with their cash (aside from cover my mortgage!). #1 Get real about their SVOD ambitions Say what you like, but Apple did change the nature of the music business, and to a lesser degree movies and TV, when they launched the iTunes Store back in January 2001. But since then they've been largely overtaken by the likes of Spotify and Netflix. Apple is rarely the first mover in markets. The iPod wasn't the first portable MP3 player, the iPhone wasn't the first smartphone, and the Mac was not the first personal computer. So, it's not surprising they haven't jumped into SVOD. But given they have faced numerous delays producing a series of Carpool Karaoke, I can't but think they need to invest if they want to meet the rising tide of Amazon, HBO, The CW and others launching their own SVOD services. Heck - even the WWE is doing a better job at the moment! #2 Invest in better software testing Why is it that almost as soon as a new version of macOS or iOS is released that we see a point release almost immediately? I think we have become so accustomed to buggy first releases that we are resigned to updating a week after an upgrade. Apple's advantage is that they control the whole widget. They dictate the precise hardware and software stack. I think they can do better. #3 Holograms baby! We've been fantasizing over holographic interfaces for years. Ever since River Phoenix was a database angel in the Michael Douglas and Demi Moore flick Disclosure, I've wanted a hologram-based UI for my computer. Apple's considerable cash and creative resources could make this a reality. #4 Cars, but not like you think I don't want to see Apple making cars. I'm not convinced it's a good strategic move for them. Apple's strength has always been about complete control of the user experience. But where Apple could make a difference is through an extension of CarPlay. I can see a place for carOS - a software environment that delivers more than just a fancy handsfree for the phone and pretty UI for the entertainment system and climate control. This would be a full diagnostic and experiential system that let you know when things were going wrong before they happened. It's the sort of data apps like Dash give you via an OBD device but integrated into a more holistic in-car experience. #5 Stretch their social justice legs This is the tough one. Apple is in a position to do more social good than most of us can imagine. They aren't alone in this but this is an article about Apple's bank balance. The same could apply to almost any other company with enough money to be considered their own economy. I think part of this would be to not engage in aggressive tax minimisation strategies and, instead, pay higher taxes so the countries they profit in can put funds into healthcare, education and other public benefits. It seems obscene to me that they can hold $250B in cash while diseases like leprosy, which are easily curable using modern medicine, are still prevalent in parts of the world. They could plug a few billion each year into important causes and not miss it. What do you think? What could Apple do with their bank balance?

Reply 0 slappy @slappy May 8, 2017, 1:43pm #WiseHacker, Yes that would be a great start, failing that I love #5. Reply 0 grunt @grunt May 8, 2017, 2:53pm One of the big problems is that most people dont understand the main reason Apple has that $250b in the bank. Mainly, they cant transfer it anywhere. Ideally, they wouldnt mind dumping a chunk of that into the US and paying out a big dividend to shareholders, but if they do the money becomes income, and taxed. There are workaround to avoid that (like borrowing a truckload of cash at near zero interest, then paying the capital debt from offshore money), and I expect a major purchase like what they are talking about would also work, but they need to be very careful as they try to use that income. Most Governments are looking for any excuse to tax these monies. Reply 1 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Underlying the festivities at Warren Buffett’s annual bash for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. shareholders over the weekend was a sobering fact: Finding the next big thing is hard. The Berkshire chief executive officer spoke at length Saturday about his failure to pounce on opportunities in tech stocks, the challenge of lining up large deals, and his frustration with a cash pile that’s approaching $100 billion. “We shouldn’t use your money that way for long periods,” Buffett said of the cash during his meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. “The question is, ‘Are we going to be able to deploy it?’ I would say that history is on our side, but it’d be more fun if the phone would ring.” It was a notably downbeat moment for the billionaire, who’s spent the past five decades snapping up businesses and stocks. His investments transformed Berkshire from a struggling textile maker into a conglomerate with insurance companies, manufacturers, retailers, utilities and a railroad, as well as an equity portfolio valued at $135 billion. With thousands of adoring fans watching live (and many more streaming video online), Buffett and Vice Chairman Charles Munger took questions for five hours from the audience, analysts and journalists on topics from investing to public policy. Buffett, 86, said the Republican health plan that cleared the House of Representatives was sure to help the wealthy, and the billionaire reiterated his view that society needs to do more to help people he called “roadkill” because they get left behind by capitalism. The Berkshire CEO also took another swing at hedge funds. Most of all, the billionaire expounded on his company and investments. Buffett said Wells Fargo & Co. mishandled its response to a fake-account scandal. And he predicted that Berkshire could make “a fair amount” on its recent airline investments if carriers keep a stronger grip on fares, while acknowledging “it is no cinch.” Apple, IBM For years, Buffett and Munger have told investors that the company’s size would be an anchor dragging down performance, only to defy their own predictions. But some missteps are now underscoring their warning. Buffett recently scaled back an investment in International Business Machines Corp. and said that he was too optimistic about the company’s prospects in 2011. Berkshire has been piling into Apple Inc. in its latest technology bet. The moves prompted a broader discussion about whether Berkshire had dropped the ball in a sector that’s come to dominate the ranks of the world’s largest businesses. For most of his career, Buffett avoided technology stocks, saying the companies were outside his expertise. On Saturday, however, he issued a mea culpa for being too late to spot their potential. Companies like Apple, Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. don’t require the large sums of capital that were required to sustain the giant industrial firms of an earlier era, Buffett said. In hindsight, he said he could have been quicker to spot Google’s potential. Berkshire’s auto insurer Geico was an early customer of the search-engine firm, and its founders consulted him around the time they were taking the company public. ‘I Blew It’ “I had plenty of ways to ask questions, or anything of the sort, and educate myself,” Buffett said. “But I blew it.” Buffett said his analysis on Apple differed from IBM, in part because the iPhone maker is more of a consumer-products company. Munger said the Apple investment was a good sign. “Either you’ve gone crazy or you’re learning,” the vice chairman told Buffett. “I prefer the learning explanation.” Steve Wallman, a money manager based in Middleton, Wisconsin, who’s been attending the meetings for more than three decades, said the remarks illustrated how Buffett and Munger are “fallible, thoughtful, and aware of how much the world has changed.” They went through “a litany of trends they missed, mistakes they made,” Wallman said. “I’ve never seen them exhibit so much vulnerability.” ‘Foot to the Floor’ Buffett also expressed frustration on the acquisition front, saying Berkshire hasn’t put its “foot to the floor on anything for, really, a very long time.” The comment prompted an exchange with Munger, who said he thought Berkshire could now entertain deals up to $150 billion. That would represent a giant leap for the conglomerate. Its largest buyout was the 2010 purchase of railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe for about $34 billion. It’s not for a lack of trying. Buffett said Saturday that Berkshire and 3G Capital were each prepared to put $15 billion into a bid by their Kraft Heinz Co. for Unilever this year. The offer was pulled after the consumer-goods giant rejected the proposal. David Rolfe, who manages about $6.8 billion including Berkshire shares at Wedgewood Partners, said he wasn’t surprised that Buffett is bummed out by the growing cash pile. Stock markets have been rising for years, making it harder to find attractive investments. ‘Cash Problem’ “A run-of-the-mill bear market could certainly solve the cash problem” by offering opportunities for Buffett, Rolfe said. Berkshire gained 2.4 percent this year, trailing the 7.2 percent advance of the S&P 500 Index. Buffett’s company said after markets closed Friday that first-quarter operating profit slipped 4.8 percent to $3.56 billion, as insurance units faced claims from a cyclone in Australia. The stream of earnings is a growing challenge. The company’s next CEO may have to allocate far more capital than Buffett ever did, the billionaire said Saturday. That will involve deciding how much to deploy to Berkshire subsidiaries, takeovers and stock picks while also considering whether to return funds to shareholders. Buffett, who hasn’t publicly identified a successor, doesn’t pay a dividend and rarely repurchases stock, arguing that he can do better by retaining earnings. But investors pressed him about whether the record cash pile would force him to rethink his approach. “At a point, the burden of proof really shifts to us, big time,’’ Buffett said. “There’s no way I can come back here three years from now and tell you that we hold $150 billion or so in cash.’’ © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

Arjun Kharpal CNBC May 6, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Getty Images. Apple executive Phil Schiller revealed he is not a fan of the Amazon Echo or Google Home smart speakers.More A top Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) executive revealed he is not a fan of either Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)'s Echo or Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Home's speakers, amid speculation that the company could be releasing its own rival product. In a recent interview with Gadgets 360, Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, took a dig at the devices—which have voice assistants built in. "My mother used to have a saying that if you don't have something nice to say, say nothing at all," Schiller said. Home and Echo both allow users to speak to them and get responses, or carry out "smart home" tasks like managing the thermostat and ensuring security. Apple has yet to release its own product, but a noted analyst recently said that the company is working on a device to rival Amazon and Google. "There is an over 50 percent chance that Apple will announce its first home AI product at WWDC in June," KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a note . WWDC is Apple's annual developers conference. Schiller did however give his thoughts on Siri, Apple's own voice assistant, and acknowledged that there are situations where a screen would not be needed. "For example, if you're driving (and) you want Siri to work for you without having to look at the screen, that's the best thing," Schiller said to Gadgets 360. "Or maybe you're across the room, and you want to ask Siri to change the song you were listening to - you don't have to walk over and back (and you can use Siri instead)." He added that while a voice assistant is "really beneficial" at times, having access to a touch screen device was still essential. "So the idea of not having a screen, I don't think suits many situations," the executive told the publication. "For example if I'm looking for directions and I'm using Maps, Siri can tell me those directions by voice and that's really convenient but it's even better if I can see that map, and I can see what turns are coming up, and I can see where there is congestion, I understand better my route, and what I'm going to do," Schiller said.

Amazon has long been rumoured to want to bring its Prime Video service to Apple’s streaming box, although content rights and Apple’s ‘conflict of interest’ with selling the box appear to have thrown a spanner on the works with the talks – thus far. You may remember Amazon chief Jeff Bezos claiming at the Re/code Code Conference back in January, last year, that Prime Video’s arrival on the firm’s platform ultimately hinged on “updated business terms” being put forward by Apple. Claiming that Amazon has no problem with selling the Apple TV via its highly-trafficked online stores -on the condition that Prime Video was available on the device- Bezos said: “When we sell those devices, we want our Prime Video player to be on the device and we want it to be on the device with acceptable business terms. We can always get the player on the device, the question is whether you can get it on with acceptable business terms.” Today Amazon’s Prime Video service features a wide range of exclusive TV programming and movies for those willing to pony up the required £7.99/mo for Prime, or £5.99/mo for Prime Video on its own. You can sign up for Amazon Prime – here. You’ll get to try it for 30-days FREE of charge, after which it’s then just £7.99 per month. / MacRumors More info iPhone + iPad Amazon Prime Video FREE Continue Reading You may also like...

The increased market value is worrisome.  Between them, the increase in market value since the US election is $600 billion (€545.5bn). Outside of the tech bubble 17 years ago, this increase in value is unprecedented. Apple has a market capitalisation of $775bn (€705bn), which has increased by $220bn (€200bn) since November. The company is one of the largest in the world, second only to Saudi Aramco, which may be worth over $1.5 trillion (€1.37tn).  It is very questionable whether Apple can justify being valued at over three-quarters of a trillion dollars given the company’s growth profile is very mature and may be only several years away when profitability peaks. There is no question that Apple has been incredibly successful.  Therein lies the problem. No company has been able to dominate the mobile phone market without ultimately experiencing a significant decline in value.  Companies such as Nokia, Ericsson, and Motorola dominated the market during much of the 1990s before other companies such as Samsung and Blackberry moved in. Phone hardware manufacturers are renowned for being slow adopters to changing technologies, fashions and trends.  Each one believes that their product is the best and that competition differentiation will fail to usurp their market share.  Blackberry is one of the best case studies in this regard. Management refused to believe customers would want a touch screen, a decision compounded by further mistakes that almost destroyed the company.  Apple is not at the same point as Blackberry but is likely to be approaching its peak operating performance. With annual revenue exceeding $230bn (€209bn) and net income approaching $50bn (€45bn), it will be difficult to generate meaningful growth. Apple management is also using the company’s significant cash balances to purchase shares in the company, while its shares trade at record levels.  As part of the company’s recent quarterly results, management increased their capital return programme by $50bn (€45bn), including an increase in the share price repurchase authorisation from $175bn (€159bn) to $210bn (€191bn).  Given Apple’s success, it may be a better move to use the cash to identify acquisitions rather than repurchasing shares at a market capitalisation of $775bn (€705bn) that no other company has been able to sustain over the longer term. The company does not appear to generate the level of innovation that built the core foundation of its products. In the industry the company finds itself, this lack of innovation is likely to stymie future growth prospects.  The current share price of $149 (€136) is difficult to justify and shareholders should be willing to accept Apple could quite easily move 30% lower. That would only put it back to where the shares traded last November.

May 8, 2017 9:11 Sponsored content from Appboy 0 When it comes to marketing, things are always changing—but in the last year or so, things have REALLY changed. Last year alone, we watched augmented reality break out with the rise of Pokémon Go, saw web messaging enter the mainstream as web push became available on Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, and witnessed Facebook bolster OTT marketing by throwing open the doors of its Messenger platform to third-party brands. But even if your brand has built a strategy to take advantage of all these new technologies and tools, it’s no time to rest on your laurels. 2017 has already been packed with new trends in marketing and we expect more to follow. Not all of them will reach their full potential. Some may fizzle out despite early promise. Even so, it’s important for marketers to keep an eye on emerging martech and tactics. After all, while it’s impossible to predict the future, it’s still essential to plan for it. To help marketers stay current and keep ahead of emerging technologies and tools, we’ve put together a list of five emerging marketing trends to watch (and maybe embrace) as we navigate 2017. Take a look! 1. TVOS, VOICE ASSISTANTS, AND OTHER EMERGING PLATFORMS When it comes to digital platforms, mobile is still king. But while mobile looks to be the dominant way brands engage with their customers for some time to come, we’re increasingly seeing other, mobile-compatible platforms emerging as potential marketing tools. Connected TVs are on the rise Television is poised to emerge as a platform, with brands looking for ways to reach customers on their TVs using Apple TV, Chromecast, Roku, and other set-top devices. Auto-focused customer communication and user engagement via Amazon Echo, Google Home, and other in-home assistants are also attracting a lot of attention. Expect to see notifications in some form on at least one of these platforms by year’s end. 2. THE PLATFORM-AGNOSTIC EXPERIENCE Starting at last year’s editions of WWDC and Google I/O, we’ve seen Google and Apple taking steps to reduce the difference in experience and any friction between mobile apps and websites, as well as between mobile devices and desktop and laptop computers, in order to provide users with an increasingly seamless experience across platforms. These changes, including Google’s launch of Android Instant Apps and Accelerated Mobile Pages(AMP) initiatives, and Apple’s expansion of popular iOS features (including Siri and Apple Pay) to desktop, reflect an emerging view of what users want from their digital experience—namely a single, continuous, platform-agnostic user experience, instead of one that treats apps and websites (and smartphones and desktop computers) as walled gardens. Expect to see that dream come closer to fruition as more brands take steps to embrace cross-platform user profiles and begin leveraging the tools that Google and Apple have made available. 3. EFFECTIVE USE OF CUSTOMER LOCATION AND SEND-TIME DATA The arrival of mobile revolutionised marketing makes it possible to collect more (and more detailed) data on customer preferences and behaviour than ever before, supporting intimate, personalised customer-brand relationships on an unprecedented global scale. As technology advances, we’re poised to see that data collection—and the customer engagement tactics that data makes possible—become even more nuanced and effective. The growing popularity of wearables like the Apple Watch and fitness devices from Fitbit, Jawbone, and other brands, has the potential to kick off a new wave of body-focused customer data tracking, while the ever-present nature of mobile devices and massive reach of Google and other major tech brands is making it easier to track when a customer is at home or at work, as well as when they’re walking, driving, bicycling, or standing still. This type of granular data has the potential to make tools like send-time optimisation even more effective at assessing ideal delivery times, and could support a level of message personalisation surpassing what’s possible today. Look for forward-thinking brands to start collecting and using this kind of customer information in their user outreach throughout this year. 4. SMARTER AUTOMATION LIKE CHATBOTS AND AI When people think about artificial intelligence, there’s a tendency to jump to visions of an apocalyptic Skynet-like future where machines have replaced all human activity—or to a futuristic utopia where smart robots have replaced all the human activity we find annoying to deal with. But while either of those futures is likely to be a long way off, expect marketers to more effectively leverage the increasingly smart automation tools that have been emerging. The H&M chatbot on the Kik platform Chatbots have already become a memorable way for brands to interact with customers on OTT messaging platforms, but there’s still a lot of room for growth, especially as AI allows these bots to engage with users like two people having a conversation, instead of a digital version of an old-school phone tree. A similar trend is taking place in mobile-focused marketing platforms as marketers are increasingly given tools that take advantage of advanced automation and predictive analytics to more effectively reach customers. Look out for tools like send-time optimisation joined by other smart automation features. 5. POINT OF SALE AND REAL-WORLD DIGITAL EXPERIENCES While a truly seamless user experience in today’s mobile-first world will require eliminating the silos between different platforms and devices, it’s also going to mean reducing the distance between the real world and users’ digital experience. That’s not going to happen overnight, but look for companies more closely connecting their brick-and-mortar locations with their mobile and web experiences throughout the rest of 2017. Facebook Messenger Code example (Source: The Verge) That could mean integrating point-of-sale data into their digital marketing platforms to allow for digital engagement based on purchases made in person, more sophisticated location-based marketing using Wi-Fi or beacons (if beacons end up actually happening), or following in Snapchat and Facebook’s footsteps by creating visual codes that can trigger app opens or website visits when users view them with their smartphones.

Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg Underlying the festivities at Warren Buffett’s annual bash for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. shareholders over the weekend was a sobering fact: Finding the next big thing is hard. The Berkshire chief executive officer spoke at length Saturday about his failure to pounce on opportunities in tech stocks, the challenge of lining up large deals, and his frustration with a cash pile that’s approaching $100 billion. “We shouldn’t use your money that way for long periods,” Buffett said of the cash during his meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. “The question is, ‘Are we going to be able to deploy it?’ I would say that history is on our side, but it’d be more fun if the phone would ring.” It was a notably downbeat moment for the billionaire, who’s spent the past five decades snapping up businesses and stocks. His investments transformed Berkshire from a struggling textile maker into a conglomerate with insurance companies, manufacturers, retailers, utilities and a railroad, as well as an equity portfolio valued at $135 billion. With thousands of adoring fans watching live (and many more streaming video online), Buffett and Vice Chairman Charles Munger took questions for five hours from the audience, analysts and journalists on topics from investing to public policy. Buffett, 86, said the Republican health plan that cleared the House of Representatives was sure to help the wealthy, and the billionaire reiterated his view that society needs to do more to help people he called “ roadkill” because they get left behind by capitalism. The Berkshire CEO also took another swing at hedge funds. Most of all, the billionaire expounded on his company and investments. Buffett said Wells Fargo & Co. mishandled its response to a fake-account scandal. And he predicted that Berkshire could make “a fair amount” on its recent airline investments if carriers keep a stronger grip on fares, while acknowledging “it is no cinch.” Apple, IBM For years, Buffett and Munger have told investors that the company’s size would be an anchor dragging down performance, only to defy their own predictions. But some missteps are now underscoring their warning. Buffett recently scaled back an investment in International Business Machines Corp. and said that he was too optimistic about the company’s prospects in 2011. Berkshire has been piling into Apple Inc. in its latest technology bet. The moves prompted a broader discussion about whether Berkshire had dropped the ball in a sector that’s come to dominate the ranks of the world’s largest businesses. For most of his career, Buffett avoided technology stocks, saying the companies were outside his expertise. On Saturday, however, he issued a mea culpa for being too late to spot their potential. Companies like Apple, Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. don’t require the large sums of capital that were required to sustain the giant industrial firms of an earlier era, Buffett said. In hindsight, he said he could have been quicker to spot Google’s potential. Berkshire’s auto insurer Geico was an early customer of the search-engine firm, and its founders consulted him around the time they were taking the company public. ‘I Blew It’ “I had plenty of ways to ask questions, or anything of the sort, and educate myself,” Buffett said. “But I blew it.” Buffett said his analysis on Apple differed from IBM, in part because the iPhone maker is more of a consumer-products company. Munger said the Apple investment was a good sign. “Either you’ve gone crazy or you’re learning,” the vice chairman told Buffett. “I prefer the learning explanation.” Steve Wallman, a money manager based in Middleton, Wisconsin, who’s been attending the meetings for more than three decades, said the remarks illustrated how Buffett and Munger are “fallible, thoughtful, and aware of how much the world has changed.” They went through “a litany of trends they missed, mistakes they made,” Wallman said. “I’ve never seen them exhibit so much vulnerability.” ‘Foot to the Floor’ Buffett also expressed frustration on the acquisition front, saying Berkshire hasn’t put its “foot to the floor on anything for, really, a very long time.” The comment prompted an exchange with Munger, who said he thought Berkshire could now entertain deals up to $150 billion. That would represent a giant leap for the conglomerate. Its largest buyout was the 2010 purchase of railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe for about $34 billion. It’s not for a lack of trying. Buffett said Saturday that Berkshire and 3G Capital were each prepared to put $15 billion into a bid by their Kraft Heinz Co. for Unilever this year. The offer was pulled after the consumer-goods giant rejected the proposal. David Rolfe, who manages about $6.8 billion including Berkshire shares at Wedgewood Partners, said he wasn’t surprised that Buffett is bummed out by the growing cash pile. Stock markets have been rising for years, making it harder to find attractive investments. ‘Cash Problem’ “A run-of-the-mill bear market could certainly solve the cash problem” by offering opportunities for Buffett, Rolfe said. Berkshire gained 2.4 percent this year, trailing the 7.2 percent advance of the S&P 500 Index. Buffett’s company said after markets closed Friday that first-quarter operating profit slipped 4.8 percent to $3.56 billion, as insurance units faced claims from a cyclone in Australia. The stream of earnings is a growing challenge. The company’s next CEO may have to allocate far more capital than Buffett ever did, the billionaire said Saturday. That will involve deciding how much to deploy to Berkshire subsidiaries, takeovers and stock picks while also considering whether to return funds to shareholders. Buffett, who hasn’t publicly identified a successor, doesn’t pay a dividend and rarely repurchases stock, arguing that he can do better by retaining earnings. But investors pressed him about whether the record cash pile would force him to rethink his approach. “At a point, the burden of proof really shifts to us, big time,’’ Buffett said. “There’s no way I can come back here three years from now and tell you that we hold $150 billion or so in cash.’’ Watch Next: Berkshire After Buffett Berkshire After Buffett Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Home Apple News Apple Rumors iPhone iPad iPod Mac Apple TV Apple Watch About Apple Rumors iPhone 8 Rumours Share on Facebook iPhone 8: Why Apple prefers Lightning to USB-C Apple is preparing to launch three new iPhone models by the end of 2017. The company will introduce an iPhone 7s, an iPhone 7s Plus and an iPhone 8 (iPhone X or iPhone Edition) to mark the 10th anniversary of the smartphone. The iPhone 8 special edition will have features and unique features. It is speculated that it will feature a dual camera, wireless charge, OLED screen and a completely new design. But, for what it seems to be, chances are that Apple will NOT include a USB-C port on the iPhone 8 . Maintaining this way the USB Lightning port in the terminal.   Load The USB-C power works best and is compatible with many more devices. But, despite the facilities offered by the USB-C connector over the USB Lightning connector, it is virtually irrelevant if Apple has the wireless charging system already devised for the iPhone 8. Transfer speed In theory, the USB-C port wins in this category. Although the Lightning port is able to offer USB 3 transfer speeds given certain circumstances. There is a combination of hardware that allows transfer of speed USB 3: an iPad Pro of 12.9 inches with the camera adapter Lightning to USB 3. This curious feature does not exist on another iOS device. But the iPhone of the future could achieve the same transfer speed while maintaining Apple’s USB Lightning port.   However, the bite apple company believes in a future without cables. A clear example of this was the withdrawal of the jack connector for EarPods on the iPhone 7. Thus, Apple does not have the need to migrate to the USB-C port.

The Company posted quarterly revenue of $52.9 billion and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $2.10. These results compare to revenue of $50.6 billion and earnings per diluted share of $1.90 in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 65 percent of the quarter’s revenue. “We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’ve seen great customer response to both models of the new iPhone 7 (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition and we’re thrilled with the strong momentum of our Services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter. Looking ahead, we are excited to welcome attendees from around the world to our annual Worldwide Developers Conference next month in San Jose.” Apple also announced that its Board of Directors has authorized an increase of $50 billion to the Company’s program to return capital to shareholders and is extending the program timeframe by four quarters.  Under the expanded program, Apple plans to spend a cumulative total of $300 billion by the end of March 2019. “We generated strong operating cash flow of $12.5 billion and returned over $10 billion to our investors in the March quarter,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “Given the strength of our business and our confidence in our future, we are happy to announce another $50 billion increase to our capital return program today.” As part of the latest update to the program, the Board has increased its share repurchase authorization to $210 billion from the $175 billion level announced a year ago. The Company also expects to continue to net-share-settle vesting restricted stock units. The Board has approved a 10.5% increase to the Company’s quarterly dividend, and has declared a dividend of $0.63 per share of the Company’s common stock, payable on May 18, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 15, 2017. From the inception of its capital return program in August 2012 through March 2017, Apple has returned over $211 billion to shareholders, including $151 billion in share repurchases. The Company plans to continue to access the domestic and international debt markets to assist in funding the program. The management team and the Board will continue to review each element of the capital return program regularly and plan to provide an update on the program on an annual basis. Apple is providing the following guidance for its fiscal 2017 third quarter:   revenue between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent operating expenses between $6.6 billion and $6.7 billion other income/(expense) of $450 million tax rate of 25.5 percent Apple will provide live streaming of its Q2 2017 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PDT on May 2, 2017 at www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/.

And while social media was abuzz with what all that amount of money could hypothetically buy or finance, some analysts took a more realistic approach. According to Citibank analyst Jim Suva, the company will likely use part of the money to fund an acquisition, and among the seven potential targets listed in the Citibank note are names like Tesla, Netflix and Walt Disney, Reuters reported. Among those three, Tesla is currently the cheapest, in terms of market capitalization. The Elon Musk company recently overtook well-entrenched rivals, Ford and General Motors, and had a market cap of $52.84 billion at the close of Friday trade on Nasdaq. By comparison, Netflix had a market cap of $67.22 billion at close of trade, and Walt Disney, whose shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange, is valued much higher at over $178 billion. Read: Tesla To Launch Pick-Up Trucks In September All three, however, are still well within Apple’s reach, and if the company bought even two of them, it would still have cash to spare. However, will any of those companies be willing to sell itself to Apple, is another matter altogether. Tesla, for one, seems unlikely to be in a hurry to be acquired by anyone. In its own earnings call earlier this week, Tesla revealed it was automating the process of manufacturing for the upcoming Model 3 sedan. And Musk reportedly said in an interview that increased mechanization of the production line would make his company as valuable as Apple.

Photo: REUTERS/Noah Berger The other four potential targets for acquisition by Apple, listed by the Citibank analyst, were video streaming service Hulu, and video game developers Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts and Take Two Interactive Software. Hulu isn’t publicly traded, and the other three companies have market caps of $41.12 billion, $29.82 billion and $6.82 billion respectively. All three trade on Nasdaq. According to Suva, Apple could be in a rush to spend its cash pile to take advantage of a new tax proposal by President Donald Trump’s administration. The proposal is to allow U.S.-based multinational companies to repatriate their earnings outside the country at a tax rate of 10 percent, down from the current 35 percent. Over 90 percent of the Cupertino, California, company’s cash is parked outside the U.S. “Since one of the new administration’s top priorities is to allow U.S. companies to repatriate overseas cash at a lower tax rate, Apple may have a more acute need to put this cash to use, Reuters quoted Suva as saying. Read: Apple Hires NASA Engineers For Self-Driving Car Project If Trump’s tax proposal becomes the law, and Apple brings back all of its cash reserves to the U.S., it would still be sitting on over $220 billion, enough to buy any of the companies mentioned in Suva’s note, and then some. Apple, also traded on Nasdaq, is the world’s most valuable company. It closed Friday trade with a market cap of $789.53 billion.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Here's A Roundup Of All The iPhone 8 Rumors Denisse Moreno International Business Times May 7, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share All iPhone 8 OLED models will have curved displays, according to a report by Korea Herald.More With facts about Apple’s much-anticipated iPhone 8 scarce, rumors abound prior to its expected fall release — so many that it’s hard to keep up. It seems like every day there is new information about the iPhone 8, and Apple has hinted it’s not so happy about that. CEO Tim Cook recently blamed the “pause” in purchases of its current iPhone models on rumors about possible iPhone 8 features during his second-quarter 2017 earnings call this week. Read: iPhone 8 Rumors: Mock-Up Video Shows How Apple's Next Edition Might Look If you’re looking to buy the iPhone 8 this fall, here’s an overview of the device’s rumored features, release date and possible delay. iPhone 8 Rumored Features Display The upcoming iPhone 8,  which could also be called the iPhone X, iPhone Pro or iPhone Edition, reportedly will come with an OLED edge-to-edge display. Apple was said to have placed orders for OLED panels from Samsung for its upcoming model. The company also reportedly signed a two-year deal worth $9 billion with Samsung for OLED panels. The iPhone 8 is rumored to be released with the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, which are expected to come with LCD displays. iPhone 8 Smart Connector: AR and VR, Wireless Charging KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested earlier this year Apple’s 2017 iPhone lineup will feature wireless charging. Another report said the iPhone 8 will come with a wireless charging feature through Apple’s Smart Connector, which is used on the iPad Pro. The Smart Connector could also support augmented reality and virtual reality accessories, the Verifier reported. In February, it was revealed Apple had 1,000 engineers working on a project in Israel that could be related to AR. Embedded Touch ID Apple reportedly will embed the iPhone 8’s Touch ID into the screen display. However, an analyst from Cowen and Co. said last month the embedded Touch ID feature was the one causing Apple the most trouble. If Apple can’t embed the Touch ID into the front screen, it might ditch the idea completely and focus on face recognition. Apple could also move the Touch ID to the back of the screen, or delay the production of the 10th anniversary iPhone, the analyst said. 3D-Sensing Camera In February Kuo, suggested the iPhone 8 could have a 3D-sensing front camera. Other reports have suggested Himax Technologies will supply 3D sensors for Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8. Another report said Himax will supply components for Apple, adding that optical and photonic products manufacturer Lumentum will supply parts as well. Enhanced Siri Rumors suggest Apple’s next iPhone lineup will feature an improved version of Siri. A report in January said Apple was looking into revamping Siri to compete with other digital assistants, including the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Apple also reportedly will boost Siri with contextual learning abilities and deep integration with iMessage and iCloud in its upcoming iOS 11 update. Read: iPhone 8 Release Date Rumors: Apple Working On Advanced Camera Systems, Curved Screens, Stainless Steel Frame Vertical Dual Camera A Bloomberg report last month said Apple was testing more advanced cameras for the iPhone 8. The company reportedly will position the dual-camera system on the back of the device vertically instead of horizontally, unlike the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple was said to be testing dual-lenses for the front camera, an upgrade from last year’s models. iPhone 8 Leaks A picture of what is supposed to be a case for the iPhone 8 was leaked on Twitter at the end of April. The case shows a section for a vertical dual-camera. It also shows a longer power button on the bottom of the device, compared to the current smaller lightning port. Around the same time, a schematic of the iPhone 8 was also leaked. The schematic showed a spot for a vertical dual-camera and a circular hole underneath the logo, which could suggest a Touch ID placed on the back of the iPhone. iPhone 8 Release Date, Pre-Orders, Price The iPhone 8 is expected to launch in September, as Apple usually does. However, Kuo said the 10th anniversary iPhone could face "severe supply shortages" when it releases. Meanwhile, analyst Brian White previously said Apple will introduce the iPhone 8 and take preorders in September, but deliveries might not start until “several weeks later.” Read More The iPhone 8 is rumored to have a price tag exceeding $1,000. iPhone 8 Delay Rumors Although some reports point to a September release of the iPhone 8, others suggest the launch could be delayed. Some rumors point to a delayed release date because of key components for the 3D-sensing camera. Another report said the iPhone 8 could be delayed until late October or November, pointing to trouble with Apple’s OLED display order. Another reason for Apple’s delay is that the company and its suppliers are working to patch up overheating problems with wireless charging components.

Rather than include a dedicated “second” speaker, Apple configured the earpiece (or receiver) speaker to serve double duty as another loudspeaker. The decision makes sense on paper but as I highlighted in my review last October, the quality of the second earpiece speaker as a loudspeaker left a lot to be desired. If a recent research note from JPMorgan proves accurate, Apple apparently got the memo and will remedy the shortcoming with the iPhone 8. As MacRumors points out, the analysts’ note indicates that the new iPhone will feature an “enhanced” receive that’ll afford “further improvements” to both audio quality and waterproofing. Specifics weren’t mentioned although with any luck, Apple will integrate a speaker that at least matches the quality and output of the primary loudspeaker on the bottom of the handset. The latter bit is in line with earlier rumors suggesting the iPhone will carry an IP68 rating. The research note further claims that Apple may ship the iPhone 8 with a complementary set of wireless AirPods, replacing the wired EarPods with Lightning connector that come bundled with current generation iPhones. This seems highly unlikely considering the AirPods sell for $159 separately although such a move could help justify the rumored higher price tag of the premium iPhone 8.

White wine and soda water. The Ladies of London call them white wine spritzers. Either way, it’s a refreshing way to tone down the alcohol content of your drink in the dead of summer. But if you want your wine to stay at 12 percent, there is way to add bubbles without pouring in club soda: the DrinkMate. Similar in style and function to the SodaStream, but it’s meant to fizzify beverages other than water. You can make bubbly wine and other carbonated beverages — but it’s not without its risks (and messes). SodaStream doesn’t recommend you do it, either. But iSoda’s Drinkmate promises you can carbonate juice, cocktails, wine, and plain old water, of course. CARBONATION STATION As with similar devices, the Drinkmate doesn’t require power. It uses a CO2 canister that you attach to the back of the machine. It comes with a plastic bottle, a cap, and a Fizz Infuser. That’s the name for the special cap you attach to the bottle when you’re ready to fizz. It has a tab you pull up to release the pressure in the bottle post-carbonating, so your wine doesn’t go spurting everywhere. You’ll want to keep an eye on how much liquid you put into the bottle (measurement lines help) and how long and frequently you tap the big silver button on top that injects the CO2 into the bottle. Some beverages get foamier than others; cold brew coffee, in particular, took a few tries to get right. It ends up looking like a rootbeer float with too many button presses, but that consistency is far better than just topping off iced coffee carbonated water (something we do every morning, regardless of the weather). What makes the Drinkmate more manageable than a SodaStream is the Fizz Infuser’s tabs. There’s a slow release you flip up that will slowly release the pressure when dealing with beverages more finicky than water. If you’re impatient, you can hit the blue quick-release tab found beneath the slow-release. But be careful. The foam may quickly rise to the top of the bottle and start spitting out of the Infuser. That’s when you can close the tab and let things settle a bit. There were a few times — possibly because we hadn’t fitted the Infuser on properly — when the pressure caused the cap to pop open. The bottle was still attached to the Infuser, so there weren’t spills, but we did have to reattach the cap before trying to add CO2 again. If you hate hand washing dishes, you should be aware that iSoda advises against putting the bottle in the dishwasher. It can’t handle high heat, so you might not want to rinse it in scalding water, either. That is one drawback, especially when you’re filling the bottle with things like coffee, juice, and beer. NOT QUITE BUBBLY We tested out a variety of beverages with the DrinkMate, from juice to cold brew to gin fizzes to wine, with varying results. Make no mistake: The DrinkMate isn’t going to turn white wine into champagne, but it did make mediocre boxed wine more palatable to non-wine snobs. You can’t put just anything in the bottle, though; the company recommends no-pulp OJ over the thicker variety, for example. The DrinkMate did an OK job of revitalizing a semi-flat beer, but it wouldn’t be our first choice for the machine. “Why would I want my tequila fizzy?” a skeptical friend asked when we pulled out the DrinkMate during a recent weekend trip. She was making tequila cocktails, which called for sparkling water. Instead, we put all the ingredients in the DrinkMate’s bottle and started adding CO2. It’s not something you’d necessarily want to do with every cocktail, but it does give some drinks a bit more sparkle than just adding some soda water. You’ll still want to add plain water to the mix; otherwise your cocktail turns into a fizzy shot. THE REPLACEMENTS The DrinkMate comes with a 3-ounce canister, but it will fit 14.5-ounce varieties as well, according to the company. Right now, swapping an empty canister for a full one is only an option in Michigan, so you can either buy them on iSoda’s site or use a compatible SodaStream product. The 3-ounce canister ran out fairly quickly, after only a couple weeks of testing, but Target had larger SodaStream options on hand. The 14.5-ounce canister costs $30 but some stores will exchange your empty for a full one for half the price. We’ve crunched the numbers before on buying SodaStreams versus just buying sparkling water from a store and found that you have to knock back a lot of fizzy stuff to break even. The DrinkMate definitely gives you a little more bang for your buck, because you’re not limited to just water. WARRANTY DrinkMate offers a two-year manufacturing warranty on the machine and Fizz Infuser, but not the bottle. OUR TAKE Thanks to the ingenious tab system on the Fizz Infuser, the DrinkMate lets you carbonate practically any beverage you can think of. It’s not life-changing, but if you like bubbles in beverages other than water, it’s easy and effective. Are there other alternatives? Obviously SodaStream is the one to beat, and the DrinkMate tops the single-release-speed, water-only device. Still, if you’ve been looking for a SodaStream alternate for political reasons, you’ll probably still be stuck using its CO2 cartridges. How long will it last? There’s an ongoing cost associated with this device — the CO2 cartridges — but the bottle won’t last forever, either. It has an expiration date a couple years in the future. Should you buy it? If you think you’ll start your morning with sparkling orange juice or foamy coffee (highly recommended), drink LaCroix like it’s going out of style, and are curious about trying a carbonated margarita, then the DrinkMate makes sense. If you only occasionally enjoy some sparkling water, it’s probably not worth the investment.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AR/VR Live concerts are music tech’s next frontier Jaja Liao, Google@JajaLiao May 7, 2017 1:05 PM Above: TheWaveVR livestreams concerts in VR and offers interactive features that enable users to touch equipment or dance in the landscape Image Credit: TheWaveVR With recent speculation about Spotify soon going public (without an IPO) and the belated launch of Pandora Premium, the music streaming space is increasingly nearing both maturity and saturation. The market is crowded by such giants as Apple, Google, and Amazon, as well as smaller companies like Spotify, Deezer, Napster, Pandora, and Tidal. For 2016, it was estimated that Spotify had 43 million subscribers, followed by Apple Music  with 20.8 million and by Deezer with 6.9 million. At this point, it is unlikely that a new player can arise and grab a significant market share from the top players. However, it’s worth noting that in the United States, paid and ad-supported music streaming together generated $3.9 billion in revenue in 2015. In contrast, live music generated $9.3 billion in revenue — nearly three times as much — for the same period. This points to the large opportunity in live music, and some of the same aforementioned companies are looking to expand into the market. It’s almost a natural progression for these companies to expand from static audio streaming to live video streaming because they can leverage their experience with the music industry (think licenses, copyrights, etc.), as well as their existing platforms. For example, Pandora has run pilot livestreams with artists such as G-Eazy, Fall Out Boy, Jack White, and Mumford and Sons, and its product team is focusing on livestreamed shows. YouTube partners with large music festivals like Coachella and Ultra to livestream entire lineups. Twitter recently announced a partnership with Live Nation to livestream concerts. Tapping into the live concert space also makes sense because of people’s interest in livestreaming generally. Thanks to Facebook Live and other services, livestreaming has gone mainstream. If we’re already used to seeing livestreams of Trump press conferences on Facebook and NFL games on Twitter, then it isn’t strange for to us watch Beyoncé concerts on Spotify. But what’s in it for the artists? Currently, many artists make most of their income from live concerts, not from streaming or digital sales. Won’t livestreaming concerts cannibalize tickets for live concerts? It seems unlikely: In fact, 67 percent of livestream viewers are more likely to buy a ticket to a concert/event after watching a livestream of that concert/event or a similar one. Jordan Zachary, chief strategy officer of ticket sales company Live Nation, said the company’s data shows that consumption of live content increases a fan’s desire to attend the concert: “Research shows that millennials highly value live experience, and we believe live attendance will continue to grow globally.” Following this logic, livestreaming concerts may actually augment an artist’s concert ticket sales. This is likely because the physical concert experience  —  acoustics, atmosphere, energy , etc. — can never be completely replicated virtually. People pay for more than the live music  alone;  they pay for the live concert experience. And the people who watch online are likely those who find the physical concert geographically or cost prohibitive. They were not going to buy live concert tickets in the first place. Further, livestreamed concerts can help artists collect and analyze data. Artists could gather data about their fans and audience from live concert streams, much like they already do from traditional streaming tools, like Spotify’s Fan Insights portal. If livestreaming concerts are merely additive and promotional for an artist, the opportunity to add another source of data about fans and audiences offers value for minimal risk. In addition, with virtual reality on everyone’s minds, it should be no surprise that there are startups looking to livestream concerts in VR. In 2014, vantage.tv livestreamed Coachella in 360 in conjunction with the release of the Coachella VR app and cardboard. This year, with YouTube added to this partnership, Goldenvoice (the company that produces Coachella) integrated the 360 broadcast with a highly trafficked 2D broadcast so users could toggle between 2D and VR. So far, vantage.tv has recorded and created more than 120 in-venue live VR broadcasts from Outside Lands, Coachella, Lollapalooza, and other festivals. Another startup, TheWaveVR, livestreams concerts in VR and offers interactive features that enable users to touch equipment or dance in the landscape. AR, too, has potential to change live concerts beyond traditional livestreaming and VR livestreaming. This year, the Coachella app contained AR filters and overlays. In the future, we may start seeing more mixed reality and immersive media (like holograms) as part of live concerts. Live concert streaming and expansions into VR and AR represent new opportunities — for both large companies and startups, that may reinvigorate the crowded streaming music category. The benefits of livestreaming concerts suggest that timing is right for music tech to play new a chord. Jaja Liao works in mobile partnerships acquisitions at Google.
Home Apple News Apple Rumors iPhone iPad iPod Mac Apple TV Apple Watch About Apple Rumors iPhone 8 iPhone 8 Rumours Share on Facebook iPhone 8 Rumors and everything we know From time to time, there comes a revolutionary product that changes everything. These were words of Steve Jobs before presenting the iPhone in 2007 as three revolutionary products: an iPod with touch screen and touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone and a revolutionary Internet communications device. Of course, the iPhone changed everything, as there was nothing similar in the world until then and was available to everyone (who had 500 dollars to spend). It has been 10 years, and Apple has introduced a new iPhone every year, usually with a new design every two years and with improvements over the previous generation in the following year. 2017 may be the year we see something different to change everything again, but we know so much of the iPhone 8 that little we may be surprised. Contents The design of the iPhone 8 How will the camera of the next iPhone Wireless charging on the iPhone 8 Price and presentation of the tenth anniversary iPhone The design of the iPhone 8 According to rumors, Apple can launch three models this year: the iPhone 7, the iPhone 7s Plus, and a new model of 5.8 inches to celebrate the tenth anniversary. iPhone 8, iPhone Edition, iPhone X or as Apple wants to call it finely. It is expected to be completely rethought from scratch with a back glass cover like the iPhone 4. The screen is expected to arrive from edge to edge as in the Samsung Galaxy S8. The second strong rumor of the iPhone 8 is the fact that it will not include physical start button. Apple plans to implement a kind of function area similar to the Touch Bar of the MacBook Pro. The Touch ID is not known if it finally stays in the back or Apple will implement it in this area of functions below the screen. How will the camera of the next iPhone Another important rumor is related to the camera of the device. On one side the front and on the other the back. On the front, it is rumored that Apple will include an infrared sensor, thanks to this and Apple algorithms will allow you to capture 3D images and make use of that information for facial recognition, 3D selfies and more. There are also rumors that Apple will implement augmented reality, for it will make use of the rear camera and a new layout of it. The two cameras currently with the iPhone 7 Plus will be relocated to line up vertically and have a greater separation between them. Thanks to this separation the iPhone will be able to capture 3D images to be used later for augmented reality. Wireless charging on the iPhone 8 Apparently, Apple will finally include wireless charging on their phones. We’ve seen it for years on some Android, and in fact the Apple Watch has it. But for the iPhone 8 was expected a real wireless load, ie, allow the user to move the device away from the charger and not have it attached to it. It does not seem to be the case, but we will see a normal and normal wireless charge like the other phones. Price and presentation of the tenth anniversary iPhone If the rumors are true, the iPhone 8 could have an exit price higher than $ 1,000 and consequently more than about 1,200 euros in Spain and Europe in general. This is due to the cost of manufacturing OLED panels and because it will include some components that make the product more expensive, such as AirPods. As for its presentation, JPMorgan says it will be during the WWDC this year, that is, in a month-long month. But it would be very rare for us to see it here for the first time, it’s more likely that Apple will dedicate an entire keynote in September to put it up for sale in October or November.

Home Apple News Apple Rumors iPhone iPad iPod Mac Apple TV Apple Watch About Apple News Share on Facebook Bosch could supply the next motion sensors of the iPhone German supplier Bosch could provide the necessary motion sensors for the next-generation iPhone to function properly. Currently, InvenSense is the company in charge of realising these sensors, although Bosch already realises some sensors and chips of the current iPhone. According to Bloomberg, Bosch could handle this component, along with barometric sensors that have been manufacturing years for Apple. But the news is not in this, but Apple often uses several vendors for even the same component and does not seem to be so now. In order to reduce prices and get a backup if one of the vendors fails, Apple orders different companies to make the components of the iPhone.     There are exceptions to this rule, for example, TSMC will surely have the monopoly of the A10 processors of the current iPhone 7, and possibly next year too. This is because some components simply do not have more suppliers capable of doing them or of dealing with the demand. Another clear example is the alleged panels of the iPhone 8, which have been commissioned Samsung almost exclusively. Another possibility is that Apple is also trying to end with InvenSense, having almost the monopoly of motion sensors, possibly also have downloaded prices, offering the demand to Bosch, things can change. For example, we have seen this with GPUs and Imagination Technology, which from one day to the next has run out of a client to supply. In addition to sensors manufactured by Bosch, the iPhone 8 is expected to have a 5.8-inch OLED display, a virtual start button, wireless charging and 3D facial recognition. All this accompanied in the back of a better double camera and aligned vertically to improve the image capture.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 IT Stocks to Buy Now Although massive in size, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon remain some of the top IT stocks for long-term investors today. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) May 7, 2017 at 1:48PM In case you missed it, technology stocks have been enjoying a golden decade. The Nasdaq Composite, an index made up of many of the top U.S. IT stocks, has outperformed more diversified benchmarks such as the S&P 500 over the past one-, three-, five-, and 10-year periods, led by compelling performances from technology companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).   Top IT Stock     Market Capitalization     P/E    Forward P/E   Apple $753 billion 17.2   14.0 Alphabet $608 billion 31.3   22.3 Amazon $438 billion 187 73.6 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Many of these leading IT stocks remain fantastic investments, even as their market caps continue to swell to once-unfathomable heights. So let's further examine what makes these tech giants compelling stocks to buy today. What makes Apple a top IT stock Apple shares have been on quite the tear lately, gaining 46% over the past 12 months. However, the world's largest tech company sports some of the strongest fundamentals in in the industry and should be strongly considered as a core technology stock for many long-term portfolios. Thanks to the popularity of its iEmpire of consumer electronics, Apple's annual revenue consistently exceeds $200 billion. Moreover, the company's high-end price points give it a plum profit margin -- 39% on average over the past five years -- which makes the company a cash cow whose net cash balance is $158 billion and growing. The much-anticipated release of the iPhone 8 later this year and a host of potential high-impact projects should enable Apple to remain a top IT stock for years to come. Image source: Alphabet. What makes Alphabet a top IT stock The company that rules the Internet, Alphabet -- much like Apple and Amazon -- has only continued to strengthen its dominant business model in recent years. High-profile initiatives such as self-driving cars, Internet-beaming balloons, and the like make Alphabet seem like the corporate equivalent of a sixth-grade science experiment on steroids. However, in terms of tracking its profit generation, Alphabet is fairly straightforward. The company's original Google search and online advertising business generates nearly all the company's sales and profits. Better still, research continues to show that Alphabet and Facebook continue to capture increasingly large shares of the online advertising market.  The future remains bright for Alphabet. The online advertising market remains ripe for consolidation; analysts expect the space to grow from $550 billion in 2016 to $724 billion in 2020. Moreover, as often detailed by the press, Alphabet is fast at work developing new, innovative technologies. The company, like the others on the list, is busy skating where the puck is heading, and that tends to be a highly profitable strategy in the world of investing. What makes Amazon a top IT stock The top e-commerce company in the world has been in operation for more than 20 years now, but, in many ways, Amazon is just getting started, a fact many investors overlook. In this vein, it's important to consider the revolution Amazon is spearheading in the way we buy and sell items, and the true enormity of its growth potential. At the end of last year, e-commerce accounted for just 8.3% of all U.S. retail sales.  The number is strikingly similar worldwide, where an estimated 8.7% of all retail transactions occurred online in 2016, according to eMarketer. It's difficult to estimate the exact percentage of retail transactions that can and should take place online, but it's probably safe to say the long-term figure is substantially higher than the high single digits. And rest assured, Amazon intends to capture as much of this future market share as reality will allow. The company's e-commerce dominance, plus its high-margin Amazon Web Services cloud segment, have Wall Street estimating Amazon will grow its EPS at a 29% average annual rate over the next five years.  Of course, achieving this goal won't happen quickly or without its fair share of challengers. In that vein, regional e-commerce companies such as MercadoLibre in Latin America are fast at work establishing their own e-commerce ecosystems. Similarly, American retail power Wal-Mart seems to finally have given e-commerce its appropriate focus; I believe its 2016 acquisition of Jet.com will be looked back on as a watershed moment for the company.  However, Amazon is a unique company in many respects. Its extremely long-term focus and its ability and willingness to create innovative solutions to pain points throughout the global retail supply chain is without equal. There's enough room to accommodate multiple large-scale winners in the global retail industry, where sales are expected to rise to over $27 trillion by 2020, but  Amazon remains the top pick in this space. Like Apple and Alphabet, it's one of the best technology stocks to own right now. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

While we’ll have to continue to wait to see if this data will play a part in the company’s autonomous car platform efforts, in the meantime it’s surely going to use by improving Apple’s own Maps service. The latest news on the project has the mapping vehicles expanding to more areas of the US, including its first appearance in the state of Connecticut. Apple’s website dedicated to the Maps vehicles has detailed the expansion, noting that Connecticut marks the 34th state they’ve begun collecting data in, with plans to hit areas including Fairfield County, Hartford County, New Haven County, New London County, and Windham County over the coming weeks. Along with Connecticut, the vans are hitting the streets in parts of New York and Arizona for the first time. For New York this includes Allegany, Broome, Cayuga, Cortland, Livingston, Madison, Niagara, Orange, Putnam, Seneca, Tioga, Ulster, and Yates. In Arizona the new additions are La Paz, Maricopa, Pinal, and Yuma. The fact that Apple’s vehicles focus on collecting street-level footage suggest they might be working on their own Street View feature for Apple Maps, something that has long made Google’s own mapping service the most popular option. But with how Apple’s self-driving car plans have been heating up recently, including details on their autonomous vehicle platform and their test vehicles being spotted on the road, there’s little doubt this mapping data is going to that project as well.

X Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger reassess tech sector Buffett investing in tech shows he's 'either learning or crazy’, says his right-hand man about 13 hours ago Eric Platt Omaha Berkshire Hathaway shareholders watch the company’s annual meeting, at which Buffett and Munger rued several of the tech investments they never made. Photograph: Rick Wilking/Reuters         It was with his traditional glib mannerism that Charlie Munger – Berkshire Hathaway vice-chairman and Warren Buffett’s right-hand man – hurled a cavalier remark at the Oracle of Omaha. Mr Buffett had long avoided investments in the technology sector, focusing on stocks and businesses he understood and could value, a core tenet of what he considers his circle of competence. Then, six years ago, he invested in IBM. In 2016 he followed with a stake in Apple. “It shows either that you’re learning or you’re crazy,” Mr Munger said on stage in front of tens of thousands of Berkshire shareholders who travelled to Omaha for the company’s annual meeting on Saturday, many of whom came simply to listen to the two men talk. “I hope it’s that you’re learning.” Over the weekend, the two famed value investors rued several of the tech investments they never made, heaping praise on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and online search group Google. It was a noticeable shift from a company that owns Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom, Lubrizol, Geico and Benjamin Moore. I was too dumb to realise what would happen . . . I did not think Jeff Bezos could succeed on the scale that he has Mr Buffett confessed that he had made a mistake not investing in Google and had underestimated Mr Bezos. “I was too dumb to realise what would happen . . . I did not think he could succeed on the scale that he has.” The reassessment of a maturing technology sector comes at a critical time for Berkshire, which is worth more than $410 billion and has nearly $100 billion in cash on hand to invest. Over the next decade, Mr Buffett or a successor will deploy more capital on acquisitions and investment in Berkshire’s businesses than he has in his entire 52 years at the helm. Businesses that need little in terms of capital investments with scale will be key. That is a point that the Berkshire chief is well aware of: the only five publicly traded companies with higher market valuations than the sprawling conglomerate are in the technology industry. The coterie – Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook– is worth more than $2.5 trillion and requires “no equity capital”, he says. “It used to be that growing and earning large amounts of money required investment.” Not any more. Shy of start-ups Lawrence Cunningham, a professor at George Washington University who is considered an expert on Mr Buffett, said it was unlikely the Berkshire chief executive would soon invest in a start-up such as Uber or Snapchat. But his growing familiarity with the technology industry could mean a greater focus on the sector. “It is about his central competence. Once a company has been around for a few cycles, through multiple chief executives and developed a record, you can start to establish what this business will look like in 15 years. You can understand Apple and understand its position as easily as you can Coca-Cola or American Express. ” The detour through an industry Mr Buffett had long avoided followed hours of questioning of the two executives, which opened on the company’s investment in Wells Fargo and repeatedly touched on its relationship with 3G Capital, the Brazilian private equity group with which it bought a controlling stake in Kraft Heinz. Mr Buffett said it would have been a “huge, huge, huge error” if executives at Wells had been alerted to the bank’s brewing fake accounts scandal and failed to act. “We agree with Mr Buffett’s comments and value Berkshire Hathaway as a long-term shareholder and customer,” a spokesperson for the bank said over the weekend. “We have taken decisive actions to fix the problems.” Berkshire Hathaway vice-chairman Charlie Munger over the weekend. Photograph: Rick Wilking/Reuters Asked about the political risks of being associated with 3G, Mr Buffett offered a full-throated defence of the group and its practices, which several shareholders indicated they believe runs counter to the values typically espoused by Berkshire. Mr Buffett said that 3G was ready to buy out companies that “really needed change”. “Change is painful for a lot of people and I’d rather spend my days not doing that sort of thing.” He added that this year Berkshire might consider taking additional losses at the margin to take advantage of higher tax rates, should Congress pass sweeping tax cuts. Losses realised this year can be used to offset taxes on gains in the future. It was a short-term titbit from a company known for its long-term view on investing. - (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017)       Topics: Benjamin Moore Charlie Munger Eric Platt Jeff Bezos Lawrence Cunningham Congress George Washington University Amazon American Express Apple Berkshire Hathaway Capital Coca Cola Dairy Queen Facebook Fruit of the Loom Geico Google Heinz IBM Lubrizol Microsoft Oracle Wells Fargo Berkshire Omaha Read More Colm Lyons takes payments start-up Fire to UK Irish companies risk losing out on digital economy boom Siro and Enet announce strategic tie-up in broadband market Digicel to buy French overseas territories business for undisclosed sum Google to pay €306m to settle Italian tax dispute Cheaper ebooks on the cards as MEPs vote to lower VAT rate Malicious phishing email targets Google users  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy Ireland set for fastest euro zone growth for fourth year in a row Work How to make a great first impression at a job interview Soccer Ken Early: Liverpool are a long way from socialism these days Innovation Storkbox offers help for expectant mothers Sponsored The Story of Home: Light and shade ‘I’m still taking it 20 years on and loving it’ The Story of Home: 'People need a sense of belonging' Charting a family adventure on the Shannon-Erne Waterways Latest Business German factory orders expand as Europe’s largest economy picked up speed 07:59 Aryzta evaluating alternatives for Picard shareholding 07:26 Akzo sees latest PPG bid inadequate, weighs options 07:24 Euro drops after rising to six-month high 06:39 Ireland set for fastest euro zone growth for fourth year in a row 06:33 How to?

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 07, 2017 1:57pm   Comments Share: Related AAPL Smaller Gizmos Mean Bigger Headaches For E-Recyclers Apple Has So Much Cash In Reserve It Could Buy 10 Snap Incs, Almost 20 Twitters First Eagle Investment Slashes 5 Stakes in –st Quarter (GuruFocus) Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) reported second-quarter earnings Tuesday. The world’s biggest company now has over $250 billion in cash as investor speculation continues on what the company should do with all that money. Gerber Kawasaki: 'Put The Heat On Tim Cook' "It's time to put the heat on Tim Cook," said Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management CEO Ross Gerber. "It should be illegal to have $250 billion dollars in cash and not utilize it – that is what you're supposed to do as CEO," he added. Wells Fargo And Deutsche Bank: Looking Toward iPhone X While iPhone sales were slightly down in the quarter, Wells Fargo is giving Apple a pass with softer unit sales likely indicating the anticipation for the 10-year anniversary iPhone. “Time will tell whether this is the case or if there is a fundamental change in upgrade cycles, which won’t be clear until Q4. However, while we see iPhone risk beyond this calendar year, we think the bigger potential issue is Apple’s legal battles and specifically with Nokia, where we think there is the possibility for initial news flow as early as year-end,” said Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo has a Market Perform rating on Apple with a $135-$145 valuation range target. Deutsche Bank noted that while second-quarter results don’t point to strength, the bull case likely triumphs any near-term concerns, and remains focused on the latest iPhone release. The German bank maintains a Hold rating and a $130 price target on the company. Barclays At Equal Weight: Seeing A Sideways Near Term Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz is predicting that Apple will trade sideways in the near term. Moskowitz believes results and outlook lack upside on Apple, especially since Apple noted there has been a pause on smartphone demand. A familiar Apple competitor may also be gaining traction. “We are concerned gross margin could be at risk to the downside if Apple starts to lose market share momentum with Samsung back in the market with its S8,” said Moskowitz. Barclays maintains an Equal-Weight rating on Apple and kept its $123 price target. Baird: Be Buyers On Weakness Analysts at Baird were much more bullish, saying that they would be buyers on any weakness. Baird maintains an Outperform rating but raised its target price to $160 from $145.

Financial results from Apple and Samsung in the last week show that the world's top two tech companies are strengthening their hold on their respective markets. While Apple saw sluggish iPhone 7 sales ahead of its iPhone 8 model, the company now holds $250bn (€228bn) in a cash pile, the largest in modern corporate history. It's enough to buy the Walt Disney company outright, a possibility that US pundits are discussing because of a potential change in US tax law this year or next. Although its Apple Watch and wireless Airpods businesses are performing well, the company is said to be on the trail of a major acquisition because of its enormous cash reserves and its increasing reliance on the iPhone for profitability. For Ireland, Apple's latest €10bn quarterly profit on €48bn in quarterly revenues keeps its Cork operations humming. Chief executive Tim Cook has repeatedly dismissed suggestions that an adverse tax conclusion from EU authorities will threaten the company's investment here or the fate of over 6,000 employees in Cork. Ireland is the only country outside the US where Apple runs its own computer manufacturing plant. For Apple's main rival, Samsung, 2017 has been a big improvement on 2016. The Korean giant's latest quarterly financial reports showed a complete rebound from the public relations fiasco over its exploding Note 7 smartphone. For the first three months of the year, Samsung recorded almost €41bn in revenue. It also recorded an €8bn profit, a 50pc jump on last year. While this doesn't quite match Apple's earning power, it is as much profit as Google and Facebook combined and significantly more in revenue. While the engine of the company's profit was driven mostly by its components and display business (it makes phone screens for rivals such as Apple), it also scored a hit with its latest smartphone, the Galaxy S8. It was a much-needed reprieve for the Korean tech giant, which courted worldwide controversy in October last year when its flagship Note 7 device was withdrawn from the market because of overheating batteries. "The Irish market is in a very different place to what it was last year," said Conor Pierce, Samsung's Dublin-born vice president. "Samsung is in a much stronger position in terms of our premium market share. About 68pc of the value of the market is premium, meaning anything priced over €600. It's a two-horse race between ourselves and Apple." Pierce says that Samsung has overtaken Apple in premium handset sales in Ireland. However, Samsung and Apple dominate the smartphone business between them, with the pair holding an estimated 75pc of the entire phone market here between them. Other tech hardware companies find themselves battling for scraps and niches. HEAD TO HEAD: Apple versus Samsung APPLE 2nd quarter revenue: €48.1bn 2nd quarter profit: €10bn Strengths: Its high-margin electronics continue to sell very well and customer loyalty levels are high. It has also become the biggest wearables and smartwatch company, with sales of the Apple Watch doubling in the last year. Its enormous cash pile of €228bn puts it in a position of unprecedented corporate strength. Weaknesses: It is increasingly dependent on the iPhone for the majority of its revenue and profit. Its iPad business is also declining as larger smartphones take over. Finally, it still faces uncertainty with its appeal of the European Commission's €13bn tax ruling against Ireland. What to look for next: The iPhone 8 launch in September will be the biggest tech event in recent years, with analysts predicting a financial 'supercycle'. This is partially because Apple is expected to unveil something radically different to mark the handset's 10th anniversary. It continues to look at self-driving cars and artificial intelligence, with acquisition targets said to include companies as diverse as Tesla and Disney. SAMSUNG Quarterly revenue: €40.8bn Quarterly profit: €7.9bn Strengths: Its components, chip and display businesses are going gangbusters. It also scored a hit with its latest Galaxy S8 smartphone with its new all-glass design set to be mimicked by other phone manufacturers, potentially including Apple. It also bounced back strongly from difficulties over exploding Note 7 phone. Weaknesses: Because it does not use its own proprietary interface, the company still has to fight harder to attract and retain phone customers than main rival Apple. What to look for next: Samsung could be on the verge of overtaking Intel as the world's biggest chipmaker because of its strength in the mobile market. It is also trying to establish its electronics brand as a high-end premium marque, so look for flashier fridges, cookers and phones.

VietNamNet Bridge - The fact that Apple has issued new policies recently may be a preparatory step for the firm to officially enter Vietnam's 90 million market. Apple announced it will refuse to give warranties to the products their owners cannot show invoices to they were bought from Apple’s authorized resellers. In late March 2017, Votra, Apple’s legal representative, sent a document to a series of private shops distributing Apple’s products imported through unofficial channels, requesting to stop using Apple, iPhone and other Apple logos. The shops were told they had seven days to do this. Votra pointed out that the use of Apple’s logos and trademarks without Apple’s permission is intellectual property infringement. A lot of private shops in HCMC have removed Apple’s logo from their signboards after receiving the document. However, they have done this only to large recognizable logos. The fact that Apple has issued new policies recently may be a preparatory step for the firm to officially enter Vietnam's 90 million market. The duration of seven days has elapsed, while Apple has not taken any further move. Votra’s representative, who reporters contacted, said he has no further information. Le Ngoc Lam, deputy head of the National Office of Intellectual Property (NOIP), commented that Apple took an act of good will when giving warning in advance and seven days to private shops to remove Apple’s logo. In principle, it can sue the private shops without giving warning. If so, the shops will receive heavy fines depending on Apple’s argument about how much it has lost because of intellectual property infringement. Lam said Apple may have decided to deal with private shops with a heavy hand because it wants to clear the unauthorized sellers to pave the way for authorized resellers to be set up in Vietnam. Vietnam, a country with low average income, turns out to be a large market for Apple.  “Vietnamese like Apple’s products, which can be the reason for Apple to decide to penetrate the Vietnamese market. However, it won’t be able to bring goods to Vietnam or make investment in the country once IP infringed goods are still available everywhere,” he explained. Some other analysts also commented that Apple’s actions seem to aim to ‘clear’ the market to prepare for its official landing in the near future. An analyst said the official arrival of Apple will be welcomed by Vietnamese, if the prices are not pushed up, because consumers will get the biggest benefits from this once they can enjoy better services. For many years, two types of Apple’s products have been available in the domestic market – products imported through unofficial channels and original products distributed by authorized resellers.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > How to use Apple Clips: The perfect video app for… How to use Apple Clips: The perfect video app for your social feeds By Carlos Vega — May 6, 2017 6:00 AM Subscribe Share Carlos Vega/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends The Apple Clips app specializes in making video clips, ones specifically designed to be shared on social media. You are probably already familiar with Stories on Facebook and Instagram, but Apple Clips separates these into a standalone app that is more powerful and easier to use. Apple’s app creates videos that are square, which is perfect for sharing on a social media timeline. As per usual with Apple’s proprietary apps, however, Clips doesn’t come with an instruction manual. Even though it is pretty intuitive, there may be some things that aren’t readily obvious. To help, we’ve prepared an easy-to-follow guide so you can jump straight into making awesome clips. The interface When you open Clips for the first time, it will default to video. Apple wants you to make small video clips that will be stitched together at the end. If you’ve ever shared a story on Facebook or Instagram, then you’re already familiar with this concept. It doesn’t matter what you share, whether it be a video or photo, you have to hold the big red button to record it. Once you’ve finished recording, Clips will add it to the timeline. You can choose to record a video, take a photo, or add a video or photo from your library. Regardless of what you add, you have to hold the red button to record it, and tell Clips for how long to play the video or showcase the photo. Directly right of the big red button, you can select either the front-facing camera or the primary camera on the back of your iPhone. The microphone icon is so that you can choose to record the audio or simply mute it. If you forget to mute the audio, don’t worry, you can go back and mute it later. At the top of the app window, you will see six icons. On the very far left you have a down arrow, and if you tap this arrow, you will see all the clips you’ve previously saved. Here, you can also choose to edit them, or you can hold down the clip for a couple of seconds to delete it. Next, you will find an icon that resembles a speech bubble, and it’s called Live Tiles. The icon next to this should also be very familiar, because it is the same icon used for filters in the Photos app. Next, you will see a star icon that stands for Overlays. This section allows you to access speech bubbles, arrows, and smileys. We will look at this in more detail shortly. The last two icons are a letter “T,” short for Posters, and a music icon you can use to add background music to your clip. The best way to understand what all these icons do is to make a short video, so let’s dig in and make a clip to share on social media. Making a clip Video The first thing you should do is tap and hold the red button to record a short clip. For this example, we will say: “Hello, we are working with Apple Clips for Digital Trends.” That was easy! We have our first clip in the timeline. Photo The photo mode will let you take a photo, with or without flash, using your phone’s front-facing or rear camera. Keep in mind that the photo won’t be added to the timeline right away, however. After you take the photo, you’ll have to hold the red button to add the photo to the timeline. To do so, hold the red button for five seconds and then let go. The photo should now be part of the timeline, and you can drag and drop these clips anywhere you want to. If you want to start with a photo, for instance, just drag it to the start of the timeline. Library Using the library is very easy, and allows you to make these clips later with videos and pictures you’ve taken during the day. Just like we did before, you select the photo or video that you want to add, and then hold the red button to add it to the timeline. How long you want the picture or video to be is up to you. Keep in mind that any time you are holding the red record button, you can also talk to add your voice. Even if you add a video from your library, you can still talk while you’re pressing the red button. If the original video has sound don’t worry, we will show you how to mute it in the next section.

It has a massive library of licensed content as well as a growing catalog of great original TV shows and movies. It’s right up there with the best of them. However, Apple TV owners have been unable to stream content from Amazon Video as no official app is available. If a new report is believed, the official Amazon Video app for Apple TV might arrive this summer. Re/code reports that Amazon and Apple have reached an agreement which is going to put the former’s video streaming app on the latter’s set-top box. It’s expected that the app is going to be released for the Apple TV in the third quarter of this year. The only way users could stream content from Amazon Video to Apple TV was through AirPlay. This involved connecting another Apple device like a Mac or iPhone and then beaming content from that device over local Wi-Fi to the TV. It wasn’t exactly seamless. There are no details available about what has happened behind the scenes that Amazon and Apple have reached this agreement. Both have rival video businesses and yet if this happens, they will have figured out a way to move forward without getting in each other’s way. It’s going to be a win-win for users, though, as they will be able to watch content from their preferred streaming service on their preferred home entertainment box. Filed in Apple.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Mon, May 08, 2017 - Page 15　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Bosch said to win some Apple orders GROWTH AREAS:Apple’s other main supplier of motion sensors, InvenSense, might focus on other areas such as driverless cars and drones following its purchase by TDK Bloomberg The Apple logo is shown next to a heart and a red dot depicting a local artist’s work on the facade of Singapore’s first Apple store on Friday. In Singapore, people often refer to their country as a “little red dot” on the map of Southeast Asia. The store is due to open soon. Photo: Reuters Robert Bosch GmbH has won orders from Apple Inc to supply the next iPhone with some of its motion sensors, according to a person familiar with the deal. It is a potential blow to InvenSense Inc, the main supplier of those smartphone components. The change — hinted at by InvenSense’s chief financial officer in August last year — comes as the San Jose, California-based maker of motion-sensing chips seeks to complete its US$1.3 billion sale to TDK Corp, a deal partly aimed at boosting the Japanese company’s business with Apple. Bosch might supply as much as half of these components for the new iPhone, with InvenSense supplying the rest, the person said. Bosch already supplies barometric pressure sensors for the iPhone, according to product teardowns by iFixit and other firms that analyze the guts of gadgets. “People believe that the acquisition is going to go through,” Robert W. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra said. “The share loss scenario may be something that TDK had already considered.” Rather than an existing revenue stream from supplying Apple, TDK might be more interested in InvenSense’s suite of technologies suited to growth areas like driverless cars, drones and the Internet of Things. The risks of losing Apple as a customer were highlighted by chip developer Imagination Technologies PLC, which last month said that the iPhone maker would stop using its intellectual property within two years. Apple chief executive officer Tim Cook tries to source components from at least two suppliers, making it easier to negotiate cheaper prices. Apple accounts for about 60 percent of InvenSense’s revenue, according to Bloomberg supply chain analysis. Apple is expected to unveil a major upgrade to the iPhone later this year to mark the 10th anniversary of the groundbreaking device. Analysts expect consumers to buy millions of the new gadgets, generating huge orders for component suppliers. The components produced by Bosch and InvenSense contain gyroscopes and accelerometers. Gyroscopes can tell if a phone is being held horizontally or vertically, being shaken, or pointing in a particular direction. An accelerometer detects different movements, such as side-to-side motion. Together, the sensors help measure step count, and they are useful for mobile games and augmented reality applications. In the iPhone 6S and iPhone 7, these were supplied exclusively by InvenSense, according to teardowns. InvenSense chief financial officer Mark Dentinger said at an August investor conference that as recently as 2014 it was dominant “by a considerable margin” at the top end of the smartphone market. “We’re still the largest player, but we are splitting some share now with our primary competitor,” he said. “Historically, it’s unlikely that most of our customers will have just one supplier over a long, long period of time.” TDK, which rose to prominence on cassette tapes in the 1970s, has since expanded into batteries, automotive components and now the Internet of Things. The Tokyo-based company received regulatory clearance to acquire InvenSense on April 18. “We aim to become a strong player in the sensor business with InvenSense as our perfect partner,” TDK CEO Shigenao Ishiguro said at the time.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Apple Shouldn't Buy Netflix: Here's Why Buying Netflix would be incredibly expensive and wouldn't reduce Apple's reliance on the iPhone very much. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) May 7, 2017 at 11:55AM Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) enormous cash hoard reached another milestone last quarter, surpassing $250 billion. Not surprisingly, this has sparked another round of complaints from investors who think that Apple should be using its cash to make some big acquisitions. Other investors and analysts have been helpfully suggesting potential acquisition targets in recent weeks. One that frequently comes up is Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Some investors think Apple should buy Netflix. Image source: Netflix. It's understandable that many investors want Apple to make a growth-enhancing acquisition. However, it would be virtually impossible for any potential target -- even Netflix -- to move the needle for Apple. This is a strong argument against paying a hefty price to buy the streaming-video leader. Some investors are losing patience Following Apple's earnings report, Ross Gerber, CEO of investment management firm Gerber Kawasaki, expressed frustration about Apple's reluctance to make a game-changing acquisition. "It should be illegal to have $250 billion in cash and not utilize it -- that is what you're supposed to do as CEO," he told CNBC. This is a dangerous perspective to adopt. A better description of the CEO's job is to ensure that the company's capital is used well. In some cases, that means making bold acquisitions, but often it means refraining from big deals. Indeed, it's important that a CEO not feel compelled to spend money just because it's available. Gerber ought to know better. After all, he recommended that Apple buy GoPro in late 2015, when its stock was trading for more than three times its current level. Had Apple taken his advice then, it would have wasted more than $5 billion to buy a company that is struggling to break even and has questionable growth prospects. Netflix is a relatively rational target For Apple, buying Netflix today would probably make more sense than buying GoPro a year and a half ago. Apple is in the midst of a big push to grow its services business, and Netflix would give it a huge boost in that area. Netflix already has nearly $10 billion of revenue -- all of which is recurring -- and is growing rapidly. That's a big reason why Apple analyst Kulbinder Garcha has been plugging the idea of an Apple-Netflix deal recently. He also notes that there could be modest synergies with Apple's existing business, such as better terms from content owners and the ability to bundle Netflix with other Apple subscription services. But Netflix wouldn't boost Apple's growth by much During 2016, revenue surged 30% year over year at Netflix as the company's international expansion gained steam. This boosted its top line by more than $2 billion. Analysts expect Netflix to grow its revenue by an average of about $2.3 billion a year in 2017 and 2018. The iPhone will continue to dominate Apple's results going forward. Image source: Apple. However, while Netflix is a high-growth company on its own, this amount of growth would be virtually meaningless to Apple, which generates more than $200 billion of annual revenue. Relative to this base, a Netflix acquisition would provide a one-time revenue boost of 4%, while increasing Apple's growth rate in future years by about 1 percentage point. To put it a different way, one of investors' biggest criticisms of Apple today is that it is unduly reliant on the iPhone. Indeed, in fiscal 2015, iPhone revenue surged by $53 billion, driving a $51 billion increase in the company's total revenue. By contrast, in fiscal 2016, total revenue and iPhone revenue both plunged by $18 billion. The revenue growth from adding Netflix (or pretty much any other high-growth company) to the mix wouldn't smooth out these gyrations very much. Due to Apple's immense size, even a fairly large acquisition would provide only minimal diversification away from the iPhone. And it would be way too expensive The other problem with acquiring Netflix is that it would be phenomenally expensive. Netflix has a market cap of about $67 billion today. Including the value of employee stock options and a deal premium, Apple would probably have to pay at least $80 billion-$90 billion to buy it. While Apple has tons of cash, 93% of it is held offshore. It would have to pay repatriation taxes of up to 35% to bring that cash home to buy a domestic company like Netflix. Thus, Apple might have to repatriate $130 billion of foreign cash -- roughly half of its total cash stockpile -- to buy Netflix. Alternatively, Apple could issue debt to pay for a Netflix acquisition. However, given that it already has nearly $100 billion of debt, adding another $80 billion-$90 billion to its tab would be a dubious move. Furthermore, even if Apple were able to finance the deal at an ultra-low 2% interest rate, it would take several years for Netflix to increase its earnings enough to cover the additional interest expense -- let alone increasing Apple's profits. This is quite a lot of trouble to go through for an acquisition that wouldn't meaningfully alter Apple's growth trajectory. Like it or not, investors need to recognize that the iPhone's success will continue to determine the company's fate for the foreseeable future.

Apple will invest $1 billion to help create more U.S. manufacturing jobs and counter recurring criticism about its reliance on overseas factories to assemble most of its iPhones and other devices. AP urgent Apple steps up its effort to emphasize its economic impact Michael Liedtke and Christopher S. Rugaber AP Business Writers 16 hrs ago AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during a 2016 announcement of new products in Cupertino, Calif. Apple will invest $1 billion to help create more U.S. manufacturing jobs and counter recurring criticism about its reliance on overseas factories to assemble most of its iPhones and other devices. SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is getting more aggressive about emphasizing its role in the U.S. economy, apparently hoping to counter recurring criticism over its reliance on overseas factories. On Wednesday, Apple for the first time released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work, showing that more than half of them are located outside Silicon Valley. It also announced a $1 billion fund aimed at creating more U.S. manufacturing jobs, although it provided few details. The strategy appears aimed at complicating efforts by President Donald Trump and other politicians to vilify Apple for using companies in China and elsewhere to assemble most of its products. Apple had no comment on political ramifications of its announcements. CEO Tim Cook first described the manufacturing fund in an interview on CNBC, but didn't say how the money will be disbursed or who will be eligible to receive it. Apple will provide more details when it announces its first investment by the end of the month, he said. Apple's initial billion-dollar investment amounts to a tiny fraction of its $257 billion in cash. Cook also promised that Apple will hire "thousands of employees, thousands more in the future" in the U.S., although he didn't specify how quickly that will happen. Apple's U.S. payroll has grown roughly 40-fold since 1998, when it had 5,000 U.S. workers. Cook also said Apple is examining ways to help more people learn the programming skills to make apps. Threats to Apple Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from China, a change that would drive up Apple's costs. That could pressure the company to raise its prices at a time when it is already having trouble increasing its sales of iPhones and iPads. "They are trying to make the case that they really do have a lot of folks working in the U.S.," said technology industry analyst Rob Enderle. "So if you want to pick on somebody, you might want to pick on somebody else because they won't be a good example." Cook isn't the only CEO who has been trying to highlight his company's hiring and expansion plans in the U.S. Trump has attacked many companies, frequently on Twitter, for moving jobs out of the U.S. and lavishly praised those who have announced major hiring initiatives. As a result, many companies, including Exxon Mobil, Intel, Charter Communications and Ford Motor, have unveiled big hiring plans, though in many cases they were already in the works before the presidential campaign. "There is a lot of political pressure to create jobs in the United States," Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics, said. Chief executives "do not want to show up in a tweet." Apple in the states Since 2014, Apple has issued a series of reports intended to underscore its contributions to U.S. jobs and economic growth. Its first report came after years of complaints about labor practices and suicides at Foxconn, one of the company's major contractors in China, drew more attention to Apple's reliance on overseas factories. Apple to also issues a separate "supplier responsibility" report reviewing the labor conditions in those facilities. The Wednesday report on U.S jobs is its fourth update, but the first to include a state-by-state breakdown of Apple employees. Unsurprisingly, the numbers show its highest concentration of workers (36,786) is located in California, home to the company's Silicon Valley headquarters and 53 stores. Apple's second biggest employment center is in Texas (8,407 jobs), where it has a corporate campus and 18 stores. Its smallest pockets of employment are in North Dakota (four jobs), Vermont (six) and Wyoming (seven). Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Apple's decision to provide detailed information about the locations of its U.S. employees could help the company win support from lawmakers eager to protect jobs in their states, Enderle said. "It gives senators something to push back with, recognizing that Apple is a real risky company to target anyway because its products are so popular with people." Besides showing how many of its full-time and part-time employees work in each state, Apple also lists where its 9,000 U.S. suppliers are located. The company says it spent more than $50 billion at its U.S. suppliers last year, helping them employ a total of 450,000 workers. App economy The company also cited a study by the Progressive Policy Institute that attributes 1.5 million U.S. jobs to Apple's iPhone "ecosystem." That figure not only includes programmers that work on the apps, but also supporting staff and employees working everywhere from banks to restaurants that have jobs because of the spending generated by apps. Such "spillover" effects are widely recognized, although economists sometimes spar over their magnitude. But for a company to claim credit for all or most of the jobs in a particular industry is a stretch, Swonk said. The vast majority of app developers, for example, also produce apps for Android phones from Samsung and other manufacturers. The Public Policy Institute only found 1.7 million jobs in the entire "app economy" — and 1.35 million of those were associated with Android apps. Most of those overlap with the jobs linked to Apple.

According to Wikipedia, Lady Justice has been depicted with a blindfold since at least the 16th century, with the blindfold representing impartiality. When impartiality of the system, or the judges who are charged with administering the system, is questioned, it is a very big deal. That is why the Code of Conduct applicable to Article III federal judges appointed as Constitutional judicial officers mandates that a judge disqualify himself or herself when there is even the appearance of impropriety. It seems that no such rule applies to Administrative Patent Judges (APJs) who make up the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), which is astonishing. Indeed, we have found yet another example of a situation where an PTAB judge has issued a decision and is participating in post grant administrative proceedings as a judge in a case where a former client is the petitioner. On November 21st, 2016, APJ Stacy Beth Margolies wrote a decision to institute an inter partes review (IPR) proceeding petitioned by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the PTAB. The panel’s decision to institute was based on its conclusion that the petitioner Apple had presented enough evidence to conclude that there was a reasonable likelihood that Apple would prevail in establishing the unpatentability of the challenged claims. Data collected through the legal analytics tools provided through Lex Machina shows that Margolies has served as an APJ on two IPRs petitioned by Apple, both of which challenge patents owned by Voip-Pal.com, a developer of Internet telecommunications technologies. Both of the challenged patents are directed at methods of routing messages for voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) communications. Both IPR proceedings are currently open post-institution. According to information from PACER, Margolies represented Apple as counsel in Fast Memory Erase LLC v. Spansion Inc. et. al. (ND Tex 3:08-cv-00977)(see screenshot). Apple was named was a defendant and counter-claimant in this patent infringement action. The case was terminated in August, 2012 and there is no indication in PACER that Margolies was terminated or removed as Apple’s representative from prior to the termination of this matter. Some may be tempted to believe that a four-year period between representing a client in a district court patent infringement matter and deciding cases as a judge where the former client is a petitioner do not raise the same conflict of interest questions as other situations we’ve recently pointed out at PTAB. See Is the ethical bar higher for practitioners than PTAB judges? Perhaps at some point there should be a cleansing of any conflict of interest based on the passage of time, that would certainly make sense. The problem for the Patent Office and those who defend the actions of APJs sitting in judgment of petitions filed by former clients is that there is no time limit on the conflict of interest created by a former client for practitioners, and there is no time limit on conflicts and the appearance of impropriety for Article III federal judges appointed as Constitutional judicial officers. So if the generic ethics rules for all employees of the USPTO, which only require a 1-year recusal period with respect to dealing with matters of former employers, is the only policy or Code of Conduct applicable to PTAB judges then that would mean that the practitioners who appear before the PTAB have substantially higher ethical requirements than do those who are sitting in judgment, which is absolutely absurd. If anything the higher ethical standards must be placed on those who sit in judgment, which is exactly what is done for Article III federal judges who are required to disqualify themselves from matters even when there is an appearance of impropriety. Certainly, APJ Matt Clements issuing decisions in post grant patent review proceedings petitioned by Apple a mere 18 months after representing Apple as a defendant in patent infringement cases is extraordinarily problematic, perhaps far more so than Margolies deciding petitions four years later. It is also particularly concerning that Clements has participated in so many post grant proceedings — we’ve identified 17 so far — where his former client (Apple) was a petitioner. Margolies has only sat on two panels currently adjudicating patent challenges brought by her former client, which also happens to be Apple. But the appearance of impropriety and what should be required of judicial officers cannot be excused as de minimus.  Any appearance of impropriety is unacceptable. The problem seems to be that the United States Patent and Trademark Office does not have a specific Code of Conduct for APJs, instead applying the same general and extremely lenient ethical standards on PTAB judges that they do on all employees. Interestingly, in April 2013 the USPTO updated the practitioner Code of Conduct to more directly coincide with the Model Rules of the American Bar Association, which are followed in various forms by most States. If you look at 37 CFR 11.803(b), practitioners commit an ethical violation for failing to report APJs who have violated the applicable “rules of judicial conduct.” § 11.803 reads: “A practitioner who knows that a judge, hearing officer, administrative law judge, administrative patent judge, or administrative trademark judge has committed a violation of applicable rules of judicial conduct that raises a substantial question as to the individual’s fitness for office shall inform the appropriate authority.” Thus, it seems that at least in 2013 there was some recognition by the USPTO that “rules of judicial conduct” would apply to the Administrative Patent Judges that make up the PTAB. What those rules are, and whether they even exist beyond the all USPTO employees general ethical provisions remains uncertain.

Anon May 7, 2017 10:48 am Gene and Steve, Before those wanting to chastise you for naming names rings in, let me just add that an understanding of administrative law and the differences between various agencies and how those various agencies have structured or insulated any “judicial-type” of function away from any “political” or “politically” control function has a direct bearing on how much “credence” Article III courts have traditionally afforded that agency’s “judicial” results. Those interested, may find of interest the fact that the United States Patent and Trademark Office structure and initial legislative mandates created one of the weakest separations of the “political” from the “judicial,” and thus, ANY view of the PTAB as far as “judicial power” is concerned necessarily – and correctly – requires scrutiny and vigilance as to the intrusion of the “political.” I have already seen IPR apologists criticizing others for such vigilance, and that sickens me as an attorney. I will step down from my soapbox now, and give the microphone to those wanting to comment on the substance of this thread. Anon May 7, 2017 10:51 am …and to offer something on point here, I would suggest that an inverse level of control and vetting for ethical concerns should be in place for the various executive agencies that have “judicial” functions – the more separation between the “political” and the “judicial,” the closer to the floor of Article III ethics control should exist and conversely, the lack of separation should induce more ethics controls. Bemused May 7, 2017 1:29 pm Gene, Steve: I know this is an extremely small sample size with these two APJ’s formerly being on the “defense” side for Apple but has anyone ever done a review of the background of APJ’s to see whether they were primarily plaintiffs (patent holders) or defendants (accused infringers) counsel? A colleague had told me several years ago that the majority of APJs were former defense-side lawyers but I was wondering if anyone had ever dug into this area to see if that was actually true. If it is true, I submit that having a PTAB comprised mainly of former defendant-side counsels makes for an inherently biased PTAB. I’m sure some folks will say it doesn’t matter whether the APJ formerly represented in private practice primarily plaintiffs or defendants but if you’ve been in this business long enough you know it does because (depending on which side your regularly appear for) you start to get conditioned to either hating patents or hating infringers. B The Time Is Now To Act May 7, 2017 2:58 pm Gene- I am very concerned; really, as an American at this point. There is A LOT of smoke here and potentially culpable officials with agency power say ‘don’t worry, no fire here. I urge you to keep digging. You on are on to something. Perhaps a tangential comment, but maybe not, at what point does the DOJ start investigating the anti-competitive, anti-trust and monopolistic combination of the following: 1) APJs deciding cases where former clients are involved. 2) Petitioners using ToT entities to pro-actively attack patents (and patent owners) and placing language on threatening pro-active IPR on ToT websites to all who would consider enforcing patents. Alongside threatening language, placing incentives for same patent owners to join as customers and grant extensive patent rights; including information rights. 3) IPR Gang tackling involving Petitioner, Faux interest groups and ToTs. 4) Examination/Investigation of PTO for Lack of PTO action in defense of patent owners who are the subject of IPR Gang Tackling. 5) Personal Examination/Investigation of PTO officials who are standing by and not utilizing AIA granted powers regarding 4) I know the DOJ has a page on patent pools where it intersects with anti trust but if the Anti Trust and other arms of the DOJ are not already investigating the interface of the above and ToT customer behavior relative to points outlined above (and others not known), they really ought to be – Post Haste. All of this in search of a few ‘bad patents’? I think not. If the IP targeted in aggregate were worthless, why have the giants spun up a billion plus engine across 95 percent of the biggest patent filers to destroy or cheaply acquire same? If the CEOs of these huge companies saw into the future, they would exist these ToTs before more information comes out and it gets really bad for their brand. The Time Is Now To Act May 7, 2017 3:07 pm last paragraph correction- they would ‘exit’ these ToTs.. Post a Comment Respectfully add to the discussion.

Now, the company has further expanded those efforts, deploying a fleet of vans in Connecticut for the first time… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover As noted on the company’s Apple Maps vehicles webpage,  Apple is continuing its Apple Maps data collection in New England with camera and sensor-equipped vans for the first time. The expansion to Connecticut marks the 34th state in which Apple has collected Maps data. Below is the full list of counties in Connecticut where Apple will be patrolling over the coming weeks: Fairfield County, Hartford County, Litchfield County, Middlesex County, New Haven County, New London County, Tolland County, Windham County In addition to the expansion to Connecticut, Apple is also expanding its Apple Maps vans to new areas in New York and Arizona. Below are those new towns: New York Allegany County, Broome County, Cattaraugus County, Cayuga County, Chautauqua County, Chemung County, Chenango County, Cortland County, Dutchess County, Genesee County, Livingston County, Madison County, Nassau County, Niagara County, Onondaga County, Ontario County, Orange County, Orleans County, Putnam County, Rockland County, Schuyler County, Seneca County, Steuben County, Suffolk County, Sullivan County, Tioga County, Tompkins County, Ulster County, Wayne County, Wyoming County, Yates County Arizona La Paz County, Maricopa County, Pinal County, Yuma County It’s widely believed that Apple uses this data to gather advanced Maps data, such as Street View footage and 3D imagery. As Apple’s own self-driving car efforts continue to ramp up, however, some have speculated that Apple may also be using these vans to collect data to aid in that project. Of course, any sort of Maps data would be useful for autonomous driving, so it likely works both ways. We first detailed Apple’s camera-equipped vans back in 2015, explaining that the vans were helping Apple work towards its goal of providing its own Maps data by 2018. Thus, reducing its reliance on companies like TomTom for Map data. If you see an Apple Maps vehicle on the road, let us know about it down in the comments!

As  Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk typically does during the company's quarterly earnings calls, he shared key insighta about the business this week, including some comments on more speculative subjects. Commentary ranged from an update on what level of Model S and Model X sales Musk thinks Tesla can sustain, to his thoughts about the potential for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to buy Tesla.  Here's some of the most notable takeaways from Tesla's first-quarter earnings call (by way of an S&P Capital IQ transcript). Sustaining a 100,000-unit production rate for Model S and X In the past, Musk has indicated that he expected annual Model S and Model X deliveries to eventually hit a steady rate of about 100,000 units annually. While the company achieved this run-rate in its most recent quarter, some investors may be wondering whether the CEO still anticipates sustaining this level of production for the two pricey vehicles as its lower-cost, higher-volume Model 3 comes to market in July. Even as Model 3's launch approaches, it looks as if Musk still expects annual demand for the two vehicles to stay at this rate: We're going to produce 100,000 units approximately, so all that matters is there's demand. Is there going to be demand for 100,000 units? I believe there will be. And there is. Tesla CFO Deepak Ahuja added that there is "certainly sufficient demand" for Tesla's guidance for 47,000 to 50,000 total Model S and Model X deliveries during the first half of the year.  Apple hasn't shown interest in buying Tesla With Apple's cash hoard swelling to $257 billion in the company's most recent quarter, there's been some speculation that Tesla might be a good fit for a potential acquisition target for the tech giant. But Musk says Apple probably isn't interested anyway: I don't think they want to have a conversation [about buying Tesla]. I don't believe -- there's not been any indication that they do. Obviously, Apple company makes some great product. And yes, I mean, I use their phone and their laptop, it's cool. Musk added that he's unclear about what Apple wants to do "on the car front." Model Y is still a few years away Tesla has said that after its Model 3 production ramp-up, it plans to bring to market another SUV that's smaller than its Model X and closer in price to the $35,000 Model 3. But investors shouldn't expect the Model Y for another few years, Musk explained when he was asked about the company's goal to achieve annualized production of 1 million units annually by 2020: I think we need to come up with the Model Y sometime in 2020 or, aspirationally, late 2019. And then I think that 1 million units is quite likely -- combined, yes. Maybe more. Musk thinks energy-storage sales are about to jump When asked about why Tesla's total energy-storage megawatt hours deployed declined sequentially, Musk said the pullback in the near term is normal. But he still has high hopes for energy-storage deployment growth toward the end of the year: With respect to the battery stuff, it's a little lumpy right now, because you're at a big installation in [the] fourth quarter with Southern California Edison. And then we had a bit of a gap between the Powerwall 1 to Powerwall 2. So we should start to see that correcting in Q2 and Q3, and then particularly toward the end of this year, I would expect quite a dramatic ramp in storage deployment, like really dramatic. While Model Y may be still too far away for investors to give it much weight, and any speculation that Apple might buy Tesla might as well be ignored, investors should certainly keep an eye on demand for the Model S and X as the Model 3 comes to market. In addition, investors should watch Tesla's energy-storage sales to see if the company's nascent energy business can deliver on Musk's bullish expectations.  Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple and Tesla. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple and Tesla. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Home Apple News Apple Rumors iPhone iPad iPod Mac Apple TV Apple Watch About Apple Watch Share on Facebook How to send voice messages on your Apple Watch A few days ago we reported on how Apple had become the most wearable company sold globally, ahead of Fitbit or Xiaomi. Apple’s smartwatch is one of the most popular in the world, so this time we will focus on a very useful watchOS tutorial. The Apple Watch allows you to send messages to others using voice dictation, but sometimes it’s much easier and faster to send an audio message to communicate with your contacts via iOS, the native messaging app for watchOS. In this tutorial for Apple Watch, we will explain, step by step, how to send voice messages in the smartwatch of apple company bite. How do I send an audio message to Apple Watch? Before the release of watchOS 3, the behaviour of the operating system asked the users if they wanted to send transcribed text or recorded audio. Apple changed this functionality with the arrival of watchOS 3, making the interaction faster and smoother. 1. Open the Watch application on your iPhone. 2. Go to the Messages section. 3. Access the category of Dictated Messages. 4. From here you can change the default option to transcribe your messages or send audio. This is how Apple describes this option in watchOS 3: “By default, when you’ve finished dictating a message, Apple Watch sends a transcript of what you said. You can change this setting to send an audio clip instead, or choose which option you want each time you dictate a new message. “ If you have never sent dictation messages from voice to text you can use this section to send voice messages and save yourself the step of having to select the audio option each time.

The technology giant would still have $50 billion left to buy more than 700,000 Tesla model S electric cars or about four Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carriers. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg File Photo   Thomas Heath The Washington Post     So much cash is raining on some U.S.-based corporations that they are at a loss on what to do with all the money. With the $250 billion sitting in its bank account, Apple could comfortably go out and buy Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, at today's market price without borrowing a penny. The technology giant would still have $50 billion left to buy more than 700,000 Tesla model S electric cars or about four Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carriers. Then there's Microsoft. The Seattle-based software maker has the second-largest stash, at $126 billion, enough to buy a $100,000 home for 1.2 million Americans. And the blizzards of green are not limited to the tech sector. Legendary investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sits on $86 billion in cash. That's enough to pay for New York City's government operations for a year. The cash hoards are coming to the forefront as earnings season is heating up. U.S. companies are reporting mostly robust profits, and the stock market, especially technology shares, are ballooning. Some investors have cautioned that equities are frothy in light of the geopolitical risks such as North Korea and the political divide in the country. A big part of the reason behind the rich corporate caches is taxes -- or unpaid taxes. Apple, Microsoft and many other U.S.-based international companies are sitting on well more than $2 trillion in cash from untaxed overseas profits, which could be brought back to the United States to be used for investment and dividends if lawmakers lower the U.S. corporate tax rate, which at 35 percent is one of the highest in the world. "Apple is one of the best companies in the world, and a third of their value is sitting in vaults in Switzerland and Luxembourg and Dublin," said Timothy Loughran, a finance professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business. "Isn't that pathetic?" The Trump administration has promised to lower the corporate tax rate significantly. Economists and politicians on both sides of the aisle have said a lower corporate tax rate or a tax holiday that repatriates money from overseas will unleash hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions, in dividends and business investments in the United States. "Companies have been accumulating cash over many years," said David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland's Smith School of Business. "The perverse disincentives of our current corporate tax system are discouraging corporations from bringing back international profits to invest in the U.S." Apple chief executive Tim Cook, in an interview with The Washington Post last year, said federal and state taxes on Apple's cash reserves, the vast majority of which is overseas, is about 40 percent. Many U.S.-based companies leave their earnings overseas rather than pay the U.S. rate. "We've said at 40 percent, we're not going to bring it back until there's a fair rate," Cook said, adding that his company is the largest U.S. taxpayer. "There's no debate about it. It is the current tax law. It's not a matter of being patriotic or not patriotic. "We think it's fine for us to pay more, because right now we're paying nothing on that and we leave it over there," he said. "But we -- like many, many other companies do -- wait for the money to come back." If the corporate rate is reduced or a holiday is granted, Apple, Microsoft and others could pay a special dividend, buy back shares or both. They could also make acquisitions, although Apple has preferred to grow organically by inventing new products such as the iPhone and iPad and investing in itself. Apple earned $45.6 billion in profit in 2016 on revenue of $215 billion. It paid a handsome dividend of $2.18, although the rise in share price has cut its yield to about 1.7 percent and made the shares much less of a bargain than they once were. If Apple chose a special dividend, its $250 billion would cover a $48 payment on each of its 5.2 billion shares. That is highly unlikely, although some lump sum dividend is possible, and it could touch nearly every American who has a retirement plan or owns taxable mutual funds. "What is going to happen when Apple has $1 trillion in cash?" said Loughran, pointing out that the iPhone 10 is due out this year. "It won't be that long. What are we going to do then? The way I think about it is the treasure of America sitting in a vault in Switzerland. We created $250 billion from profits and we are not using it. This is an obvious reform that is needed." Kass said he expects a major return by Apple to shareholders through several vehicles, including an increase in the Apple dividend, stock buybacks and a big one-time dividend. He said it is less likely that Apple would make acquisitions, given the company's historic aversion to them. Berkshire Hathaway has little in overseas exposure because most of its profits are made in the United States. And Buffett has been reluctant for Berkshire Hathaway to pay dividends, arguing that he can make better use of the money by finding smart investments. "His companies are sufficiently profitable, and he is very patient, that his cash has accumulated over several years," Kass said. "But if the corporate rate is lowered from 35 percent to 15, 20, 25, it will result in additional profits for Berkshire and just about every other American-based corporation. "If that takes place, then Warren Buffett's pile of cash will increase much further," he said.

Management Wants You to Know Apple's CEO and CFO share updates on the company's App Store sales growth, what's driving Mac sales higher, one market where Apple isn't doing so great, and more. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) May 7, 2017 at 7:06AM With all the attention the media pays to Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) revenue, earnings, and iPhone sales, it's often easy to overlook other facets of the tech giant's business, suc has its App Store, Mac, and Apple Watch. Fortunately for investors, Apple management gave some useful updates on these topics during its earnings call last week.  Here are some of the most interesting tidbits from Apple's earnings call (by way of a Reuters transcript). Image source: Apple. Apple's App Store is still growing rapidly With Apple's services segment serving as the company's most consistently strong growth driver in recent quarters, investors have good reason to be interested in the sustainability of the segment's growth. This is why it's always good to get an update on how App Store sales are performing. Playing a key role in the segment's revenue growth, services revenue growth could slow if App Store sales peak. But App Store sales are still climbing sharply, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook: App Store momentum is terrific, with revenue growing 40% year over year to an all-time quarterly record. The number of developers offering apps for sale on our store was up 26% over last year, and we're thrilled to see their success. Apple's Mac business is crushing it While Apple's iPhone segment may get all the attention, investors shouldn't overlook the company's Mac business. Accounting for a small but still meaningful 11% of Apple's revenue, Mac sales were up a nice 14% year over year during Apple's second quarter -- not far below Apple's 18% year-over-year growth in its services segment. Apple CFO Luca Maestri explained the Mac segment's success: Revenue [for the Mac segment] was up 14% year over year and set a new March quarter record. We sold 4.2 million Macs, up 4% over last year, compared to zero growth in the PC market, according to IDC's latest forecast. Demand for MacBook Pro was very strong, helping to drive overall portables growth of 10%, twice the growth of the portables market. Apple Watch. Image source: Apple. Apple Watch is doing great, too Thanks to its fast-rising sales, Apple Watch, which is still lumped in with Apple's other products segment, is turning into a significant business for Apple. After the product's sales hit a record high in Apple's holiday quarter, Apple Watch sales continued on this momentum, with sales of the device nearly doubling year over year in Q2, management said. "Apple Watch is the best-selling and most loved smartwatch in the world, and we hear wonderful stories from our customers about its impact on their fitness and health," Cook noted. Hong Kong is dragging on Apple's Greater China segment Revenue in all of Apple's geographic operating segments, except Greater China, was up year over year in Apple's second quarter. Hong Kong was a particularly weak market in Apple's Greater China segment. Cook explained the company's challenges on Hong Kong, as well as what he expects in Hong Kong going forward: [O]ur performance continued to be weak in Hong Kong, which has been hit a bit harder as the tourism market continues to slump. Also, where the iPhone 7 Plus did well, we didn't perform as well on some of the previous-generation iPhones. ... What I now believe is that we'll improve a bit more during this current quarter, not back to growth but improve -- but make more progress. And we continue to believe that there's an enormous opportunity there. Though the iPhone may be more important to Apple's financial results than these four areas of the tech giant's business, all four of these trends are worth keeping an eye on. Investors should look for continued growth in App Store, Mac, and Apple Watch sales, as well as look for improvement in Hong Kong.  Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

It seems like every day there is new information about the iPhone 8, and Apple has hinted it’s not so happy about that. CEO Tim Cook recently blamed the “pause” in purchases of its current iPhone models on rumors about possible iPhone 8 features during his second-quarter 2017 earnings call this week. Read: iPhone 8 Rumors: Mock-Up Video Shows How Apple's Next Edition Might Look If you’re looking to buy the iPhone 8 this fall, here’s an overview of the device’s rumored features, release date and possible delay. iPhone 8 Rumored Features Display The upcoming iPhone 8,  which could also be called the iPhone X, iPhone Pro or iPhone Edition, reportedly will come with an OLED edge-to-edge display. Apple was said to have placed orders for OLED panels from Samsung for its upcoming model. The company also reportedly signed a two-year deal worth $9 billion with Samsung for OLED panels. The iPhone 8 is rumored to be released with the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, which are expected to come with LCD displays. iPhone 8 Smart Connector: AR and VR, Wireless Charging KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested earlier this year Apple’s 2017 iPhone lineup will feature wireless charging. Another report said the iPhone 8 will come with a wireless charging feature through Apple’s Smart Connector, which is used on the iPad Pro. The Smart Connector could also support augmented reality and virtual reality accessories, the Verifier reported. In February, it was revealed Apple had 1,000 engineers working on a project in Israel that could be related to AR. Embedded Touch ID Apple reportedly will embed the iPhone 8’s Touch ID into the screen display. However, an analyst from Cowen and Co. said last month the embedded Touch ID feature was the one causing Apple the most trouble. If Apple can’t embed the Touch ID into the front screen, it might ditch the idea completely and focus on face recognition. Apple could also move the Touch ID to the back of the screen, or delay the production of the 10th anniversary iPhone, the analyst said. 3D-Sensing Camera In February Kuo, suggested the iPhone 8 could have a 3D-sensing front camera. Other reports have suggested Himax Technologies will supply 3D sensors for Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8. Another report said Himax will supply components for Apple, adding that optical and photonic products manufacturer Lumentum will supply parts as well. Enhanced Siri Rumors suggest Apple’s next iPhone lineup will feature an improved version of Siri. A report in January said Apple was looking into revamping Siri to compete with other digital assistants, including the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Apple also reportedly will boost Siri with contextual learning abilities and deep integration with iMessage and iCloud in its upcoming iOS 11 update. Read: iPhone 8 Release Date Rumors: Apple Working On Advanced Camera Systems, Curved Screens, Stainless Steel Frame Vertical Dual Camera A Bloomberg report last month said Apple was testing more advanced cameras for the iPhone 8. The company reportedly will position the dual-camera system on the back of the device vertically instead of horizontally, unlike the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple was said to be testing dual-lenses for the front camera, an upgrade from last year’s models. iPhone 8 Leaks A picture of what is supposed to be a case for the iPhone 8 was leaked on Twitter at the end of April. The case shows a section for a vertical dual-camera. It also shows a longer power button on the bottom of the device, compared to the current smaller lightning port. Around the same time, a schematic of the iPhone 8 was also leaked. The schematic showed a spot for a vertical dual-camera and a circular hole underneath the logo, which could suggest a Touch ID placed on the back of the iPhone. iPhone 8 Release Date, Pre-Orders, Price The iPhone 8 is expected to launch in September, as Apple usually does. However, Kuo said the 10th anniversary iPhone could face "severe supply shortages" when it releases. Meanwhile, analyst Brian White previously said Apple will introduce the iPhone 8 and take preorders in September, but deliveries might not start until “several weeks later.” The iPhone 8 is rumored to have a price tag exceeding $1,000. iPhone 8 Delay Rumors Although some reports point to a September release of the iPhone 8, others suggest the launch could be delayed. Some rumors point to a delayed release date because of key components for the 3D-sensing camera. Another report said the iPhone 8 could be delayed until late October or November, pointing to trouble with Apple’s OLED display order. Another reason for Apple’s delay is that the company and its suppliers are working to patch up overheating problems with wireless charging components.

Netflix, Walt Disney Also Maybe On iPhone Maker’s Acquisition List, Report Says By Himanshu Goenka @HimGoJourno On 05/07/17 AT 7:17 AM Close In its recently released financial results, iPhone maker Apple revealed it is sitting on a massive $250 billion of cash reserves. And while social media was abuzz with what all that amount of money could hypothetically buy or finance, some analysts took a more realistic approach. According to Citibank analyst Jim Suva, the company will likely use part of the money to fund an acquisition, and among the seven potential targets listed in the Citibank note are names like Tesla, Netflix and Walt Disney, Reuters reported. Among those three, Tesla is currently the cheapest, in terms of market capitalization. The Elon Musk company recently overtook well-entrenched rivals, Ford and General Motors, and had a market cap of $52.84 billion at the close of Friday trade on Nasdaq. By comparison, Netflix had a market cap of $67.22 billion at close of trade, and Walt Disney, whose shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange, is valued much higher at over $178 billion. The Apple logo is displayed at a store in the central business district of Sydney on April 6, 2017. Photo: Getty Images Read: Tesla To Launch Pick-Up Trucks In September All three, however, are still well within Apple’s reach, and if the company bought even two of them, it would still have cash to spare. However, will any of those companies be willing to sell itself to Apple, is another matter altogether. Tesla, for one, seems unlikely to be in a hurry to be acquired by anyone. In its own earnings call earlier this week, Tesla revealed it was automating the process of manufacturing for the upcoming Model 3 sedan. And Musk reportedly said in an interview that increased mechanization of the production line would make his company as valuable as Apple. Scott Skjong, a Tesla production supervisor, examines a Model S for paint quality at the company's factory in Fremont, California, June 22, 2012. Photo: REUTERS/Noah Berger The other four potential targets for acquisition by Apple, listed by the Citibank analyst, were video streaming service Hulu, and video game developers Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts and Take Two Interactive Software. Hulu isn’t publicly traded, and the other three companies have market caps of $41.12 billion, $29.82 billion and $6.82 billion respectively. All three trade on Nasdaq. According to Suva, Apple could be in a rush to spend its cash pile to take advantage of a new tax proposal by President Donald Trump’s administration. The proposal is to allow U.S.-based multinational companies to repatriate their earnings outside the country at a tax rate of 10 percent, down from the current 35 percent. Over 90 percent of the Cupertino, California, company’s cash is parked outside the U.S. “Since one of the new administration’s top priorities is to allow U.S. companies to repatriate overseas cash at a lower tax rate, Apple may have a more acute need to put this cash to use, Reuters quoted Suva as saying. Read: Apple Hires NASA Engineers For Self-Driving Car Project If Trump’s tax proposal becomes the law, and Apple brings back all of its cash reserves to the U.S., it would still be sitting on over $220 billion, enough to buy any of the companies mentioned in Suva’s note, and then some. Apple, also traded on Nasdaq, is the world’s most valuable company. It closed Friday trade with a market cap of $789.53 billion.

Shares could exceed $1,000 by summer and gain 20% in a year. By Jack Hough Biography Updated May 6, 2017 1:46 a.m. ET As Amazon.com stock nears its 20th birthday, its long-term holders have already enjoyed many happy returns. The price has soared from $2 to $934, adjusted for splits, since the first day of trading on May 15, 1997. That puts Amazon’s market value at $450 billion, making it the fourth-largest U.S. company, behind Apple (ticker: AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT). No company has ever reached such a size with so little in cumulative profit—about $5 billion since going public. Alphabet, by comparison, has earned $90 billion over just the past five years.

The survey released Thursday by Strategy Analytics showed Apple grabbed a 15.9 percent share of the wearables market in the first quarter. While Apple does not release sales figures for its Apple Watch, the estimate by Strategy Analytics showed a 59 percent jump in sales from a year earlier, with 3.5 million units sold in the first three months of the year. “The new Apple Watch Series 2 is selling relatively well in the US, UK and elsewhere, due to enhanced styling, intensive marketing and a good retail presence,” said Strategy Analytics executive director Neil Mawston. Fitbit, which has been a longtime leader of the wearables market with its fitness bands, slipped to third place on a 36 percent slide in sales in the first quarter, the research firm said. The survey found that China’s Xiaomi, which makes a budget-priced fitness band, was the second-largest vendor with a 15.5 percent global market share, ahead of Fitbit’s 13.2 percent. “Fitbit has lost its wearables leadership to Apple, due to slowing demand for its fitness bands and a late entry to the emerging smartwatch market,” said Strategy Analytics researcher Cliff Raskind. “Fitbit’s shipments, revenue, pricing and profit are all shrinking at the moment and the company has a major fight on its hands to recover this year.” Overall, the report said sales of wearables rose 21 percent from a year earlier to 22 million units, led by stronger demand for new smartwatch models.

By Washington Post May 6, 2017 at 3:58 pm | Print View Apple says it intends to bolster the U.S. manufacturing sector by creating a $1 billion “advanced manufacturing fund” — with some of that initial money going toward a company the tech giant is prepared to partner with, CEO Tim Cook said. The announcement, which Cook made Wednesday on CNBC, comes after months of focus by President Donald Trump on jobs, manufacturing and the global economy. Cook did not appear to suggest that his company’s decision was influenced by Trump. But the president has showered praise on companies such as Carrier, Softbank and Charter Communications for promising to hire more American workers — even if some of those pledges predated Trump’s tenure. Unlike those firms, Apple’s announcement was not a hiring promise. The company simply said that it was hoping to promote U.S. manufacturing with its new fund. “We’ve talked to a company we’re going to invest in already,” Cook said. Apple intends to invest in programs that can train workers how to code, Cook added. But that much of the money for this effort will be borrowed rather than drawn from its substantial cash reserves. Cook has spoken previously about the shortage of U.S. workers who can perform advanced manufacturing. Advanced manufacturing differs from typical manufacturing in that it often requires specialized skills to produce highly engineered components that go into Apple’s products. “The U.S., over time, began to stop having as many vocational kind of skills,” Cook told “60 Minutes” in 2015. “I mean, you can take every tool-and-die maker in the United States and probably put them in a room that we’re currently sitting in. “In China, you would have to have multiple football fields.” Apple has taken some steps to highlight a commitment to U.S. jobs. In 2013, the company announced that it would begin manufacturing its high-end Mac Pro computer in Texas. But in recent years, the Mac Pro’s reputation has faltered amid complaints that the device is difficult to upgrade and poorly suited for next-generation computing. The share of Apple customers who use the Mac Pro are in the single digits, according to company execs in a recent interview with a number of Silicon Valley journalists — raising questions about the state of Apple’s U.S. manufacturing presence. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment for this story. Cook said Apple would release more details about its plans for the manufacturing fund later this month. Even as it pledges to spend big, Apple and other tech companies still have billions of dollars in revenues stashed overseas. Bringing that money home likely would incur a hefty tax bill — which is why Trump has proposed slashing corporate tax rates in a way that encourages businesses to repatriate those funds. Cook said that he’s hopeful the Trump administration can succeed with that push. Labor economists say restoring U.S. manufacturing jobs will be difficult at a time when automation is increasingly threatening to replace many workers. Businesses may move their factories back to the United States, but because American workers are still more expensive to employ than robots, those corporate decisions may not lead to an uptick in hiring. “The mentality is, ‘Can we increase our output first by becoming more efficient by using better technology as the first resort?’” Augustine Tantillo, president of the National Council of Textile Organization, told the Los Angeles Times. Analysts predict that even highly specialized industries such as law or radiology may be shaken up by artificial intelligence. And the trend isn’t just problematic for older workers. By 2030, more than a third of all U.S. jobs may be done by robots, according to a recent study by the consulting agency PricewaterhouseCoopers. Like what you're reading?

Illustration: David Simonds/Observer Technology sector Business leader Apple can’t just make iPhones for ever. What’s next?

But the company has $250bn to spend … Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Sunday 7 May 2017 02.00 EDT As the biggest company in the world, Apple operates to different rules from other businesses. That was apparent against last week when Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, partly blamed weaker-than-expected iPhone sales on leaks about future products. Cook said that there had been a “pause in purchases” due to “earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones”. There is undoubtedly some truth in this – why buy a product when you know a better version will be available in a few months? However, this is an issue that Apple faces every year; indeed, it is something that it actively encourages with its glitzy ceremonies to launch new and upgraded products. Wall Street appears to have shrugged off the news that Apple missed expectations, because shares in the company still rose 3% over the last week. It remains the most valuable company in the world, with a stock market value of more than $750bn (£579m). However, the quarterly results are a reminder that the company is far from infallible and that its extraordinary run of success since launching the iPhone in 2007 is nearer the end than the start. Apple reported iPhone sales of 50.8m in the first three months of 2017, down by 1% year-on-year. Its revenues grew 5% to $52.9bn, which was just below analysts’ forecasts of $53.1bn. The company’s financial performance is heavily reliant on the iPhone. While it generated more than $33bn of sales in the quarter, a category it defines as “other products”, which includes the iPod, Apple TV and the Apple Watch, generated just $2.9bn. While the Apple Watch may be popular with those who use it, it has certainly not created a new platform of customers for the company to meaningfully develop – not yet, anyway. Reports in the technology industry suggest that the next iPhone will be a significant step forward. According to rumours, it could include wireless charging, 3D facial recognition and a curved display. But even so, an upgrade to an existing product is unlikely to be a game-changer in the same way that the original iPhone was a decade ago, or the iPod and the iPad were. It is also worth remembering that Apple saw sales of the iPhone decline in 2016; last October, the company revealed its first fall in annual sales and profits in 15 years. It would be foolhardy to call this the peak for Apple, because you can never be sure what mystery products are lurking in its research and development buildings. However, it is clearly becoming more difficult for Apple, Samsung and others to expand the smartphone sector. The devices are now effectively a commodity, particularly in the western world. The market is for customers looking to upgrade every couple of years rather than those looking to buy their first handset. But a slowdown in its biggest market makes the $250bn cash mountain that Apple is still sitting on even more intriguing. Analysts at Citigroup, the investment bank, have drawn up a list of seven companies that Apple could buy with the cash. Their candidates are Netflix, Walt Disney, Tesla, streaming service Hulu, and video game makers Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts and Take Two Interactive. Some of these deals, such as Disney or the videogame makers, would basically be bolt-ons that would allow Apple to share the success these businesses already enjoy. Buying Tesla, however, could be transformative and help Apple down the path towards transferring its technology to driverless and electric vehicles. Rumours suggest that Apple may already be working on an electric vehicle anyway. Even if Apple does not do a deal, it seems its next move will be about bringing its technology closer to our everyday lives, whether through a car or turning its headphones into health monitors, another rumoured plan. As smartphone sales slow, we are closer than ever to finding out what Apple’s next move will be. In the wrong at Pearson Pearson chief executive John Fallon’s suggestion that he was somehow doing the decent thing was irritating. After collecting a £343,000 bonus for a year in which the educational publisher lost £2.6bn, Fallon told shareholders on Friday: “I don’t decide what CEOs get paid but I did decide once the payment was made that the right thing to do was buy shares in Pearson.” No, Mr Fallon, after a year like 2016, the right course was to waive the bonus and rub along on your £780,000 salary. It is true that the last of the five profits warnings in the past four years arrived a few weeks after the end of Pearson’s financial year, but it was a humdinger of a warning. It signalled a cut in the dividend this year, thereby removing the sole source of solace for investors during Fallon’s ill-starred reign. The share price, even after the bounce that accompanied the unveiling of yet another restructuring plan, has halved in little more than two years. Fallon is correct that the remuneration committee sets his pay. Thus Elizabeth Corley, chair of that committee, and Sidney Taurel, group chairman, must take direct blame for a fiasco that saw almost two-thirds of voting shareholders oppose the remuneration report. Almost a third also opposed Pearson’s forward-looking pay policy. That level of opposition is extremely rare at FTSE 100 companies. Corley also received a 27% vote against her re-election. She is the former chief executive of giant investment manager Allianz Global Investors, so this was a case of shareholding fund managers voting against one of their own. She should take the hint and go. Pearson’s commitment to “continuing dialogue with our shareholders” on pay will look thin if the same individual is sent out to bat again. “We’re the world’s learning company,” says the corporate blurb, but Pearson has shown zero understanding of the public anger over undeserved corporate pay. The lesson isn’t hard: when you’ve reported record losses, don’t give the boss a bonus. Shale industry turns tables on Opec Oil industry hopes that the price of Brent crude would stabilise at around $60 (£46) a barrel were dashed last week. The price was supposed to rise from the average of $55 seen over recent months, following a squeeze on oil production orchestrated by Saudi Arabia and the 13-nation Opec cartel. An improving global economy was also expected to push the price higher as global demand outstripped supply. Indeed, BP and Shell reported bumper profits last week amid signs of an upturn for the big industry players. But US shale operators have had other ideas. They turned on the taps once the price passed $50 and their derricks became profitable again. This led to the oil price falling below the $50 mark again last week. For consumers, it spells a return to lower prices at the petrol pumps and some relief from rising inflation. For the industry and Opec, however, it confirms that shale provides an effective cap on prices however hard they work.

Worldwide tablet shipments have declined 8.5% over the past year, Q1 is the tenth straight quarter in decline Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 1:20pm PDTMay 4, 2017 72 Plus 1 on G+ 42 Share on Facebook 115 Share on Twitter Total Shares229 News Remember when everyone thought tablets would replace PCs, at least for average consumers? Yeah, that didn't happen. In fact, the opposite is happening. In a report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide tablet shipments in Q1 2017 have dropped 8.5% compared to Q1 2016, with just 36.2 million devices shipped. In addition, Q1 2017 is the tenth straight quarter where the tablet market saw a decline, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. It's worth noting that the IDC only counts 'slates' (tablets lacking a keyboard) and 'detachables' (tablets with first-party keyboards) as tablets. There are a few reasons for this continuing decline, which shouldn't be surprising to anyone. Convertible laptops, commonly referred to as 2-in-1s, have been cannibalizing the tablet market for a while now. The rise of larger smartphones didn't help tablets either. Apple remained top dog over the past quarter, with 8.9 million unit shipments. Samsung followed in second place, with Huawei, Amazon, and Lenovo rounding out the top five manufacturers. Apple's results likely had a small bump from the recent 9.7" iPad refresh. Samsung also released the Galaxy Tab S3 during this time, but it launched near the end of Q1, so the impact is likely negligible. Again, this shouldn't be surprising to anyone. There has been very little incentive for people with tablets to buy new ones, and Android tablets haven't seen much attention from OEMs or Google since the Honeycomb days. Press Release FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The worldwide tablet market once again contracted in the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) with total shipments of 36.2 million, a year-over-year decline of 8.5%, according to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker. The first quarter contraction marks the tenth straight quarter that tablets have experienced a decline over the same quarter a year earlier, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. The tablet market is comprised of two different product categories, which are headed in very different directions as noted by IDC in the past. Devices offering a first-party keyboard, which IDC refers to as detachable tablets, continue to grow for the most part. Many of these devices have quickly grown to resemble products that IDC refers to as traditional notebook PCs or laptops. The other product category is slate tablets (those lacking this keyboard option), which saw shipments peak in 2014 and is now in a steep decline that IDC believes will continue throughout the forecast period. "As far as most are aware, the tablet market was created in 2010 with the launch of the original iPad, despite unsuccessful product attempts by other OEMs in the years leading up to this," said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers. "The rate at which the tablet market grew from 2010 to 2013 was unlike many other consumer-oriented device markets we've seen before. However, it appears for many reasons consumers became less eager to refresh these devices, or in some instances purchase them at all. We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones, along with rather minimal technology and form factor progression." At the same time that this roller coaster of tablet growth, peak, and decline was taking place, the personal computer market was experiencing one the worst declines the market's history. Fast forward to 1Q17 and traditional PCs have returned to growth, albeit relatively flat growth, for the first time since 1Q12. "A long-term threat to the overall PC market lies in how the market ultimately settles on the detachable versus convertible debate," said Linn Huang, research director, Devices & Displays at IDC. "To date, detachable shipments have dwarfed those of convertibles, but growth of the former has slowed a bit. In IDC's 2017 U.S. Consumer PCD Survey, fielded over the previous two months, detachable owners held slightly more favorable attitudes towards their detachables than convertible owners did for their convertibles. However, owners of both were far more likely to recommend a convertible over a detachable." IDC's outlook is that detachables will continue to far outpace convertibles in shipments, but the market pendulum seems to be swinging back in favor of convertibles if ever so slightly. Still, the detachable market has proven it will move with major product launches and Microsoft and Apple have yet to launch their 2017 salvos. Tablet Company Highlights Apple experienced its 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment decline despite being the market leader in 1Q17. Apple's results show that it is not immune to the changing dynamics of industry and consumer demand, part of which is due to the ongoing success of its other product lines. 2016 was Apple's first full year of iPad Pro shipments, which included the launch of the smaller screen lower-cost 9.7 inch version. This product line quickly elevated Apple to the top of the growing detachable tablet market segment, and IDC believes Apple is in a good spot to remain competitive at the top of this segment despite using a 'mobile OS' while many of its competitors are entering the space with Windows-based devices. Samsung remained the number 2 tablet provider despite seeing shipments decline 1.1% year over year in 1Q17. Much like Apple, Samsung continues to migrate its tablet portfolio to the detachable segment and to support this the company launched three new products at this year's Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona in February. After supposedly leaving the PC business in 2014, Samsung now finds itself approaching the market again with a handful of Windows 10 detachable tablet models. The move isn't surprising as the entire industry seems keen on taking advantage of this market opportunity. Huawei was the only company among the top 5 to experience positive growth in 1Q17 with shipments of 2.7 million, which was up 31.7% from the 2.0 million shipped in the first quarter a year ago. Like Samsung, Huawei has also slowly migrated its tablet portfolio from an Android slate tablet lineup to now include a mix of Windows-based detachable devices. It is somewhat unclear how serious Huawei is about going down the Windows device route, but given this quarter's growth while others decline it seems the mix strategy and tablet play is working for the company. Amazon.com continues to fluctuate in and out of the top rankings with its low-cost Kindle Fire devices. In 1Q17 the company shipped 2.2 million devices, all of which continue to be aimed at a very aggressive price point with a strategy to drive content and product sales via the device. Regardless of the changing industry dynamics mentioned in this release, Amazon seems poised to remain a competitor given its market strategy. Lenovo rounded out the top 5 with 2.1 million tablets shipped in the quarter. Of all the companies in the top 5, Lenovo is likely best positioned in terms of channel strategy to grow its tablet business and IDC expects to see more of its successful notebook PC lineup migrate into the detachable tablet category. Lenovo captured 5.7% market share in 1Q17, which was down just slightly from the 5.5% market share it had at this time last year. Notes: Total tablet market includes slate tablets plus detachable tablets. References to "tablets" in this release include both slate tablets and detachable devices. The reference to 'convertibles' for convertible notebooks, which are notebook PCs that have keyboards that can either flip, spin, or twist, but unlike detachable tablets, convertible notebook keyboards are hardwired to the display.

My Nexus 7 has been in a drawer since I got my Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P. Geoff Johnson Plus ultrabooks have been getting smaller, lighter, and cheaper, so it's not as much of a pain to carry around a laptop like it was 5 years ago. Suicide_Note Agreed. Buying the N6 made my second gen N7 pretty much irrelevant/redundant, so i sold it and never bought another tablet after that. Timmy Turner Same, although I still whip it out for road trips for movies. Dan Nah, I bought a used N9 on swappa to go with my N6, I read books and e-mail and such on the N6, but the larger screen is much better for web surfing, shopping etc. Callanish My Nexus 7 LTE continues to get decent use as it splits the battery load with my 6P so I don't need to charge the phone throughout the day. It is getting long in the tooth though as far as performance though. Keeping a close eye on Lenovo's new tablets coming out in May, especially the 8 inch tab 4 plus LTE model which should make for a decent replacement to the Nexus 7 2013. Thade780 When I got my Nexus 6 I thought the same, but then I started craving a bigger screen for when I was at home and just wanted to browse Reddit and watch Youtube. In the end I got a 10" Samsung S2 and I'm in fucking love with it. It's still plenty fast and does everything I need, so I'm going to skip the S3. I may end up with a possible Tab S4 next year. Master Yates I disagree as my Galaxy Tab S2 is much nicer for surfing the net than my One Plus 3 when I'm at home. As soon as One Plus makes a tablet, I'll be all over it. sbeaulieu My Nexus 9 is working so great it make me want to buy another one. /s & /s Peter Silie I'm fine with my N9 :) (/nosarcasm) wjrandon Burn the Nexus 9 with fire. freddyba I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5", and it works great. However I won't buy another Galaxy Tab S(X) until they get a 16:9 screen again. I will just stick with what I have, replace the battery in a few years if need be. However I will gladly take suggestions on 16:9 tablets if any one has them! Marty They say the iPad is also in decline. I find that difficult to believe because I own a number of iPads and find them to be the finest web browsing tool ever created. I use mine for media playing, web browsing and a few other task-related things. I came from a PC, which is all I cared to use for web browsing and everything else. But since owning an iPad, the PC now seems clunky at best. I hate to even boot my PCs up. I relegate them strictly to command line tasks. They just don't provide the ease and simplicity of usage I experience with my iPads. I also own Android tablets. There has never been an Android tablet in my experience that has been worth a damn for reliable web browsing or other usage. In my opinion they are the absolute worst devices yet. So, given the value I deem of the iPad trying to understand why it's not selling like gangbusters, I just wonder if people aren't buying Android tablets, getting the same horrifically crappy experience I have with them and then condemning all tablets as worthless...the iPad included? I just wonder if people are being terminally pessimistic about *all* tablets because of any experience with Android tablets? I can understand that if that's happening. I've tended to be that way with things at times myself. catalysto I can't speak to the decline of the iPad, but I absolutely hate any tablet browsing experience. Mobile web browsing is painfully limited in many cases, and for that reason alone, I cannot get into the idea of replacing my laptop with a tablet. I'd get a Chromebook before getting a tablet (though in an ideal situation, I'd have a nice, convertible ultrabook). Marty I've done pretty much ever configuration of PC. I started out buying an eMachines tower a very long time ago. Then I bought a Velocity Micro tower rig. Then I started building my own custom tower rigs. Built several and even sold one on eBay trying to go into the custom PC business. Didn't work out due to family-related issues. Then I got into laptops and have owned a handful. Now I'm into tablet PCs. I own two: a Sony 11.6" Vaio Tap 11 and a Surface 3. None of them have been as convenient to use as my iPads. I doubt I will ever buy another PC...unless MS can somehow radically improve Windows to where it's as convenient and easy to use as an iPad. Not likely, though. catalysto Yeah, but none of that addresses the software limitations of a mobile browser. I understand that it's important to find a good device, but I think that can already be found in several existing ultrabook and convertible devices. But of course, if you are fine with the mobile browsing experience, that's totally fine, too. iPads are definitely great for that! Marty The hardware... generally... isn't the problem with PCs, it's the software and browsers that presents the biggest convenience blockage. Microsoft's Edge browser is about the best you can get for user convenience, but it oales in comparison to Safari on the iPad. I was a big Firefox fan for PC browsing, and on powerful enough equipment it's really good. But on a Surface 3, it sucks. So it all depends on the configuration of a PC to get the best out of it. I agree, the capability of mobile browsers can't match a PC experience. But for general web browsing usage, the iPad can't be beat. catalysto I have to disagree. Chrome is great, and it has given me the best browsing experience by far -- especially because of its speed and cross-device syncing. And again, I loathe any sort of mobile browser, so pretty much any desktop browser would be preferable to me. But this is obviously very subjective, so I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. I mean, it's great that you are so satisfied with the iPad, but making general statements like "can't be beat" is inherently incorrect because of different people's preferences. By the way, I only mentioned hardware because you brought it up when describing all the different machines you've tried. Marty It's not incorrect. People that haven't used an iPad for web surfing are basing their assertions on the Android experience. Yes, mobile browsing on any Android sucks bad...at least used to till Samsung Internet Beta came along. But I have used Chrome on all systems and the bookmarks system on mobile Chrome makes it entirely miserable for people who are used to a desktop browsing experience. Safari alleviates much of the misery by providing a near-desktop experience, but without a mouse. catalysto It is indeed incorrect because it's based on a subjective evaluation. There's no "right answer". We have several iOS devices in our home, so I've used iPads and iPhones extensively. Regardless, I hate any mobile browsing experience -- on iPad or otherwise. Mobile means any mobile browser on any OS. Though I will say that I much prefer Chrome on Android to Safari on iOS, so, again, subjective. And I find the Chrome bookmarks work great, so I don't know what you're talking about there either. The bookmark and tab syncing is another of my favorite features, actually. Marty You keep expounding on Chrome's syncing capabilities. I'm talking about actual usage. If I have to press a menu button and then press another button to find my bookmarks, IT IS NOT A DESKTOP BROWSER EXPERIENCE. You absolutely have immediate access to bookmarks on a desktop browser. You absolutely have immediate access to bookmarks in mobile Safari. You do not have immediate access to bookmarks on mobile Chrome. And you CANNOT use desktop chrome on Android. Jeeeze! How the hell are people so blind and so deft??? catalysto I'm not expounding on anything; I'm just mentioning a feature I really like about Chrome and one of the reasons I prefer it over other browsers. In any case, I see this conversation is going nowhere. So as I suggested earlier, we'll just have to agree to disagree. =) Marty Yeah, whatever. Thankfully there's now a much better alternative on Android. No need to put up with Google's ignorance or laziness. Marty Here's what I hear people like you say...people who seem to f*cking love the bookmarks in mobile Chrome: "I have to press a billion buttons to get to bookmarks in mobile Chrome, but they're there. What's wrong?" Nexus Hexus I find using my Acer X34 Monitor, Core i7 7700k @5Ghz, GTX 1070, 32GB Ram, 960 EVO SSD to be worlds better then any iPad. You're one of those people that say your new phone or tablet is better to use then his 10 year old budget computer. Marty To each, his own. Brandon V. Fletcher iPad sales have been going down for a while. https://www.recode.net/2017/1/31/14460952/apple-ipad-sales-still-falling mxwp it's none of those reasons. it is because people with ipads don't buy new ipads every year, unlike with their iphones. everyone that wants one pretty much already has one. Marty To a certain extent, that's probably true. I know for myself that if my 16GB iPad Air 2 hadn't kept running out of space whenever I tried to install a few free apps BGR's daily listing, I would have kept using it and never would have bought a new one with more storage. But what you're saying assumes everyone already owns an iPad. Not likely. I run into people all the time online and in person who don't own one. So I believe there's a huge marketing potential if Apple can figure out how to sell the iPad properly. JLV90 Well most people use tablets for media consumption you don't need much performance to run netflix and youtube. RiftSilver I'm wondering if I'm just not looking, or uniformed. But what happened to good budget friendly tablets like the Nexus 7 (2013)? I love mine, still going strong. I know myself and others I know are in the market for a new good tablet, but for what most good tablets are going for now, ~$600, I'd rather buy a laptop. Jonathan Litwinka They stopped being "good". You can get an okay tablet for between $150-$200 at Costco or Amazon, but the tech is still comparable to the Nexus 7 (2013). Master Yates Agreed. The Nexus 7 2013 was way ahead of its time and that why its lasted so long. I'm not an LCD fan but the screen on the Nexus 7 2013 remains awesome. Callanish Keep your eye on the Lenovo Tab 4 range being released in May. Good pricing, decent specs and running Nougat 7.1.1. Like you, my Nexus 7 13 has been a workhorse, but performance has become my biggest gripe, even after cleaning out the cache now and then. Defenestratus My Pixel C is basically a laptop. It works beautifully for what I use it for - web browsing, kindle-reading and minor productivity work. fgd135 I replaced my tablet with a Samsung Chromebook Plus and couldn't be happier. destinyhud planning on doing this but waiting more devices burkett375 Waiting on the Pro...the processor on the + has me worried. dizel123 There are basically 2 classes of tablets. The decent ones that are waaaayyyy overpriced and the cheap ones that are absolute garbage. And most of them have very little to no software support. If companies sold decent tablets for decent prices and guaranteed updates, maybe people would buy them. destinyhud this is why i think a chromebook pixel c2 would be the best of both world. pixel c was just $500 Mix Bought an 8 " $200 Samsung tab A for my 2 year old for Paw Patrol and what not and it's great, the Galaxy tab S3 is $799...like what the balls Samsung!? Who would ever pay that for a freaking tablet? Zap Rowsdower Someone who has somebody else paying for it, like a school or company or relative as a gift. I bought a no-name Android tablet a few months ago, with keyboard and case for US$39.00. I popped a 512MB sd card in it and it's in my workshop for playing music on bluetooth speakers, watching how-to videos, casting to a nearby TV, whatever ... and other than a crap screen resolution, it's fast and works great. $39.00! Nicholas Conrad You're forgetting about the Nexus 7 Leonardo Coleman I initiated freelancing over world wide web, participating in some fundamental assignments which mainly needed a personal computer and also having access to internet in addition to Now I am more delighted than ever... half a year have gone by since i begun this and additionally i had income total of $36k...

Nicholas Conrad Sure, but they're still going strong. Really, what are tablets good for besides media consumption, and the N7 does that fine still.

Ethan Nelson-Moore In a root terminal run: sleep 5; echo ff > /proc/ektf_dbg Then set your tablet on a flat surface and don't touch it for 5 seconds. It will recalibrate the screen. mxwp that was stated in the article... people with tablets are not buying new ones Nicholas Conrad Sure, because all they're really great at is watching movies on planes, and a 4 year old one is as good at that as a new one. No compelling new features to drive the upgrade cycle. Kristian Ivanov And the Shield K1 (the actual successor to the Nexus 7 2013) shonangreg Yeah, I've been waiting for a couple of years to buy a replacement for my Nexus 7. Other than the NVidia Shield K1, nothing was decent. So, I finally got an iPad Pro 9.7 last year (discount coupon with a pocket WiFi device). I still want a replacement for the Nexus 7, but I'm reluctant to buy the Shield K1 now as it is at the end of its life (and still not heavily discounted, at least here in Japan). Nicholas Conrad Yeah, I didn't buy a K1 because I was convinced an X1 tablet was just around the corner, regret that now. Sorry to hear about your ipad: I had one once, it was terrible. Zap Rowsdower Why was owning your iPad a terrible experience? That would be helpful to know. Nicholas Conrad It was my only ever apple device. It started with an ordeal over signing into the darn thing to begin with because you have to have an apple id to sign in, and it can't create one for you, then itunes is a racket, you need a new $15 app for everything you want to do. The darn thing doesn't even have a file system, so you need to buy apps that can move files from where some apps can see them to where other apps can see them. Playing movies or music from my LAN was nearly impossible because apple wants you to buy all of your content from them, and it doesn't play well with anything not made by apple. But mostly it was just buggy. I had constant app crashes and resprings, kept losing work onenote data and had to chuck it in a drawer. I mean, isn't their whole thing that it "just works"? There wasn't one redeeming thing about it if you're not already entrenched in the ios ecosystem. You still can't even set gosh-darn default apps on ios for crying out loud.... shonangreg My iPad has become my favorite device. I use the iPad for all communications (all duplicated on my phone and most on my N7). It is only when I'm at my desk or walking that my PCs or my phone get their turn. Si vis pacem, para bellum To me it's not even that, it's the lack of choice between the very good ones (the "way overpriced" ones). I have a 2.5+ years old Tab S 10.5 LTE which I love and use a lot when at home and even use as a laptop replacement when I live part of the year abroad (I used to carry my Windows laptop with me, not anymore). I don't see any real alternatives to my Tab S (I may be interested in a Pixel C, now that with Nougat it has finally got MultiWindows, but it's not sold here in Italy) and I have not upgraded to a Tab S2 nor am I probably going to upgrade to the Tab S3 because the marginal improvements are simply not worth it. Actually, they almost feel like a downgrade since they have removed the IR blaster (which I DO use), they put smaller batteries, they went for the 4:3 aspect ratio (I much prefer 16:10) and the S3 has a glass back (I MUCH prefer the "rubbery" one of my Tab S! At least they didn't choose a F'ing metal back, which is the thing that I hate the most on handheld devices). Compelling new features (like an *integrated* S-Pen, I am a Note user from the original one and I miss it on my tablet!) or substantial improvements in specs/battery life are the only reasons who would motivate me to upgrade since I don't have any problems with my Tab S: while not exactly blazing fast it runs quite well (it's on stock, rooted Marshmallow) and still gives me 5+ hours of SOT. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Then theirs Windows 2in1s. Windows 10 is definitely the way to go for 10inch screens. Ah I see what Microsoft did there lol. UniBroW Except the new ipad at $329, it's lightening fast and loads web content like a champ. Couple that with ad blockers from the App Store and you have a great tablet that can't do most PC things but amazingly good once you get over the home screen PVL_93_RU Here's the problem though... it's an Apple device. If you were an avid user of something like the Nexus 7 - you'd have to make a big switch to a whole new platform. Meaning you need to get used to new software, to deal with certain missing features, as well as having to repurchase the entire library of your apps and games, which is a big investment on top of buying the iPad in the first place. Then there's cases, accessories, .. JSo Well if a company would make something worth buying it might change. Marty You mean if a company would make an *Android tablet* worth buying it might change. There are none. Brian Klippel We buy used nexus 9's in this house. With nexus gone, all of the new tablets on the market are way to expensive for what they offer. Pretty much only the pixel will get more than a year of updates and it's just too expensive to watch youtube and play candy crush on. I had one samsung tablet that I smashed with a hammer because it was such a POS. Master Yates Nexus 9's? I'm surprised people aren't paying you to take them away. Biff Wonsley Last fall I bought an Asus ZenPad 8.0 (Z380M.) Not especially impressive specs, but it's fine for the usual apps & reading books & only cost $130. And about a month ago it was updated with Nougat, which I didn't in my wildest dreams expect. I have a Nexus 6, but I can't imagine reading a book with it. So long as 8" or so tablets are available, I'll have one. What passes for a phablet these days isn't big enough. Jay There hasn't exactly been many new and/or good tablets to help with these statistics either. Marc Edwards "Apple remained top tog" I think you mean top dog there my friend. fijisiv are you sure he didn't mean "dop tog"? Mix Maybe he was asking us a question? "Apple remained, got pot?" illregal There have been no new tablet releases.. Cakefish No need to replace my iPad Air 2 yet, it's still a beast. And I'm sure it'll handle iOS 11 just fine. destinyhud i dont think my ipad air will handle ios 11. i might not update and later get a Chromebook detachable Taios I understand this. But I so so so want someone to release a replacement for my nexus 7 2013. destinyhud come on chromebook pixel c2 Dan The "problem" if you want to look at it as one, is that people that want one have one and don't need an upgrade. If it ain't broke why buy a new one? Same thing in the PC market, it's not a decline in number used or in the house, just in sold because there is nothing wrong with the current one. Iamsecond Exactly! It irritates me every time I see a 'tablets sales decline' article that no-one seems to mention this. Tablets are simple devices for simple use cases such as web browsing and media consumption and so most older tablets do the job just fine. shonangreg A lot of Nexus 7 owners have been waiting ... and wanting ... Other than the Shield K1, there has been nothing. I do watch Huawei with interest; seems too locked down, though. We were told long ago that the bottleneck in OS upgrades for our phones were the carriers. This isn't a problems for tablets, generally, yet their track record is maybe even worse than phones. Leonardo Baez to be fair there is also less tablet offers to the market. me me I have Nexus 7 2013, Google Pixel C, and a Toshiba Chromebook 2. The Chromebook I have repaired it twice due the flexible plastic screen, the Pixel C has a tough outer shell construction and survives drops, the N7 2013 is still going strong but I use wireless charging to extend its socket life and custom kernel with 90% max charge to extend battery life. I'd happily buy newer if they were better. Innovation in mobiles is far greater, there's more of a reason to upgrade more often than with tablets. [A]dri[A]n I absolutely LOVE my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2015) It's a pretty damn good tablet for $249 or whatever they're priced at now. The battery life is amazingly great and the performance is more than good enough. Lasts about 3 to 4 days with around 15 hours of SOT. Like someone stated before, I'm pretty sure sales are down because the need/want to buy a new tablet isn't as important or relevant as buying a new phone. Mix Snagged the 8" Tab A for $199 CAD and it's a wicked little tablet and you can get 4 of them for the price of a single Galaxy S3 tablet.....Like, why would someone even consider an $800 tablet? whispy_snippet And people wonder why Google won't take tablets seriously. AQ I bought my first tablet last month, isn't as fast or high resolution as my phone but it lasts long & keeps me from charging my phone as much. it was cheap, gsm unlocked, has 2GB ram & 16GB rom+microsd & still has stereo front facing speakers. I doubt I could find another tablet twice it's price having at least those things. ethd ZTE Trek 2 HD, by chance? I replaced my old Nexus 10 with one of those and I couldn't be happier. It's shocking how good cheap tablets have gotten. AQ Yup, though I got it for only $70 it retails for $150 from AT&T, which still isn't bad for all the features it has. I love that its GSM unlocked, no WiFi only limits when I really want to use something that requires internet when away from home. Also it's great for GPS (loud, big & bright). StopBeingOffendedDERP psshhh. Who needs a tablet when you have a Surface Book. Best of both worlds. Kamal Qara’in People are increasingly looking for lightwaight, portable devices that mirror the functionality of a traditional PC. And that's unfortunately where Android tablets fail; there's little to no 'Value add'; powerful, tablet-optimised apps are almost non-existent on the platform xyz Great. I never liked tablets. Only PCs and smartphones for me. I guess people who bought tablets are satisfied with 6-7" phablets. me me No. I own 10" and 7" tablets, and I like 10" tablets when I'm spending days moving, and like 7" tablet when flying. The issues is there's nothing new worthwhile in newer tablets to bother with the effort to upgrade. A mobile however is always having a compromise of features vs performance so mobiles are being refreshed. Tablets are not being refreshed. This is about technology innovation being slower in tablets than mobiles so tablets are being refreshed less often. Larger tablets are just expensive, and Chromebooks overlap. russjr08 I have a Nexus 7 2013 and an iPad Air 2 and I absolutely love my N7 but it's definitely starting to show it's age. And I'm just not that into iOS to really use my iPad a lot. I also have a Surface Pro 3, but it's waaaaaay too big to be the "tablet" that I casually use to read on. Great for doing something like Netflix or Hulu, but otherwise... I'm just kind of relying on my phone (currently N5X) for most of my stuff. Vay L My n7 2013 touch barely work and i had this problem for over a year now. Im waiting for Lenovo tab 4 10 plus to be released this month. it looks promising on paper Nathan J Remember the Apple Newton? Apple's failed tablet under CEO John Sculley before Steve Jobs' triumphant return? It utterly failed. And now the iPad is pretty much the only successful tablet. It's weird because the PADD on Star Trek: The Next Generation was so cool. It was basically a Nexus 7 or iPad Mini in size, but thinner, I believe. And let's face it, LCARS (the OS) is pretty, but it's also pretty lame. Too many buttons, it's not a real OS, it's just for show. Even forgiving that, the huge borders on the fixed content areas are ugly. What it could do, we can do with tablets now. Access any information — Google and Wikipedia. Access all art and media — streaming services, and Google. Control certain ship functions — Google/Apple Home. We have that tech now and it's just not as cool as they make it out to be. Also, does anyone remember where they kept PADDs? They don't have pockets. They don't have holsters for them. (They do have phaser and tricorder holsters, though.) I've never seen a stack of PADDs waiting to be picked up. I've seen people set them down and pick them back up, but I've never seen a bunch of them. They just kind of come and go. I think if you have an Android phone, there's no real need for a tablet. Either you have a large phone or a huge phone, and it's partway to tablet land anyway. I can see having a small or normal sized iPhone and an iPad or iPad Mini to go with it. But I have the normal sized iPhone, and I don't want an iPad. Here's where I want Android. On a larger device. That's where I want to spend time customizing. My wife has a 2013 Nexus 7, and it's a good device. I want one in 8" with modern specs and either a microSD card slot, or 64GB of storage. Or 128GB. Or let me hook my portable SSD up to it. But I'm really not a tablet guy. Just a gadget hound... TedPhillips as someone who's recently been rewatching TnG, there are stacks of padd's (of various sizing), and the 'vertical file divider' style for collections of padd's on the show. Sootie I own a nexus 7 an ipad air 2 (or whatever the latest ones are called) an old ipad and some other big tablet plus laptops desktops but 90% of the time everything but my phone (pixel xl) is flat plus my phone works perfectly fine for everything I do with it (which admittedly is basically just reddit and youtube) and is always charged Peter Silie And I can tell you why it's like this: because there are so few tablets you can actually buy unless you want to spend a premium amount of money. There used to be way more choices, especially in the Android tablet market. Funem Android tablet specs have dropped while phone specs have increased. If I go online or to the shops its difficult to find a branded Android device that even has 32gb of memory, sometimes its even hard to find one with 16gb whilst phones have more and more crammed into them tablets just seem to have stagnated. The last tablet I purchased was the Tab Pro 12" which was a great tablet, but them Samsung didn't even upgrade the OS much and kind of just left it and this wasn't a cheap device. I'm still looking for a decent replacement with a 10" plus screen, 32gb of ram, SD card support and a decent screen resolution as I want to read my magazines on it and watch films and play some of the games that require a bigger screen real estate to work properly. The only one that came close recently was the Shield K1 Tablet, but the screen is to small. tinabolina2017 They aren't giving people what they want.the chips in then are too slow and the LTE is too expensive royrov Well, if Google just could sell their Pixel hardware here on Norway, I would have bought one a long time ago.. Richard Markert The verdict is in: nobody really wants tablets. Lord Argyris I'll just echo a lot of what has already been said here and in the article: the tablet product category as a whole has been cannibalized by other devices. Even traditional laptops have started to make inroads. Recently I narrowed down my choice for a new computer to a Surface Pro 4 or a 13-inch MBP and went with the latter. It's small and light enough that I don't miss the additional portability of the Surface or a new tablet. Part of my intention with the new purchase was to largely replace multiple devices, including my Nexus 7 (2013). The latter mostly sits in a drawer now, being taken out only when I want to go further than a few rooms over and have a computing device with me. Nearly three and a half years ago, when the Nexus 7 (2013) was new, this would have been inconceivable. Even high end laptops were prohibitively heavier, larger, and had worse battery life, not to mention they still in some cases ran hot and had noisy fans. They also typically had low resolution (>200 PPI) and poorly calibrated screens (sometimes even with a sub-sRGB gamut and a TN panel), which made media consumption a significantly worse experience than you could get on much cheaper tablet (and smartphone) hardware. Especially in the PC space, the hardware has since gotten much better (the lingering MacBook Air range being a notable exception). Over the years, the list of exclusive advantages one could get from buying a tablet has grown shorter, and new product categories (2-in-1s, large smartphones) have emerged to draw away market share. I'm actually glad tablets happened, as they seem to have been a great catalyst to make the other computing categories improve. Mike I purchased and used a Nexus 10 quite a bit when I had a Galaxy Nexus. After getting a Note 2 I just didn't see the need anymore. I tried to convert it to be a laptop replacement but all of the keyboard/mouse peripherals were pretty bad. About a year or two ago I purchased an Asus Chromebook Flip and for half the price of the Nexus 10 it does so much more (Albeit, it was released a couple years later but still, a tablet can't do what a dedicated laptop can). As someone who was one of the biggest fans of tablets when they first started becoming mainstream (Owned a Tab S2, Nexus 7, Nexus 10) I wouldn't mind if they just died off at this point. PVL_93_RU No surprise there, really The classic tablets as we know them are slowly becoming less popular because the tech advancements in them have slowed down, people aren't needed to replace their current tablets with newer models as often as phones, and the introduction of projects like RemixOS or the Android App compatibility in ChromeOS, as well as the rising spread of convertibles, is making the classic tablet pretty much an obsolete product Unless the tablet market makes a revolution of some sort (be it in functionality or hardware etc) - the decline will only continue. Hell, even Apple is struggling, despite bringing the Pro and the Mini to the table justmy2pennies2012 My Ipad Air is 3 1/2 years old. My only complaint is I purchased the LTE verison and it only has 16GB. It still does what I need it to do, comsume media, web surf, etc. I use my Laptop for my computing needs. I would love to replace it with an Android tablet. My son still has a Nexus 2012/2013 tablet but it is slow has heck. He prefers his Android phone over his old as heck android tablet. I tend to replace my phone evry 22-24 months, but tend to go 3-4 years on a tablet. The newer Ipad isn't to bad feature and price wise IMHO. I had the first Moto tablet (yes the heavy one) but returned it within 30 days back in 2010. I think once manufacturers can produce a quality tablet in a mid price range (not too expensive not too cheap where they can't support it), sales will increase. With the lower price of the newer Ipads,this makes it harder for android tablets to compete on features and price. 1966CAH The only people really surprised by this are the ones who hopped aboard the "Tablets are the Next Big Thing!!!" hypetrain. There's a market for tablets just like there's a market for smartwatches. Neither of them have or likely will fulfill the pipe dreams of their early cheerleaders. They have largely achieved their market saturation point is all, and the demand just isn't what was hyped. I had both versions of the Nexus 7 and now have the Shield K1. When I get home at night, I put down the phone and use the tablet almost exclusively. I don't have any need to upgrade until such time as mine bites the dust or it's too obsolete, but when the time comes I will be looking to replace it. Colin Rowlands If you are mostly using a tablet for consuming media and browsing, there simply isn't any real need to upgrade a tablet until your current one dies, so it is no wonder that sales are decreasing. Bernhard Mähr Waiting since two years for a good 7" table with recent Android version. Ricardo Torres Still using my Nvidia Shield Tablet original not K1 but I did get a k1 as a backup after that recall scare. Use it every day have not had a reason to get a new tablet.

More than 30,000 people are expected to attend the annual meeting, and participate in company-sponsored activities, though the main attraction is CEO Warren Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger's Q&A session on Saturday. Nati Harnik AP Photo Business May 06, 2017 6:08 PM The Latest: Berkshire shareholders reject 3 proposals The Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story OMAHA, Neb. The Latest on Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting (all times local): 4:50 p.m. Berkshire Hathaway shareholders have rejected three proposals that would have required the company to sell off stock investments linked to fossil fuels and disclose more information about its political contributions and methane emissions. Advocacy groups proposed the measures because they wanted Berkshire to change its practices. Buffett and Berkshire's board opposed all three shareholder measures Saturday. The board argued that both the proposed reports are unnecessary and selling off stocks tied to fossil fuels could hurt Berkshire's investment returns. With Buffett controlling about one-third of the vote, the measures faced an uphill battle. But the groups pushing the proposals had an opportunity to make their case before thousands of Berkshire shareholders. Climate scientist Mark Mann with Penn State University urged Buffett and Berkshire shareholders to take a stand against climate change. He said doing so could add to the company's legacy, but the proposal failed. ___ 4:20 p.m. Eighty-six-year-old Warren Buffett and 93-year-old Charlie Munger say they both try to continue learning and that shows up in the investments they've made for Berkshire Hathaway in recent years. Munger says Berkshire's purchase of 133 million shares of Apple stock shows Buffett is learning because for decades Buffett resisted investing in technology companies. Buffett says he came to realize that Apple behaves more like a consumer products company than a tech company, so he became comfortable investing in it. ___ 3:25 p.m. Billionaire Warren Buffett says growing health care costs continue to be a drag on the performance of U.S. businesses, and he's not sure the reform package Republicans passed will do much to help that. Buffett said Saturday that health care costs have gone up incredibly, and are expected to continue increasing. The high cost of U.S. health care puts American businesses at a competitive disadvantage with other countries. Buffett says the one thing he's sure the Republican reforms will do is deliver a big tax cut to people like him with more than $250,000 income and significant investment income. ___ 2:45 p.m. Investor Warren Buffett says Wells Fargo made a huge error in failing to respond promptly to its sales practices scandal. Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders Saturday that the bank should have done more to correct the problem once it was discovered. Buffett says Wells Fargo didn't act promptly when it discovered the problem. The bank said last fall that its employees opened up 2 million bank accounts without customer approval to meet unrealistic sales goals. Berkshire is Wells Fargo's biggest shareholder. Buffett says he still believes in the long-term prospects of the bank even though Wells Fargo mishandled the scandal. ___ 2:30 p.m. Warren Buffett continues looking for major acquisitions for Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett told shareholders Saturday that Berkshire could do a very large deal because it has more than $90 billion cash on hand. Buffett says he likes to keep at least $20 billion to $25 billion on hand for emergencies or any large insurance claims, but he's actively looking for a big deal. Currently, Buffett believes he can find a good use for Berkshire's cash, so the company doesn't pay dividends and rarely repurchases its stock. Buffett says the board would look at both options if it ever decided he could generate good returns by investing the money. ___ 1 p.m. Investor Warren Buffett says one of the most-important skills his eventual successor will need is a talent for allocating all the cash Berkshire Hathaway's businesses generate. Buffett said at Saturday's annual meeting that it's crucial his successor have what he calls a "money mind." Buffett has no plans to leave his job as chairman and CEO of the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate he built through acquisitions over more than 50 years. The 86-year-old told his investors that the company's plan to replace him hasn't changed. Buffett says his successor will have to be able to wisely invest Berkshire's cash without making major mistakes. Currently, Berkshire has more than $90 billion in cash on hand. ___ 11:25 a.m. Billionaire Warren Buffett says Berkshire Hathaway's insurance businesses will continue to thrive regardless of who's leading them. At Berkshire's shareholder meeting Saturday, Buffett was asked about the challenges of replacing Ajit Jain because Buffett has heaped praise on Jain for years. Buffett acknowledges some insurance deals might be impossible to replicate once Jain is gone, but says a lot of solid habits are institutionalized at Berkshire's insurance companies. Berkshire owns Geico and General Reinsurance as well as a number of specialized insurers that handle malpractice, worker's compensation and other businesses. For his own position as Berkshire's CEO and chairman, the 86-year-old Buffett says there's been no change in the plan to eventually replace him. ___ 11:10 a.m. It's hard to say exactly how much Berkshire Hathaway would benefit from a major tax cut. Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett says the effect to a tax cut would vary across the more than 90 different businesses the conglomerate owns. For instance, at the regulated utilities Berkshire owns, any benefit from a tax cut will be passed on to customers through lower rates. In other businesses, it will depend on how much competitive pressure there is to lower prices after a tax cut. Buffett made his comments during the company's annual meeting Saturday in Omaha, Nebraska. ___ 10:45 a.m. Investors Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders that they probably should have recognized Google's brilliance and invested in it. But the top two executives at Berkshire had long ruled out technology companies because they believe it's too hard to predict which ones will prevail. So they missed out on Google even though they knew the business well because Berkshire's Geico insurance unit advertised with the search engine. Munger says in retrospect, he thinks he and Buffett were smart enough to figure out Google's prospects early on, but they didn't. In recent years, Buffett has ventured a bit into tech investing but with mixed results. He said Friday that Berkshire recently sold off one-third of its 81 million IBM shares because the investment hasn't performed as well as he expected. Berkshire holds about 133 million Apple shares, but Buffett says he looks at that more as a consumer products company instead of a technology company. ___ 10 a.m. Investor Warren Buffett says he believes it works better to hold his employees to a high standard and expect them to do the right thing instead of imposing extensive rules. Buffett says he always urges Berkshire Hathaway employees to protect the company's reputation above all and avoid questionable behavior. Buffett made his comments during the company's annual meeting Saturday in Omaha, Nebraska. He believes that will help Berkshire avoid scandals like the one that hurt Wells Fargo last year. Berkshire is Wells Fargo's biggest shareholder. Berkshire is known for its decentralized structure with fewer than 30 people at headquarters that allows the more than 90 companies it owns to largely run themselves. "We count very heavily on principles of behavior rather than loads of rules," Buffett said. Buffett says Berkshire will occasionally have problems because it has 367,000 employees. ___ 9:20 a.m. Billionaire Warren Buffett paid tribute to Vanguard founder Jack Bogle at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting Saturday. Bogle attended Berkshire's meeting Saturday after Buffett praised him in his annual letter to shareholders this year. Buffett has long recommended that most casual investors would be better off investing in index funds steadily over time instead of trying to pick individual stocks. Buffett says Bogle played a major role in creating the index funds that are common today, and that has helped millions of investors earn more because the fees are so cheap. Buffett, who is 86, said Bogle will celebrate his 88th birthday Monday. Buffett joked that if Bogle holds out for just a couple more years, he'll be old enough to qualify for an executive job at Berkshire. Buffett's Vice Chairman Charlie Munger is 93. ___ 7:10 a.m. When billionaire Warren Buffett toured the exhibit hall where Berkshire Hathaway companies are selling their products outside Berkshire's annual meeting, he was again surrounded by a pack of reporters, shareholders and security officers. At Berkshire's annual meeting Saturday, Buffett is the celebrity that everyone wants to get close to. While Buffett met Mr. Peanut at the Kraft Heinz booth, Miami Dolphins defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh wandered a few feet away without a crowd. While he wandered through the hall, Buffett told reporters that he continues to believe the economy is growing steadily at about 2 percent a year. And he told a recent college graduate to try to find career that makes use of her skills and appeals to her passions. Shareholder Elizabeth Varner said it was fun just listening to Buffett while walking near him in the crowd and trying to shoot pictures of the down-to-Earth billionaire. ___ 6:30 a.m. Listening to Warren Buffett never gets old to the thousands of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders filling an arena to listen to the billionaire investor at the company's annual meeting. The chance to hear Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger field questions for more than five hours is again expected to attract more than 30,000 people to Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday. Seventy-year-old Dave Mueller flew out from Denver, Colorado, for his fourth meeting because he loves hearing the 86-year-old Buffett and 93-year-old Munger talk. Dozens of companies Berkshire owns set up booths in an adjoining 200,000-square-foot exhibit hall to sell their products and take questions about their businesses.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Spreading the word on safety Saturday May 6, 2017 at 8:07 PM May 6, 2017 at 8:07 PM Monica Solano Staff Writer @DP_MonicaInes APPLE VALLEY — Disaster can strike at any given moment and many Apple Valley residents were preparing for the worst on Saturday. Despite high winds, hundreds of people came out to learn how to be prepared for a natural disaster at the first Family Preparedness Fair hosted by the Town of Apple Valley. “The goal for this event was to keep our community safe while also putting into perspective that an emergency can occur at any given moment,” said Emergencies Service Officer Joseph Ramos. “We have so much great information here and we want to assure our residents are getting the best to be prepared.” The Town of Apple Valley, Apple Valley Fire Protection District and the Apple Valley Police Activities League (PAL) came together to bring awareness to the community and to better prepare  neighborhoods their residents on fire, flood, earthquake and other safety measures. With 38 groups and organizations participating in the event, guests were not only educated on safety practices, but they were also given the opportunity to experience a little shake, rattle and roll thanks to the earthquake and fire seismic simulator provided by San Bernardino County Fire Office of Emergency Services. Nicole Nunez and her son Chase Danger Nunez, 5, of Apple Valley, told the Daily Press the simulator provided them with quite a jolt. “It definitely put things into perspective once you were in there and felt the tremors start to get bigger and bigger,” Nicole Nunez said. Attendees also received information on fire prevention, water safety, car seat installation, utility safety, children’s fingerprinting and other vital and useful safety information. “It’s important that people know how to prepare for the worst and this is a great event to get the word out there and help others,” said AFVPD Fire Chief Sid Hultquist. Marylu Maya and her daughter Sheily Torres, 13, of Apple Valley said they come to the event every year and always “leave learning something new” about safety preparedness and appreciates the time and effort everyone makes to help educate them. “We also want to relate the message to our residents that they can come up to any of their local officials with questions on safety at any given time,” Ramos said. “We’re here to ensure you are safe and well prepared.” Monica Solano can be reached at MSolano @VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6231.

Skip to main content asia one Singapore Malaysia China Asia World Singapore Malaysia China Asia World Business Showbiz Health Food Why Apple loves Yeay, the teenage app that is the Snapchat of shopping The Yeay App PHOTO: CNBC Lucy Handley CNBC May 07, 2017 How does Apple find out about the future? Ask a teenager, of course. Snapchat-style teen shopping app Yeay only came out of beta development three months ago, but Apple execs have already been to its Berlin office to understand more about its audience of ten to 20 year-olds. Yeay is a "social shopping" app, which lets users make and upload videos to sell products, largely fashion and lifestyle goods, and has been described as "QVC + Tumblr + Snapchat" by tech blog Product Hunt. "Our app is a utility app, it helps everyone create good product videos. At the same time, it's a platform where these product videos can immediately transform into transaction videos and people can immediately purchase on our platform," Yeay founder Melanie Mohr told CNBC. "You could say it's a marketplace, but at the same place an entertainment platform combined with many social factors, and I think this is what, especially when you are looking into this generation, this is what they want, they want to be social, they want to share products," Mohr added. The core group of buyers and sellers on the app is aged 12 to 18, and they are an entrepreneurial bunch. "They want to create products, and they want to make money," said Mohr. Yeay doesn't take commission from individuals who sell via the app, but plans to charge larger brands an undisclosed percentage, from 2018. Apple's future consumers Apple got interested in the app because of the insights it can give into the next generation of shoppers, Mohr said. "We had delegations from Apple in our office… There are many ways our product is quite interesting to them, but I think that they are also looking into trends and they saw this is the kind of trend-capturing platform, and this Gen Z focus is something they are highly focused [on]." Yeay also has versions for Apple's iMessage app, and is working on an Apple TV version. Users can set up a wish list within the Yeay app and share it with friends who can see it via the app store within iMessage. Big agencies and brands are also interested because of the insights Yeay can give them, as well as how to create videos and other content teens want to like and share. "They want to have access to our user-generated content and to this tool within the app to create [it]… such as product video challenges and campaigns." The most searched-for brand on Yeay is Yeezy, Kanye West's fashion line, followed by Supreme, the hip New York street wear label, but people also sell goods they've made or sourced themselves. So far nearly $2 million-worth of transactions have been made in three months, the app has 100,000 registered users from 160 countries and is available in 18 languages. The US, UK and the rest of Europe are its hotspots, and it is working with Veon (formerly VimpelCom), the Russian telco that has more than 200 million customers, on an integration for its WeChat-like messaging application that will have a "zero data policy," (so users won't incur data charges) Mohr said. Shopping stars It's easy to compare Yeay to Ebay as a marketplace and Snapchat as a social network, especially as it added filters and stickers last month, but Mohr prefers to liken it to Musical.ly, the app where teens lip-synch along to their favourite hits, gaining millions of followers along the way, because "people love to have this feeling that they could be the next music star, or behave like their favourite star." With Yeay, they can become a star of selling. The teens selling on the app differ from their older Millennial counterparts because they are natural and unselfconscious, says Mohr. "They know how to create good content and they know how to message it right to their crowd on other social platforms."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 7 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple announces environmental progress in China Lens Technology has committed to power all of its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by the end of 2018, as part of Apple’s industry-leading supply chain clean energy program announced last year. Lens is the first supplier to make a clean energy commitment for all of its Apple production, and will meet its goal through an unprecedented power purchase agreement with local wind projects. Apple is working with suppliers to help transform the environmental landscape in China, and is proud to announce all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The UL standard certifies all of their manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or, when necessary, converted into energy. Since the program began in January 2015, the sites have diverted more than 140,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. “We want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we’re working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. “We congratulate Lens for their bold step, and hope by sharing the lessons we’ve learned in our transition to renewable energy, our suppliers will continue to access clean power projects, moving China closer to its green manufacturing goals.” “Our power purchase agreement is the first of its kind in southern China and we hope it will serve as an example for other companies looking to transition to cleaner, more economical sources of power,” said Lens CEO Zhou Qunfei. “We’re pleased to be the first supplier to commit to covering all of our Apple production with renewable energy, and proud to source from local Hunan wind farms to power our facilities in Changsha.” Lens’ manufacturing with Apple currently includes two facilities in Changsha, Hunan province. Wind energy will cover 100 percent of the energy consumed producing Apple products at Lens facilities by 2018, avoiding nearly 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, equivalent to the energy use in 380,000 Chinese homes.

Can Consumer Wi-Fi Be a New Growth Driver? Formerly enterprise and online-only, Ubiquiti is bringing its newest product to a brick-and-mortar retailer near you. Billy Duberstein (Dubs82) May 6, 2017 at 6:36PM One of the hardest things to value in a company are future products and markets. For instance, who could have predicted Amazon would become a leader in IT infrastructure back in 2000? Or that Apple would be a phone-maker, back in the 90s? However, it is precisely these types of less predictable innovations that can lead to Amazon and Apple-like returns. Lesser-known Ubiquiti Networks (NASDAQ:UBNT) recently rolled out a new business segment, and it's coming to a retail store near you. If you haven't heard of the company, that is because it is mostly known for its high-performance radios that form the backbone of WISP networks (wireless internet service providers). In more rural parts of the U.S. and emerging markets, service providers are selling broadband wirelessly via Ubiquiti's radios. In 2011, Ubiquiti ventured inside small businesses and schools with its Unifi product -- its line of enterprise-grade access points, switches, and routers. That segment has been a huge success, posting 87% year over year gains last quarter, and it is now almost as big as the service provider segment. Next up: Amplifi In 2016, Ubiquiti entered the consumer home Wi-Fi market with its next new product line called Amplifi. Amplifi's mesh-Wi-Fi system is geared to give your home enterprise-grade Wi-Fi speeds and fill pesky dead spots, all at consumer prices. This type of home solution had previously been the realm of low-cost consumer routers made by Netgear or Google, but these days, greater capability is need to handle the increased data requirements for connected home devices and video streaming. Therefore, Ubiquiti thought consumers might now have use for its high-powered technology. With the consumer in mind, the company constructed the router to look cool, with a blue-light touchscreen, and also made the system very easy to set up. Owners can set up a network in minutes, easily add or drop devices to their networks, and check network speeds all from the easy-to-use app. source: Amplifi.com Last week, Ubiquiti announced that Amplifi would now be available at Sam's Club, Best Buy, and Gamestop. Despite being unveiled a year ago , Amplifi was only previously available via Amazon or the Amplifi online Store. The reason for the hold-up lies in Ubiquiti's ultra-lean business model. The company does little to no sales or marketing efforts, instead utilizing its online community where tech-savvy enterprise customers can commiserate the lack of availability of its devices, then only ramping up volumes when demand is assured. The average consumer is much less savvy. So, instead of rolling the product out nationwide and risking an inventory buildup, the company sold product first through its own store, then the largest online destination, Amazon, in conjunction with an initial PR rollout. Now, the company is ready to get the product in front of people in a physical store. In many ways, this will be the ultimate test as to whether consumers will snatch up these advanced offerings. Sam's Club is part of Wal-Mart, still the largest retailer in the U.S. by a wide margin. Despite years of revenue declines, Best Buy is still the leading electronics retailer in North America, and could be boosted further by bankruptcies among rivals. It also has the all-important Geek Squad, which can educate laymen about mesh networks. The most interesting placement is in Gamestop. Gamers require very high speeds, so Ubiquiti is making a statement that these high-end applications require its high-end technology. Will Amplifi move the needle? Right now, Amplifi is lumped in with Ubiquiti's Unifi segment when the company reports revenues, due to the segment being new. If the new retail push can gain traction, it could become material, especially if the glowing reviews like this from App Advice are any indication of consumer sentiment.  A system consisting of the main router and two mesh points ranges anywhere from the standard $199 system to the $349 HD system. Users can also buy the router or mesh points separately. Assuming the company can sell 100,000 systems per year, that would equate to around $30 million, which would be about 4% of current revenues. However, it is likely Ubiquiti will expand internationally if the product sells well in the years to come, and establishing the brand may also allow the company to follow with more products for the Internet of Things and increasingly, the connected home. As Amazon and Apple taught us with cloud computing and the iPhone, entirely new products can sometimes be even more material than older core businesses. Investors should keep an eye on how Amplifi catches on this year. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Published: Monday, May 8, 2017, 10:17 [IST] Subscribe to Oneindia News Houston, May 8: On the second day of his United States visit, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu met top executives of some of the world's largest technology companies and sought investments from them in his state. The much-anticipated Apple's foray into Andhra Pradesh got a fillip on Saturday following Naidu's meeting with the company's Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams. Naiu told Williams: "This is the right time for Apple Inc to invest in India as it has been growing consistently". "Being a state that has just begun building itself from the scratch post-bifurcation, AP offered tremendous opportunities. Apple would do well to enter AP which has been adjudged the best state to do business with and has a productive young population," the chief minister said. AP Govt has signed MoUs with Innova Solutions, I-Bridge Inc and EVX Solutions, which is expected to provide jobs for over 12,000 people.⁠⁠⁠⁠ Photo credit: @ncbn/Twitter. Naidu will also receive the 'Transformative Chief Minister Award' during the United States-India Business Council West Coast Summit in Silicon Valley. The USIBC has selected Naidu for the award for his efforts to strengthen ties between the countries at the state level. The summit will see the participation of 150 industry leaders from sectors such as information technology, banking, food processing, healthcare, clean energy and digital payment. Texas-based Dell has expressed interest in setting up a data centre in the state capital. The technology giant expressed keen interest when Naidu met Srikanth Satya, a top executive of Dell in Dallas. Naidu visited the University of Silicon Andhra after the NRI CEO's meet. Various MoU's were signed with Innova Solutions, I-Bridge Inc and EVX Solutions, which is expected to create over 12,000 jobs. Andhra govt aims to have a computer expert, entrepreneur and artist in every house. Naidu also held a meeting with California Governor Jerry Brown and invited the US state to join hands with AP as 'we build a greenfield capital with global opportunities'. Among others who met Naidu were Gopi Sirineni, VP, Qualcomm, NIO USA CEO Padmasree Warrior, Mike McNamara, CEO of Flextronics. The leaders expressed their interest in AP's Fiber Grid project, and expansion of their respective companies in the state. Naidu appreciated the innovative efforts taken toward mobility and learnt about various features of the driver-less car at Waymo during Google X visit. On Saturday, Naidu paid humble floral tributes to Mahatma Gandhi's statue at the largest Gandhi Memorial in Irving, near Dallas. Naidu appreciated Prasad Thotakura, the person behind the initiative, and his dedicated management team for their relentless efforts in building huge memorial in 5 months with one million dollar budget and collaboration with Irving city officials. Naidu was later in the evening greeted at the community wide reception by thousands of Indian origin Telugu community members at Irving, Conventions Center. Indian Consul-General in Houston, Anupam Ray, welcomed Naidu at the reception and gave a quick overview of the Telugu community, praising them for their contribution in creating jobs and prosperity. Naidu lauded the Indian Americans and people of Telugu origin for their enormous contributions and said that he was looking forward to make Andhra Pradesh a model state for the rest of the world by garnering strong business alliances in the USA. Naidu is accompanied by his 16-member team comprising Finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu, Government Advisor (Communications) Parakala Prabhakar and senior officials, will visit Washington DC, San Francisco, California, New York, Chicago and other states.

Samsung, once again, was kept out of the top five. By Jonathan Chadwick | May 8, 2017 -- 03:13 GMT (20:13 PDT) | Topic: Mobility Shipment volumes and market shares for the Chinese market. (Image: IDC) Chinese smartphone maker Huawei has overtaken Oppo as the number one smartphone seller in China for Q1 2017, research firm IDC has revealed. Of the total 103.1 million smartphones shipped to China during the first quarter, Huawei's shipment volume reached 20.8 million units, a year-over-year increase of 25.5 percent, according to IDC's Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker. Oppo's shipment volume, which reached 18.9 million units for Q1 2017, showed a year-over-year increase of 19.5 percent. Latest news on Asia Huawei overtakes Oppo as China's top smartphone seller: IDC Singapore retailers roll out integrated POS terminals StarHub loses 28,000 customers across mobile, pay TV Cook remains optimistic on China despite Q2 revenue decline Singapore looks for answers to key challenges in AI, data science While Oppo led China's market share in Q4 2016 with 18.1 percent over Huawei's 16.8 percent, Huawei surged ahead in Q1 2017 with a 20 percent share, compared with Oppo's 18.2 percent. Vivo placed third in Chinese market share for the first quarter, with a 14.1 percent market share. Apple came fourth, with 9.2 percent market share, closely followed by Xiaomi, at 9 percent. Huawei was helped by the launch of its P10 and P10 Plus smartphones, as well as its Honor V9 and "strong momentum for the Honor brand", according to IDC. Huawei's Honor 8 and Oppo's R9s were also helped by the strength of their photo capabilities, battery capacity, and celebrity endorsements, IDC said. While the first quarter was relatively soft in terms of product launches, IDC expects second quarter sales to be driven by the launch of handsets such as Vivo's Y53, Xiaomi's Mi6, and Meizu's E2. Apple's sales amounted to a year-over-year decline of 26.7 percent, according to IDC. However, while Apple has seen double-digit year-over-year declines in China for the fifth quarter in a row, the upcoming 10th-anniversary iPhone should help the Cupertino-based giant experience a rebound in the Chinese market, according to IDC senior market analyst Tay Xiaohan. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he remains enthusiastic about business opportunity in the country, despite Apple's Greater China sales continuing to slip. In the company's quarterly revenue of $52.9 billion, up from $50.6 billion for the same period a year earlier, China was its only key market that registered revenue decline during the period. In the company's earning call, Cook blamed unfavourable exchange rates and falling sales in the Hong Kong market, which attracted fewer Chinese visitors to purchase Apple products during the period. Despite this, Cook said he expects sales performance in China to improve in the current quarter. In terms of global shipments, Samsung regained the title of "world's largest smartphone vendor" in Q1 2017 with 79.2 million units shipped, according to IDC. Worldwide smartphone shipments grew by 4.3 percent in Q1 2017, the firm added. Correction 1:35pm AEST May 8, 2017: Apple's sales, rather than market share, amounted to a year-over-year decline of 26.7 percent.

By: Shilpa Published: Monday, May 8, 2017, 8:57 [IST] Over the past few years, we have seen so many changes implemented in the smartphone's design. Especially integrating dual camera setup, OLED display, fingerprint scanners, and much more. Removal of a headphone jack is another trend followed by smartphone manufacturers recently. Apple and Motorola have ditched headphone jack in their iPhone 7 and Moto Z phones respectively. Now even HTC is rumored to come up with HTC U 11 with no audio port in it. This is not the end. The recently released much-hyped phone, Xiaomi Mi 6 have also maintained the same trend. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! What made others ditch audio port Almost every smartphone company who ditched this technology on their phones have the same reason to say. According to Apple, 3.5mm headphone jack is an old technology which withstands the company from making some innovation to their upcoming phones, so they had to ditch this. Also Read: Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime to be launched soon in India What Xiaomi says about this Xiaomi also says the same. Since this port was acting as a hindrance to integrate large battery on their flagship phone, Mi 6, they decided to remove it permanently. The Xiaomi Mi 6 comes with a battery of 3350mAh capacity whereas, its predecessor MI 5 has just 3000mAh battery. Regarding this Xiaomi says, "Smartphones are highly-integrated products and internal space is precious. By removing the headphone jack, we can save room for other components such as a bigger battery. Audio through USB Type-C is becoming more common, and will continue to provide excellent sound quality." Also Read: Xiaomi MIUI 9 to bring split screen and picture-in-picture features Makes the device water resistant Other than giving some extra space for battery, the removal of audio jack also helps in making the device water resistant. Though this being the another biggest feature of currently running smartphones in the market, Xiaomi did not speak about it at the launch event. It just told that the device can survive splashes. Other reasons Ditching this audio port even helps in improvising camera technology. That is, both Apple and Xiaomi were able to integrate dual camera setup on their flagship devices. Also Read: Xiaomi is opening its first Mi Home Store in India Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! If you are not happy with this move by the company, then you don't have to worry because Xiaomi came up with other alternatives as well. It will include a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter with the box to provide better sound quality.

ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES Over $2.6 trillion is held as untaxed cash in offshore accounts by top US companies like Apple, Google, IBM, Pfizer Pepsi and Coke, McDonald's etc according to a report by the Washington-based Institute for Tax and Economic Policy (ITEP). This is the highest-ever hoard held offshore by American companies and represents a net tax loss of a staggering $767 billion for the US government. The $2.6 trillion untaxed funds are more than the combined GDP of 153 countries. Meanwhile, the Hudco IPO that opens today will see the government sell 10.19% stake in the firm and raise up to Rs1,200 crore at a price band of Rs 56-60 per share. Here's a look at seven macro-economic triggers that are likely to impact the market today Companies to face MAT on dividend payout, debt recast: Minimum alternate tax, or MAT, a levy on book profit of companies that avail of exemptions and concessions, is now back to haunt companies – both Indian and multinationals operating in the country. Companies that had announced a dividend or restructured debt in the previous financial year will face this liability in the current financial year. This is because, under IndAS, the new Indian accounting standard, both dividend and debt restructuring could increase the book profit of companies and would attract MAT. Of the BSE 500 companies, 422 had announced dividend last year. Path cleared for big private role in defence production: The defence ministry seems to have unlocked the strategic partnership (SP) logjam with a firm push from the Prime Minister's Office and sustained focus by defence minister Arun Jaitley, setting up the private sector to play a major role in the production of weapons systems for the armed forces. A tussle within the bureaucracy over what rules the SP model would follow had resulted in a stalemate within the ministry since February 2016, frustrating leading private sector companies that were expecting to get mega production orders for aircraft, submarines and land systems. Macron wins French presidency by emphatic margin : Emmanuel Macron was elected president of France on Sunday with a business-friendly vision of European integration, defeating Marine Le Pen, a far-right nationalist who threatened to take France out of the European Union, early projections showed. The centrist's emphatic victory, which also smashed the dominance of France's mainstream parties, will bring huge relief to European allies who had feared another populist upheaval to follow Britain's vote to quit the EU and Donald Trump's election as U.S. president. Life insurance portability on anvil? Insurance regulator IRDA is may allow life insurance policy holders to switch from one insurer to another without surrendering their existing policies and thus losing a portion of the premium paid. Discussions to allow portability in life insurance are in early stages and it is likely to happen after the industry moves to a completely digital form of transacting and managing insurance product. Green car plan prioritises electric vehicles over hybrids: The Niti Aayog has recommended lowering taxes and interest rates for loans on electric vehicles, while capping sales of conventional cars, signalling a dramatic shift in policy in one of the world's fastest growing auto markets. A draft of the 90-page blueprint, also suggests the government opens a battery plant by the end of 2018 and uses tax revenues from the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles to set up charging stations for electric vehicles. The recommendations are aimed at electrifying all vehicles in the country by 2032 and will likely shape a new mobility policy. Government plans lower income tax slab for single women: Acknowledging that women are a disadvantaged section despite comprising nearly half of the population of the country, the Centre is considering lowering income tax for single women, introducing Aadhaar-linked health cards for free basic health check-ups for women and cashless medical service for those who are pregnant. A national policy for women is expected to be unveiled soon. It proposes a lower rate of income tax for single women as it takes note of a growing segment of the population; there has been a 39% increase in this category between 2001 and 2011. FDI momentum may slow this year: India's FDI inflow momentum may slow down this year and exports too may not revive with "full gusto" as domestic bottlenecks remain, says a report. Although higher world growth is likely to buoy exports, a strengthening rupee and worsening domestic bottlenecks could limit the increase, it said. "Stronger exports and higher FDI inflows have likely contributed to the strong performance of the INR is recent times. While both are likely to remain buoyant, we believe it is important to note that incremental gains over the short term may not be limitless," HSBC said in a research note. ... and in financial markets last Friday Rupee down: The rupee closed at 64.37 a dollar—a level last seen on 24 April, down 0.31%, its steepest fall since 10 April, from its Thursday’s close of 64.17. Bonds rebound: Government bonds (G-Secs) rebounded on good buying support from banks and corporates. The 6.97% G-Secs maturing in 2026 rose to Rs 100.1825 from Rs 99.99 previously, while its yield edged down to 6.94% from 6.97%. The 6.79% G-Secs maturing in 2029 climbed to Rs 97.39 from Rs 97.1350, while its yield softened to 7.11% from 7.14%. The 7.59% G-Secs maturing in 2026 gained to Rs 103.6325 from Rs 103.40, while its yield moved down to 7.02% from 7.06%. The 7.72% G-Secs maturing in 2025, the 7.68% G-Secs maturing in 2023 and the 7.61% G-Secs maturing 2030 were also quoted higher at Rs 103.1150, Rs 103.1175 and Rs 102.84 respectively.

Sections Deseret NewsSports Sports Kim Cowart: Why running Is the best gift my kids have given me By Kim Cowart Published: May 7, 2017 8:10 p.m. Updated: 4 hours ago + Leave a comment View 2 Items , I love a good origin story. How superheroes became super is more interesting to me than what they do with those powers. How Steve Jobs started Apple is more fascinating than what the new iPhone can do. Understanding how Dunkin' Donuts became the successful franchise it is is more tantalizing than the donuts themselves. Maybe I’ve gone too far. It’s not just curiosity that drives me. Understanding the motives behind our actions can help guide us in our decisions. “Why do I run?” is a question I ask myself every morning, especially Saturdays at 4:30 when the wind is howling, the temperature is freezing and even the birds are still sleeping. I didn’t start running to lose weight, despite the fact I had given birth two months before my first official run. I didn’t start running to feel a part of a community. I didn’t know anyone that ran, at least in my neighborhood. I certainly wasn’t looking for a hobby. I had a baby and a toddler. My time was rarely my own. I ran because I wanted to be alone. I would never have admitted it at the time, but I was craving a few solitary moments where I wasn’t anything to anybody. I’d always wanted to be a mom. It wasn’t easy becoming one, so I was overjoyed to have the two healthy daughters we have. It felt almost treasonous to not savor every moment, not to enjoy the precious time I knew would be over in a flash. I’d waited for so long to have these little people and now I wanted to literally run away? But I couldn’t deny how at peace I felt after even the shortest of runs outside, just me, the sunshine and my thoughts. Running kept me sane on the craziest of days. I couldn’t give it up. For a few years my running was confined to Saturday mornings or pre-dawn before the kids woke up and while my husband was still home. I worked my running schedule around the family. It cost me some sleep, but the return on my investment was invaluable. I’d thought my days of waking up before 5 a.m. were gone when I quit teaching high school. Now, here I was waking up even earlier with no time card to punch, lessons to plan or faculty meetings to attend. Who was this person I’d become? “Why do I run?” Running quieted the chaos in my head. The physical exertion somehow sharpened my focus. Both my quads and my patience grew. Running five early-morning miles made the third reading of Green Eggs and Ham something to look forward to. Spilled sack of flour all over the kitchen? No problem. I ran today. Crayon petroglyph on the bathroom wall? Not only can I clean it up, but I can outlast the tantrum my toddler’s throwing while in timeout. Running didn’t make me Supermom, but it definitely made me a better mom. Now my daughters are in the tween and teen years. The problems are bigger than diaper blowouts and permanent marker body tattoos. All the more reason to keep running. Taking care of others is hard work. Whether you’re a parent taking care of a child or a child taking care of a parent, a friend helping a friend, or everyone’s go-to person when times get rough, we all can serve others better when we serve ourselves first. It’s not selfish. We can do it in a way that doesn’t interfere or take away from our responsibilities, but we need to do it. Our loved ones deserve our best selves, our whole selves. A good friend found a shirt that said, “Running Saves Lives Yours and Mine.” That’s pretty much it. These days when I run, I find myself running alone less because I want to and more because I have to. Not surprisingly, as my girls become more independent, my need for solitude dims. I still wake up before they do to log in some morning miles, but if they wanted to join me, I wouldn’t say no. Comment on this story For Mother’s Day all I asked was that my kids run a 5K with me during our summer vacation. I probably could have asked for an iPad and they would have agreed faster, but in the end I won. Ten years after that first solo run I will lace up my shoes with my two daughters and run with them. Without knowing it, they gave me the gift of running and it’s been the best gift of all. Kim Cowart is a wife, mother, 24-Hour Fitness instructor, marathoner, and Feetures! Ambassador.

Apple originally announced on April 24 that commission rates for apps and in-app purchases would drop from 7 percent to 2.5 percent. That means that partners will only get 2.5 percent of each purchase generated through an iTunes or App Store link they promote on their mediums. Well, affiliates have been checking their account dashboards this past week and have found that iOS and Mac apps were still generating at the old 7 percent rate. Indeed, Mac Gamer HQ decided to contact Apple for clarification and received a response back. Apparently, “the correct new app commission levels” only drop the in-app commission rate for both Mac and iOS apps down to 2.5 percent. App commissions stay at 7 percent. Apple noted this change on Friday with a post on its Affiliate Program page as a clarification of its pre-change announcement. Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

If you’re looking at how many phones within the first quarter had each of their names on them, well, it’s a tighter race than you might expect. A Strategy Analytics report, relayed by The Korea Herald, shows that Apple pushed out 12.6 million iPhones, good for 34.5 percent market share — a 2.3-point gain. Samsung lose 3 points, down to 24.6 percent, and has 9 million shipments in the can. Keep in mind that these numbers are limited to US activity. Number three LG? Up 3 points to 20 percent and 7.3 million units shipped. It’s a milestone and record wrapped in one as the K and X series took a lot of credit for keeping sales up. Thing is, the heavy-duty V20 also got a lot of love, too. “The V20 model in the US market enjoyed an unsolicited gain from the Galaxy Note 7 recall as American consumers became more sensitive about the safety of their handsets,” said an LG spokesperson. The LG G6 will count towards second quarter numbers. Rising Chinese star ZTE came in fourth place with 6.7 percent share — the raw number was not disclosed, but Pocketnow estimates this to be about 2.4 million. The US market overall lost 4 percent in shipments annually to an estimated 36.5 million units.   Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

Normally this space is reserved for missives to you, but I am positive you do not care about the BlackBerry KeyOne, a new phone from BlackBerry Mobile. Besides Kim Kardashian, very few people have cared about BlackBerry phones in recent years. That's why today I'm going to take a moment to reach out to Kim. The girl's been a wreck since her ancient Bold 9900 died last year, and I really think she needs to know there's a new, actually kind of excellent, BlackBerry device. Dear Kim, light of my existence, harborer of my heart, and port in the storm of life: I know how upset you were last year when your ancient Bold 9900 finally died. Our mutual friend Chrissy Teigen sent you condolence flowers. You were one of, like, twelve people still loyal to BlackBerry. Which the company acknowledged by sending you a BlackBerry Priv. But the BlackBerry Priv is a garbage phone. We wouldn't wish it on our worst enemy. (Besides, you have other ways of publicly humiliating your nemeses.) But rejoice, dearest Kim, because the new BlackBerry KeyOne is not a garbage phone. In fact, for the very small number of people like you, it's a solid device. I know girl. I was shocked as hell too. The last few months have been rough for you, what with the robbery and Kanye being Kanye — not to mention Kendall's unfortunate involvement with that bad Pepsi ad and the Fyre Festival. (Honestly, the last six months have been rough for all of us.) But in spite of everything that may be going on in the world — or in your world — this phone is good news! Even if it's kind of a weird BlackBerry. It's not produced by BlackBerry (formerly known as RIM), but by BlackBerry Mobile, a new brand licensed to Chinese TV maker TCL. The KeyOne is the Blackberry brand's latest attempt to stay relevant in a world of Apple iPhones and Samsung Galaxies. It runs on Android (Android 7.1 Nougat, to be exact), which means that unlike your old Bold, you can use the Kimoji keyboard app and play your game. But it's still a BlackBerry, so there's a keyboard, and unlike the Priv, which had a mushy slide-out keyboard, the KeyOne's keyboard is built into the device, solid as hell, and kind of perfect if a person is like you, Kim, and misses having a nice physical keyboard. The keyboard on the KeyOne even has a few tricks. There's a fingerprint sensor built right into the space bar. That's totally better than the trend of putting it on the back of the phone, and the sensor allows you to approve Google Play purchases with a touch, so North won't be able to make those accidental in-app purchases that Kanye hates so much. The best part of the keyboard might be that you can assign shortcuts to each individual key. I set the "I" key to launch Instagram. This was great, except for when I was in the text app. The keys do not launch apps or function as speed dial buttons when in text apps. But the keyboard does function as a trackpad in a pinch. This made it much easier for me to scroll through photos from the Met Gala. But girl, there is a trade-off when your BlackBerry has a great keyboard. It means the screen is small compared to the screen on everyone else's fancy flagship phone. Scrolling on the keyboard is just easier than scrolling using the display. If you've been jealous of the Samsung Galaxy S8's 15cm display or even the Apple iPhone 7's 13cm display, then the KeyOne's 13cm screen is a bummer. But thanks to the phone's design the display also has a very square 3:2 aspect ratio. That's awful for watching movies, but practically perfect for making sure a photo will be fire on Instagram. And that's very easy because BlackBerry gets you girl, and while it couldn't afford to put a professional photographer into every single phone, it did put a 12 megapixel camera on the back. The camera, which uses the same sensor as the Google Pixel, takes great photos, which rival shots taken on a Samsung or Apple phone. The front camera is a lower-resolution 8 megapixel affair. But don't worry Kim my darling, it can still handle your daily selfies. Almost as well as it handles these creep shots of coworkers. Yet let's be real about something Kim, the KeyOne is not gonna win any fashion awards. The phone is thicker and heavier than an iPhone 7 or Galaxy S8. It feels solid and durable in a way those phones do not, but don't throw this at Khloe's head. That would be considered assault with a deadly weapon. Besides the battery life is too nice for you to just be using the phone as a BlackBerry-shaped bludgeoning device. I easily got through two full days of regular use without reaching for the USB-C charger, and because it uses Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0, the phone juices up super fast. It's noticeably thicker than even an iPhone 7 Plus. If BlackBerry Mobile starts hounding you about this phone, Kim, its PR reps will probably talk up the included BlackBerry Hub and the DTEK security apps. Even though you of all people could probably benefit from a more secure phone, I don't think you'll care that much about these features. The BlackBerry Hub is just a giant inbox for all of your messaging accounts (Instagram, Facebook, Gmail, Twitter), and although that sounds nice in theory, it can be overwhelming if you get a lot of notifications. My advice is to not even bother with that stuff and just enjoy the Android experience. Most people are still going to make fun of you for rocking a brand that hasn't been relevant since George Bush was in office. That's ok, Kim! BlackBerry has been so lame the last few years that I get it if you're a little reticent to carry around its latest hefty brick. But this phone, with its capacitive physical keyboard was designed for you (and BlackBerry's other primary demographic, ageing lawyers who still use WordPerfect). The $US550 ($741) BlackBerry KeyOne is an attempt at making a phone the rest of us would want to use, and it's so solidly built, with a great camera, and excellent battery life, that I'm almost wooed myself. This is the closest to a winner that BlackBerry's built in years. Love, Christina README It's thicker and heavier than other flagship phones like the Samsung Galaxy S8 or iPhone 7, but it also feels sturdier. The keyboard is actually great. The display is small and the 3:2 ratio isn't friendly for video, but it's perfect for photos on Instagram or Snapchat. Lol a BlackBerry that's not terrible. Comments darren @darren May 8, 2017, 11:23am Why is a physical keyboard still a thing? No way to swipe on that. Reply 0 Mick Sejnoha Guest May 8, 2017, 12:14pm Um, actually you *can* swipe on the keyboard on the KeyOne. You can also swipe on the keyboard on the Priv. Reply 0 darren @darren May 8, 2017, 12:43pm Never thought that could work well on a physical keyboard. Reply -1 Mick Sejnoha Guest May 8, 2017, 12:11pm Maybe if Christina still used WordPerfect, she wouldn't have misspelled something as simple as 'aging'. Reply -2 Campbell Simpson @campbellsimpson MOD May 8, 2017, 12:31pm Both spellings are acceptable. British English tends to spell it ageing, AU/US English tends to spell it aging. Reply 1 Lorenzo Zoil Guest May 8, 2017, 12:53pm Sorry Campbell, but I think you jumped in rather quickly there. AGEING, with the E, is currently used by the ABC, SMH [print media] and EVERY government department. I didn't even realise there was a US/AU English relationship. Reply -1 Campbell Simpson @campbellsimpson MOD May 8, 2017, 1:30pm Aaaaaaaaand on Gizmodo I don't care whether it's spelled ageing or aging. Language is a constantly evolving thing and anyone that tries to police it is fighting a losing battle.

I miss them actually. being able to type without looking. I will sit patiently until they announce (hopefully) a Galaxy Note 8 in which case having an S pen trumps a physical keyboard for my usage. and hopefully someone will make one of those keyboard cases for it ive seen for other models.

Adobe software has always been expensive, but at least it was one upfront cost. As it turns out, we were right. Another annual price increase for Creative Cloud is happening a month from now, and it represents the latest jump in a nearly 250 per cent price rise for some Creative Cloud plans since it started. Wonder Woman Deserves Better Rae Johnston 07 May 2017 12:00 AM At the age of 75, the Amazonian Warrior Demi-Goddess and founding member of the Justice League is hitting the big screen for the very first time - in less than a month. Wonder Woman is finally getting a movie, and the trailers we have seen look fantastic. So, like any upcoming superhero movie, here we are expecting to be swamped with teasers, behind the scenes footage, interviews, merchandise, advertising, magazine covers, talk show appearances - except that's not what is happening at all.

How about swapping it for a banana? A campaign for a Bluetooth-enabled Banana Phone is currently underway on crowdfunding website Indiegogo. The fruit-shaped phone, which can be pre-ordered for US$40 (NZ$57.81), won't allow you to forgo your current phone. Instead, it will connect to your smartphone and send your calls to the Banana Phone. According to the Indiegogo campaign, the phone will likely be available in September 2017. It's likely to appeal to nostalgic Millennials, with the concept first popularised by children's singer Raffi in 1994, in the song 'Bananaphone'. The phone's creators say 1 percent of all sales will go to Gearing Up 4 Gorillas, a UK charity which helps gorillas in Virunga National Park, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The phone's makers have so far raised more than half of their US$30,000 goal. Newshub.

Read More VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh government has signed agreements with three firms which are expected to create over 12,000 jobs in the state in the next few years. Memoranda of understanding were signed with EVX Solutions Ltd, Innova Solutions and I-Bridge INC. The MoUs were entered into on the second day of chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu-led a high-level delegation's visit on Saturday (IST) in San Francisco. While EVX Solutions Ltd is expected to create 10,000 jobs, Innova Solutions is planning to offer jobs to 2,000 people. The delegation later met chief operating officer (COO) of Apple Jeff Williams and invited the firm to invest in Andhra Pradesh. Naidu urged Apple to establish a manufacturing facility in the state. Earlier in the day, the chief minister visited Google's X facility that developed Google's driver-less cars and glasses projects besides using balloons for spreading internet. He interacted with firm's CEO Astro Teller and discussed the latest technological and innovative advancements. On the occasion, Google X has agreed to collaborate with the state to enhance Internet penetration in AP. Google X gave a demonstration of driver-less car and use of drones to deliver various products to homes to the delegation. Naidu also met with vice-president of Qualcomm Technologies Inc Gopi Sirineni who expressed keenness to work within AP on the fibre grid project. The CM asked Gopi Sirineni to study the current status of the project and identify where his firm can contribute. Later, he interacted with NRIs and appealed to them to invest in AP. "Time has come for you to do your bit for your motherland. We are looking for partnerships for development of the state and I invite you to invest in your state which is rich in natural resources," he appealed and said that prospective investors should focus on investing in manufacturing facilities. Minister for finance Yanamala Ramakrishnudu, government advisor (communications) Parakala Prabhakar, CM secretary G Saiprasad, Economic Development Board CEO J Krishna Kishore, CRDA principal secretary Ajay Jain, IT principal secretary K Vijayanand and secretary of industries Solomon Arokyaraj were present.

Not too long after analyst Rod Hall issued an analyst note claiming that Apple will unveil the iPhone 8 at WWDC, the firm recently published a new research report alleging that everything we thought we knew about the iPhone 8’s edge-to-edge display has been completely off base. Don't Miss: NASA’s Saturn spacecraft just delivered photos so stunning you’ll think they’re fake In a note first spotted by 9to5Mac, JPMorgan analysts claim that the iPhone 8’s  5.8-inch edge-to-edge OLED display will only be edge-to-edge horizontally, not all across the device. In other words, JPMorgan believes that the final iPhone 8 design will not feature a display that takes up the entire front of the device. On the contrary, there will be discernible bezels located on both the top and bottom of the device. This of course is at odds with any number of leaked schematics and rumors which point to a sleek iPhone design with minimal 4mm bezels surrounding the entirety of the display. To date, most iPhone 8 rumors we’ve seen claim that the device will look something like this, with the Touch ID sensor embedded into the display itself. JPMorgan, meanwhile, anticipates that the iPhone 8, upon its release, will sport a design that looks something like this. Now to be fair, it’s more than plausible that the final iPhone 8 design will look similar to the design featured above. And while it’s hard to ignore that this particular iPhone design flies in the face of every single iPhone 8 rumor we’ve seen to date, it’s worth noting that Apple typically experiments with any number of varying iPhone prototypes before deciding which model will actually go to mass production. Nonetheless, JPMorgan doesn’t exactly have a lengthy or impressive track record with respect to Apple rumors, so you might want to take their most recent analyst report with the requisite grain of salt. Even more bizarre, though, is the JPMorgan claim that Apple may include free AirPods inside of every new iPhone 8 box. This seems beyond unlikely for a number of reasons, one of which is that Apple didn’t amass a quarter-trillion dollars in the bank by literally giving money away. AirPods have proven to be a surprise hit for Apple, so much so that the company still can’t manufacture enough of them to meet swelling demand. Consider this: AirPods became available in mid-December and there’s still a 6 week shipping delay — per Apple’s website — if you put in an order today. The idea that Apple will give away $159 headphones for free with every iPhone 8 purchase — when it still can’t satisfy demand from customers all to happy to pay for them — seems beyond far-fetched, to say the least. Read More As far as other iPhone 8 rumors are concerned, JPMorgan says that the iPhone 8 will feature 3D cameras, a feature that will reportedly be used for facial recognition and advanced augmented reality functionality. As a point of interest, we’ve seen rumblings that the iPhone 8’s advanced 3D cameras may be the reason behind the delayed iPhone 8 release date. Recall, it’s believed that the iPhone 8 has a slim chance of actually launching in September, with a more realistic launch window likely set for October, or in a worse case scenario, November. Specifically, Apple component supplier STMicroelectronics will reportedly not have enough 3D camera modules ready in time to support an iPhone 8 release date in September. Regardless of when the iPhone 8 actually launches, the larger takeaway is that the device will help spur what many analysts believe will be the largest iPhone refresh in history.

Embarrassment beckoned for the Yeatsmen. However with injuries hurting their hopes, Niall Carew’s experienced men stepped up to the plate in the final 15 minutes to wrestle the contest back in their favour and secure a showdown with Mayo in a fortnight’s time with an eight-point victory. This was so much more than an exhibition as the Championship kicked off with some superb flowing football on foreign soil. The first six minutes saw as many scores shared between the sides as the patrons were treated to a scintillating opening to the 2017 Championship. Sligo’s Neil Ewing had got the show on the road within 30 seconds with a smart point but Daniel McKenna responded immediately, veteran Mark Breheny and Eugene McVerry then sharing frees with nerves hard found in the Bronx air.  The experience of Breheny — beginning his 18th Championship season here — was going to be key as Carew’s men looked to avoid ending up as a punchline. While Keelan Cawley chose to forego the game’s first goal chance for another point soon after, by the time the contest finally began to settle on 20 minutes, Sligo were 0-9 to 0-4 ahead, Paddy O’Connor, Stephen Coen John Kelly and Adrian Marren getting on the scoresheet with McVerry’s frees keeping New York in touch.  Sligo could have been further clear but for Vinny Cadden, their countryman keeping guard between the hosts’ posts, brilliantly tipping a clever Breheny effort on to the post and away. It was a moment that gave the underdogs a visible boost and as the heavens finally opened and the ball began to skip across the synthetic surface, the flow of the contest was willed back New York’s way. With McVerry and Conor McGraynor’s accuracy from dead balls paying off, the margin was clawed all the way in. New York were down by just two points at the break. Having trailed Roscommon by double that margin last year only to come within inches of history, both sides knew this was far from over.  A contest in which a goal would have been huge got one on 45 minutes — and it lit up the Big Apple. Keith Quinn floated in a deep free, substitute Shane O’Connor soared to knock it down to McVerry who powered home. Six minutes later, New York had their  first lead with a booming Wherity score. Gaelic Park was alive and Sligo needed to stem the tide.  Impressively their veterans did so, a Marren brace and Kelly putting them back in front. Then came Cawley’s decisive goal. Wing back Eoin McHugh — superb throughout — burst through the New York defence to feed Cawley who ended the game as a contest.  Carew may only have two weeks to get to grips with the prospect of Mayo in Castlebar but escaping ignominy in the Bronx will do for now.  RECAP: NEW YORK 1-13 SLIGO 1-21 New York: V.

Windows 10 includes a “dark” theme that flips the backgrounds of some apps from white to black. The operating system also has a high-contrast mode available in the Ease of Access settings that inverts the white background with black, while also changing the colours of buttons and menus to make them stand out against the dark background. You can get to either option by pressing the Windows and I keys to open the Settings area, or by going to the Start menu and selecting the gear-shaped Settings icon. In Settings, choose Personalisation and then Colours. In the Choose Your App Mode area toward the bottom of the window, select Dark; you can pick a custom accent colour for your windows here, too. The dark theme works with several Windows 10 apps, but does not give everything a black backdrop. For example, the File Explorer and browser windows keep their white backgrounds. Some versions of Microsoft Office have their own dark themes, too, as does the Edge browser. Other browsers have similar add-ons; Google offers its own High Contrast extension for its Chrome browser. For a more universal system switch from white to black, click the High Contrast Settings link under the app mode options in the Personalisation box, or click the Ease of Access icon in the main Settings area. In the Ease of Access box, select High Contrast and choose a colour combination that suits you from the drop-down menu. You can turn off or adjust either the dark theme or the high-contrast mode by returning to Settings. Apple includes its own contrast and colour settings for the Mac in the System Preferences. To make adjustments, open the System Preferences icon in the desktop dock, click the Accessibility icon and choose Display. Q: How do I change the billing information for iPad app purchases? You can update your credit card number, address or other details about the way you pay for your iTunes and App Store downloads by opening the Settings icon from the iPad’s home screen and selecting iTunes & App Store. In the box that pops up, tap View Apple ID and sign in, if prompted. On the Apple ID screen, select Payment Information from the list, and on the next screen, make the changes you wish. Apple notes that if you are using its Family Sharing feature to corral all purchases made by members of a designated family group, only the user previously deemed the “organiser” can change the payment information. If you are having trouble trying to remove a linked credit card from your account by switching to None as a billing option, make sure you have no outstanding charges with the iTunes or App Stores — or subscriptions that automatically renew and bill that credit card. You can also change your Apple billing information from your Windows PC or Mac computer. To get to your settings from the desktop, open the iTunes programme, go to the Account menu and select View My Account. Sign in with your account password and on the account settings screen, click the Edit button next to payment type to make your changes. The process for changing billing information is similar for other companies that keep your electronic payment method on file — like Google and Amazon and apps that offer purchases or subscriptions. Simply find the account settings area, log in and locate the section for payment details. Just make sure you are on a secure network connection when you do.

Reuters/Issei Kato The iPhone 8 continues to keep most thinking and the latest word out is whether Apple will employ a change in the porting phase. Apple has relied on the old Lightning port but some are now wondering if a USB-C change is in the works.  That seems like a logical dish only that it may not happen for the iPhone 8. It would have been a dandy addition to the redesigned Apple flagship but the cost and time to integrate it may not be enough. Though delays are being suggested, adding another feature to worry about is something the Cupertino company will surely want to hold off for now, CNet reported.  What can USB-C do that a Lightning port can’t? Transitioning from the familiar Lightning port to a USB-C is not expected until maybe later on. While it is a port used by most devices in the market, the Lightning port seems sufficient enough to use for now. Among the areas of concern include charging and data transfers. As Apple Insider points out, the USB-C promises to bring in more power delivery but its advantage over the Lightning port may not be that glaring. Apple still has the technologies to account for faster charging such as the Fresco Logic FL1100SX host controller of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. While that may be far off, the point here is that Apple does have technologies on their end that even potential iPhone 8 users can resort to. So if that were the case, a shift to USB-C port can wait.  The same holds true to date transfer rates for the iPhone 8. The setup mentioned above does pretty much the same thing, regardless if the USB-C has been feted for faster transfers. Also, Apple has been quietly focusing on wireless transfers through its Wi-Fi sync. This negates the need to rely on cables, meaning Lightning or USB-C ports become worthless with the Cupertino company’s shift to wireless technology.  USB-C integration may happen eventually Time will only tell when Apple decides to shift to USB-C technology. But with the iPhone 8 expected to be unveiled this September, the best chances of port changes may be for devices after that.  It could be the next iPad Pro, MacBook or an iPhone 9 next year. Apple has been notorious for relying on their actual technology and turning to changes at some point. Right now, the USB-C may be a hit with rival brand devices but Apple will likely take its sweet time first since the change doesn’t appear to be alarming and necessary.

Top News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter App International Edition Monday May 8, 2017 About Us App Advertise Contact Us Taiwan Foreign Community National Local Foreign Affairs China-Taiwan Relations Business Arts-Leisure Analysis Catcher's Q1 net profit shrinks CNA  Monday, May 8, 2017, 12:01 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ 中文 TAIPEI -- Catcher Technology Co. (可成), a metal casing supplier to Apple Inc., suffered a significant drop in its net profit for the first quarter of this year, mainly due to large foreign exchange losses caused by a stronger Taiwan dollar. In addition, Catcher said that the fall in its earnings for the January-March period came because its major clients were in a transition period before launching new models. The statement echoed comments made by Apple CEO Tim Cook earlier in the week that a delay in consumer purchases resulted from "reports about future products," which affected iPhone shipments in the first quarter. In the three-month period, Apple's iPhone shipments totaled 50.8 million units, lower than an earlier market expectation of 52 million units. Catcher said that it posted NT$2.104 billion (US$69.67 million) in net profit for the first quarter, down 77.9 percent from a quarter earlier and also down 49.5 percent from a year earlier, with earnings per share at NT$2.71. That compared with earnings per share at NT$12.37 seen in the fourth quarter and NT$5.40 recorded over the same period of last year. The Taiwanese manufacturer said that it suffered about NT$2.27 billion in non-operating losses, mainly from foreign exchange losses in the first quarter, when the Taiwan dollar rose about 6 percent against the greenback. Catcher was just one of many Taiwanese exports-oriented high tech firms to report foreign exchange losses. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC, 台積電), the world's largest contract chip maker, incurred about NT$6 billion in foreign exchange losses, while Largan Precision Co., a smartphone camera lens supplier to Apple, recorded NT$1.14 billion in such losses. In the first quarter, Catcher's consolidated sales totaled NT$14.58 billion, down 39.3 percent from a quarter earlier and also down 13.4 percent from a year earlier, while its gross margin, the difference between revenue and cost of the goods sold, fell 1 percentage point from a quarter earlier to 49 percent. Catcher said that the first half of the year remains a traditional slow season for the company but momentum is expected to pick up, which will help its operations bounce back strongly the second half. Therefore, it has left its forecast unchanged, predicting that its operations will improve throughout 2017 as a whole. In April, Catcher's consolidated sales reached NT$5.14 billion, up 3.3 percent from a month earlier but down 14.9 percent from a year earlier. In the first four months of this year, the company's consolidated sales fell 13.8 percent from a year earlier to NT$19.71 billion. Catcher has decided to expand a factory located in Jiangsu Province, China, by investing US$1 billion to buy production equipment to meet demand in the future. Analysts said that the investment aims to secure more orders from Apple, which is expected to launch the next generation iPhones in the second half of the year.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Apple Plans To Create A New Automator App For IOS 11 And Mac’s OSX 10.13 Posted: May 7 2017, 10:57am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in Rumors | Apple     Apple’s plans are the vaguest ones when it comes to the world of leaks and rumors. So many speculations and rumors surface the internet that it becomes a confusing task to believe on one. Don't Miss: Find Rare Products in Stock Online with The Tracker But still, rumors and report supported by evidential entities are highly considered to be true. As is the case with cyanhat’s post earlier today on Reddit. This user has been correct in speculating FaceTime calls, and the Power saver mode which are now almost confirmed to be featured in iOS 11. Cyanhat threw a light on Apple’s very recent Acquisition, the Workflow app, and claimed that Apple will use the functionality of Workflow and the skills of its developers to create a new Automator app for iOS 11. The Automator application in iOS 11 will be a pre-installed, first-party application, and will replace Home app of iOS 10. Not to worry, introduction to Automator does not mean that your integration with Home app will be lost, the Automator application will arrive as an upgraded experience with more capabilities. The Automator application will also have a feature known as iCloud Integration. This story may contain affiliate links.

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 103 Plus 1 on G+ 370 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares578 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

What's wrong with it? I haven't really noticed issues on my 128 non XL. I still love my phone but I understand if someone was switching now, they should just wait for the new one. I probably will. Patruns The XL is too large for me. No wireless charging is a game stopper for me. $650+ is just too much to pay as I buy my phones outright for my wife and myself. We are still happily using our Nexus 5 phones until something of roughly the same dimensions with QI charging comes out that won't break the bank. Also, I want pure Android. Not interested in Touchwiz or any other skins. Rod So, I found another proud N5 owner! I'm in my third battery, nothing to complain about. YuCMi I skipped this generation, was too salty about Google's treatment of Nexus devices. If they make their next phone reasonably priced, then I'll consider it. Otherwise, Google can fuck off with their "premium" pricing. CW The OnePlus 3T is a great phone at a great price! Laura J. Sellers Hughes I bought my Google Pixel XL for the camera. I have not been disappointed! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c44fd1bc546c27c02f945b075e0388e076c62e0fd612b3c74442129a05446139.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c4618b9d22a1d44186f347c184038b3a833f38a1148cc4b91b95981303fa8b6b.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/465d23a781688e73e20a0737904c3880ee693ee06b5dd1779ae91d9799b0488b.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1f3d76182fdd59b34eda695d20943d03e71240b775f63106ef41809601a7cabf.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/66175dfb8d6503940dc945b8d865f4f8276c84f7f3abd0e0e46dc31136501275.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f7fa8ed860bc28a3a3e377a7e74591e764bdec5795747c4a1afb93eaa44aa0b2.jpg Rod You shouldn't. It's the best camera in a smartphone currently. Even the S8 was left behind in image quality. Aj Wayans Nothing wrong with my Pixel, best phone I've ever had. Only has scratches because I've dropped it a few times Rod Impossible. Pixel is horrid, every single owner has an urge to throw it onto the nearest wall. WNDRKND I hear ya, but I got pixel for Christmas. And back then, there was no new Samsung phone. Personally, the optimization alone makes the phone worth it... Like, I've literally had no problems. Even the speaker issue, Bluetooth, whatever. My handset works perfect, even for a first generation device. Either way, I'll be waiting for pixel three and skipping pixel 2 this Christmas. Rod I think you're 4 months late. Lol WNDRKND Haha perhaps, but with nobody able to get one... I still feel 9 months early lmao! Rod First rule of the Pixel club: no one talks about the club Hussain Ahmadi Pixel is an indie phone, like indie films with limited screens and very much less public appeal, no matter how good it is it will always be just a side phone. The only true big sharks in the market are Samsung and Apple. Google is not able to compete with them erikz The main reason I wanted the Pixel was to get on Google Fi. ackthbbft I think there are still good reasons to go with the Pixel, even if it means waiting for gen 2. I went with the Pixel because I wanted to get on Project Fi and "pure" Android. As a former Samsung Galaxy S5 user (S2 before that), I got tired of both carrier-installed and OEM bloatware, plus I've been saving money on my plan. Tj Hariharan Frankly I'm considering an LG-G6... comes with assistant, near stock android from what I've been told and my little experience with in-store demo's...AND iirc: an SD Card. Rod Then, when Google drops Android 8, you'll infuriated asking LG where your OTA is. gparmar76 Google will charge the same price with Pixel 2. They have a proven track record with the Nexus phones... roseglace >The Bluetooth performance is horrid. so? bluetooth is not everything to everyone. in particular, i've used it on my pixel exactly once. a non-issue. > It's not waterproof. i'll remember not to take my phone into the shower. another non-issue. > The bezels really are due for a shrink. the bezels i can't see with the phone in its case? > I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a >particularly high quality. the coating i can't see with the phone in its case? > The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. there's that case in the way again. darn. > And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four >of the big US carriers. such as? maybe i'd worry if i lived in the united states but i bought the phone for phone calls, SMS and wifi. are those 'advanced'? they work in canada. > the model most of us want - the 128GB XL is there a shred of evidence that 'most' of 'us' want it? if it was the exact same price as the 16GB version i'd want it. if it was even twenty bucks more? umm, probably not. i know it's labelled 'opinion' and everything, but could you try a _little_ harder not to sound like you're whining? John Pitkethly I got a Pixel in December and have none of the problems listed in this article. Jordan Bartholme Great article, thank you! thereasoner If fast updates and performance are your thing than it's never a bad time to buy a Pixel but if one must wait then I guess the Pixel 2 is not that far off. Don't care about stock Android performance and updates? Then there are more choices coming still besides Samsung. I personally am looking forward to the HTC U 11 in a couple of weeks time. geolemon Good points. Even still, the worst point is that it's a metal (stupid) and glass (downright silly) wannabe iPhone (including all the hardware limitations we all hate Apple for) to try to pull the "Apple demographic" stereotype as a customer - people who want a jewelry phone rather than a functional, practical tool. Sadly, few alternatives exist today, if you want high end specs. How far we've fallen in just a few years. Hopefully it's something to just ride out - high end phones that fit in front trouser pockets and have swappable batteries, sd cards, and the durability of polycarbonate replacing the impact vulnerability of metal will reappear. But certainly - the Pixel is one of the more vulgar offerings. Sad, because I was otherwise a satisfied customer on Google Fi. Mike Dealbreaker on the Pixel 2 could be whether or not Google include unlimited full resolution Photos & Video BackUp like they have with the Pixel 1. If they don't & just throw in something like the S8's increased 100K Play Music songs limit instead, we just might hold on to our Pixel XL 128 a little longer instead. Like all hardware, it's what you do with it that really matters, but without the software to achieve it with... You just pays your money & you takes your choice. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 is my Pixel XL. Easy to get one and top end specs. I have had all the Nexus phones and passed up the Pixel. I may look at the 2nd generation but they need to fix their supply chain. No reason to wait long with all of the good competition out there. They also created hype with limited availability. Get it right Google. Kimwo Good read! I've HATED my Pixel from day one! I tried to fall in love with it but I haven't! My husband made me do an upgrade and of course it was when this dumb a*$ ph came out! I sent my Samsung GalaxyS5 in as was required for rebate to get the Pixel. The camera sucks butt, I don't know what all the hype was about! I thought I'd like the fact it has unlimited storage but how is that useful if you can't get a good quality photo!!!! I think Androids are way better, and easy to use. That's all I've had sense the iPhone 4! Wouldn't go back to an iPhone but would take it over a Pixel any day!!😝 Christopher Hopkins First off who ever made this post is just a glorified iPhone fan and downing the Google pixel I've had mine since launch and so have the 3 others on my account and all of us can say nothing has gone wrong with my pixel not once so get off your high horse and the back glass part of my phone is not scratched still and this is the same phone since launch same with my GF her brother and my best friend on my account Stanced Imports What a joke review I've had a Google pixel since January this phone is the best phone I've ever had, and I've had a iPhone 7😂 if you can't afford it that's not a reason to not buy it, that's a choice the consumer should make not a reflection on the phones performance 😁 I live in Canada so my Google pixel is about 1000$ and it's worth every penny Stanced Imports Also I find it's nice that the phones availability is scarce so I don't look at everyone and they all have the same phone. vitriolix "unsupported by October 2018" That's wrong, they will still get security patches until Oct 2019.

Apple on Wednesday for the first time released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 US employees work, showing that more than half of them are located outside Silicon Valley. It also announced a US$1 billion fund aimed at creating more US manufacturing jobs, although it provided few details. The strategy appears aimed at complicating efforts by US President Donald Trump and other politicians to vilify Apple for using companies in China and elsewhere to assemble most of its products. Apple had no comment on political ramifications of its announcements. Apple chief executive officer Tim Cook first described the manufacturing fund during an interview on CNBC, but did not say how the money would be disbursed or who would be eligible to receive it. Apple will provide more details when it announces its first investment by the end of the month, he said. Cook also promised that Apple will hire “thousands of employees, thousands more in the future” in the US, although he did not specify how quickly that would happen. Apple’s US payroll has grown about 40-fold since 1998, when it had 5,000 US workers. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from China, a change that would drive up Apple’s costs. That could pressure the company to raise its prices at a time when it is already having trouble increasing its sales of iPhones and iPads. “They are trying to make the case that they really do have a lot of folks working in the US,” technology industry analyst Rob Enderle said. “So if you want to pick on somebody, you might want to pick on somebody else because they won’t be a good example.” The numbers show its highest concentration of workers (36,786) is located in California, home to the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters and 53 stores. Its second-biggest employment center is in Texas (8,407 jobs), where it has a corporate campus and 18 stores. Apple’s decision to provide detailed information about the locations of its US employees could help the company win support from lawmakers eager to protect jobs in their states, Enderle said. “It gives senators something to push back with, recognizing that Apple is a real risky company to target anyway because its products are so popular with people,” he added. Besides showing how many of its full-time and part-time employees work in each state, Apple also lists where its 9,000 US suppliers are located. The company says it spent more than US$50 billion at its US suppliers last year, helping them employ a total of 450,000 workers. This story has been viewed 1547 times. Comments will be moderated.

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 103 Plus 1 on G+ 370 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares578 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

What's wrong with it? I haven't really noticed issues on my 128 non XL. I still love my phone but I understand if someone was switching now, they should just wait for the new one. I probably will. Patruns The XL is too large for me. No wireless charging is a game stopper for me. $650+ is just too much to pay as I buy my phones outright for my wife and myself. We are still happily using our Nexus 5 phones until something of roughly the same dimensions with QI charging comes out that won't break the bank. Also, I want pure Android. Not interested in Touchwiz or any other skins. Rod So, I found another proud N5 owner! I'm in my third battery, nothing to complain about. YuCMi I skipped this generation, was too salty about Google's treatment of Nexus devices. If they make their next phone reasonably priced, then I'll consider it. Otherwise, Google can fuck off with their "premium" pricing. CW The OnePlus 3T is a great phone at a great price! Laura J. Sellers Hughes I bought my Google Pixel XL for the camera.

It's the best camera in a smartphone currently. Even the S8 was left behind in image quality. Aj Wayans Nothing wrong with my Pixel, best phone I've ever had. Only has scratches because I've dropped it a few times Rod Impossible. Pixel is horrid, every single owner has an urge to throw it onto the nearest wall. WNDRKND I hear ya, but I got pixel for Christmas. And back then, there was no new Samsung phone. Personally, the optimization alone makes the phone worth it... Like, I've literally had no problems. Even the speaker issue, Bluetooth, whatever. My handset works perfect, even for a first generation device. Either way, I'll be waiting for pixel three and skipping pixel 2 this Christmas. Rod I think you're 4 months late. Lol WNDRKND Haha perhaps, but with nobody able to get one... I still feel 9 months early lmao! Rod First rule of the Pixel club: no one talks about the club Hussain Ahmadi Pixel is an indie phone, like indie films with limited screens and very much less public appeal, no matter how good it is it will always be just a side phone. The only true big sharks in the market are Samsung and Apple. Google is not able to compete with them erikz The main reason I wanted the Pixel was to get on Google Fi. ackthbbft I think there are still good reasons to go with the Pixel, even if it means waiting for gen 2. I went with the Pixel because I wanted to get on Project Fi and "pure" Android. As a former Samsung Galaxy S5 user (S2 before that), I got tired of both carrier-installed and OEM bloatware, plus I've been saving money on my plan. Tj Hariharan Frankly I'm considering an LG-G6... comes with assistant, near stock android from what I've been told and my little experience with in-store demo's...AND iirc: an SD Card. Rod Then, when Google drops Android 8, you'll infuriated asking LG where your OTA is. gparmar76 Google will charge the same price with Pixel 2. They have a proven track record with the Nexus phones... roseglace >The Bluetooth performance is horrid. so? bluetooth is not everything to everyone. in particular, i've used it on my pixel exactly once. a non-issue. > It's not waterproof. i'll remember not to take my phone into the shower. another non-issue. > The bezels really are due for a shrink. the bezels i can't see with the phone in its case? > I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a >particularly high quality. the coating i can't see with the phone in its case? > The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. there's that case in the way again. darn. > And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four >of the big US carriers. such as? maybe i'd worry if i lived in the united states but i bought the phone for phone calls, SMS and wifi. are those 'advanced'? they work in canada. > the model most of us want - the 128GB XL is there a shred of evidence that 'most' of 'us' want it? if it was the exact same price as the 16GB version i'd want it. if it was even twenty bucks more? umm, probably not. i know it's labelled 'opinion' and everything, but could you try a _little_ harder not to sound like you're whining? John Pitkethly I got a Pixel in December and have none of the problems listed in this article. Jordan Bartholme Great article, thank you! thereasoner If fast updates and performance are your thing than it's never a bad time to buy a Pixel but if one must wait then I guess the Pixel 2 is not that far off. Don't care about stock Android performance and updates? Then there are more choices coming still besides Samsung. I personally am looking forward to the HTC U 11 in a couple of weeks time. geolemon Good points. Even still, the worst point is that it's a metal (stupid) and glass (downright silly) wannabe iPhone (including all the hardware limitations we all hate Apple for) to try to pull the "Apple demographic" stereotype as a customer - people who want a jewelry phone rather than a functional, practical tool. Sadly, few alternatives exist today, if you want high end specs. How far we've fallen in just a few years. Hopefully it's something to just ride out - high end phones that fit in front trouser pockets and have swappable batteries, sd cards, and the durability of polycarbonate replacing the impact vulnerability of metal will reappear. But certainly - the Pixel is one of the more vulgar offerings. Sad, because I was otherwise a satisfied customer on Google Fi. Mike Dealbreaker on the Pixel 2 could be whether or not Google include unlimited full resolution Photos & Video BackUp like they have with the Pixel 1. If they don't & just throw in something like the S8's increased 100K Play Music songs limit instead, we just might hold on to our Pixel XL 128 a little longer instead. Like all hardware, it's what you do with it that really matters, but without the software to achieve it with... You just pays your money & you takes your choice. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 is my Pixel XL. Easy to get one and top end specs. I have had all the Nexus phones and passed up the Pixel. I may look at the 2nd generation but they need to fix their supply chain. No reason to wait long with all of the good competition out there. They also created hype with limited availability. Get it right Google. Kimwo Good read! I've HATED my Pixel from day one! I tried to fall in love with it but I haven't! My husband made me do an upgrade and of course it was when this dumb a*$ ph came out! I sent my Samsung GalaxyS5 in as was required for rebate to get the Pixel. The camera sucks butt, I don't know what all the hype was about! I thought I'd like the fact it has unlimited storage but how is that useful if you can't get a good quality photo!!!! I think Androids are way better, and easy to use. That's all I've had sense the iPhone 4! Wouldn't go back to an iPhone but would take it over a Pixel any day!!😝 Christopher Hopkins First off who ever made this post is just a glorified iPhone fan and downing the Google pixel I've had mine since launch and so have the 3 others on my account and all of us can say nothing has gone wrong with my pixel not once so get off your high horse and the back glass part of my phone is not scratched still and this is the same phone since launch same with my GF her brother and my best friend on my account Stanced Imports What a joke review I've had a Google pixel since January this phone is the best phone I've ever had, and I've had a iPhone 7😂 if you can't afford it that's not a reason to not buy it, that's a choice the consumer should make not a reflection on the phones performance 😁 I live in Canada so my Google pixel is about 1000$ and it's worth every penny Stanced Imports Also I find it's nice that the phones availability is scarce so I don't look at everyone and they all have the same phone. vitriolix "unsupported by October 2018" That's wrong, they will still get security patches until Oct 2019.

There have been rumors for weeks now about Apple unveiling a Siri-powered connected speaker at WWDC in June, and Schiller’s comments seems to indicate that the company has been thinking about a device for some time now. Speaking to Gadgets 360, Schiller didn’t refer to the Echo or Home speakers by name, but he did make it clear that Apple feels the devices leave much to be improved on. While speaking about voice assistants in more broad terms, the executive commented that Apple is committed to the development of its Siri technology, and that the company feels there are different usage scenarios where a screen can play a valuable role. Schiller acknowledged the growing consumer interest in voice-powered devices like the Echo and Home, but noted that the lack of a screen can be severely limiting. “We think it’s important that there are times when it’s convenient to simply use your voice when you are not able to use the screen,” said Schiller. “For example, if you’re driving [and] you want Siri to work for you without having to look at the screen, that’s the best thing. Or maybe you’re across the room, and you want to ask Siri to change the song you’re listening to.” He goes on to explain that while voice-only interaction can be necessary at times, the presence of screen can only enhance the experience and add options for interaction. “So there’s many moments where a voice assistant is really beneficial, but that doesn’t mean you’d never want a screen. So the idea of not having a screen, I don’t think suits many situations. For example if I’m looking for directions and I’m using Maps, Siri can tell me those directions by voice and that’s really convenient but it’s even better if I can see that map, and I can see what turns are coming up, and I can see where there is congestion, I understand better my route, and what I’m going to do.” Schiller went on to point out how screens would be needed in order for voice assistants to grow and improve in areas like photography and gaming. He ended the interview by saying that voice assistants will continue to become more powerful and useful, but that it’s important to think about the role the screen can play and when it’s appropriate.

If you downloaded HandBrake between 10:30 a.m. EDT on May 2, 2017 and 7:00 p.m. EDT on May 6, 2017, you should follow these instructions to check your Mac for a new variant of the malware OSX.PROTON. Yes, HandBrake was compromised by malware. A popular video conversion app, HandBrake, has been infected with malware (Image Credit: HypnoArt) How Is It That HandBrake Was Compromised By Malware? Sometime before 10:30 a.m. EDT on May 2, 2017, one of the download mirrors for HandBrake was compromised by malware. An unknown malicious file including the Trojan replaced the installation package HandBrake–1.0.7.dmg. When the developers behind HandBrake discovered the infection, they posted a notice on the HandBrake forums. HandBrake shut down the affected download server, and is now rebuilding it from scratch. OSX.PROTON is a remote access Trojan first discovered on a Russian cybercrime message board in early February 2017. The cybercriminals offered the malware with an Apple-approved developer signature to enable it to bypass Apple’s Gatekeeper protection on the victim’s Mac, according to security firm Intego. After installed, an attacker could gain complete remote access to the user’s computer, including viewing the screen in real time and recording keystrokes. The malware is also capable of uploading your files, downloading additional malware, accessing the webcam, and issuing shell commands, among other nefarious activities. How to Find Out if Your Copy of HandBrake Is Infected If you downloaded the video conversion software during the reported timeframe and then installed a HandBrake.dmg file with this checksum, your Mac is infected: SHA1: 0935a43ca90c6c419a49e4f8f1d75e68cd70b274
SHA256: 013623e5e50449bbdf6943549d8224a122aa6c42bd3300a1bd2b743b01ae6793 You can check this by running the following command in Terminal from the folder containing the install file: shasum HandBrake–1.0.7.dmg You can also confirm infection by launching Activity Monitor from Applications/Utilities. Look for a process called “activity_agent” or “Activity_agent”. The infection is present if you see that process. Apple is updating the definitions for OS X and macOS’s XProtect feature, a process that began this morning. The new updates are rolling out soon, if not already. The definition update offers some measure of protection. However, go ahead and follow our removal procedure if the Trojan has already infected your Mac. Great, It’s Infected My Mac – Now What? Removal of the malware itself is relatively straightforward and easy. To remove this variant of OSX.PROTON, issue the following commands from the Terminal: launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/fr.handbrake.activity_agent.plist
rm -rf ~/Library/RenderFiles/activity_agent.app You should also check ~/Library/VideoFrameworks for the presence of a file called “proton.zip.” If it’s there, HandBrake suggests deleting the entire VideoFrameworks folder. Finally, you should delete the infected HandBrake.dmg file and download it again from a clean mirror. According to HandBrake, the primary download mirror and website are unaffected. It would also be wise to run additional malware detection software. This is just in case the Trojan has already downloaded any of its friends. Oh, and one more thing. HandBrake says affected users should change any passwords that might reside in your macOS or OS X Keychain or any browser password stores. Great news, isn’t it? For more information and updates, be sure to check HandBrake’s announcement of the breach periodically.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) revealed in its fiscal second-quarter report it is sitting on more than one-quarter of a trillion dollars in pure hard cash. To be specific, the company is holding $256.8 billion, up more than $10 billion from just the prior quarter. The problem is $239 billion is held overseas, which would be subject to a hefty 35 percent tax rate if it is brought home, making the prospect of an immediate shopping spree less likely. But, if the White House introduces a one-time tax holiday or reduction, then Apple could bring home hundreds of billions of dollars and put it to use. Statista compiled a "shopping list" of companies Apple can buy instead of spending tens of billions of dollars in dividend payments and stock buybacks. As a whole, Apple could enter the social media space by acquiring Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) ($13 billion), Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) ($25 billion), ride-sharing platform and major self-driving car player Uber ($68 billion) and tech giant Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE: SNE) ($43 billion). Apple would have plenty of cash leftover to buy Airbnb ($31 billion), another major player in the on-demand economy, and satisfy investors hoping for an expansion into media and entertainment by buying out Time Warner Inc (NYSE: TWX) ($77 billion).

(NASDAQ: AAPL) CEO Tim Cook promised investors back in January its Services business would become the size of a Fortune 100 company in 2017 and then double in size within four years. On Tuesday, the executive offered an update to his ambitious goal in conjunction with Apple's fiscal second-quarter earnings report. Speaking to CNBC, Cook noted within the Services segment, the App Store is seeing "a lot of momentum" — most notably a 20 percent growth in the developer community. Cook added that the company now boasts over 165 million paid subscriptions across all Apple-branded services and third-party platforms. As a whole, Services accounted for $7 billion in revenue in the quarter, which implies the company is "on target to hit the first milestone" of becoming the size of a Fortune 100 company. "There is a lot of momentum," Cook emphasized. For comparison, Apple's Services revenue of $7 billion appears even more impressive compared to Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB)'s entire revenue last quarter of $8.81 billion. Not An Easy Path Ross Geber, president and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, told CNBC Apple's Services unit faces an uphill battle moving forward. Specifically, it will face competitive pressures from not only traditional rivals, but unexpected companies like Spotify, Samsung Electronic (OTC: SSNLF) and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX). Gebe hinted that Apple is being stingy with its cash hoard and doesn't approve of Apple's massive stock buybacks and dividends, saying, "It's time for Tim Cook to spend the money."

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts JPMorgan: iPhone 8 to bring enhanced stereo sound and waterproofing, ship with AirPods Christian Zibreg on May 7, 2017 29 JPMorgan analysts who track Apple’s supply chain in the Asia-Pacific region, including Gokul Hariharan, shared a new research note this week. In it, the they predicted that the company’s upcoming iPhone 8 will come outfitted with an enhanced earpiece sporting “further improvements” to stereo sound and waterproofing. The note, obtained by MacRumors, does not specify what acoustical improvements Apple could introduce to iPhone 8’s earpiece. JPMorgan also made the prediction that AirPods could come as a free accessory with iPhone 8. If true, Apple’s $159 wireless earbuds could replace the firm’s $29 wired EarPods with Lightning connector that come in the box with current iPhone models. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube The research note mentions other previously rumored iPhone 8 features, like an OLED display, a stainless steel and glass design, a faster A11 processor, a larger battery, wireless charging and enhanced cameras with new sensors for 3D mapping, 3D selfies, facial recognition, augmented reality capabilities and more. The analysts estimate that iPhone 8 will be $75 to $80 more expensive to manufacture. iPhone 7 became the first iPhone to feature stereo sound. Rather than use two separate speakers at the bottom of the device, Apple has opted to combine a speaker unit at the bottom with the earpiece at the top to create “immersive stereo sound” delivering two times the audio output of iPhone 6s and increased dynamic range. Tagged: AirPods Analysts Apple Audio iPhone iPhone 8 MacRumors News Rumors Sound MORE FROM iDB Another analyst speculates that iPhone 8 will have rear Touch ID Apple may be struggling with iPhone 8’s rumored optical fingerprint reader iPhone 8’s in-screen Touch ID apparently causing Apple the most trouble Jay If I’m not mistaken the HTC One M7 was the first phone to use the earpiece as a second loud stereo speaker. A great idea and I’m glad  finally came around to it. For years a lot of people thought there were two speakers at the bottom of their iPhones. Rowan09 HTC doesn’t use the earpiece as a speaker, it has its own dedicated speaker on top. Jay There are only two speakers in the phone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d1cb5a776131353f6f97f8b98cf41c68e2641df4bf1ab8cbafc1d70d969a50bb.png Rowan09 Oh ok you’re right then. Jay I just wasn’t sure if the HTC was the first device to do it. It could’ve been a Nokia. sadaN iPhone 7 became the first iPhone to feature stereo sound. Not iPhone 7 became the first phone to feature stereo sound. Joey Captain Obvious? How did these so called analysts get their jobs anyway? Siri Tim Cook Holness No1 wants airpods plz ship some good beats not shove shitty airpods down our throats Rowan09 What’s some good beats and do you own AirPods now? Siri Tim Cook Holness Tbh any of the new wireless beats r superior to airpods I own solo3 bc it’s factual that over ear will always be better Rowan09 So you know they suck how? You want them to ship with other the ear headphones? Siri Tim Cook Holness I just said I do NOT own airpods as 160$ is way too much for in ear headphones with measly 5 hour battery life Rowan09 I edited my comment since it was sent before I saw your response. Siri Tim Cook Holness I need bass in ear bass is always terrible and synthetic Rowan09 So you never used the AirPods just saying they are trash from reviews then? Over the ear headphones won’t be ship with any phone. Siri Tim Cook Holness Ik but at least ship some wireless in ear beats which are still at least a bit superior to airpods Rowan09 How do you know this? Siri Tim Cook Holness Seriously if u think airpods r ok ur probs a stupid Hillary supporter Rowan09 Lol. I don’t own it just asking. I have Beats Powerbeats 2 askep3 Lol this guy, I like your responses Rowan09 Lol Jerry The airpods are great and no I am not a Hillary supporter askep3 If you’ve only heard bass from beats then I’m not sure you know what the difference between good and bad bass is. I love beats bass, it’s “fun”. All I’m saying is there’s more precise and higher quality bass with other headphones askep3 Have you seen the competition? Worse battery life and the decent ones start at $300. Forget that, the AirPods work flawlessly without the annoying Bluetooth connection hassle. Would you rather spend time connecting your earphones or just take them out and put them in your ears? Siri Tim Cook Holness No I don’t own airpods 160$ is way too much for in ear Cerberus The Wise If apple does ship them with AirPods, it’ll be a pretty major win for the consumer. Most people would probably love to have them and if the 8 is going to cost close towards 1000, then thats the least they could do. It’ll also help a lot in pushing their wireless movement forward. People who don’t like them could also just sell them for some easy cash. I am a bit skeptical since they’re still having such a hard time meeting AirPods high demand. MMA Rules Maybe this is why the AirPods are in shortage, but I also can be wrong Jerry Ship with airpods YEAH OKAY. That 159$ price tag they have them on Apple wouldn’t be that stupid askep3 If it’s going to be at least $75 more expensive, I doubt Apple will add airpods. It not only adds the cost of AirPods-cost of EarPods, it also takes away people who would buy the AirPods separately. People won’t be buying AirPods if they already got some with their phone obviously.

Home Apple News Apple Rumors iPhone iPad iPod Mac Apple TV Apple Watch About Apple Rumors iPhone 8 Rumours Share on Facebook Analysts insist, the iPhone 8 will continue to carry Touch ID As every year, a few months from the presentation of the next iPhone is almost impossible to stop thinking about it. Every week, completely new data appear that contrast the existing ones and make us re-think the image we all have in mind about what the next Apple phone will be. All aspects that will change with the arrival of the next iPhone are already being discussed by the community, from the screen to the design of its back. However, there is something that is bringing everyone headlining, since this, in particular, is one of the functions that have most influenced the use of the iPhone over time. I’m talking, of course, about the Touch ID sensor. This security system allowed us to forget to waste time introducing complicated passwords when unlocking our phone, or we just started to really worry about your security. For the first time, protecting our devices became a simple task. Again, yes, the Touch ID will be on the iPhone 8, at least, according to these analysts So it seems, and despite what has been rumoured these months, Apple has no intention of getting rid of the Touch ID. The point is, this is placed back in the back, not on the screen, as we all wanted. They said that the company would have been working on it just like Samsung, but it would not have achieved satisfactory results either, so that, in order not to eliminate functionality, it would be placed in the back of the terminal, as represented in Scheme they have created.   If this is true, we could not hide our disappointment, since it was one of the most interesting features of rumoured for iPhone 8. But, on the other hand, if the design is such and how it is represented in the image, at least Situated in a place somewhat more comfortable than that of its competitors. Anyway, there is still some time left, and there may still be the possibility that Apple gives us the surprise in its presentation.

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 103 Plus 1 on G+ 370 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares578 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

What's wrong with it? I haven't really noticed issues on my 128 non XL. I still love my phone but I understand if someone was switching now, they should just wait for the new one. I probably will. Patruns The XL is too large for me. No wireless charging is a game stopper for me. $650+ is just too much to pay as I buy my phones outright for my wife and myself. We are still happily using our Nexus 5 phones until something of roughly the same dimensions with QI charging comes out that won't break the bank. Also, I want pure Android. Not interested in Touchwiz or any other skins. Rod So, I found another proud N5 owner! I'm in my third battery, nothing to complain about. YuCMi I skipped this generation, was too salty about Google's treatment of Nexus devices. If they make their next phone reasonably priced, then I'll consider it. Otherwise, Google can fuck off with their "premium" pricing. CW The OnePlus 3T is a great phone at a great price! Laura J. Sellers Hughes I bought my Google Pixel XL for the camera. I have not been disappointed! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c44fd1bc546c27c02f945b075e0388e076c62e0fd612b3c74442129a05446139.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c4618b9d22a1d44186f347c184038b3a833f38a1148cc4b91b95981303fa8b6b.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/465d23a781688e73e20a0737904c3880ee693ee06b5dd1779ae91d9799b0488b.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1f3d76182fdd59b34eda695d20943d03e71240b775f63106ef41809601a7cabf.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/66175dfb8d6503940dc945b8d865f4f8276c84f7f3abd0e0e46dc31136501275.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f7fa8ed860bc28a3a3e377a7e74591e764bdec5795747c4a1afb93eaa44aa0b2.jpg Rod You shouldn't. It's the best camera in a smartphone currently. Even the S8 was left behind in image quality. Aj Wayans Nothing wrong with my Pixel, best phone I've ever had. Only has scratches because I've dropped it a few times Rod Impossible. Pixel is horrid, every single owner has an urge to throw it onto the nearest wall. WNDRKND I hear ya, but I got pixel for Christmas. And back then, there was no new Samsung phone. Personally, the optimization alone makes the phone worth it... Like, I've literally had no problems. Even the speaker issue, Bluetooth, whatever. My handset works perfect, even for a first generation device. Either way, I'll be waiting for pixel three and skipping pixel 2 this Christmas. Rod I think you're 4 months late. Lol WNDRKND Haha perhaps, but with nobody able to get one... I still feel 9 months early lmao! Rod First rule of the Pixel club: no one talks about the club Hussain Ahmadi Pixel is an indie phone, like indie films with limited screens and very much less public appeal, no matter how good it is it will always be just a side phone. The only true big sharks in the market are Samsung and Apple. Google is not able to compete with them erikz The main reason I wanted the Pixel was to get on Google Fi. ackthbbft I think there are still good reasons to go with the Pixel, even if it means waiting for gen 2. I went with the Pixel because I wanted to get on Project Fi and "pure" Android. As a former Samsung Galaxy S5 user (S2 before that), I got tired of both carrier-installed and OEM bloatware, plus I've been saving money on my plan. Tj Hariharan Frankly I'm considering an LG-G6... comes with assistant, near stock android from what I've been told and my little experience with in-store demo's...AND iirc: an SD Card. Rod Then, when Google drops Android 8, you'll infuriated asking LG where your OTA is. gparmar76 Google will charge the same price with Pixel 2. They have a proven track record with the Nexus phones... roseglace >The Bluetooth performance is horrid. so? bluetooth is not everything to everyone. in particular, i've used it on my pixel exactly once. a non-issue. > It's not waterproof. i'll remember not to take my phone into the shower. another non-issue. > The bezels really are due for a shrink. the bezels i can't see with the phone in its case? > I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a >particularly high quality. the coating i can't see with the phone in its case? > The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. there's that case in the way again. darn. > And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four >of the big US carriers. such as? maybe i'd worry if i lived in the united states but i bought the phone for phone calls, SMS and wifi. are those 'advanced'? they work in canada. > the model most of us want - the 128GB XL is there a shred of evidence that 'most' of 'us' want it? if it was the exact same price as the 16GB version i'd want it. if it was even twenty bucks more? umm, probably not. i know it's labelled 'opinion' and everything, but could you try a _little_ harder not to sound like you're whining? John Pitkethly I got a Pixel in December and have none of the problems listed in this article. Jordan Bartholme Great article, thank you! thereasoner If fast updates and performance are your thing than it's never a bad time to buy a Pixel but if one must wait then I guess the Pixel 2 is not that far off. Don't care about stock Android performance and updates? Then there are more choices coming still besides Samsung. I personally am looking forward to the HTC U 11 in a couple of weeks time. geolemon Good points. Even still, the worst point is that it's a metal (stupid) and glass (downright silly) wannabe iPhone (including all the hardware limitations we all hate Apple for) to try to pull the "Apple demographic" stereotype as a customer - people who want a jewelry phone rather than a functional, practical tool. Sadly, few alternatives exist today, if you want high end specs. How far we've fallen in just a few years. Hopefully it's something to just ride out - high end phones that fit in front trouser pockets and have swappable batteries, sd cards, and the durability of polycarbonate replacing the impact vulnerability of metal will reappear. But certainly - the Pixel is one of the more vulgar offerings. Sad, because I was otherwise a satisfied customer on Google Fi. Mike Dealbreaker on the Pixel 2 could be whether or not Google include unlimited full resolution Photos & Video BackUp like they have with the Pixel 1. If they don't & just throw in something like the S8's increased 100K Play Music songs limit instead, we just might hold on to our Pixel XL 128 a little longer instead. Like all hardware, it's what you do with it that really matters, but without the software to achieve it with... You just pays your money & you takes your choice. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 is my Pixel XL. Easy to get one and top end specs. I have had all the Nexus phones and passed up the Pixel. I may look at the 2nd generation but they need to fix their supply chain. No reason to wait long with all of the good competition out there. They also created hype with limited availability. Get it right Google. Kimwo Good read! I've HATED my Pixel from day one! I tried to fall in love with it but I haven't! My husband made me do an upgrade and of course it was when this dumb a*$ ph came out! I sent my Samsung GalaxyS5 in as was required for rebate to get the Pixel. The camera sucks butt, I don't know what all the hype was about! I thought I'd like the fact it has unlimited storage but how is that useful if you can't get a good quality photo!!!! I think Androids are way better, and easy to use. That's all I've had sense the iPhone 4! Wouldn't go back to an iPhone but would take it over a Pixel any day!!😝 Christopher Hopkins First off who ever made this post is just a glorified iPhone fan and downing the Google pixel I've had mine since launch and so have the 3 others on my account and all of us can say nothing has gone wrong with my pixel not once so get off your high horse and the back glass part of my phone is not scratched still and this is the same phone since launch same with my GF her brother and my best friend on my account Stanced Imports What a joke review I've had a Google pixel since January this phone is the best phone I've ever had, and I've had a iPhone 7😂 if you can't afford it that's not a reason to not buy it, that's a choice the consumer should make not a reflection on the phones performance 😁 I live in Canada so my Google pixel is about 1000$ and it's worth every penny Stanced Imports Also I find it's nice that the phones availability is scarce so I don't look at everyone and they all have the same phone. vitriolix "unsupported by October 2018" That's wrong, they will still get security patches until Oct 2019.

For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

What's wrong with it? I haven't really noticed issues on my 128 non XL. I still love my phone but I understand if someone was switching now, they should just wait for the new one. I probably will. Patruns The XL is too large for me. No wireless charging is a game stopper for me. $650+ is just too much to pay as I buy my phones outright for my wife and myself. We are still happily using our Nexus 5 phones until something of roughly the same dimensions with QI charging comes out that won't break the bank. Also, I want pure Android. Not interested in Touchwiz or any other skins. Rod So, I found another proud N5 owner! I'm in my third battery, nothing to complain about. YuCMi I skipped this generation, was too salty about Google's treatment of Nexus devices. If they make their next phone reasonably priced, then I'll consider it. Otherwise, Google can fuck off with their "premium" pricing. CW The OnePlus 3T is a great phone at a great price! Laura J. Sellers Hughes I bought my Google Pixel XL for the camera.

It's the best camera in a smartphone currently. Even the S8 was left behind in image quality. Aj Wayans Nothing wrong with my Pixel, best phone I've ever had. Only has scratches because I've dropped it a few times Rod Impossible. Pixel is horrid, every single owner has an urge to throw it onto the nearest wall. WNDRKND I hear ya, but I got pixel for Christmas. And back then, there was no new Samsung phone. Personally, the optimization alone makes the phone worth it... Like, I've literally had no problems. Even the speaker issue, Bluetooth, whatever. My handset works perfect, even for a first generation device. Either way, I'll be waiting for pixel three and skipping pixel 2 this Christmas. Rod I think you're 4 months late. Lol WNDRKND Haha perhaps, but with nobody able to get one... I still feel 9 months early lmao! Rod First rule of the Pixel club: no one talks about the club Hussain Ahmadi Pixel is an indie phone, like indie films with limited screens and very much less public appeal, no matter how good it is it will always be just a side phone. The only true big sharks in the market are Samsung and Apple. Google is not able to compete with them erikz The main reason I wanted the Pixel was to get on Google Fi. ackthbbft I think there are still good reasons to go with the Pixel, even if it means waiting for gen 2. I went with the Pixel because I wanted to get on Project Fi and "pure" Android. As a former Samsung Galaxy S5 user (S2 before that), I got tired of both carrier-installed and OEM bloatware, plus I've been saving money on my plan. Tj Hariharan Frankly I'm considering an LG-G6... comes with assistant, near stock android from what I've been told and my little experience with in-store demo's...AND iirc: an SD Card. Rod Then, when Google drops Android 8, you'll infuriated asking LG where your OTA is. gparmar76 Google will charge the same price with Pixel 2.

John Pitkethly I got a Pixel in December and have none of the problems listed in this article. Jordan Bartholme Great article, thank you! thereasoner If fast updates and performance are your thing than it's never a bad time to buy a Pixel but if one must wait then I guess the Pixel 2 is not that far off. Don't care about stock Android performance and updates? Then there are more choices coming still besides Samsung. I personally am looking forward to the HTC U 11 in a couple of weeks time. geolemon Good points. Even still, the worst point is that it's a metal (stupid) and glass (downright silly) wannabe iPhone (including all the hardware limitations we all hate Apple for) to try to pull the "Apple demographic" stereotype as a customer - people who want a jewelry phone rather than a functional, practical tool. Sadly, few alternatives exist today, if you want high end specs. How far we've fallen in just a few years. Hopefully it's something to just ride out - high end phones that fit in front trouser pockets and have swappable batteries, sd cards, and the durability of polycarbonate replacing the impact vulnerability of metal will reappear. But certainly - the Pixel is one of the more vulgar offerings. Sad, because I was otherwise a satisfied customer on Google Fi. Mike Dealbreaker on the Pixel 2 could be whether or not Google include unlimited full resolution Photos & Video BackUp like they have with the Pixel 1. If they don't & just throw in something like the S8's increased 100K Play Music songs limit instead, we just might hold on to our Pixel XL 128 a little longer instead. Like all hardware, it's what you do with it that really matters, but without the software to achieve it with... You just pays your money & you takes your choice. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 is my Pixel XL. Easy to get one and top end specs. I have had all the Nexus phones and passed up the Pixel. I may look at the 2nd generation but they need to fix their supply chain. No reason to wait long with all of the good competition out there. They also created hype with limited availability. Get it right Google. Kimwo Good read! I've HATED my Pixel from day one! I tried to fall in love with it but I haven't! My husband made me do an upgrade and of course it was when this dumb a*$ ph came out! I sent my Samsung GalaxyS5 in as was required for rebate to get the Pixel. The camera sucks butt, I don't know what all the hype was about! I thought I'd like the fact it has unlimited storage but how is that useful if you can't get a good quality photo!!!! I think Androids are way better, and easy to use. That's all I've had sense the iPhone 4! Wouldn't go back to an iPhone but would take it over a Pixel any day!!😝 Christopher Hopkins First off who ever made this post is just a glorified iPhone fan and downing the Google pixel I've had mine since launch and so have the 3 others on my account and all of us can say nothing has gone wrong with my pixel not once so get off your high horse and the back glass part of my phone is not scratched still and this is the same phone since launch same with my GF her brother and my best friend on my account Stanced Imports What a joke review I've had a Google pixel since January this phone is the best phone I've ever had, and I've had a iPhone 7😂 if you can't afford it that's not a reason to not buy it, that's a choice the consumer should make not a reflection on the phones performance 😁 I live in Canada so my Google pixel is about 1000$ and it's worth every penny Stanced Imports Also I find it's nice that the phones availability is scarce so I don't look at everyone and they all have the same phone. vitriolix "unsupported by October 2018" That's wrong, they will still get security patches until Oct 2019.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax blueprint, which was unveiled last month, proposes allowing multinationals to bring in overseas profits at a tax rate of 10 percent versus 35 percent now.  “Since one of the new administration’s top priorities is to allow US companies to repatriate overseas cash at a lower tax rate, Apple may have a more acute need to put this cash to use,” Suva said. The analyst is rated three out of five stars for his recommendations on Apple, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine.  The other potential acquisition targets include video game developers Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts and Take Two Interactive Software as well as video streaming service Hulu. The analyst said the targets were screened considering five criteria – strategic fit, global scale, transaction size, few non-strategic assets and likely impact on Apple’s share price. Under pressure from shareholders to hand over more of its cash hoard, Apple recently boosted its capital return program by $50 billion, increased its share buyback program by $35 billion and raised its quarterly dividend by 10.5 percent.

According to data by Strategic Analytics on Sunday, LG shipped out 7.3 million smartphones in the first quarter of the year, accounting for a fifth of the world’s biggest handset market. The market share for LG rose nearly 3 percentage points from a year earlier. The gain follows steady sales of the company’s lower-price models, known as the K series and X series, as well as the previous premium V20 model, according to the researcher. The newest G6 smartphone was not counted in the first-quarter shipments, since the model was launched early April in the US market. LG’s latest expansion in the US market has widened the market share gap from fourth player ZTE from China, which took 6.7 percent. Apple retained the top spot with a 34.5 percent share, up 2.3 percentage points from the same quarter last year. The iPhone vendor shipped out a total of 12.6 million units for the first three months of the year, the data showed. Samsung Electronics came in second with a 24.6 percent share, but the figure fell nearly 3 percentage points on-year, as it was affected by the recalled Galaxy Note 7 model and delayed launch of the latest Galaxy S8 model. The South Korean tech titan reported 9 million first-quarter shipments. “The V20 model in the US market enjoyed an unsolicited gain from the Galaxy Note 7 recall as American consumers became more sensitive about the safety of their handsets,” said a spokesperson at LG Electronics. LG’s premium V20 smartphone won the MIL-STE-810G certification, known as a US military standard for durability. With the newest flagship G6 smartphone, LG hopes to cement its current position in the American market. The company added a wireless charging feature to G6 devices selling in the US, tailoring to consumer needs there. “It’s been one month since the new model hit the US market, and so far we are hearing positive reactions,” said the LG official said. “Durability and safety will be the focus of US marketing for the G6 smartphone.” LG’s mobile communications business is on a path to restore profitability. The division reported 200 million won ($176,000) in operating losses in the first quarter, reducing drastically by nearly 200 billion won from a year earlier. “The company is forecast to reduce the loss from the smartphone business with the backing of global sales of the G6 smartphone,” said John Ko, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities.  فيسبوك تويتر يوتيوب Almal - News Iran minister warns Saudi Arabia after 'battle' comments: Tasnim Employee charged with embracing Aya Hegazy's ideas Banks fall short of financing small &medium-sized enterprises:EBRD Reform plan bolstered Public Business Sector Companies: minister EGX30 fell by 0.14% amid surging sales led by Egyptians State companies IPOs program should be time-bound, EGX chief Qodra designs a solar power plant for an int’l organization OTMT posts EGP 921mn due to floatation Banque Misr plans to pump EGP 14bn in energy and construction ECC Aquatic invests EGP 1bn in 4 projects Egypt extends opening of Rafah border crossing until Tuesday Egypt expects second instalment of IMF loan in second half of June Banque Misr considers 3 scenarios to obtain financing of USD 1bn Three firms are to bid on managing IPO of ENPPI Government to re-examine setting up a sovereign fund Site map Latest News Stock Index Politics Economy Finance Companies Markets World News Letter join to news letter to recieve new offers search Follow us Design & Developed  ikdynamics.com Almal - Contact us Almal News 2013 - ©Copyrights Reserved

Here are top 10 takeaways from the 53rd Annual General Meeting of Berkshire Hathaway: On Well Fargo Warren Buffett on Saturday criticised Wells Fargo & Co’s previous management for failing to take action immediately upon learning that its employees were signing up customers for accounts they did not want. All praise for index funds Buffett thanked index fund king Jack Bogle for saving billions of dollars for US investors. Bogle founded Vanguard Group, the largest US mutual fund firm, in 1974 and created the first index fund that allows investors to passively invest in the stock market by tracking a market index. Take on IBM Responding to a shareholder question on the Berkshire move to sell a large stake in IBM, an investment which had earlier surprised investors mainly because of Buffett’s stated aversion towards the technology sector, the ace investor said he was wrong on IBM. “We started buying IBM six years ago as we thought it would have performed better,” he said. Take on Apple To a pointed question on Apple, a stock on which Berkshire doubled its stake in first quarter, Buffett said he looks at Apple more as a consumer stock than a tech bet. Biggest regret Buffett said he regretted not investing early in Google. “Our biggest tech failure was missing Google. Walmart and Google were missed opportunities,” he said. On Ajit Jain This is Ajit Jain, who is creating more money for shareholders than Warren Buffett. “Nobody would possibly replace Ajit Jain if he were to leave or retire. But we have a terrific team. There are things which only he can do. A lot of things are institutionalised in business. Ajit Jain made more money for Berkshire than I have probably,” said Buffett. Bullish on aviation The legendary investor said the airlines industry would have some more pricing sensibility in next 10 years and he believed airlines would operate at higher degrees of capacity in the future. On automation Buffet said automation, driverless cars could hurt auto insurers. On Amazon & Jeff Bezos Buffett believes Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos is not only just an investor, but an incredible executor. On Q1 earnings Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday reported a 27 per cent fall in first quarter net profit, and said a loss from insurance underwriting contributed to operating results that fell short of forecasts.

In the past two years, social media platforms rolled out a range of products designed to hook publishers. Snapchat Discover, Facebook Instant Articles, Apple News, Twitter Moments, and Google AMP all provide a space to publish content directly within platforms. Publishers, which have been losing advertising dollars to companies like Google and Facebook for years, are adopting these tools in the hopes of reaching more readers and pulling in revenue. Yet much of the social media action around news publishing, touted as earnest effort and welcomed by publishers, is just a boxing match between social giants vying for users and attention. Can publishers win in a fight that isn’t really about them? The most public displays of aggression are between Facebook and Snapchat. Snapchat rejected Facebook’s $3 billion offer to buy the platform in 2013, and has now captured millions of the youngest social users — in other words, the future. In January 2016, rumours began that Snapchat planned to encroach on Facebook’s ad model, with an API allowing it to target ads to users at a huge scale. Within weeks, Facebook opened its Audience Optimization tool to publishers, allowing them to target stories at specific readers. This wasn’t explicitly in response to Snapchat, but the targeting capability, and the data behind it, were two things Snapchat didn’t yet have. Facebook struck again in August, revealing a Snapchat clone on Instagram called Stories. Now, 200 million people use Stories daily, while Snapchat has a total of 158 million daily users. So obvious was this copycat move that Snapchat swiped, releasing a filter on April Fool’s that framed a user’s face as an Instagram post. Facebook doubled down during its developer conference F8, where founder Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook’s aim “to make the camera the first mainstream augmented reality platform.” In other words, putting graphics and filters over camera photos and videos, the entirety of Snapchat’s strategy. Stratechery founder and media analyst Ben Thompson wrote that F8 revealed a Facebook that “shamelessly” embraced “the audacity of copying well.” ALSO READ: Facebook denies targeting insecure users Facebook isn’t only fighting Snapchat. In the ad space, its rival is Google. In February 2016, Google launched Accelerated Mobile Pages – a wordy name for a product similar to Facebook’s Instant Articles. Both offered fast-loading mobile pages to publishers willing to let the platforms host the content, and the clicks. The difference is that Facebook is more restrictive with the number and format of ads, while on AMP publishers can have as many ads as they want. As social media platforms find more ways to host content in their own walled gardens, this could be interpreted as a plea by Google to keep journalism on their turf: the open web. “Facebook passed Google as the top traffic driver back in 2015,” Thompson noted, “and as of last fall drove over 40 percent of traffic for the average news site.” Now, Google is creeping up; major US publishers get 7 percent of their traffic from AMP. Platforms are also competing over video. Last year, Facebook doubled down on live video, prioritising it in the News Feed and giving certain publishers a total of $50 million to create videos with their Live product. About a month later, Twitter signed a coveted NFL live streaming deal, one of many live video deals it would secure throughout the year, including with Bloomberg and Cheddar. Twitter’s lead didn’t last long: Amazon outbid Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube for this year’s NFL contract. Where does all of that leave publishers? Spending resources on this expanding arena and hoping the returns on investment outweigh the costs. Our interviews with more than 70 social media managers and strategists for the Tow Center for Digital Journalism’s “The Platform Press: How Silicon Valley Reengineered Journalism” found that expensive news distribution strategies aren’t yet yielding enough consistent revenue for publishers to justify the costs or to know whether their strategies are working. Some publishers feel they simply cannot opt out. According to Digital Content Next, publishers’ native strategies were yielding an average of $7.7 million each — disappointing, but not negligible — only two years in. Still, one head of social distribution from a broadcast news organisation, which are particularly affected by the platform emphasis on video, said in an interview, “We would have a real detrimental effect to our business overall if we were not playing on all these different platforms.” Many publishers noted the complexities of “how to optimise for competing platforms when what optimises to one platform goes against what would optimise for another one.” If two different platforms permit or optimise for different video lengths, two versions must be created. Also, translating user data provided from platform to platform is not “apples to apples.” And it is resource intensive to populate every platform with high-performing content; not every newsroom can afford to staff around platform products, so they have to move around the pieces they already have, which are often already spread thin. David Skok, a digital media executive who has worked for, among others, the Boston Globe and Toronto Star, told us, “I feel as if we are collateral damage in the war between these platforms. They’ll give some publishers a chance to play, but not others. They’ll give favourable rates and treatments to some and not to others. They are already picking winners.” Such preferential treatment includes the roughly two dozen coveted Snapchat Discover deals, or the Facebook Live subsidies for a select group of publishers. Some publishers may be able to leverage exclusive content in order to keep up with platforms’ shifting priorities as platforms compete for users. Organisations such as BuzzFeed, for example, or Time, Inc., which owns high-value brands like Sports Illustrated, Food + Wine, and Entertainment Weekly. ALSO READ: Facebook adding 3,000 people to screen out violent content Regina Buckley, senior vice president of Digital Business Development and Business Operations at Time Inc., sees platform competition as a good thing. “Over the past year or so, we have seen the various distribution platforms begin to compete for exclusive access to specific pieces of our content. This is a good thing for us because scarcity creates value, and value creates leverage for us as content creators,” she said. And leverage often means dollars. For publishers with a budget only for text and a small readership, the future looks grim. The platforms’ focus on exclusive and premium content is unlikely to change anytime soon. Facebook is laying the groundwork on the advertising side: The company in November began moving toward fewer ads on its platform, which is likely to drive up the price, and quality, of each ad. While large publishers are able to produce premium content against which they can place high-value ads, small publishers don’t have such capability. As long as platforms are chasing users, it is inevitable that some publishers, as Skok put it, will be “collateral damage.” -- Columbia Journalism Review The writer is a research fellow on the Platforms and Publishers project at Columbia Journalism School’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism.

According to data from Strategic Analytics on Sunday, LG shipped 7.3 million smartphones in the first quarter of the year, accounting for a fifth of the world’s biggest handset market.  The market share for LG rose nearly 3 percentage points from a year earlier. The gain follows steady sales of the company’s lower-price models, known as the K series and X series, as well as the previous premium V20 model, according to market observers. The newest G6 smartphone was not counted in first-quarter shipments, since the model was launched early April in the US market.  LG’s latest expansion in the US market has widened the market share gap from fourth player ZTE from China, which took 6.7 percent. Apple retained the top spot with a 34.5 percent share, up 2.3 percentage points from the same quarter last year. The iPhone vendor shipped out 12.6 million units in the first three months of the year, the data showed. Samsung Electronics came in second with 24.6 percent share, but the figure fell nearly 3 percentage points on-year, as it was affected by the recalled Galaxy Note 7 model and delayed launch of the latest Galaxy S8 model. The South Korean tech titan reported 9 million first-quarter shipments. “The V20 model in the US market enjoyed an unsolicited gain from the Galaxy Note 7 recall as American consumers became more sensitive about the safety of their handsets,” said a spokesperson at LG Electronics. LG’s premium V20 smartphone won the MIL-STE-810G certification, known as a US military standard for durability. With the newest flagship G6 smartphone, LG hopes to cement its current position in the American market. The company added a wireless charging feature to G6 devices selling in the US, tailoring to consumer needs there. “It’s been one month since the new model hit the US market, and so far we are hearing positive reactions,” said the LG official said. “Durability and safety will be the focus of US marketing for the G6 smartphone.” LG’s mobile communications business is on a path to restore profitability. The division reported 200 million won ($176,000) in operating losses in the first quarter, reducing drastically by nearly 200 billion won from a year earlier. “The company is forecast to reduce the loss from the smartphone business with the backing of global sales of the G6 smartphone,” said John Ko, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities.

Event Key is a new app that lets people from Roswell and Chaves County stay up to date on what’s going on in town. The app is free and is available for Android and Apple phones. (Submitted Image) There’s a new app in town. For those who aren’t as technologically up to date as they might be, “app” is short for application. An app is nothing more than what used to be called a program. One big difference between apps and programs is that often the software that runs the app is in the cloud, rather than on your machine, but that isn’t always the case. Enrique Moreno, local organizer and businessman, decided that the time had come for Roswell’s people to have one place to go to find out what’s going on in town. “They say there’s an app for everything,” Moreno said. “I found out that there really isn’t. So I decided to jump on this before somebody else did. I’ve had some people on Facebook calling me a dream crusher because they wanted to do an app like this.” Part of his motivation was that he needed help in his profession. “The event calendar helps me as an organizer,” he said. “People throw away flyers, but they won’t throw away their cellphones.” He said he tried to make the app as useful as possible to as many people as possible. “I went to Parks and Recreation Department and they sent me to the city,” Moreno said. “I spoke with them and they have a website where they list [auth] calendars. Parks and Rec has one, and the Civic Center. The city has one, too. I got permission to list their information as long as I don’t make a profit off of them.” He said he will draw clear lines where money is concerned. “I’m not profiting to list information,” he said. “You can download from iTunes and Google Play for free. The only charges for the app are business listings. Nonprofit events are listed free. For-profit events have a way to get listed for free, too, since we’re not trying to make a profit off of the listings. If they promote the app at their event or provide tickets that we can give away to the public, their listing is free.” Moreno said that the app has already made a difference and that he expects it to continue to grow. “If you have the app and you’re looking for something to do on the weekend, it’s right there,” he said. “We’re already using it to promote the next community yard sale. And we’ve had two people already sign up for the yard sale in September, so it’s already having an effect.” He is prepared to list anyone with an event to share, he said. “If anybody sends me a message, we’ll put their events on as long as they are family-friendly,” Moreno said. “The app is certified as ‘E’ for Everyone.” Moreno surprised himself with this project. “I never pictured myself starting an app,” he said. “I hired a company to write the code, to get the event calendar to work, so that you can save an event into your phone’s calendar so it can alert you the day of the event. I did the graphics myself, punched them in and they made it work. I have 24/7 support.” He said the cost was surprising. “It’s a pretty affordable service,” he said. “I’m wanting to see if anybody’s interested in the app process and wants to jump on board and work as a street team. There are a lot of good ideas out there that haven’t been found.” It’s been a growing experience for him. “I learned a lot of things while developing this app,” Moreno said. “Some apps are plug and play, like video games. You have somebody monitor them every so often to make sure there are no glitches. Event Key is not plug and play. I’m monitoring it every day to make sure it’s working as it’s supposed to. I’m reaching out to businesses. If a new event comes and someone doesn’t know about the app, I have to reach out to them and let them know it’s available.” There are two features that make Event Key particularly attractive, he said. “One of the features is if it’s a benefit-type event,” Moreno said, “a nonprofit, it has the ability to push an alert to anybody who has the app. One thing that hasn’t pushed yet but we will be pushing is, yard sales. The yard sale calendar has a feature where, at the bottom, it has a map button and you can use it to plan your route for going to yard sales.” He’s hoping to serve all of Chaves County. “I’m hoping that the people on the outskirts of Roswell, Hagerman and Dexter would download it,” he said, “and see what’s happening in the area, too.” While businesses do pay for advertisements, Moreno stresses that users never pay for any information. “Even though there are business listings,” he said, “this is a free app. All the contents are free to view. The only way this app will work is if people use it. We need people to download and use the app now. I’m not going to push advertising sales. I’m going to push downloads. User downloads are the main thing we’re wanting to push. I monitor it every day. Downloads are constantly going up.” He’s also using lower-tech ways to reach people. “I’m definitely still going old school,” Moreno said. “We’re doing flyers and banners at events. We’re going in person to events and pushing our app. We’ve got event collaborations to push the app and the events together.” Moreno is working to better optimize the app for search engines. “It’s a smaller app,” Moreno said, “being only local and not international, so it goes to the bottom of search engines. We’ll be focusing on Twitter and Instagram soon. Right now, we offer links for businesses that list to send us their Twitter link, so we can push it that way.” Android users can find Event Key on Google Play with a basic search for Event Key, but it requires some scrolling. The easiest way to find the app on iTunes is to Google “event key Roswell app iTunes.” Features reporter Curtis M. Michaels can be reached at 575-622-7710, ext. 205, or at reporter04@rdrnews.com.

LIKE   TWEET   SHARE   PIN   SHARE   POST MAIL MORE Posted May 7, 2017 at 3:49am by iClarified · 5697 views · Translate Apple is planning to make changes to the earpiece on the next generation iPhone, according to a new research note from JPMorgan. The iPhone 8 is said to feature an 'enhanced receiver' with 'further improvements' to stereo sound and waterproofing. With the launch of the iPhone 7, the earpiece (receiver) doubles as a speaker giving you stereo sound. Presumably, the new speaker in the iPhone 8 will be louder and could be sufficiently waterproof to meet the IP68 water resistance rating rumored for the new smartphone. JPMorgan also claims that the iPhone 8 could come with AirPods instead of EarPods; however, that's quite unlikely considering there is still a 6 month shipping estimate on the wireless earphones five months after their release. (Or pay a premium on Amazon) Notably, a separate JPMorgan analyst (Rod Hall, USA), claims that Apple could preview the iPhone 8 at WWDC in June. That also seems very unlikely; however, Apple could be looking to get ahead of leaks and prepare developers for a new OS and display size.

But that approach could come with its own risks. Ryan Brooks reports. Video Transcript In China's cutthroat smartphone market- -Apple's making a play to hitch sales onto services- -in everything from digital payment to online games. The move could be crucial money after maker the company posted a dip in first quarter iPhone sales - with revenue in China slipping as local rivals eat into the market. That strategy makes sense given China drove 50% of growth on the App Store last year. But as Reuters' Cate Cadell explains, the new focus comes with some local problems. SOUNDBITE (English) CATE CADELL, REUTERS, SAYING: "It comes with a lot of separate risks which aren't involved in hardware. So there's a lot of things that the Chinese government has been cracking down on in the last year, including livestreaming, including media, including games, and all of these things fit into Apple's new services ecosystem. We can expect that they're going to- come into conflict with regulators on the content side a lot more than compared to just selling straight hardware." As Beijing clamps down online on one side- Experts expect local brands to move aggressively into services, too... To compete, Apple really needs to nail its next iPhone model this fall. SOUNDBITE (English) CATE CADELL, REUTERS, SAYING: "Getting that next phone into the hands of consumers is really really important, not just for selling hardware and making money but for getting a bigger install base for getting more of these services and really bring people into their ecosystems so they can compete with people like WeChat, these large China players that are coming up and building their own ecosystems." In April last year, regulators forced Apple to pull its iBooks and movies from China just weeks after they went live. And the company's gaming apps have had setbacks with new rules that say foreign developers need local partners. Those are hurdles that local brands with cheaper phones won't always need to jump. Making it that much harder to convince Chinese buyers to stay inside that Apple's universe.

Company Summary NSE BSE Pfizer Loading data... ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES Over $2.6 trillion is held as untaxed cash in offshore accounts by top US companies like Apple, Google, IBM, Pfizer, Pepsi and Coke, McDonald's etc according to a report by the Washington-based Institute for Tax and Economic Policy (ITEP). This is the highest-ever hoard held offshore by American companies and represents a net tax loss of a staggering $767 billion for the US government. The $2.6 trillion untaxed funds are more than the combined GDP of 153 countries, four times the US defence budget, and slightly more than the total mandatory spending of $2.45 trillion on social security, food security, medicare and unemployment by the US government in 2015. The untaxed treasure hoard is more than India's GDP. According to Richard Phillips of ITEP, this information was dug out from 10-K filings, that is, annual reports filed by companies with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Of the 500 top companies in the US, 322 were found to have large offshore holdings. How is it possible for companies to keep their profits abroad and evade taxes? The answer lies in a well-exploited loophole in the US tax code, says Phillips. "The US tax code has a provision, known as deferral, which allows companies to pay no additional US taxes on their offshore earnings until that money is repatriated.When it is technically repatriated, the companies have to pay the full US tax rate, minus any foreign taxes they have already paid," he told TOI. Eyeing this cash, President Donald Trump has proposed an amnesty scheme under which companies can bring back their offshore wealth by paying a one-time 10% tax. The going rate for corporate taxes in US is 35% and, so, a huge concession is being offered. President George W Bush had granted a similar amnesty in 2004 with a onetime tax rate of 5.25% only. However, it was thought to be a failure with companies hoarding more cash abroad hoping for tax holidays. Phillips thinks the best policy to end this hoarding of cash would be to require companies to pay US tax immediately on their offshore earnings, rather than allowing them to defer these taxes as under current law. Without the incentive of tax avoidance, companies would simply stop hoarding their cash offshore, he said.

Bionic basil. The Open Agriculture Initiative, an MIT Media Lab project to apply technology to food production, revealed results last week from a series of experiments that yielded dramatically more flavoursome basil that can be achieved in normal growing conditions. The plants were grown in an environment where computers controlled an array of factors, from water and salinity levels to light exposure and heat. Each plant produced more than 3m data points that were fed into an artificial intelligence system developed by Sentient Technologies.

Club MacStoriesWeekly Extras MENU ABOUT PODCAST NEWSLETTER ADVERTISE SECTIONS APP REVIEWS IPAD DIARIES STORIES APPLE HISTORY IOS AUTOMATION GAMES Dispelling the Apple Services Myth Prizmo Go Review: Smarter OCR with the iPhone’s Camera App Camp for Girls is Coming to Chicago Phil Schiller on App Store Upgrade Pricing→ Linked By Federico Viticci Gadgets 360's Kunal Dua interviewed Apple's Phil Schiller last month and, among questions about voice-only assistants, he also asked about upgrade pricing on the App Store. Gadgets 360: With all the recent changes in the App Store, can developers expect to see upgrade pricing next? Phil Schiller: The reason we haven’t done it is that it's much more complex than people know, and that's okay, it's our job to think about complex problems, but the App Store has reached so many successful milestones without it because the business model makes sense to customers. And the upgrade model, which I know very well from my days of running many large software programmes, is a model from the shrink-wrapped software days that for some developers is still very important, for most, it’s not really a part of the future we are going. I think for many developers, subscription model is a better way to, go than try to come up with a list of features, and different pricing for upgrade, versus for new customers. I am not saying it doesn't have value for some developers but for most it doesn’t, so that's the challenge. And if you look at the App Store it would take a lot of engineering to do that and so would be at the expense of other features we can deliver. For example, the App Store has one price for an app, when you see it, you see if there's a price on it, that's the price. It doesn't have multiple prices for multiple tiers of customers so to engineer that in, it's not impossible, but a lot of work for a small segment of software that we hope for many of them, subscription pricing is a better model, the one where the customers are comfortable with. So we’ll keep talking to developers about what's most important on their list, we want them to keep telling is if that [upgrade pricing] is high on the list or not, and we’ll keep an open mind to it, but it's harder than people realise. Schiller's point makes sense – rather than retrofitting the App Store for old software pricing systems, Apple has found success with a new, simpler model. It's also true, however, that upgrade pricing has worked successfully for developers that have never sold "shrink-wrapped software" – companies that want to retain their most loyal customers without forcing them to sign up for a subscription. You don't need to sell software on physical discs for upgrade pricing to make sense. It'll be interesting to see how developers – especially on iOS and the iPad (if WWDC brings new incentives to the platform) – will continue to adapt and try different strategies. We've seen some signs of this over the past year, with The Omni Group shifting to In-App Purchases and productivity apps relying on subscriptions, and I hope Apple will add even more flexibility to these new models at WWDC.

The city’s annual Cannabis Parade rolled down Broadway on Saturday — with enthusiasts buzzing that the Big Apple should soon go to pot. Some 200 puffers assembled to march from 32nd Street to Union Square, where activists called for legalization and trumpeted the medical benefits of marijuana. Participants also danced to reggae music and rolled their own in plain sight. The NYPD officially frowns on any reefer madness. But the billowing clouds of acrid pot smoke from parade goers Saturday said otherwise. “They’re human beings. They’re enjoying themselves. That’s all that matters,” said one cop at the march who took the high road. “Thank you NYPD for letting us have our party!” crowed rally speaker Steve Bloom, who runs the marijuana-news website CelebStoner.com. More On: marijuana Disney World bans medical marijuana from Orlando parks De Blasio shows up late for Democratic candidates' forum WWE legend X-Pac arrested for having meth, pot in airport Smuggler tries to hide massive pot stash in casket Along the puffers parade route, participants chanted “Hey hey ho, high prohibition has got to go!” and waved posters reading “Enjoy the breeze, blow trees,” “Peace love and weed,” and “Cannabis therapy reduced opioid deaths.” Steven Phan, 27, owner of a weed-themed clothing line, smoked a blunt with his friends as he enjoyed the mellow afternoon. “I smoke because I enjoy the feeling. It helps me with my ADD. It slows me down, it helps me focus better,” Phan said. “I prefer to do that than take Aderol or another pill. All these different people, from all walks of life come together. We all have a common reason to be here, which is pot. It’s a beautiful thing.” High-rollers passed out “special” cookies and shared a pipe, while others donned weed-related wardrobe. Activist Todd Hinden donned his signature custom made suit emblazoned with marijuana leaves. Anne Armstrong, Reverend of the Healing Church of Rhode Island, anointed the flock with cannabis oils and blew into a horn to kick off the marijuana march. Armstrong said she puffs because it “makes me feel closer to God and more compassionate toward human beings.” One high-light: Several advocates carried a 52-foot-long inflatable joint along the parade route. March organizer Dana Beal said the parade is a tradition that dates back to the 1970s and New York should take its cue from other states where marijuana is now legal. “It’s legal in a lot of places, which means that there is more support for it. We want to replace alcohol and cigarettes with marijuana. It’s much safer. Nobody ever dies from pot. We haven’t seen how far we can go yet. We can go beyond Colorado.” Piped Beal, “There is a stereotype of marijuana smokers as stoners, as boneheads, nothing upstairs, but look at what people are like on alcohol.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under cannabis ,  manhattan ,  marijuana ,  parades Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Why schools and religion are proving to be a tricky mix Read Next Why schools and religion are proving to be a tricky mix Share Selection Trending Now on NYPost.com 37,755 ISIS widow now on a high-priority terrorist 'kill list' 28,064 Inside Barack's sex-filled relationships before Michelle 23,882 Columnist who defended NRA quits after being suspended 16,425 Model learns the hard way the internet is forever Columnists John Crudele De Blasio's war on cigarettes should focus on smugglers too Jennifer Gould Keil Joe Coffee opening up four new locations SEE ALL COLUMNISTS Now On How bad does Carmelo Anthony miss his family?

Here are five ways to cut down on iPhone data usage If you are running out of your mobile data limit each month, then here are five things you could do to keep your data plan in range. tech Updated: May 08, 2017 11:12 IST HT Correspondent Hindustan Times (Reuters file photo) Is your iPhone guzzling down data? Are you straining yourself to find out how to stop data leakage? Here are five things you can do to do stop more data usage on iPhones: a) Stop app updates on mobile data If your apps update automatically, make sure they do so only when you are on WiFi. Go to Settings > iTunes & App Stores and turn off Use Cellular Data. b) Stop app refresh in the background iOS apps can update in the background, grabbing new content as they sit idle so they can show you the latest news when you return to them. Go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh and you can turn this setting off completely or go the a la carte route from the list below and choose which apps update in the background. c) Wi-Fi Assist to be turned off Wi-Fi Assist is a great feature where your iPhone hands off a weak Wi-Fi signal to your cellular network to prevent pages from loading slowly or not at all as it clings to the last remnants of a Wi-Fi signal. If you sit on the edge of a Wi-Fi network at work, say, then your cellular network may be assisting more than you’d like and running up data charges. d) Stop iCloud Drive actions on mobile data If you use iCloud Drive to shuttle documents in and out of the cloud, those data transfers can add to your bill if they are done over a cellular connection. You can restrict iCloud Drive to Wi-Fi only by going to Settings > iCloud > iCloud Drive and scrolling to the bottom and turning off Use Cellular Data. e) Please download music and not stream them Streaming music or podcasts for long stretches when you are away from Wi-Fi can quickly add to your data usage. Most music and podcast apps (like Spotify and Apple Music) let you restrict streaming to Wi-Fi only, which will then force you into the habit of downloading playlists or podcasts before playing them instead of the easy route of simply streaming them. Let’s look at Apple Music and Apple’s Podcasts apps as examples. For Apple Music, go to Settings > Music. In the Streaming & Downloads section, you’ll see two settings if the first is enabled. The first, Use Cellular Data, lets you disable streaming via a cellular connection entirely. If that’s too drastic a measure for you, then you can leave that setting enabled and turn off High Quality on Cellular to stream songs at a lower bitrate when you aren’t on Wi-Fi. For the Podcasts app, go to Settings > Podcasts and turn off Cellular Data. You can also enable Only Download on Wi-Fi to prevent podcast downloads from adding to your data usage. tags Mobile Data iPhones how to save more mobile data iPhones mobile data ways to stop data leakages Is Your Couch Making You Cough?

My bag contains [my] make up kit, hand lotion and hand sanitizer aside from my other personal belongings like wallet and phone. Nothing beats clean hands! I guess a bag must basically contain things that are useful for our daily activities.  What electronic gadgets are you currently using? For my laptop I am using a Macbook and an iPhone for my phone. It’s a fact that Apple products have always have the good quality and more advanced.  What’s inside your closet? Mostly my dresses from different collections are the major stuff inside my closet. I like glamour office attires, which I can also wear for evening events. I am also into shoes and handbags which occupy the most space in my closet. What is your style of clothing? Talking about my style cannot be defined in one corner. We have to be flexible. For me, it depends on the weather and occasion. Living in Dubai you can see me with fit clothes during summer and you can see me with fur during winter and sportswear every morning as I hit the gym or if I am just at home spending my time painting and  when I am with my music,  I  just merely wear my rugged clothes. What clothing brands do you think closely fit your sense of fashion?  I don’t really have a clothing brand in particular, when I shop, I visit every store and find something that fits my body type. My principle is this: If it looks good on you, buy it! No matter what brand it is, as I shop depending on what makes me look good not just the hype.  That would help you boost confidence.  What is your favorite perfume?  Chloé Eu du Parfum, it has a fresh powdery floral scent which makes me feel happy and boost my self-esteem and femininity. What is your favorite brand of shoes?  I both like Louboutin and Valentino.  I invest in a pair of good quality shoes as those brands produce comfortable shoes, more durable and they last longer especially [since] I always love to wear heels so I need to have a good quality pair of shoes. Are you a shopaholic?  Yes, I was before to be honest, but when I started earning from my own sweat, I intended not to, but I treat myself once in a while. We all have to admit that buying something new (new car, new dress, new shoes, new bags) makes us feel great but it’s only passive. For as long as you are not spending beyond your budget, then that’s totally fine!  What inspires or influences you to buy an item? I normally buy stuff for my basic needs or replacing old items but if I see great deals on the stores, I don’t want to miss the opportunity!              What brands do you trust for your skin care? I use SK-II and Shiseido for my face. I am very careful when buying products for my skin especially since I have acne prone skin. That’s why these two brands stand out for me. I also use Nivea shower gel and Nivea Lotion ever since. What is a Branded Pinoy for you? Branded Pinoy for me is someone who has a positive outlook in life. Our brains are wired to find things we are looking for. If you are always cynical or waiting for things to go wrong, then your life will reflect that. On the other hand, having a positive outlook in life will bring you joy and provide you with inspiration when you least expect it.  Facebook Comments Website Comments free pron March 6th, 2017 Reply HL5bYg Pretty!

Required fields are marked * Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Name * Email * Website nine  −  seven  =  Keith Fitz-Gerald Peter Lynch achieved rock-star status in the 1980s when he ran the Fidelity Magellan Fund. So much so that an estimated one in 100 Americans invested at the time based on a very simple premise driving his work: "invest in what you know." It's a common-sense mantra that still resonates with millions of folks today who think they're going to get ahead of Wall Street by doing nothing more sophisticated than buying an "iconic brand" they've encountered in their lives. Problem is… being iconic isn't good enough in today's markets. Here's a list of three "iconic" stocks you do not want in your portfolio. The Roaring '80s Worked in the Roaring '80s… for a Reason Millions of investors took Mr. Lynch's common-sense advice to heart and went with what they "knew" – meaning they bought stocks based on personal experience and knowledge. Doing so made sense because the roaring '80s were just getting underway. In fact, I can vividly recall the moment they began. Dec. 12, 1980 – that's the day Apple Computer went public at $22 a share and 4.6 million shares were gobbled up in the largest stock offering since Ford Motor Co. went public 24 years earlier, in 1956. I can recall with equal clarity when the markets responded. Aug. 18, 1982 – that's the first time more than 100 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. A year later, the Dow blew by 1,000 and has never looked back. I remember these dates because that's when double-digit gains entered the minds of investors who were used to the single-digit returns of the 1970s, when you'd take profits and pack it in with only modest gains to show for your effort. Greed became an operative word for millions who suddenly viewed the markets as a source of instant "strike it rich" wealth rather than something that produces value over time – as was the case for generations before them. Movie characters like Gordon Gekko (the corporate raider Michael Douglas played so perfectly in 1987's smash hit, "Wall Street") didn't help. They made conspicuous consumption acceptable and something to aspire to. If you weren't living it up, then you weren't living… or so went the thinking. It was entirely logical that Lynch's advice (misinterpreted though it was, which I'll get to in a minute) became so popular against this back drop. Today's parallels are striking. We've got the Kardashians, Paris Hilton, bling-laden rappers, and the Rich Kids of Instagram just to name a few – all of whom ply their trade on social media in front of hundreds of millions who want to "live the dream" at a time when the dream seems exceptionally limited. Fast cars, champagne, jewelry – anything you can buy takes on new importance if it's worn or even shown on social media these days. For example, Kanye West's Adidas "Yeezy Boost 750s" sold out in minutes… seconds, according to some accounts. Millennials consider Victoria's Secret and Nike Inc. (NYSE: NKE) to be top brands. Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. (NYSE: KORS), DSW Inc. (NYSE: DSW), and Coach Inc. (NYSE: COH) aren't far behind. Each of these companies produces iconic goods – shoes, bags, clothes – that have become a status symbol. It's led many people to once again make investment decisions based on "going with what they know" – simply because they have experience shopping in a particular store, have a familiarity with certain products, or have seen celebrities wearing them on social media, TV, magazines… you name it. The situation reminds me of a mosquito drawn to a porch light on a hot summer night. Most are gonna get zapped. Big retail brands like the ones I just mentioned are particularly risky right now.  Trapped in the past, unable to adapt, or simply unable to compete with Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN), they're going to clobber millions of unsuspecting investors who have overestimated their prospects. Starting with these three portfolio-killers. Harley-Davidson Inc. (NYSE: HOG) Harley-Davidson Inc. (NYSE: HOG) has let the pursuit of shareholder value stifle innovation, kill the rebel role model that customers value, and commoditize its motorcycles. Back in 2002, riders would pay a 38% premium over similarly equipped Japanese offerings, according to Forbes. Now it's the other way around.  Value-oriented customers are moving on to less expensive Japanese bikes with better technology, better service, and better quality. Harley's most recent earnings report was abysmal. Shipments fell 14.7% in the first quarter compared to last year. That's not surprising considering that U.S. retail motorcycle sales fell 5.7%; international sales fell 1.8%, with a 9% drop in the previously hot Asia Pacific region. Harley's dealer level inventory is so high that they will have to hold back new model production. It's no surprise to me that the company predicted that this year's shipments will be flat. Then there's the resurrected Indian – America's first motorcycle company, founded in 1901. Harley execs laughed that yet another company would try "yet again" to bring back Indian – something many have tried and failed to do over the years – and that it would be a viable competitor. Yet, since launching, Indian's revenue has increased 47%, while Harley's has fallen 2%. At this rate, Polaris Industries Inc. (NYSE: PII),which makes Indian, will sell more motorcycles than Harley in less than three years. Anecdotally, my wife and I see more Harleys broken down on the side of the road when we're out riding than any other motorcycle brand I encounter. Just sayin'… Sears Holding Corp. (Nasdaq: SHLD) I think there's a good argument to be made that Sears Holding Corp. (Nasdaq: SHLD) CEO Eddie Lampert has fleeced the investing public the way movie villain Gordon Gekko did, only this time around greed is not good. Things are so bad that management actually issued a statement on March 22, 2017, saying that "Our historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company's ability to continue as a going concern." In my best Valley Girl voice – an ode to another 1980s cultural icon – "no duh!" Sears hasn't turned a profit since 2010. Last year was particularly bad, with net income falling 96.72% before winding up a $2.2 billion loss. That's an astounding number considering the company's entire market cap is just $1.46 billion. Optimistic investors convinced the company had some redeeming value used to talk about how Sears was a real estate play in disguise. Evidently they didn't get the memo that up to 50% of American shopping malls are at risk of going dark or being used for non-retail purposes within a decade. The share price has fallen 91% since 2006. To put that in context, the stock will have to appreciate a staggering 1,100% from current levels just to break even. Like that's going to happen at a time when it's Amazon versus everybody else?! International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) This one surprises a lot of investors, but none more so than older folks who remember International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) at the pinnacle of its success when its name was synonymous with technological innovation. It's a position that management understands well, which is why they're doing everything they can to maintain the illusion. Chances are you've seen those clever "Watson" commercials just like I have. But, as I noted on FOX Business Network last Monday, IBM's had 20 consecutive quarters of year-over- year revenue declines. You don't need to work at NASA to know this is a disaster. IBM is a portfolio-killer in the making. From 2013 to 2016, Big Blue has seen revenue slide from $98.36 billion (in 2013) to $79.9 billion (in 2016). Legacy consulting contracts don't do much for new growth, especially when they've sold off much of the core technology business that got IBM where it is today… or was yesterday. Cutting costs has been the order of the day for years, but the market doesn't buy it and you shouldn't either, pun absolutely intended. Share prices have dropped more than 24% in the past four years. By comparison, Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL), the tech-heavy Nasdaq, and S&P 500 have gained 124.7%, 82.1%, and 51% over the same time, respectively. In closing, I want to return to Lynch for a minute. He's emphatic that he never said "buy what you know" and that his advice has been misinterpreted over the years. I agree. Which is why I urge you to reread what he actually did say in his bestselling 1989 book, "One Up On Wall Street" – and I'm paraphrasing here… …know the company (you want to buy) as a business. For us, that means three things when it comes to investments capable of producing terrific profits in today's markets: Knowing which Unstoppable Trends power it… and steering clear if there are none Identifying must-have products and services" with the power to cut through unpredictable economic cycles and market events… and steering clear if the company produces easily substituted "nice to haves" Using risk management consistently to protect your profits and your capital… or risking financial disaster when there's a panic-inducing hiccup I'll be with you every step of the way. Must See: What do billionaires Peter Lynch, President Trump, and a retired cop from Northridge have in common? They've all benefited enormously from a curious Great Depression-era "program." And even though most have no idea this exists, it could be worth $68,870 or more to the average American.

Zones is not only a better alternative, it also packs in features Apple's option should have. As you'd expect, Zones lets you add a bunch of different time zones so you can easily glance at the current time anywhere in the world. Better still, you can change the time in any of those time zones to see what time it'd be elsewhere. For example, you can set Tokyo to 2pm on May 11 to see what time that would be in London, New York and Sydney. There's even a Today Widget so you can access all those times right on your lock screen. The app is free out of the gate for four time zones, but you can pay an in-app purchase to unlock new themes and an unlimited number of time zones on the screen at once.

(Matt Katz / WNYC) i Apr 20, 2017 · by Matt Katz One of the myriad tour groups winding its way through Manhattan this week is not made up of your typical camera-toting, wide-eyed tourists from the Midwest. Instead, these moms, dads and babies (including a 20-day-old boy) are Syrian refugees who fled civil war and resettled in recent months in Elizabeth, NJ. Groups of them are arriving each morning in Manhattan to learn about everything from Madison Square Garden ("where one of the most famous Muslim athletes had many of his events...Mohammed Ali") to the Empire State Building ("when it was built, it was the tallest building in the world").  Some of the 150 Syrians taking part in the tours spent years stuck in Jordan. Now, they're blending into the Big Apple panoramic — passing street musicians and the homeless, a model doing a photoshoot and someone smoking marijuana. Yet all Mohammed Abdul-Aziz, 10, was focused on was how big the buildings were. "Oh my gosh, so big!" Mohammed said he liked everything about New York. "Everything big," he said. "And New York is very nice. Me happy." The whole group gathered for a picture before boarding their first subway ride. Tour guide Luke Miller shows Mohammed Abdul-Aziz the photo. Matt Katz (WNYC) Luke Miller of Real New York Tours is offering the tours for free because he said he felt helpless as the refugee crisis unfolded. "And then it kind of occurred to me: Let's do what we do every day," he said. "Let's welcome people to New York. That’s what we do best." Miller reached out to the Muslim humanitarian organization ICNA Relief, which connected him to the Syrians and provided volunteer translators for the tours.  Mohammed’s dad, Shaker Abdul-Aziz, brought his six children. He owned a supermarket back in Syria, and dreams of having one here in the U.S. "I been here 10 months," he said. "I am very happy in America." Donors paid for the refugees' train fare into the city, MetroCards and their lunch of New York pizza. The tours go all the way to Battery Park City, with a view of the Statue of Liberty. But along the way there are several firsts, including a subway ride to Central Park. The Syrian refugees wait on the platform for their first trip on the subway. Matt Katz (WNYC) The kids loved the big rock in Central Park. Matt Katz (WNYC) The children ran through the park to the carousel. They didn't notice a small sign at the entrance that read: Trump Carousel. Waiting to get on the Trump Carousel. Matt Katz (WNYC) President Trump's company operates the facility. Miller called the fact that a group of giddy Syrians were now riding Trump’s horses "divine justice." "This is perfect," he said.
LG Secures 20% Share of U.S. Smartphone Market By Shin Dong-heun Facebook 0 Twitter 0 E-mail More Google+ LinkedIn KakaoStory May 08, 2017 13:05 LG said Sunday that its share of the U.S. smartphone market soared to 20 percent in the first quarter, up 2.9 percentage points from the same period last year, with sales of 7.3 million units. This is the first time that LG's share exceeded 20 percent there. The Korean electronics maker beat China's ZTE to rank third after Apple (34.5 percent) and Samsung (24.6 percent). LG's North American market share including Canada also reached a record 19.6 percent. An LG staffer said, "Sales remained strong for our V20 premium smartphone released in the second half of last year, while more affordable models like the K8, K10, X Screen and X Cam series were also good." That resulted in overall sales rising by more than 800,000 over the first quarter of last year. The U.S. market is smaller than China but seen as the prime battleground for premium phones. LG's smartphone revenues in the first quarter totaled W3.1 trillion, up 3.7 percent from the previous quarter thanks to strong U.S. sales, according to analysts (US$1=W1,134). Sales of LG's premium G6 smartphone were not included in the latest results because it was only released in the North American market in April. An LG spokesman said, "The fact that sale rose in the first quarter, when we didn't release any new models, shows that our fundamentals have improved, so our market share will rise even further in the second quarter, when G6 sales are reflected."  Copyright © Chosunilbo & Chosun.com Previous Next All Headlines Back to Top

Jerick Ternida: A health-conscious model Jamie Marie Elona October 6, 2016 2:41 pm Branded PinoyLIFESTYLE 2.4K 0 Age: 45 Height: 5’5” Current Location: Abu Dhabi Philippine Hometown: Taytay, Rizal Hobbies:  Going to the gym, playing Basketball, singing, and watching movies Job: Personal Trainer at City Gym Meet our Branded Pinoy this week, Jerick. He started joining bodybuilding competitions in 1994 like Mr. Philippines and Musclemania World Championship. He won a number of times from the contests. He was the over-all winner in the “Muscleman Universe 2008” held in Miami, Florida, USA. Jerick is currently focusing in coaching since he retired in 2012. What’s inside your bag? I carry my needs inside my bag like my food and vitamin supplements on a daily basis. I also bring my daily important stuffs such as towels, toothbrush, sunglasses, extra shirt, keys, power bank, workout suits and baking soda. Baking Soda has so many uses like alternative for soap and also serves as natural deodorant. What electronic gadgets are you currently using? I am a big fan of Apple. I use iPhone 5S because I prefer a phone with a smaller screen size.  It is comfortable to use and easy to place on my pocket. I intentionally did not upgrade my phone for the mentioned reason. When I go for workout, I like to use my Dr. Dre Beat headphone that helps me feeling good during my workout. For my camera, I am using Canon DSL Camera. What’s inside your closet? I place all my important stuff inside my closet from T-shirts, top tank, shorts, jogging pants, jackets and other personal stuffs. I do have also my formal and casual collections. I bought a vault to keep my important documents like my passport What is your style of clothing? Being a trainer in the gym, I like wearing shorts, top tank, T-Shirts, sports shoes and it also depends on the weather. During winter season, I like to wear formal coat and a jacket especially when I go for strolling. What clothing brands do you think closely fit your sense of fashion? A brand for me has no significant preference when it comes to purchasing clothes. For me, the comfort and the genuine design are the factors I consider in buying clothes. Most of my outfit are from Nike, Billabong and EFS. What is your favorite perfume? It is very seldom that I wear a perfume not unless during special occasion. I have several collections from Dior Sauvage, Giorgio Armani and Hugo. I believe in the carcinogenic effect of the perfumes in our body that’s why I try to limit using it. What is your favorite brand of shoes? My favorite NBA player is Lebron James that’s why I am collecting some pair of shoes from Nike Lebron 12 and I am planning to purchase the Lebron 13 White. For some casual wears, I like the collections from Adidas. Since I am  New Wave baby, I like the Dr. Martens Boots and Creepers shoes by Underground UK. Are you a shopaholic? No. I only purchase an item if it’s necessary and could really pleases me to decide to buy it. That’s why I always keep my favorite quote in my mind “Buy what you need, not what you want”. During weekends when I get bored, I usually go out and visit health stores to explore what are the new offers for vitamins and body building supplements. I like to go out with my family to visit some restaurants as well.  We need to be always practical for us to reach our financial goals. What inspires or influences you to buy an item? Personally, my choice in buying something and availing services is largely affected by the celebrity endorsers from different fields. It has a big impact and influence to consumers. One important factor I consider is the advocacy for a certain product or brand where they get involve like in helping Charitable institutions. What brands do you trust for your skin care? When it comes to skin care, the natural is much better. I like to apply organic and natural products to my skin like apple cider vinegar, avocado, raw honey and baking soda. It is the best way to maintain a healthy skin and get rid of those toxic chemicals which some beauty products are using. What is a Branded Pinoy for you?

It’s expected to begin work later this year and roll out compact Sedans and SUVs by July 2019. A few days later, the State Cabinet finally finalised a Singapore Consortium as the master developer of the startup area in the Amaravati capital region, albeit under the controversial Swiss Challenge method - terms heavily skewed in favour of the foreign companies. And on Saturday, Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, who is on a week-long tour of the US, met Apple Inc COO Jeff  Williams and pitched Andhra Pradesh as the iPhone maker’s best bet to make in India. Will iPhones made in Andhra be a reality then? It’s too early to trumpet, Naidu himself had cautioned journalists, citing competition from other States such as Maharashtra. Apple had sought duty exemption on manufacturing and repair units, components, and capital equipment for smartphones for 15 years to set up a manufacturing facility in India. With the GST set to kick in from July 1, the Centre rejected its request, pointing out that the GST Council will have to take a call on it. It appears talks are still going on between the tech giant and the Centre and Union Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Nirmala Sitharaman too has confirmed Apple’s plans for selective introduction of manufacturing lines in India this year. Chandrababu Naidu, the consummate marketing professional that he is, smells an opportunity when there is one from a distance. If he manages to rope in Tim Cook, iPhone made in Andhra could be the brightest feather in his cap. A few weeks from now, his government will be completing three years in office, which effectively means he has just one-and-a-half years to seek public mandate again, if one discounts the last six  for poll campaign, to carry forward his Baahubalisque vision for the State. Acutely aware of the reality, Naidu, however, seems in no mood to compromise on his magnum opus - the capital project. He has made it clear that he would wait for as long as necessary for that perfect design to give his consent. With Amaravati still in conceptual stage, the TDP chief is banking on his marketing skills to lay the ground work for turning the State into a manufacturing hub and showcase the same at the hustings in 2019 along with his son and IT Minister Lokesh. Recently inducted into the Cabinet, Junior, unused to the rough and tumble of politics, has already become the favourite whipping boy of the main Opposition YSRC which seems keen on painting him as the Rahul Gandhi of Andhra politics. Branded ‘Pappu’ on the social media, Lokesh has been quickly drawn into the slippery slope of the twitterverse and the government’s knee-jerk reaction of raiding the YSRC’s IT wing and the farcical detention of a satirist haven’t helped him one bit. Thankfully, he has since decided to turn a bind eye to tweet pricks. Having dropped out of the US trip, he stayed put at the Secretariat following his dad’s instructions to a t unlike the rest of the ministers and officials who decided to make the most of Naidu’s absence. Brahmani, his wife, complained her husband has stopped texting her after becoming a minister. He is expected to get further busy and emerge as his father’s chief lieutenant at the TDP’s three-day annual conclave, Mahanadu, to be held in Visakhapatnam from May 27. Time is of essence for him and the TDP to get their act together since not just the Opposition but also ally, BJP, has plans. Just a couple of days before Mahanadu, BJP’s master strategist and president Amit Shah will arrive in Guntur to impart booth-level management gyan to his State cadre and a couple of weeks later, he will fly to Visakhapatnam along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other party leaders for the national executive meeting. The saffron leaders will be discussing their AP vision, among other things, much to the discomfort of the Naidus. The self-proclaimed CM-in-waiting YS Jagan Mohan Reddy too will bring the battle to the TDP’s camp when he will hold his party’s plenary in Vijayawada next month. Last but not the least, actor-cum-politician and Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan is already at it, conducting tests and interviews to recruit his sainiks for the big battle ahead. The TDP’s enemy and the frenemy, both, are picking on issues such as the chilli farmers’ protest at the drastic fall in prices as and when they come while the TDP is focused on the big picture. Which one matters in the end is anybody’s guess. iPhone is beautiful but it’s Redmi that most buy. Therein hangs a tale, between aspiration and affordability.

Just this quarter, market leader Apple losing 13 percent of its unit shipments from last year. Sure, the company was able to proudly tout higher returns this quarter thanks to its pricey iPad Pro line, but the competition may have been able to make up the difference in margins with growing sales figures… if they actually grew. Research firm IDC reported that Samsung and Lenovo unit shipments were down by single-digit percentages. Huawei was the only one in the top five shippers to mark positive growth and with a big boost to boot. Amazon and Lenovo are best poised for sustained strength, if not further growth — the former has an aggressive pricing strategy while the latter is opening up supply channels. Here’s the number sheet for the first quarter. OEM 1Q17 Unit Shipments (millions) Change from 1Q16 1Q17 Market Share Apple 8.9 -13% 24.6% Samsung 6.0 -1.1% 16.5% Huawei 2.7 31.7% 7.4% Amazon.com 2.2 -1.8% 6% Lenovo 2.1 -3.8% 5.7% Others 14.4 -14.7% 39.8% Total 36.2 -8.5% 100% Apple’s losing quarter is its 13th in a row as tracked by IDC.

It's super easy to use your phone to pay for goods at the store using Samsung Pay, Apple Pay and Android Pay, here's how to get set up.More Every morning I wake up, drive to Dunkin' Donuts and tap my phone to buy a large iced coffee. There's something fun about that experience. I don't have to reach for my wallet and search for cash or pull out a debit card. I just lean over the debit card reader at the coffee shop, tap my phone, and go on with my life. You need a phone that supports this functionality to partake in the fun, but most devices sold over the past couple of years work in that fashion. Three primary options are available: Android Pay for most Android smartphones, Samsung Pay for Samsung smartphones and Apple Pay for iPhones. Here's how to get started with each one. Android Pay Android Pay hasn't grabbed headlines like it did when it first launched, but it's still a very viable option on most Android smartphones. It's your best bet if you have an Android phone but it isn't a Samsung device with Samsung Pay. Download Android Pay from the Google Play App Store. Open the app and tap "Add Credit or Debit card." You can choose cards already associated with your Google Account or add a new one. Agree to the terms and conditions that pop up. Then verify your card via email (you'll receive a number to enter into the app) That's it! Now, the next time you see a card reader with the Android Pay logo, just open the app, choose your card, and tap to pay. Samsung Pay Samsung Pay is my favorite of mobile payment options because it's able to work with more checkout terminals. In fact, it even works on older machines that only have magnetic stripe readers, thanks to technology from Samsung's acquisition of a company named LoopPay. Here's how to set it up. Open up Samsung Pay, which should be pre-installed on your Samsung smartphone. (If for some reason you don't have it, get it here.) If you're prompted to sign in, use your Samsung account credentials or create an account. This is where you'll also create a PIN for accessing your cards before payment. Tap credit/debit cards and then tap "Add." Use the camera viewfinder to center your credit card. This allows your phone to capture the card number, expiration date and your name. You can also enter this in manually. Next add in the verification code. You'll need to confirm your card with a code sent to you via email or text message from your bank. Enter this in. Now you're ready to go. Samsung lets you swipe up from the bottom of the home screen to easily access your cards when you're ready to pay, and you'll verify your identity with a pre-set pin code or your irises (if you have a newer Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8+ smartphone. Samsung Pay is even offering a temporary promotion for a free $20 gift card for registering your first card, which you can use anywhere Samsung Pay is accepted. Apple Pay You might already have Apple Pay set up without knowing it. Apple's iPhone asks if you want to get started while you're initiating your phone for the first time, and Apple Pay can be used in the App Store or for mobile payments. If you're not sure, open up the Apple Wallet application, which is pre-installed on your phone. If you don't see any credit cards under the Pay icon, tap the + button at the top-right of the screen to add one. If you don't have Touch ID setup yet, you'll be walked through registering your fingerprints. Next, use the camera viewfinder to scan in your card. Just center it in the frame and Apple Pay will grab all of the details, or you can enter them manually. Like with the other payment options, you'll need to verify your card using a text message or email code sent to you from your bank. Enter that and you're all set. To use Apple Pay while your phone is locked, just double tap the home button. It'll bring up your favorite debit or credit card, or you can select others at the bottom of the screen. Hold your finger to Touch ID as you tap the phone on an Apple Pay-approved reader (just look for the sticker. That's it! Welcome to the future.

Home Apple News Apple Rumors iPhone iPad iPod Mac Apple TV Apple Watch About iOS 10 iPhone Tips & Tricks Share on Facebook 4 tips for recording more professional videos on your iPhone When Steve Jobs introduced the first iPhone, he described it as a telephone and an Internet communicator. Curiously, that original iPhone that revolutionised everything, had a camera but did not offer the possibility of recording videos. 10 years later, the iPhone has evolved a lot since then. In fact, it has become one more camera for many users … and is that the best camera for a real photographer will always be the one you carry with you.   Apple makes recording videos with the iPhone really easy, but that does not mean that you can not improve the results … Today we will share with you some tips to make the videos on your iPhone are much more professional.   Contents 1. Storage 2. Light 3. Stabilizer 4. iMovie 1. Storage Before you begin, keep in mind that storage on the iPhone is limited. If you have a 16GB, 32GB or even 64GB device we recommend using different services to store your best videos: ICloud Dropbox PC / Mac External hard drive   2. Light   An iPhone records great videos with good lighting, but if the stage does not have much lighting it will need a little help. If there is a lot of light behind what you want to record, you will see a very dim silhouette. If you want to improve the exposure, press with a finger on the screen before recording your video and slide the brightness bar to focus and brighten your lens better. 3. Stabilizer   You have to have a lot of pulses when recording a good video if you do not want the video to show too much movement you can enable the stabiliser function of your iPhone. Still, the results will never be perfect. One technique recommended by many photographers is to hold their breath, and if the video is very long you can try to breathe very gently at short intervals. 4. iMovie   Finally, once you’ve recorded your video, you’ll be doing a few tweaks with Apple’s iMovie video editing application. It’s one of the fastest and most efficient ways to improve the look of videos, but you can always move the file to the PC / Mac for even more professional results … But it takes a lot more time.

It indicated a tattletale nearby, a secret spilled to Mom, and somebody about to be in trouble. Whatever. Annoying as it was, “I’m telling” never hurt much more than your pride then. Today, as in the new book Scores by Michael D. Blutrich, serious snitching could get a guy killed. How does it happen that a gay man would own a mainstream strip club? It was, says Michael Blutrich, a long story that started after he opened his law firm and, in search of an investment, purchased an L.A. nightclub. Believing that the success of his California business could transfer to New York, he recalled the excitement of a private banker who claimed he’d always wanted to own an upscale strip club. Being a closeted gay man, that wasn’t exactly Blutrich’s dream but the idea niggled at his brain. Partnering with the banker and others, they began looking for a building and batting ideas around. Scores was born, with a planned opening on Halloween night, 1991. “And then the mafia arrived.” In order to operate, the partners were told, they would need “protection,” which would involve some of New York’s biggest mafia families in a sort of symbiotic relationship, plus a grand-a-week kickback. It would also involve skirting Big Apple laws for as long as possible, because Scores would be the city’s “first and most notorious upscale gentlemen’s club” and there were rules against what a customer would find inside those Upper East Side doors. Because of the novelty and the entertainment it offered, Scores was successful – more successful than Blutrich had ever thought. He rode a wave that made him a rich and semi-famous man – at least, until the FBI caught up with him and made him an offer he couldn’t refuse… And, of course, that’s far from the end of the tale. What’s left to say about “Scores” involves rompishness, humor, surprisingly heart-pounding chapters, a little Goodfellas, a little Boogie Nights, and quite a bit of fun. That last appeal comes in the form of overgrown tales, courtesy of author Michael D. Blutrich’s memories of what happened inside his gentlemen’s club every evening for nearly five years. Readers who remember the most infamous discos of the 70s will find something familiar in that, updated to the 1990s but no less outrageous. But this book isn’t all party: Blutrich delightfully drops names, including many you’ll recognize, but he’s deadly serious when he switches his tale from wild to wired, from dancing to danger. Indeed, though you know the risk has largely passed – he wrote a book, after all, right? – the whole of the story is one you’ve got to read. There’s an amazingly small amount of profanity and prurience inside this book; it’s there, but not as much as you’d think there’d be, given the subject matter. That restraint uniquely serves to enhance this book, and heightens the story’s value. And that makes “Scores” a book you’ll want to tell everyone about. BOOK REVIEW Scores by Michael D.

More than 30,000 people are expected to attend the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting where Buffett and his Vice Chairman Charlie Munger preside over a Q&A session. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik) Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint OMAHA – Listening to Warren Buffett never gets old to the tens of thousands of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders who filled an arena this weekend to listen to the billionaire investor at the company’s annual meeting. More than 30,000 people came to Omaha to hear Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger talk. The 86-year-old chief executive and his 93-year-old partner have been leading the conglomerate for more than five decades, but the crowd is always listening for new tidbits of wisdom. Buffett is known for his candor and plain speaking. Berkshire’s top two executives acknowledged Saturday that they missed out on investing in Google years ago, but they expressed pride in the company they built through acquisitions and said they believe it will thrive for decades to come. “In retrospect, I think we were smart enough to figure out Google early, and we didn’t,” Munger said. Buffett and Munger have avoided technology investments for most of their careers because they said it was too hard to figure out which companies would win. Berkshire does now own 133 million Apple shares, but it just sold off one-third of its 81 million IBM shares because Buffett misjudged that firm. He had harsh words for Wells Fargo’s managers who failed to respond promptly to the sales practices scandal that cost former CEO John Stumpf his job last year. The bank said last fall that its employees opened up 2 million bank accounts without customer approval to meet unrealistic sales goals. Nati Harnik &#x2022; Associated Press More than 30,000 Berkshire Hathaway shareholders were in Omaha this weekend for the company’s annual meeting to hear CEO Warren Buffett — even people with just one share of stock. “The main problem was they didn’t act when they learned about it,” Buffett said. Berkshire is Wells Fargo’s biggest shareholder. Buffett said he still believes in the bank’s long-term prospects even though Wells Fargo ­mishandled the scandal. Several questions homed in on politics, and Buffett, a Democrat with close ties to former President Barack Obama, offered measured criticism of President Donald Trump’s policies. He argued that the American Health Care Act, which passed the House last week, amounted to “a huge tax cut for guys like me.” He also said rising health care costs, rather than high taxes, are the biggest drag on U.S. businesses. “Medical costs are the tapeworm of American economic competitiveness,” he said. Buffett said there’s no change in Berkshire’s plan to eventually replace him. He said one of the most important qualities his successor will need is a talent for wisely investing Berkshire’s cash. “We need a money mind as CEO,” said Buffett, who has no plans to retire. Dozens of companies Berkshire owns set up booths in an adjoining 200,000-square-foot exhibit hall to sell their products and take questions about their businesses. But Buffett is the celebrity that everyone wants to get close. When Buffett toured the exhibit hall, he was surrounded by a pack of reporters, shareholders and security officers. While Buffett met Mr. Peanut at the Kraft Heinz booth, Miami Dolphin Ndamukong Suh wandered a few feet away without a crowd.   The New York Times contributed to this report View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

There’s the typical stock of pre-order bullshit, but these stories span ridiculous levels of rudeness. Note: these stories aren’t entirely emblematic of the stores mentioned. Though, for any managers or retail movers and shakers who might be reading this, it’s worth noting the consistent complaints against pre-order pushiness, sneak subscription enrollments, pre-orders oddly not being honored, and mismanagement of used games. I’ll be making a call soon for the more pleasant side of the brick and mortar experience, too. Hang tight. But, for now… Whoops, That Was Actually Porn (via J) About twelve years ago or so, I had my dad drive me to Best Buy so I could pick up the newly released X-Men Legends. I was a huge comic fan, and the game looked pretty good so I was pretty stoked. When we got home the first thing I did was to pop that baby into my PS2 and start playing. But something was amiss. When it started playing, it wasn’t a video game. It was some B movie called Palm Springs or something. Ended up being a cheap softcore porn. I ejected the disc (no pun intended) to see if there was some sort of mix-up, but it had the X-Men Legends cover and everything on the CD. So I had my dad drive me back to Best Buy (it was a 30 min drive, and he was already mad cause he hated video games) and did a simple exchange with the Customer Service Personnel. I even explained the issue with them before they gave me a new unopened copy. Fast forward another 30 min drive home and I get the SAME thing!! It was that stupid movie again with the wrong cover on the disc! It took no short amount of pleading and begging for my dad to drive me back over to the store. I was pretty upset at this point because I really wanted to play that game, and my dad was super angry with me. I asked for the manager of the store, and proceeded to explain the situation. He looked at me like I was an idiot kid! He told me that games usually start off with a short cinematic before they go to the main menu. I played games all damned day, I knew what a cinematic was!! I begged him to just pop it into their demo PS2 or even into a damned DVD player, but he refused. He began to get quite angry with me and tell me off for wasting his time. He then proceeded to disappear into the back of the store, leaving me standing there for a half hour. I finally figured out he wasn’t coming back, and just asked the original person helping me to just refund me my damned money. I left Best Buy with my refund in pocket, and a chip on my shoulder. They treated me like an idiot, and refused to listen to a damned thing I said. I eventually went to Gamestop a few weeks later and picked up a genuine copy there. Never did hear anything on the news about a bunch of PS2 game discs being mixed up with porn movies. And I refuse to step foot into Best Buy to this day. You Must Be Poor (via blueblip) I had a bizarre experience when visiting a GameStop once, all the way back in 2005. It started off, oddly enough, as a misguided attempt to be helpful, but descended into unintentional condescension and now serves a cautionary tale as to why one shouldn’t rely on stereotypes to judge other people. It was around a month or so after Jade Empire had been released, and I was visiting my brother who lived in Chicago at the time (I was attending university nearby). Seeing as I’m a Bioware boy, I decided to check out the nearest GameStop to see if they had a copy. I walk into the store, and it was empty save for me and a very average looking, 20-something year old guy behind the counter. He was reading something, and glanced up at me when I entered. Things started off pleasantly enough. We both greet each other warmly, and I ask him if he’s got a copy of Jade Empire. They do, but since neither of us seemed to be in a hurry, we just started chatting. Halfway through our conversation, the guy then asks me where I am from (perfectly normal; I’m from India). I told him so, and then he asks, “No no. Where in the States are you from?” Again, nothing unusual. I’ve always spoken English without much of an accent of any kind, and many people in the US simply assumed I was born and brought up there because of that. So I tell our shopkeep that no, I’m really really from India. “Really? Oh wow! Did you go to school on an elephant?” Now THIS was a most abnormal question, and it took me completely by surprise. I thought I must have heard him wrong. “I’m sorry, but could you repeat that?” “Did you used to go to school on an elephant?” I started laughing. It was an instinctive reaction to such an absurd question. And by laughing, I mean I doubled over, clutching my stomach, gasping for breath kind of laughing. My reaction must have hurt the feelings of the counter guy, because he had this puzzled yet injured look on his face. So when I was able to control my emotions, I explained that no, I didn’t go to school on elephant, and that no one in India goes to school via elephant, and that we do have cars and such. The guy immediately became very apologetic and such. I told him it was all okay etc etc. But this is where it gets to the bad part. His follow up question was, “Are you sure you want this game?” A little surprised, replied that yes, of course I want it. Why did he ask? “Well, games like Jade Empire are a little complicated, you know. Seeing you’re from India, you most likely have never played games before. I mean, I don’t want to be rude, but I’m guessing you’ve never even used a computer before you came to the States.” Now, keep in mind that when I say I’m old school, I mean that my first computer was an Apple IIC from the 80s, and that didn’t even have any form of internal storage at all (it ran off RAM and ROM, and you had to save everything on 5 and a quarter inch floppies or run programs off said disks). So yes, I’m intimately familiar with computers. But despite that, what the guy said was kind of dickish. Maintaining my cool, I explained that this is/was 2005 and that they are pretty ubiquitous. “But they can be expensive and I can’t imagine you coming from such a poor country and affording one. So I’m just trying to point out that if you want to get into gaming, there are better, cheaper ones you can buy. Get a feel for what games were like before buying something like Jade Empire. I mean, I doubt you can even afford a rig that can even run it!” At that point, I figured it would be best if I simply just bought the game and left the store immediately before my overwhelming urge to punch the guy took over. Way To Make A 10-Year-Old Boy Cry (via Private_Smiley) So maybe 10 years ago, my best friends, my brother, and myself all got into Warcraft 3. Well, my brother wanted the battle chest for it, so my dad and my brother and I went to good ol’ Walmart to get it. Go back to electronics, find it, pay for it back there, get receipt but no bag as it was too big. As we head for the exit, the greeter person sees my little brother holding the battle chest and starts screaming at him that he stole it, while my dad is right there. He calmly shows her the receipt that shows it is paid for, but she will not listen and threatens to get her manager. Meanwhile, my 10 year old brother is almost in tears because this random lady has been screaming at him in public. Manager comes over, sees the receipt, tells us we can go, and gives the greeter a hard look and tells her to come to the office. The Aggressive Pawn Shop (via UsedMeat) I was in my teens and online shopping wasn’t a thing yet. Back then you would normally sell your games to local stores and pawn shops. So being a smart child I hopped on my bike and hit up about 5 stores to see what kind of cash I could get for my NES games. Store #3 was a game store in the back of a pawn shop that basically offered me dog crap prices on my good games and mediocre prices on my terrible games, the prices were for each game individually. I sold some of my good games to a different store that offered me the best prices, then I returned to Store #3 to sell them my crappy games. The employee then started yelling at me about how I should have sold all the games to her. Actually yelling. I informed them that I sold it to the store that offered me the most money. She then starts screaming about how I “owed” them the good games which was especially crazy since I had never been there before. 15 year old me told her I didn’t owe her shit, she then physically pushed me out of the door which is nuts because it’s about 4 steps up, I fell on my ass stood up and kicked the door. Then the owner comes out of the pawn shop yelling about how he recorded the whole thing and was going to call the cops. I told him he should because she attacked me. Choice words were thrown back and forth and I left. 22 years later I still laugh/cringe whenever I drive past that pawn shop. Thank goodness for online shopping. Blockbuster Memory Loss (via DonShulaDoingTheHula) In the waning days of Blockbuster, they ran some promotion involving trading in games and getting significant credit toward new releases. I can’t remember the specifics but it must have been $30 to $40 off per game – it was substantial. You can probably see where this is going. I preordered Madden and Tiger Woods for the 360 – it was the year the 360 launched. After I traded in a bunch of games for credit and came back to collect a couple months later, the guy at the counter told me I had no preorders. He ignored my receipt for the trade-ins and pretended he had never heard of the promotion. At one point he told me there was no way he was going to give me Xbox 360 games in exchange for credit, as if he had suddenly remembered the promotion but arbitrarily decided to exclude 360 games on the spot. I left the store without anything and never went back – for rentals or purchases. It closed a year later. I never got to spend any of the trade-in credit either. Shitty company got what it deserved. Xbox One Versus PS4 (via Crimson Sin) As a customer, when I went to pre-order my Xbox One, the clerk at Gamestop kept trying to talk me out of it and get a PS4. I get suggesting once or twice, but he started being pretty rude with me about it. Almost to the point of making fun of me for wanting an Xbox One. Laughing it off saying stuff like it’s a waste of money to buy any Microsoft product. Luckily when I picked up my Xbox on launch day he was nowhere to be seen. Sneak Magazine Subscription Attack (via Brass Shadow) One time when I was checking out at Best Buy, the cashier had me swipe twice. When I asked why I had to swipe twice, he passed it off as a computer error “You know, these machines.” Turns out he signed me up for a magazine subscription for Entertainment Weekly without my permission or knowledge and slipped the receipt for the subscription in my bag. I canceled it right away and complained to the store manager. Apparently at the time the cashiers received a commission for each subscription. A Wii Accessory Huh (via ElSuavenero) While I’ve never had a bad experience personally, I have witnessed quite a few before. I was in a Target store killing time while my girlfriend was clothes shopping. A store associate and customer were discussing the Wii U, whereby the associate proceeded to inform the customer that the system was an accessory for the Wii. For some reason, I felt the need to step in and explain the differences to this customer so he didn’t end up making a stupid purchase. I think the prospect of buying a whole new system was just too much for the guy and he left, though I’m not entirely sure why he was okay with buying a $300 Wii accessory before I explained the difference. Please Sell Me Your Hoodie (via Jon) The last year I went to Comic-con, I had gone to a little press event thing where Bioware was demonstrating a preview build for Dragon Age 2, where I bought a Mass Effect N7 hoodie. Some time after coming home from the con, I wore this hoodie to Gamestop, and a few of the clerks said “hey, cool” and that was that. One clerk, though, just would not let it go. He asked me where I got it, and I told him about Comic-Con, but that Bioware sells these hoodies on their website. He asked if I would sell him the one I’m currently wearing. I told him “no thank you,” but he continued to belabor the point. While processing my preorder for something, he asked me three more times if I would sell it to him. Not only that, but this guy remembered me. I decided to never wear that hoodie to the Gamestop again, but this guy remembered my face. The other two times I showed up at that store, he asked again, and even started getting more pushy with it. And to top it all off, turns out this guy went to the same college as me, and he saw me at school one day wearing the hoodie and once again ASKED ME TO SELL IT TO HIM. At this time, I was getting really tired of telling him “go to the website” or “leave me alone,” so I just ignored him and walked away. I’ve never gone back to that Gamestop since then, and thankfully I never saw him at school after that. Outclassed By A Grocery Store (via Keil) My friends and I would often go to Gamestop together to pick up pre-ordered games. I decided not to pre-order GTA 4, lying to myself that I could wait for the price to come down or for a used copy. Still, I went with my friends who did pre order it after work. We were in Alaska so by lunch I had seen video posted from East Coast players and knew it was worth buying immediately (nobody posted about the fucking cousin yet). Despite not having a preorder I figured a game as big as GTA 4 would certainly not be understocked, so I asked the manager if they had any for non-preorder customers. He looked at me like I asked to eat the flesh of newborns. Manager- “Why wouldn’t you preorder, that’s so stupid! Why would we have any extra?” Me- “Well I figured that since this is probably going to be the best selling game of the year you would want extra on hand to sell, make money?” Manager- “Well, here at Gamestop we respect games enough to only allow those who would appreciate them to have them.” Me- “What? How does that make sense? So Gamestop is always about the money unless there is an opportunity to screw the customer by not taking theirs?” Manager- “You just don’t understand how the games industry works. Not that I’d expect someone like you would!” And this cunt sneers at my uniform, my ARMY uniform I was wearing because I was in the GOD DAMNED ARMY and this shitwizard had the stones to try to mock me for that even though there were at least 8 other soldiers or airmen in the shop. My friends who were also Army demanded a refund and we went to a grocery store. Not only did a damn grocery store have the game, they had an entire PALLET of them behind the counter. The nice old manager there who saw us troops buying the game gave us all a 20% managers discount as long as we promised that we stopped playing in time to get a good night’s rest. We continued to go back to that grocery store for games and continued to get great service. I haven’t purchased anything from a Gamestop since. Girls Are Cheaters (via Nikki) So this story happened back when I was twelve years old, a couple weeks before the release of Halo 2. The Gamestop I always went to with my family was having a tournament to celebrate, and my older brother and I were so excited that we even made our own shirts. So we get in line to enter and already the worker keeps asking me if I’m sure I want to. He doesn’t do this for any other customer but me. At first I thought maybe it was because I was the youngest one there. The employee next to him gave me the sign-in sheet and I was entered. Already there seems to be tension from the first employee, Ryan. I will not forget that guy’s name for as long as I live. The competition starts and everyone is having fun and fangirling about Halo, it was great! Then it was my turn and I was nervous but excited. Everyone else was a lot older so no one really expected me to do well. And I won my first round, I was able to go to the finals. That’s when Ryan shows up and tells me it isn’t right to cheat. To clarify, I played Halo like crazy with my brother before the tournament so I’d be ready. I worked extremely hard to be a good player. He drops it and everyone else gets to play. Now it’s the finals, three other guys and me. I went for the same controller as I had last time and the worker unplugs it and tells me it is broken. Multiple people, including myself, keep telling him we know it isn’t yet he changes it anyway. We start the competition and the new controller is broken. I can’t play. So it ends and everyone is curious what happened. I go to talk to Ryan and he tells me that since I’m a young girl I must have cheated, so he didn’t want me to ruin the fun for everyone else. That I should know my place and know not to be playing video games since I’m a girl. Now remember, I was only twelve, so I didn’t understand the issue of girls gaming. Ryan, a full grown adult, told me that a girl can’t be that good, that a girl can’t beat men at a game. He then yelled at me and said, “YOU CAN’T BE THAT GOOD! YOU’RE A LYING LITTLE CHEATER!! GET OUT!!” There is a happy ending however. I found out two years after this incident that Ryan was fired for bullying every female customer that went to that store. A Case Of Mistaken Theft (via Clayton) I know my parents had been planning to get me one of the new Pokémon games for Christmas last year (2014). I told my dad that I was going out to get Smash for my 3DS, and he asked me if I was willing to go to the EB Games (which is about 15-20 minutes away) and see if they had Alpha Sapphire in stock if he were to go in tomorrow to get it for me. Of course I obliged and went about getting Smash for my DS. I had checked the EB site before-hand and called in to check if they had a copy of Smash in, which they didn’t. I then asked if they had any copies of Pokémon Alpha Sapphire in (the one I wanted) and they said they had one, so I asked if it was possible if I were able to reserve a copy for purchase the next day and they said I had to come in store to do it (certain EB Games allow you to reserve a copy of a game to purchase within 24 hours otherwise it goes back on the shelf). I went out to the Target near my house and bought Smash there along with a couple other things for my family because they were having a Christmas sale. Afterwards I bussed out to the EB across town and went in to reserve the copy of Sapphire for my dad the next day. Of course, not having a car, I had to bring my target bag in the store with me. I went up to the front desk of an empty EB and asked about reserving a copy of Sapphire, telling him in short the conversation I had over the phone. The guy at the desk mentioned that they hadn’t had any in stock for the last few days, but said that he can quickly check the back for any loose copies. He went to the back and I decided to look around the Nintendo section of the store for any games that interest me. I found none, and when the guy walked out from the back of the store I went back up to the front. He said that he didn’t have any copies of Sapphire, but that there were a few Rubys he could. I said no thank you and asked when he thinks they would be getting a copy of Sapphire in. He said they should be getting some in a few days and to come back then. It was at that time he noticed the copy of Smash 4 in my bag and asked if I wanted to pay for it. I told him I got it at Target, to which he asked for the receipt. After looking through the bag for a minute I realized that it would’ve fallen out of the bag on the bus, and so I didn’t have it. He said that I would have to pay for it (again) and even after the bar-code turned up invalid and the UPC also, he went to get the manager. The manager came out and after about 10 minutes of trying to get the game to register in the system, was getting obviously annoyed. He told me that he was going to go to the back and get another copy for me. I told him (again) that I had already purchased the game at Target but I had lost the receipt. He responded very angrily with “I don’t care if you say you bought it somewhere else, you bring a game in here and can’t prove you bought it where you way, you’re paying for it again!” At this point I was also getting annoyed and told him that, if he didn’t give my game back, I would phone the police and report the store for theft. He laughed at me and said, “Well looks like this game is going back into the storage area. I called the police and within 10 minutes they were there. After half an hour the store manager had had enough and said he just wanted to go home and that I could have my game. The police went into the back with him to make sure he actually got MY game. I got my game, got home, and told my dad that they were sold out and wasn’t getting another shipment until after Christmas. I still got Alpha Sapphire for Christmas, though I’m not sure where my dad got it from, but I hope he didn’t have to deal with the same thing I did, 2 hours of wasted time.

Just recently, unedited images of her derriere went viral because they revealed a cellulite issue. CLOSE UP A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on May 4, 2017 at 10:54am PDT Kim had previously revealed to Shape that she had cellulite problems, just like other women across the world. The following was her statement in relation to this. “I have cellulite, just like almost every other woman on the planet. And just because I feel secure with my body doesn’t mean I think cellulite is cute! It will always be an issue for me. So let’s just say it’s a work in progress!” So excited to announce you can get a signed, limited-edition copy of "Selfish" with an all-new cover – exclusively available on @Gilt! The link is in my bio A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on May 4, 2017 at 8:51am PDT She also revealed that she did a combination of cardio and sculpting to maintain her shape and keep cellulite on the low. Speaking about her famous butt, Kim Kardashian has for some time now cashed in on the hype by selling a pool float designed in the shape of her bum. She also introduced her butt emoji a few years ago, which almost broke Apple Store. As such, many of her fans felt cheated after recent unedited pictures of her bum hit the internet. Kim Kardashian reportedly lost about 100,000 Instagram followers following the leak. On Friday, the mother of two was spotted donning an illusion bodysuit that accentuated her shape as she headed for Casa Vega in Los Angeles. It featured white stripes on the sides, making her waist look incredibly smaller. She combined this with a pair of black jeans and lace-up boots. You can check out the pictures here, here and here. PRE MET A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on May 2, 2017 at 9:32pm PDT In other news, Kim Kardashian’s mom, Kris Jenner, has just been granted a restraining order against a former bodyguard, who has been stalking her. According to the momager, Joshua Jacobs “crashed his vehicle through the gate to our community, came on to my property looking for me at around 1:00 AM.” He was spotted by security trying to key in codes to the door to her house. The following is an excerpt of the report by TMZ detailing this. ” Jacobs was actually kneeling down in front of the security keypad on her house, and pressing keys when Kris’ personal security spotted him. He was charged with felony stalking, and arraigned Wednesday.” “According to docs, Jacobs made the same mad dash for Jenner’s house 2 weeks earlier, and also showed up in March… with his grandmother in his car. The restraining order was granted, and Jacobs has been ordered not to harass or contact Kris… and must stay 100 yards away from her.” Kris Jenner and Scott Disick are presently reported to be working on a new reality TV show about flipping houses. Apparently, Scott is the main star, with the supporting cast including Tomer Fridman, a realtor, and Mickey, a contractor. The main concept involves Tomer showing houses that have a high return potential to Scott, who comes up with the financing. Mickey then steps in and patches them up. The houses are then resold by Homer for a huge profit. The following is the inside scoop from TMZ. “The show is called Royally Flipped, a takeoff on Royally F**ked. We’re told they’re already shooting the pilot at 2 homes… one in Malibu and another in the San Fernando Valley. E! has the first right of refusal.” “Here’s what’s crazy. We’re told Scott and Kourtney are fighting these days… not getting along at all. Yet Kris will be the Executive Producer of a show starring her daughters at-the-moment nemesis.” Tonight on #KUWTK!! 9/8c on E! #family #love #KUWTKSunday A post shared by Kris Jenner (@krisjenner) on May 7, 2017 at 8:32am PDT News of the project comes in the wake of dropping Keeping Up With The Kardashians ratings. Kylie Jenner is reportedly also working on her own show.

Google Assistant to arrive in Nougat, Marshmallow soon Ryan Thomas Namia March 3, 2017 8:28 am TECHNOLOGY 2.8K 0 DUBAI – Google’s virtual assistant, Google Assistant, will soon be available to phones running Android 7.0 Nougat and Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Previously available to Pixel phones, Google Assistant lets users talk to his phone in a conversational way, providing answers to questions about weather, flight information and appointments. Yes, it’s like Apple’s Siri. LG was one of the first smartphone makers to reveal it would feature the assistant on its new device, the G6. In its blog post, the assistant will be rolled out this week in the US, while users in Canada, Australia, Germany and the UK will get the feature soon as well. “With this update, hundreds of millions of Android users will now be able to try out the Google Assistant,” Gummi Hafsteinsson, product lead for Google Assistant, said. To use this (if you have Nougat or Marshmallow operating system), just long press the Home button and say “Ok Google” to get started. And now, you can ask things such as ‘What’s my confirmation number for my London flight,’ ‘Take me to Museu Picasso,’ ‘Do I need an umbrella today,’ and many more. According to its blog, there is no need to download the update because Google Assistant will be usable on phones running Nougat and Marshmallow with Google Play Services. “Our goal is to make the Assistant available anywhere you need it. It came to Android Wear 2.0 – via new smartwatches – just a few weeks ago and, as we previewed in January, the Assistant is also coming to TVs and cars,” Hafsteinsson said.   Facebook Comments Website Comments free pron March 6th, 2017 Reply ab5Pn3 My brother suggested I might like this website.

More than half with the uninsured are under the age of Thirty five. They do not really feel they are looking for health insurance as they are young and also healthy. Their own income is often spent on homes, food, along with entertainment. Many people that do represent the working class either complete or part-time are not supplied insurance by means of their work so they go without due to the rising expense of health insurance in the country.

Bradford DeLong » Artificial intelligence and artificial problems Artificial intelligence and artificial problems May 07,2017 - Last updated at May 07,2017 Former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers recently took exception to current US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin’s views on “artificial intelligence” (AI) and related topics. The difference between the two seems to be, more than anything else, a matter of priorities and emphasis. Mnuchin takes a narrow approach. He thinks that the problem of particular technologies called “artificial intelligence taking over American jobs” lies “far in the future”. And he seems to question the high stock-market valuations for “unicorns” — companies valued at or above $1 billion that have no record of producing revenues that would justify their supposed worth and no clear plan to do so. Summers takes a broader view. He looks at the “impact of technology on jobs” generally, and considers the stock-market valuation for highly profitable technology companies such as Google and Apple to be more than fair. I think that Summers is right about the optics of Mnuchin’s statements. A US treasury secretary should not answer questions narrowly, because people will extrapolate broader conclusions even from limited answers. The impact of information technology on employment is undoubtedly a major issue, but it is also not in society’s interest to discourage investment in high-tech companies. On the other hand, I sympathise with Mnuchin’s effort to warn non-experts against routinely investing in castles in the sky. Although great technologies are worth the investment from a societal point of view, it is not so easy for a company to achieve sustained profitability. Presumably, a treasury secretary already has enough on his plate to have to worry about the rise of the machines. In fact, it is profoundly unhelpful to stoke fears about robots and to frame the issue as “artificial intelligence taking American jobs”. There are far more constructive areas for policymakers to direct their focus. If the government is properly fulfilling its duty to prevent a demand-shortfall depression, technological progress in a market economy need not impoverish unskilled workers. This is especially true when value is derived from the work of human hands, or the work of things that human hands have made, rather than from scarce natural resources, as in the Middle Ages. Karl Marx was one of the smartest and most dedicated theorists on this topic, and even he could not consistently show that technological progress necessarily impoverishes unskilled workers. Technological innovations make whatever is produced primarily by machines more useful, albeit with relatively fewer contributions from unskilled labour. But that by itself does not impoverish anyone. To do that, technological advances also have to make whatever is produced primarily by unskilled workers less useful. But this is rarely the case, because there is nothing keeping the relatively cheap machines used by unskilled workers in labour-intensive occupations from becoming more powerful. With more advanced tools, these workers can then produce more useful things. Historically, there are relatively few cases in which technological progress, occurring within the context of a market economy, has directly impoverished unskilled workers. In these instances, machines caused the value of a good that was produced in a labour-intensive sector to fall sharply, by increasing the production of that good so much as to satisfy all potential consumers. The canonical example of this phenomenon is textiles in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century India and Britain. New machines made the exact same products that handloom weavers had been making, but they did so on a massive scale. Owing to limited demand, consumers were no longer willing to pay for what handloom weavers were producing. The value of wares produced by this form of unskilled labour plummeted, but the prices of commodities that unskilled labourers bought did not. The lesson from history is not that the robots should be stopped; it is that we will need to confront the social-engineering and political problem of maintaining a fair balance of relative incomes across society. Towards that end, our task becomes threefold. First, we need to make sure that governments carry out their proper macroeconomic role, by maintaining a stable, low-unemployment economy so that markets can function properly. Second, we need to redistribute wealth to maintain a proper distribution of income. Our market economy should promote, rather than undermine, societal goals that correspond to our values and morals. Finally, workers must be educated and trained to use increasingly high-tech tools (especially in labour-intensive industries), so that they can make useful things for which there is still demand. Sounding the alarm about “artificial intelligence taking American jobs” does nothing to bring such policies about. Mnuchin is right: the rise of the robots should not be on a treasury secretary’s radar.     The writer, a former deputy assistant US Treasury secretary, is professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley and a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. ©Project Syndicate, 2017. www.project-syndicate.org Rate up 5 users have voted.

Quotes in the article Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRK.A ▲ 250,000.00 +460.00 +0.18% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 148.96 +2.43 +1.66% American Express Co AXP ▼ 78.32 -0.01 -0.01% International Business Machines Corp IBM ▼ 155.05 -4.00 -2.51% Speaking at the company’s annual meeting, a weekend-long celebration known as the Woodstock of Capitalism, Buffett said a 10% cut in the corporate tax rate would reduce the tax owed on more than $90 billion in unrealized gains in holdings of companies like American Express, Coca-Cola and Apple. The conglomerate is also considering timing sales of stock to take advantage of expected changes in tax law, Buffett said. The idea is to lock in losses this year, while tax rates on realized gains are higher, because the ability to write off losses could let the government to take as much as 35% of the hit, Buffett said. At the same time, any moves to cash in positions that have risen in value might be deferred until next year, hoping that taxes on the sale would be lower. “It would be a slight preference, but it may be a factor in accelerating losses and (delaying) any gains,” Buffett said. The discussion on taxes came early in Berkshire’s meeting, where Buffett and Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger make themselves available for hours of questions from analysts and shareholders. Other shareholders prodded Buffett and Munger on Berkshire holdings, including Apple, IBM, Wells Fargo and whether the company would sell its decades-old position in Coca-Cola, worth $16.6 billion as of Dec. 31 according to Berkshire filings, over claims that the soft-drink makers contribute to water shortages in the developing world. Buffett harshly criticized Wells Fargo, Berkshire’s largest outside stock holding, for failing to act quickly when it learned employees were setting up fake accounts for customers in order to meet sales goals. “The biggest mistake was, and I obviously don't know all the facts," Buffett said. "But at some point if there is a major problem, the CEO will get wind of it and at that moment ... the CEO has to act."   Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

My bag contains [my] make up kit, hand lotion and hand sanitizer aside from my other personal belongings like wallet and phone. Nothing beats clean hands! I guess a bag must basically contain things that are useful for our daily activities.  What electronic gadgets are you currently using? For my laptop I am using a Macbook and an iPhone for my phone. It’s a fact that Apple products have always have the good quality and more advanced.  What’s inside your closet? Mostly my dresses from different collections are the major stuff inside my closet. I like glamour office attires, which I can also wear for evening events. I am also into shoes and handbags which occupy the most space in my closet. What is your style of clothing? Talking about my style cannot be defined in one corner. We have to be flexible. For me, it depends on the weather and occasion. Living in Dubai you can see me with fit clothes during summer and you can see me with fur during winter and sportswear every morning as I hit the gym or if I am just at home spending my time painting and  when I am with my music,  I  just merely wear my rugged clothes. What clothing brands do you think closely fit your sense of fashion?  I don’t really have a clothing brand in particular, when I shop, I visit every store and find something that fits my body type. My principle is this: If it looks good on you, buy it! No matter what brand it is, as I shop depending on what makes me look good not just the hype.  That would help you boost confidence.  What is your favorite perfume?  Chloé Eu du Parfum, it has a fresh powdery floral scent which makes me feel happy and boost my self-esteem and femininity. What is your favorite brand of shoes?  I both like Louboutin and Valentino.  I invest in a pair of good quality shoes as those brands produce comfortable shoes, more durable and they last longer especially [since] I always love to wear heels so I need to have a good quality pair of shoes. Are you a shopaholic?  Yes, I was before to be honest, but when I started earning from my own sweat, I intended not to, but I treat myself once in a while. We all have to admit that buying something new (new car, new dress, new shoes, new bags) makes us feel great but it’s only passive. For as long as you are not spending beyond your budget, then that’s totally fine!  What inspires or influences you to buy an item? I normally buy stuff for my basic needs or replacing old items but if I see great deals on the stores, I don’t want to miss the opportunity!              What brands do you trust for your skin care? I use SK-II and Shiseido for my face. I am very careful when buying products for my skin especially since I have acne prone skin. That’s why these two brands stand out for me. I also use Nivea shower gel and Nivea Lotion ever since. What is a Branded Pinoy for you? Branded Pinoy for me is someone who has a positive outlook in life. Our brains are wired to find things we are looking for. If you are always cynical or waiting for things to go wrong, then your life will reflect that. On the other hand, having a positive outlook in life will bring you joy and provide you with inspiration when you least expect it.  Facebook Comments Website Comments free pron March 6th, 2017 Reply HL5bYg Pretty!

In the real world, your personal life is a private space. But in tech, your personal data is a ripe resource for businesses to harvest in their own interests. That was the broad takeaway from the recent New York Times profile on Uber, the car-summoning service, and its chief executive, Travis Kalanick. Among other revelations, the report illuminated that to stay competitive, Uber bought information about its main US ride-hailing competitor, Lyft, from Unroll.me, a free email digest service. How did Unroll.me get data about Lyft? While people could use the service free of charge to unsubscribe from marketing emails, Unroll.me made money by scanning the contents of its users’ inboxes and selling anonymised data, information that did not have individuals’ names attached to it (in this case, emailed Lyft receipts), to other companies, including marketers. Many consumers found Unroll.me’s practices misleading. In addition, Uber was involved in some deception of its own: It participated in fingerprinting, a process in which iPhones were tagged with permanent identities that were detectable even after the Uber app was erased from the devices. The practice violated Apple’s terms of service, which could have resulted in Uber’s being banned from the App Store. Uber eventually revised the app to remove the fingerprinting code. When it comes to data collection, services like Unroll.me and Uber are small fry compared with Internet giants like Google and Facebook, which have a wealth of information about people. And then there are large data brokers like Acxiom, CoreLogic, Datalogix and ID Analytics, which collect, analyse and sell billions of details about consumers’ online activities for marketing purposes. For consumers, giving up some data has become part of the trade-off of receiving compelling, personalised services. But that doesn’t mean you have to be caught by surprise. Here are some tips from privacy experts on protecting yourself from tricky data collection: Read privacy policies It was never a secret that Unroll.me was sharing anonymised user data with third parties. Its privacy policy, which was publicly posted, says that “we may collect, use, transfer, sell and disclose non-personal information for any purpose” and that data can be used “to build anonymous market research products and services.” That so many people were caught by surprise showed how rarely they bother to read terms of service agreements, including privacy policies, said Runa Sandvik, director of information security for The New York Times. When you sign up for a new app or web tool, the company typically asks you to agree to its terms of service. To avoid a privacy pitfall like the one involving Unroll.me, start perusing the terms and pay particular attention to the privacy policy. If you see language that suggests your data could be shared in a way that makes you uncomfortable, opt against using the service. Of course, you would not be alone if you felt confused or uninformed after reading a terms of service agreement, which is saddled with language written by lawyers. “People quickly run into the challenge that there’s so much legalese that it’s up to you to envision how your data may be used,” Sandvik said. Still, it’s better than reading nothing. Research company biz models Rarely is a free product ever truly free, and a company’s business model can provide insight into how your data may eventually be shared. If you are using a product that does not charge an upfront fee or show any advertising, a for-profit company has to find some way to monetise your patronage. For many companies, the path to monetisation is anonymised, aggregated user data. That means while your name will not be attached to the information, your age, gender, shopping activities and location will all be rolled up with other users’ data. Altogether, that becomes incredibly valuable information to many retailers looking for market research. The good news There are some nonprofits with no ties to the advertising industry that offer tools to protect your privacy, said Lee Tien, a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. For example, his non-profit provides Privacy Badger, a free ad blocker, in hopes of getting people to become members and donate to the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Free open-source tools like uBlock Origin, another ad blocker, and Signal, an encrypted messaging app, also lack skin in the advertising game. But if it’s a for-profit business offering a free product, count on it monetising your data somehow. “Follow the money,” Tien said. “If you’re not paying for it with money, you’re paying for it with data.” So before subscribing to a free app or online tool, take a moment to do a web search for the company’s business model. Audit your apps It’s worthwhile to periodically check your primary online accounts, like Facebook, Twitter or Google, to see which apps are hooked into them. Chances are you have used those accounts to quickly sign up for a web tool or app. The ones you never use may still be leeching off your personal data, so you should disable them. On Facebook, go to the settings page and click on the Apps tab to see which apps are connected to the account. On your Google account page, you can find a similar apps list labeled “Connected apps & sites.” And on Twitter, go to the Apps page under “Settings and privacy.” Sandvik recommended pruning apps that you don’t recognise or have not used in the last six months. Once you have narrowed down the list, take a deeper dive on the ones that remain and read up on how they use your personal data. If their data-sharing practices sound offensive, remove the apps. Do this audit at least once a year: The number of connected apps on your online accounts can pile up over time. On my neglected Facebook account, for example, I had 82 connected apps. After removing many unused or defunct apps, like LivingSocial and Draw Something, I had 32 left. Opt out for good Deleting your app from your phone or computer often isn’t enough. You’ll remove data from the device itself, but not from the company’s servers. If you’ve lost trust in a company, make the cleanest break possible: Delete your account. In the case of an app like Uber, for example, you can submit a request on the company’s website to have your account deleted. Similarly, with Unroll.me, you can log in to the site and click through the settings to delete your account. Even after doing that, you will have to reconcile with the idea that the company will probably hold on to the information you have already shared. “Data you’ve provided to the service as part of using the service is data that they can store and continue to use,” Sandvik said. “It falls under the terms of service.” Email this page Print this page Tweet Go to Top Videos more Youth in Pulwama protested for a valid reason, says Altaf Bukhari Polls open in what is seen as France's most important election in decades Online Group of Music Lovers Meets Offline - Bengaluru hosts RMIM silver jubilee bash Ludhiana-based numismatist hopes to collect every coin minted by RBI Bahubali sarees new attraction among Surat women Tourist bus narrowly escapes from falling into sea 'Mother' should not be used to describe a bomb: Pope Roses in hand, Venezuelan women protesters face security forces Watch: Yogi Adityanath wields broom to clean streets Shiv Sena MP Gaikwad hails aviation ministry's move to ban defaulter passengers Most popular stories now Commented Emailed Viewed 1.Tie old cows outside BJP men's houses, see if they cared: Lalu 2.Trump's tougher H1B rules take toll, disheartened wife commits suicide 3.Lady IPS in tears after Yogi confidante rebukes her publicly 4.India will retaliate: Army chief on beheading of soldiers 5.Is India losing Kashmir? 1.Protect your privacy as apps harvest data 2.A career in Science 3.On a sandy trail... 4.11.38 lakh students take NEET 5.Indian-origin girl in UK gets 162 IQ points,more than Einstein 1.

The corporations that run it get a little bigger, their power grows more concentrated, and a bit of their idealism gives way to ruthless pragmatism. At the moment, the Internet isn’t in a good place. The Frightful Five — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google’s parent company — control nearly everything of value in the digital world, including operating systems, app stores, browsers, cloud storage infrastructure, and oceans of data from which to spin new products. A handful of others — Comcast, AT&T, Verizon — control the wired and wireless connections through which all your data flows. People used to talk about the Internet as a wonderland for innovative upstarts, but lately the upstarts keep getting clobbered. Today, the Internet is gigantic corporations, all the way down. Which brings us to net neutrality. The rule basically prevents broadband providers from offering preferential treatment to some content online — it blocks Comcast from giving, say, a speed boost to a streaming video company that can afford to pay over one that cannot. Amid many legal battles, neutrality rules in some form have governed the Internet for years. The fight over network neutrality is often seen as a battle between telecom companies and Internet companies — between fat-pipe providers like Comcast and digital innovators like Google. Telecom companies are becoming Internet companies (Verizon now owns AOL and Yahoo), Internet companies are dabbling in telecom (Alphabet has a fiber-optic Internet service arm), and they’re all becoming film and TV studios. So the better way to think about the rules isn’t in terms of what these companies do, but rather in terms of size. Does ending network neutrality help the big fish or the little fish? Will it create a more favourable atmosphere for potential challengers of the Frightful Five? Probably not. In fact, it could entrench their power even further. Tim Wu, the Columbia Law professor and New York Times contributing opinion columnist said that the emergence of a handful of Internet giants has altered how he thinks about the issue. In 2003, when he began arguing for neutrality rules, Wu was mainly interested in protecting digital innovators from the telecom oligopolies that had long stifled new technology on their networks. If phone companies brought the same rules from phone networks over to the Internet, attaching unapproved hardware to your line (like a Wi-Fi router) or running software that might compete with the phone company’s primary business (say, Skype) could be deemed verboten. But today, Wu sees neutrality rules as having a broader purpose — protecting innovators not just from broadband companies, but also from the Internet giants that now rule the network. Meanwhile, opponents of network neutrality argue just the opposite — that removing the rules would actually strengthen startups. “The big companies are already getting huge speed advantages because they’ve built out massive online infrastructure,” said Bret Swanson, who studies telecom policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. “But the upstart that doesn’t have the massive infrastructure and doesn’t have tens of billions of dollars to build it, that company could use things like paid priority to enter this competitive market.” Email this page Print this page Tweet Go to Top Videos more Youth in Pulwama protested for a valid reason, says Altaf Bukhari Polls open in what is seen as France's most important election in decades Online Group of Music Lovers Meets Offline - Bengaluru hosts RMIM silver jubilee bash Ludhiana-based numismatist hopes to collect every coin minted by RBI Bahubali sarees new attraction among Surat women Tourist bus narrowly escapes from falling into sea 'Mother' should not be used to describe a bomb: Pope Roses in hand, Venezuelan women protesters face security forces Watch: Yogi Adityanath wields broom to clean streets Shiv Sena MP Gaikwad hails aviation ministry's move to ban defaulter passengers Most popular stories now Commented Emailed Viewed 1.Tie old cows outside BJP men's houses, see if they cared: Lalu 2.Trump's tougher H1B rules take toll, disheartened wife commits suicide 3.Lady IPS in tears after Yogi confidante rebukes her publicly 4.India will retaliate: Army chief on beheading of soldiers 5.Is India losing Kashmir? 1.Protect your privacy as apps harvest data 2.A career in Science 3.On a sandy trail... 4.11.38 lakh students take NEET 5.Indian-origin girl in UK gets 162 IQ points,more than Einstein 1.

Phone calls and the old-fashioned, face-to-face conversation have been supplanted by texting and snap chatting. Thoughtful Parenting: Youth Services This weekly column about parenting issues is written by area youth-serving professionals. It publishes on Mondays in the Steamboat Today. Read more columns here. The reality is, this stereotype hits home, not only for Generation Z, but for all of us. In 2016, Apple stated that the average iPhone user logs in 80 times per day, accessing it, on average, every 11 minutes and 15 seconds. Due to the proliferation of apps for everything from sports and entertainment to news and social media, we can personalize our devices so we can learn, work and play in the ways we want, whenever we want. As busy parents, we constantly strive to add efficiencies to our family’s lives; hundreds of parenting apps exist, promising to educate, organize, protect and sooth our children. While the use of these apps can be helpful, the role of in-person interaction within our family and community remains invaluable. Behavioral scientists are increasingly finding that social connection is a key indicator for health, well-being and longevity. Our children learn how to interact and build trust within the community through our example as parents. By continually exposing them to our experiences and relationships, we create the building blocks they will use the rest of their lives. One of the biggest challenges to this is when technology becomes a distraction or an addiction. A great strategy to combat that is appreciating and taking advantage of opportunities to connect face-to-face when they arise and creating an intention to involve our children in our daily interactions. Steamboat Springs offers a plethora of community events for families to grow, including the monthly All Pro Dad Breakfast for fathers their children. The APD Breakfast occurs every from 7:15 to 8:15 a.m. every third Friday during the school year in Strawberry Park Middle School cafeteria and hosts dads and their kids age 3 through 14 at no cost. Each meeting begins with time for everyone to settle in and, of course, enjoy breakfast. The dads then introduce themselves and their children and share with the group what makes them proud of their kids. Next comes a group discussion about important topics, such as trust and bravery. The event closes with a raffle for the kids. The local chapter started in 2014, after Brian Simmons and his family moved to Steamboat from Tennessee. Having been part of an APD group in Nashville, the Simmons family missed their monthly tradition. Through their encouragement, Simmons started his own group and has since grown the event to an average of 35 attendees every month. Providing food and prizes on a regular basis to a group this size is no easy task. Fortunately, local businesses and organizations, including The Egg & I, the Fatherhood Program of Routt County and Steamboat Bible Church, have provided tremendous support to keep the program rolling. The final breakfast of the school year will take place at Strawberry Park Middle School on May 19. The event will also be making its debut at the North Routt Charter School from 7 to 8 a.m. May 18, thanks to the efforts of another Steamboat resident, Jerry Coleman. For more information about the program and how you can support either chapter, email Simmons (Steamboat) at allprodad.brainsimmons@gmail.com or Coleman (North Routt) at allprodadjerry@outlook.com. Information can also be found at allprodad.com.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 07, 2017 1:53pm   Comments Share: If you had a million used cell phones and decided to rip them to shreds, you’d have 75 pounds of gold, 772 pounds of silver, 33 pounds of palladium and a whopping 35,000 pounds of copper, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. At today’s prices, that would fetch nearly a quarter-million bucks in serious metal, which is one of the incentives for electronics recyclers — especially those who deal with hundreds of thousands of tons at a time — to strip out what they can’t refurbish and resell. Unfortunately for scrap dealers, more people than ever are using devices such as phones, tablets, wafer-thin laptops and desktops weighing a third of what they once did. The thinning of the herd of towering workstations and fat-screen TVs is one factor rattling the waste-recovery sector, which has seen at least 50 U.S. companies go under since 2016. “The big problem is the products are getting smaller and less valuable,” William H. Johnson, chief lobbyist the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI), told Benzinga. “So there is less and less material to recycle. When you had your desktop machine it was full of stuff. But the phone, there’s hardly anything in there.” The phenomenon has forced others to diversify their services into endeavors more refined since the brass-knuckle days of metal management. Garbage collectors are getting into the business of erasing your existence from every device you ever owned and convincing the cloud that stores everything that you’ve ceased to exist. “Mobility has changed the way the way people compute,” said Robert Houghton, CEO of Sage Sustainable Electronics LLC and a steering committee member the Coalition of American Electronics Recycling, a rival of the larger ISRI trade group. “The number of devices [has] increased per person. The average individual has a tablet, laptop and a smart phone.” And though first adopters will always beat a path to the door of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) Store on opening iPhone day, businesses and a segment of users see no reason to pay premium for the latest and greatest, and instead will save a bundle by eschewing fashion for value. Time To Take Out The Trash Full disclosure: This story is being written on a seven-year-old, refurbished Lenovo Thinkpad that cost $200. “That’s the additional factor: the reuse market,” said Houghton. “People are finding that they last longer. There is more reliability.” Industry giant Sims Metal Management Ltd (OTC: SMSMY), one of the few publicly traded companies with a significant electronics recycling wing, reported plunging earnings for five years straight through 2016, including an 83 percent drop last year in its electronics recycling — which accounts for 17 percent of its business — and the closing of four facilities that cut the workforce by 13 percent, mainly in the United States. It cited overcapacity, flat commodities prices and an influx of cheap metals from China as factors in the overall recycling market’s decline. “Current headwinds have put many of our peers in survival mode,” Todd Scott, vice-president of investor relations, told analysts during a conference on 2016 Q2 earnings. “Since the beginning of the fiscal year 2016 over 50 metals recycling facilities have either closed or gone bankrupt only in North America alone, in the US alone.” But for the long term, growth prospects look great, Sims said in its annual report. It said global e-waste generated alone in 2014 was $52 billion. Global Industry Analysts, Inc. said the e-cycling business would reach $32.4 billion by 2020. Bill In Congress Would Limit U.S. Trash Exports Industry insiders are sharply divided about the degree to which American junk is used by countries such as China to make counterfeit computer chips. Or whether Big Garbage is using Third World countries as dumping grounds for toxic scrap linked to mental retardation in children. Electro-trash of the toxic variety — heavy metals in general and lead glass from antiquated CRTs in particular — is hard to track through the serpentine pipelines in the United States, let alone abroad. Half the states regulate electronic trash, and consumers often must pay to get rid of it. It doesn’t always go where it is supposed to. A lot of environmentally feel-good fairs in many communities are just conduits to spreading toxic chemicals to Third World giga-dumpsters, said Houghton. “Those events that accept everything and don’t charge, it’s usually going to the export market,” Houghton said. In the chaotic theater of the absurd that is contemporary Washington, a bill pending in the U.S. Senate seeks to curb exports before they are used to breach the security of, say, the e-monitored Hoover Dam or Golden Gate Bridge. “Experts say fake electronic components can be found in everything from the airbags in our cars to our critical domestic infrastructure and even our military hardware,” Coalition for American Electronics Recycling said in a position paper. “A Senate Armed Services Committee study determined that counterfeit chips are pervasive in fighter jets, missile guidance systems, submarines, helicopters and more, concluding ‘there is no way to predict how well they will perform, how long they will last, and the full impact of failure.’” But Johnson of ISRI — which represents big, global recyclers such as Sims and the privately held Electronic Recyclers International — said the backers of the bill are just trying to stymie foreign competition. “This is a piece of legislation that has been floating around a long time,” he said. “The rationales change and really can’t be substantiated.” He cited a U.S. International Trade Commission report that U.S. exports of scrap accounted for only 17 percent of recycled goods. Houghton, however, said that is still a lot of junk. China, however, said on April 18 that it was prepared to impose sweeping reforms on recycled waste imports.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Scratch-resistant Sapphire Edition Of HTC U Ultra Is As Strong As HTC Promised Posted: May 7 2017, 10:44am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Technology News   Jerryrigeverything    HTC U Ultra seems to be the revival of HTC’s lost creativity. Along with all the cool features, HTC is now offering a HTC U Ultra edition which consists of a sapphire screen. Don't Miss: Find a Nintendo NES Classic in stock Sapphire is one of the hardest material that can be used for a smartphone’s screen, and is almost impervious to everyday scratches and blows. All this talk about glory raises one question, is HTC U Ultra Sapphire edition really as strong? YouTube’s channel, JerryRigEverything placed a luxury Tissot wristwatch, a fifty dollar-worth glass protector for Samsung Galaxy S8, and an HTC U Ultra Sapphire edition under his famous scratch test, hoping to answer the question. Zack, the founder of JerryRigEverything, performs his test such that he tries to scratch the surface of the device with tips of increasing hardness, the level of hardness where the surface shows scratches is where the test is concluded. These levels of hardness have been extracted from Mohs scale. The glass protector failed the scratch test at the third level of hardness, objects like gold or silver will leave prominent scratches on the protector. Moreover, Zack tried the fire test on the screen protector also, the protector caught fire within seconds and was turned into plastic paste on the screen of Galaxy S8. Tissot Watch and HTC U Ultra qualified to the next stages of the scratch test. Most of the devices including LG G6, iPhone 7, and Galaxy S8 give up when scratched with a level 6 or 7 hard material. Shockingly, the Luxury Watch by Tissot and HTC U Ultra’s screen were invulnerable till level 9 hard material. This story may contain affiliate links.

Something on the order of tours of a Veterans Administration hospital for wounded veterans by Third Grade schoolchildren should help stop the ball rolling. Reply ↓ Katharine May 7, 2017 at 9:40 am Thanks, ambrit! Some ten or fifteen years ago, I knew a girl involved in JROTC who, in talking about possibly going to Iraq in a couple of years, said, “I wouldn’t be scared.” I said, “Then you wouldn’t be alive very long.” The idea of anyone approaching unknown dangers without healthy fear horrified me. It made me angry to realize that malleable teens were being “trained” in a way that exploited their desire to impress each other at a potential cost of their lives. I am thankful to say the Algebra Project ended up having more influence than the drill instructor. Last I heard, she was doing well. Reply ↓ ambrit May 7, 2017 at 10:44 am Good to hear Katherine. By the way, I am not hip about the “Algebra Project.” Somehow, it conjures up visions of cryptographers secretively toiling away in the basements of various D.C. and Langley locations. You are right about the teens being especially vulnerable to appeals to “solidarity” and “elite” self-identification. I remember a teacher in my High School who was a sort of Mr. Establishment type. He would set up “voluntary” psychological profile tests, which I only figured out later, to be taken by some of the “best and brightest” of the student body. (I fit that description early on, but something went “wrong” later on.) I have always wondered about who he was working for. Phyl and I were down on “the Coast” in Gulfport several weeks ago and, it being a Sunday, stopped in at a “fast food,” read that “self destructive urges realization” outlet. An older man was sitting by the door, wearing a Vietnam Veteran baseball cap. This area is a centre of military bases and retirees. A thirty something woman with two six or seven year old boys stopped them from exiting the place and exhorted them, and exhort is the right word to use to describe her tone and demeanor, to thank the old man “for his service.” “He’s the reason we have the freedoms we take for granted,” was her argument. So, the conditioning starts very young in some parts of the society. Reply ↓ Katharine May 7, 2017 at 11:19 am The original Algebra Project was a project of Bob Moses and his daughter’s teacher. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_Project There is a national organization which seems heavily institutional: http://www.algebra.org/ The Baltimore Algebra Project is an independent entity inspired by Moses that claims to be “youth led and youth run” and is more political. https://www.baltimorealgebraproject.org/ Its “About Us” page starts with this statement: Our mission is to ensure that all students have access to quality, 21st century education which includes learning and mastering advanced math. We value the intelligence of Baltimore City Youth by paying a living wage to teach math to their peers; training their existing leadership skills; and supporting their vision for a just, more equitable Baltimore and beyond. Quality Education, adequate employment, proper healthcare, and safety is the right of every Baltimore City Youth. I have admired it for a long time. Reply ↓ ambrit May 7, 2017 at 11:56 am Thanks.

French citizenship may be applied for after three years’ service.[7] Additionally, any soldier who becomes injured during a battle for France immediately becomes a French citizen under a provision known as “Français par le sang versé” (“French by spilled blood”).[7] As of 2008, members come from 140 countries.

Reply ↓ Altandmain May 7, 2017 at 12:10 pm The big problem is that lots of Americans end up joining the military for economic reasons. Let’s face it, despite attempts to glorify the US military, the cruel reality is that many enlist due to limited opportunities in the civilian world or because they cannot afford a university education. I suppose the rich like it that way. That’s the big obstacle. They need their cannon fodder and their domestic economic policies keep people on the economic margins.

The Pentagon even admitted on its website that these acts would lead to mass outbreaks of disease. These were certifiable war crimes under international law. After Saddam’s defeat the U.S. also imposed widespread sanctions on his regime that included preventing necessary medicines from reaching Iraq. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens perished as a result. In an infamous interview in 1996 Madeleine Albright, then the Secretary of State, was asked to justify the deaths of 500,000 children. She defended these atrocities by saying “I think this is a very hard choice but we think the price is worth it.” ….. This condition of ignorance is the effect of the incomplete and, too often, dishonest orthodoxy in required school texts and by the distortion of the real past by popular culture, Hollywood films and corporate controlled network television, especially the purported “news.” ….. As I write these words Trump has launched missiles at a Syrian airfield, employed the U.S.’s deadliest weapon short of nukes in Afghanistan, bombed Yemen, and sent troops to Somalia. His Secretary of Defense, former General James Mattis, affectionately called “mad dog” by his troops, threatens Iran, falsely accusing it of violations of the recently signed agreement on nuclear proliferation. Trump is recklessly threatening North Korea, potentially creating an extreme risk of a nuclear event that would certainly also engage China. He has called for an increase in military spending that by itself is almost larger than the entire military budget of any other country. ===================================================== When one looks at the stenography coming from the news media today ((‘with the bombing os Syria, Trump became presidential’)), I can’t help but look at the whining coming from the NYT as reflected in today’s link section in the below link and think of it as poetic justice: Hell hath no fury like The New York Times scorned by Hollywood Columbia Journalism Review The media, whose Pentagon and Watergate publications are like a man whose only accomplishment was scoring a winning touchdown in high school and who incessantly yammers about it is pretty much how the NYT and WP behaves, doing nothing for the almost 50 years….

Yes, it’s a crime,” he said. “Without knowing what the intentions were and so forth, there is potentially a prosecutable crime.” “Isn’t that what Director Comey said?” asked Geist. “There was nothing new to come from this additional trove of emails,” said Blumenthal. “Should it have been prosecuted,” host Joe Scarborough jumped in. “It still may be potentially. It’s not outside the statute of limitations. Who will decide it? That’s why we need a special prosecutor to review all of this investigative material.” he said before artfully pivoting back to questions over Donald Trump and Russia. ====================================================== Well, if you interject “intentions” into the law, it seems to me your allowing the same escape clause used by Clinton.

The war served merely as pretext. Of that there can be little doubt. In a searing civil conflict that threatened the very survival of the republic, Americans, under Lincoln, enjoyed every liberty that could possibly be spared. In a war safely fought three thousand miles from our shores, Americans, under Wilson, lost every liberty they could possibly be deprived of. . . . . When a Hollywood filmmaker released his movie epic “The Spirit of ’76”, federal agents seized it and arrested the producer: his portrayal of the American Revolution had cast British redcoats in an unfavorable light. The film, said the court, was criminally “calculated . . . to make us a little bit slack in our loyalty to Great Britain in this great catastrophe.” A story that had nourished love of liberty and hatred of tyranny in the hearts of American schoolchildren had become a crime to retell in Wilson’s America. The filmmaker was sentenced to ten years in prison for recalling the inconvenient past. . . . . On his last morning in office this terrible ruin of a man was asked to pardon Eugene Debs, rotting his life away in a federal penitentiary. Unforgiving, Wilson refused. He had pity only for himself. Today American children are taught in our schools that Wilson was one of our greatest Presidents.

In this regard, yes I would have preferred a simple bullet checklist, but compared to previous Manifestos, it is a step forward with concrete promises (eg. 1m new houses, nationalising the railways, ending zero-hour contracts, National Investment Bank…) mixed amongst the weasel words (eg “with social justice at the heart of our environmental policies”, “We will take action to tackle violence against women…”).

The US has run into the same strategic error that many colonial powers have made, namely that winning fixed piece battles is the same as pacifying the country.

Mountain ranges can induce atmospheric waves that travel up into the stratosphere and perturb the stratospheric vortex. … Without that perturbation, the stratosphere can just keep cooling down by radiating to space all winter while there’s no sunlight. This is why the Antarctic is so much colder than the Arctic, and why polar stratospheric clouds form there much more often. So…The ozone hole is worse in the southern hemisphere because there are fewer mountain ranges there. Earth science is weird!

We have a government in the throes of the most depraved 19th Century assumptions . Reply ↓ Cynthia May 7, 2017 at 1:44 pm Yes, what’s killing healthcare more than just anything else is overhead costs, which is literally spirally out of control! Some of these spirally costs are due to having a multi-insurer healthcare system, resulting in an overly complex and utterly opaque billing system, which has often been dubbed as a “Rube Goldberg” contraption that’s more likely to make you sick than get you better. However, quite a bit of these costs are due to providers, namely hospitals, having way too many managers and back office workers on the payroll. Over the past two decades or so, their numbers have grown by leaps and bounds, if not hyperbolically, while the number of frontline nurses, as well as frontline doctors, have remained essentially flat. It doesn’t take a doctorate in hospital management to understand that patient care and patient safety can’t improve by adding more layers of management or by adding more (electronic) paper shufflers to the back office or even by adding more consultant jobs to the payroll. Patient care and patient safety will only improve when hospitals truly put patients first, and that can only be done by adding more doctors and nurses to the frontlines. And this won’t cost hospitals an extra dime, in fact, it’s likely to save them money. Lots of it. The savings will come by shifting licensed nurses, as well as licensed physicians, out of the boardroom, out of the corporate suite, and out of the back office and onto the frontlines of care. For starters, hospitals could shift their assistant nurse managers back into a more traditional “charge nurse” role, where they can be effective leaders as well as providers of care. As a bonus, morale and thus retention among frontline nurses would improve simply because they would feel better, thus work better, just knowing that the person directly in charge of them is more of a supportive colleague rather than a ruling authoritative figure. Or, even better, cross-train these mid-level micromanagers to become care managers, as well as transitional care managers. This can be done without compromising patient care and safety. In fact, if anything, patient care and safety would improve, and surprisingly so, even to the biggest believers in micromanagement. Reply ↓ Kurtismayfield May 7, 2017 at 2:32 pm I love reading the bits of fiction that the health insurance industry sends me about my doctor visits.

I would propose the following: #1. Instead of health insurance companies giving the payments to the doctor, they write a check to the patient (actual money changing hands) #2. Then, the patient sends the payment to the doctor. If this system was in place I could guarantee that costs will magically go down. Of course you would have to ban rebates/refunds/kickbacks from the doctor to the health insurance company.

And there actually is no real distinction between say trying to buy a house in a neighborhood with good public schools and sending kids to private schools (and in some circumstances the full private school tuition is CHEAPER as the former is richly reflected in highly bid up housing costs). When happens when college educated people become parents though is they start thinking about these things. It happens almost invariably.

Then turning around and jumping on said plane for vacation. Yes the plane ride is environmentally damaging, but that is not the issue here, the virtue signaling hypocrisy is the issue. And again you chose to completely walk around the issue of nauseating liberal hypocrisy with your answer, non-answer.

I reported this incident to management​. They took my concerns seriously and that’s good. Because if I had needed any medical care, they would have been hearing from my lawyer. Reply ↓ Carolinian May 7, 2017 at 1:05 pm The same thing happened to me while walking in my neighborhood. Apparently small dogs with female owners can be quite aggressive and protective–at least that’s what the Dog Whisperer says. Since it was a neighbor I didn’t insist that she call the city and have the dog quarantined for rabies, which I believe is the law for biting dogs in most states. Reply ↓ craazyboy May 7, 2017 at 2:14 pm That amazes me. In my limited engagements with large service dogs is they are unbelievably docile, caring and intelligent. A great big black lab comes to mind – scratch her back and her whole posterior wags back and forth like Britney Spears on some really good crank. Another is a female magnificent pure white German Shepard, who adopted me at a party by first leaning against my leg, then slowly sat on my foot, pinning me into position for the remainder of the party. The owner was afraid she was permanently dumped for another! But I’d feel sorry for a dog cooped up at work all day. Reply ↓ Carolinian May 7, 2017 at 2:20 pm Dogs spend most of their time sleeping and like to be with their owners. They may see the office thing as a good gig. And I was bitten by a small dog–small but quick. Reply ↓ craazyboy May 7, 2017 at 2:35 pm Yeah, the usual alternative is not good – being locked up alone at home. The smarter they are the more they miss their humans, ironic as that may be. That’s when, driven by boredom, they chew up the $700 handmade British shoes or decide the toilet paper roll is a toy rather than the special purpose tool humans invented it to be. Then waddaya do?

It was a rescue and started getting very territorial. Thankfully her boss called me in to be the bad guy before something happened. On the other hand, I am glad that I can bring my dogs to work from time to time. I only do so when I need to keep an eye on them when they have medical issues. I have a golden retriever and a fluffy yellow rescue who, though advertised as such, is not a golden. They make the rounds when they first come in, then settle under my desk and sleep unless someone stops by to visit. Re: little dogs. When I was growing up our neighbor had an ancient chihuahua that everyone hated, including the neighbor. One day, my mom picked up a loaf of bread for her at the store and asked me to take it over. I approached the house carefully. The dog was nowhere in sight. When I knocked on the door the little bastard zipped out from behind a trash can and bit me in the a$$ with all two of its remaining teeth. I beat it over the head with a loaf of wonderbread until the neighbor came to my rescue. Reply ↓ lyman alpha blob May 7, 2017 at 11:59 am RE: What Is to Be Done in Venezuela? Thank you for posting this one – always a pleasure to read Greg Grandin. Good to hear a more balanced account of the issues there and nice to have a reminder that any current problems are not so bad as what was going on prior to Chavismo under the US-backed government of the time. Also glad he mentioned the strike in Brazil from last week that had tens of millions hitting the streets against the new extremely unpopular government that took over after the soft coup against Rousseff. I hadn’t heard about that before. Funny how we saw a lot more about her supposed ‘crimes’ in the runup to her BS impeachment but not so much about this.

But did not see any discussion of the worst own goal, two different official exchange rates, which allow insiders with access to the cheap one to both loot and get their own money out. Have to float, of course painful to insiders. Second own goal is land confiscation/control of farm prices to benefit city dwellers, which cuts local production a la Zimbabwe, similarly slashing domestic food production and boosting inflation. Have to get prices paid to farmers high enough to make a living. High or hyper inflation always begins with shortages, usually food, not money printing, which is a desperate attempt of a regime to maintain living standards of insiders and critical supporters, e.g. Military, police and judiciary. Eventually hopeless policies will be reversed, whether under the current regime or another, but lots of damage already, recovery will take a long time. Likely much worse before better.

Bernie will be 78 during the campaign. Reagan was 74 when he took office for the second time. So bernie is old, and maybe couldn’t stand the rigors of another campaign even if willing… and the vitriol will be worse than ever if he goes third, whether green or new. but what if he is willing, goes third party, and looks ok while campaigning? Would you vote for a typical dem or rep over bernie? You go to war with the army you have, not the one you want. I think he continues to hope he can reform the dems, but Perez shows him every day that’s not possible, they’re too addicted to the money. So every day, even as he tries to bring people to the dems by talking about popular policies people desperately need, Perez points out the real dem party opposes every one. Anyway, more flee that corrupt xxx every day… you don’t suppose Bernie is Samsun, pulling down the temple? Whatever. I continue to hope he can be drafted.

The sensible thing to do would be to designate it a UNESCO World Heritage Site and ban the use of supplemental oxygen – that would slash the traffic right quick. As the legendary Reinhold Messner said, when you use supplemental O2 you are not climbing the mountain, you are bringing its summit down to you. But na ga happen – the countries owning pieces of the mountain make far too much money from the sale of personal seat licenses, erm I mean climbing permits. Neoliberal mountaineering for the win! o “Pet dogs are the new must-have accessory at the smarter office | Guardian” — Shouldn’t that be filed under Guillotine watch? o “BUFFETT: Wells Fargo made 3 huge mistakes during the fake accounts scandal but one ‘dwarfs all the others | Business Insider” — Is one of them not being sufficiently systemically risky to threaten to bring down the global financial system should the government dare to do anything that might impact the firm’s share price? As the GFC taught us, ya gotta have that credible threat of financial nukage in order to get your execs immunized and allow top shareholders like Uncle Warren grift off the ensuing government bailouts. o “Trump wants a new Afghan surge. That’s a terrible idea | Politico. Do any of these people read any history?” — “Terrible” or not depends entirely by which metrics one is judging the “success” of the mission. “Buck for Bombs” being the one “these people” use. o “Donald Trump hasn’t quite thought through his first foreign trip to Saudi Arabia, Israel and the Vatican. Your weekly Robert Fisk fix.” — That’s a lot of rings to kiss. I expect DT’s personal trainers have him doing a strenuous regimen of daily lip-ups in order to get him into proper shape for the coming besame-mucho marathon. Reply ↓ PlutoniumKun May 7, 2017 at 5:25 pm There is really no need to permit any climbing of the big peaks. The Bhutan government banned all high Himalaya mountaineering in the late 1980’s after many deaths. They changed the laws and focused instead on promoting a trekking industry with strict regulations to insure only locals could provide guide services and accommodation. The result was a far better spread of the benefits of tourism to mountain people and far fewer deaths. There are still many very high peaks unclimbed in Bhutan because of this. Reply ↓ craazyboy May 7, 2017 at 7:02 pm Maybe Trump can get Alec Baldwin to go as his stunt double? Alec certainly has the facial pucker technique down… Then if they get Colbert to go in drag as Hillary in a pantsuit, any more gaffs along the trip can be deflected towards the Ds? It’s safer that way too. The Pope is the only one that won’t overtly get you killed. Even if he did, you just need to confess to the gaff, then you get to go to Heaven anyway.

 The inventor of the web Tim Berners-Lee on the future of the internet, 'fake news,' and why net neutrality is so important Mathias Döpfner, Die Welt May 7, 2017, 12:18 PM 3,597 facebook linkedin twitter email print Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, being interviewed by Axel Springer CEO Mathias Dophfner Die Welt Axel Springer CEO Mathias Döpfner sat down with Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, for a far-ranging conversation on the future of the internet, fake news, net neutrality, and the rising tide of censorship in countries across the world. A few of Berners-Lee's highlights: How Google's ad system led to the proliferation of "fake news" during the 2016 election. Why monopolies in tech are not as dangerous as they appear. Why net neutrality was critical to the formation of the internet and why it's still important today. Here's the Q&A: Mathias Döpfner:  In a way, you are the Konrad Zuse for the digital world. In 1989, you created the World Wide Web, which is basically seen as the ideal for transparency. Do you sometimes feel that this ideal is transforming into a monster? Tim Berners-Lee:  Over the decades, I changed my answer to that. For the first two decades, I would answer as a matter of principle that, when you look out there, you see humanity. Humanity has good sides and bad sides. The Web has to be an accurate mirror of humanity. Therefore, you will find bad stuff, and you will find good stuff, horrible stuff and glorious stuff. That was my answer for a long time. Now we’ve gotten into the age of social networks, I think the last couple of years have made a lot of people rethink. So having spent two decades trying to keep the Web open, keep it neutral, assuming that, if humanity has an open and neutral Web, then it will build wonderful things with it, like Wikipedia, etc. Now we’ve realized, actually, it might not. It depends what sort of system technically you build on the Web when you build something like a social networking system. Now, depending on how you design it, it can be lent to a more constructive argument or a less constructive argument. It can be lent to a propagation of wonderful sort or the propagation of hatred. Döpfner:  If you were to draw a line through the World Wide Web and digitalization today, would it be more good or more bad? Berners-Lee:  Net, more good. Döpfner:  Let’s go back to the ’80s when you worked in Geneva and, step by step, you came up with this groundbreaking innovation. How did it happen?  Berners-Lee:  Now you’re a journalist, and I’m an inventor, and journalists always ask inventors about the way we came up with it. Döpfner:  Some of the biggest inventions happen when scientists are looking for something completely different. Berners-Lee:  Yeah, some of those are very interesting. Döpfner:  Viagra was invented against high blood pressure. Berners-Lee:  Exactly. In this case, no. I had been working on problems like that for years and years and years, and I had worked on text formatting programs, and I had worked on data transition programs, and I’d worked on operating systems, and I’d worked on user interfaces. Everywhere I’d gone, I found myself frustrated by the fact that anything they gave you which was printed for a meeting, there’d always be a disc copy somewhere. So somewhere, there would be a copy of this thing going round and round on a computer, and that computer was probably connected indirectly or directly to the Internet, but once I had the piece of paper, I couldn’t actually search electronically without jumping through completely different hoops for each system. So the lack of interoperability between all the systems for handling information was frustrating. CERN was a great place. It was full of wonderful people, full of wonderful different ideas, and it was very diverse. So in a way, it had that problem of diversity and to perhaps a greater extent than most places. I wanted to solve the problem of lack of interoperability. I’d seen a lot of people who had actually tried to do that by building one single system, and whenever they’d done the centralized approach, they’d failed because they would decide to use the IBM mainframe. So I realized that the ideal would be actually to leave people using their existing systems. Döpfner:  Could you describe a little bit how long it took to really develop it and how many people had you involved? Was it a big team, or was it basically done in splendid isolation? Berners-Lee:  Well, what took a long time was getting the space to be able to work on it because CERN didn’t make general-purpose software. So I didn’t get any official go-ahead at all. Well, my boss Mike Sendall, in fact, he had a twinkle in his eye, and he found an excuse for me to do it. I’d given him a memo describing it, and I’d also said that I was really interested in getting a NeXT machine. The NeXT was a box. It was the thing that Steve Jobs did when he left Apple. So that was in itself a really interesting creative thing, and he developed that for people to be able to communicate. So Mike said, "Okay. You’re interested in the NeXT. Let’s just get one. We need to develop something just to test the NeXT box.“ So with a big wink, he says, "Why don’t you just try it out, that hypertext thing you were talking about or something like that?" So the NeXT arrived in 1990 in September. I started working in October. I had the Web working in the end of November, in fact after a couple of months really developing it. Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web. Die Welt Döpfner:  Sorry, from October to November, that would be just two months? Berners-Lee:  Yep. Döpfner:  That was it? Berners-Lee:  That was it, it was a really good development platform. Döpfner:  How high was the budget? Berners-Lee:  Zero. It was all unofficial, zero budget, but Mike allowed my 20 percent time to expand to 100 percent time. Döpfner:  That was crucial? Tim Berners-Lee:  That was crucial. I didn’t get back that memo that I gave him until after he died. His wife Peggy found it, and she found that he’s written on the top corner in a pencil, "Vague, but exciting." Döpfner:  That’s wonderful. Berners-Lee:  It was an exponential progress. Over the first year, it grew. The number of hits on our server, my personal server, went up by a factor of 10. The next year, they went up by 10. The following year, they went up by 10. So it was linear if you kept it on a scale of powers of 10. It was exciting, of course, because something that grows that fast was unusual at that point. One crisis was a challenge with the Gopher project. The University of Minnesota had a project which was a campus-wide information system quite like the Web. It worked on the Internet. It didn’t have exactly links, but it was competing, and in fact, it was more popular than the World Wide Web. At the time, the World Wide Web was increasing exponentially, and the Gopher project  was increasing exponentially, and it was winning. Then there was a point when the University of Minnesota said, "Maybe it won’t be royalty free. Maybe we won’t charge. Only the service, we won’t charge academics, only businesses, but if you’re a business, not now, but later, and a very small amount, but we might possibly reserve the right to charge for the system in the future." That was it. That was the end of Gopher on the Internet. So that was a big lesson. That was an opportunity in that the people wanted to know. They demanded a statement from CERN. So eventually, it was after 18 months of the project start, and on April 30th, 1993, CERN made that commitment to a royalty free license. Ten years later, all the members of the Web Consortium, all the industry members, also made a similar commitment to keep it patent free. So that was, in a way, the crisis of the early Web. If anybody’d ended up charging royalties for it, that would’ve just settled it. Döpfner:  Of course, you as an inventor had to be passionate about it. How about the other people in the institute or the people that were working with you? Did they understand the vision, or was there also a lot of opposition or criticism? Berners-Lee:  There was a lot of opposition because a lot of people did not understand what it would be like, and it’s really difficult to explain to millennials now why they couldn’t understand. Döpfner:  It´s  so obvious. But only in retrospect. Berners-Lee:  But then I’d show them a hypertext page, and I click on a link, and I go to another hypertext page. They say, „Big deal. You’ve got two hypertext pages.“ So what would happen is I would give a talk to a group of people, in an auditorium with 30 or 40 people, and most of the people would sort of nod and think another documentation system or something, but two or three people, you’d see their eyes crack. They’d think, „If everybody did this, this would be really neat.“ So they would come afterwards. After the questions, they’d come up and say, „Where do we get the software? Can we help?“ And so it spread. I suppose it spread in three dimensions. It spread to people who were interested in hypertext, which was an obscure form of backwater of the computing space, but there were some people who were interested in hypertext. So they were interested. I developed it on the NeXT, which was really rare. So people who had NeXT machines, they were able to download the thing over the Internet. And of course, physicists, I really had to try to make it appeal to this specific group. Döpfner:  Do you think that CERN was particularly privileged for such an invention, or could that have happened anywhere else? Berners-Lee:  I think it in a way could’ve happened anywhere else, but CERN was in a way a great place to try it out because it had... Döpfner:  ... experimental culture? Berners-Lee:  Yes there was. It had people who had the latest workstations on their desks because CERN would buy very powerful workstations with nice screens for doing the physics. So they ended up being useful to the World Wide Web. Because it didn’t have a strong hierarchy, it had people from different universities, different countries, those people came. So it was sort of a bit of a small-scale model of the rest of the world in its diversity, a lot of cultures, lots of different computer systems. So it had sort of the frustration of these incompatibilities. If it had been a big company, if it had been something like General Motors, then the manager would’ve said, „All right. We’re going to have a big central documentation system by next Thursday,  and everybody will use it.“ And that’s the end of the story. So it takes something very diverse. Döpfner:  Is there any advice that you could give to young people who have crazy ideas, who want to invent something great? Berners-Lee:  Well, CERN was a fortuitous place to be, but also, 1989 was a fortuitous time. The Internet was just coming. Here in Berlin, across a lot of the world, it was a time of massive change. The communities, the universities were getting actually connected together. I benefited from the work that Internet designers had done in building it as an open platform. Also, building it as a platform, I didn’t have to ask permission to use. So that’s true also of the Web. You don’t have to ask permission. If somebody out there has a brilliant idea, you can just go and think of a website you’d like to build. The way the Web works is you just get a computer, plug it into the Internet,  and design what the hell crazy website you like. You can be very creative. Really, it’s a challenge. If you’ve ever been to a website and felt that you could do better, well, you can. Go for it. It’s the openness, the permission of space. Döpfner:  Why did you decide not to patent your invention? Berners-Lee:  I knew from the beginning the goal was always to have one Web. If there was any commercial, if there were any royalties charged by whoever it was, then that company then would’ve become one of the Webs. Other companies would’ve immediately made incompatible versions of it. They would’ve built their own patents and own technology. Mathias Döpfner:  It could never get to a global standard. Berners-Lee:  I’d never get to the global standard. I wouldn’t get that key. Döpfner:  So it was not a moral decision at all. It was just  very logical, pragmatic... Berners-Lee:  It was a hard-nosed pragmatic decision, yes. Döpfner:  Did you ever think about how the Internet would look today without the World Wide Web? Perhaps as a kind of military tool for very few people? Berners-Lee:  We can never know.  Döpfner:  But would you agree that, basically, the World Wide Web transformed the basic invention of the Internet into a mass market success? Berners-Lee:  Well, the Internet allowed any two computers to communicate. The World Wide Web provided an information space for humanity to be connected. Because it was easy enough for ordinary people to use, it then pushed the Internet to people who in the geeky days would never have thought about buying a computer. You can remember what it was like with America Online, for example, perhaps the most successful of the walled gardens, but there were lots of them. There were dial-up bulletin boards, I think like Prodigy and Delphi, and then AOL was one. Each of those tried to be the single place that you go to for everything. When the Web came along, AOL got into trouble to a certain extent, first, they tried to pretend that the Web was a small thing and really part of AOL. Then people realized that AOL is part of the Web. However much effort they put into the walled garden, it could never compete with the crazy creativity. The classic AOL "yellow man" Flickr / Travis Wise Döpfner:  Before we go to the walled gardens of today: is it actually true that you were advised not to call it the World Wide Web because www is so difficult to pronounce in the English and French language? Berners-Lee:  I was certainly advised. People complained. WW was too much of a mouthful, but it was useful. Nobody else had thought of WWW, and it was unique. So we could count the number of Web servers, for example, just by counting the number of computers called www. Mathias Döpfner:  Did you consider any alternatives for the branding of this idea? Tim Berners-Lee:  I considered a few, well, Mine of Information. I called it The Information Mine because Mine of Information just in English is colloquial, conveys richness of things, of contents, but The Information Mine is TIM, which was a little bit too egocentric. Döpfner:  When the project was finished, did you realize that you developed something very big or was it more like: “this was an interesting project?” Berners-Lee:  This is still an interesting project. What are all the things we have to do to keep this project on track? So the phases, there’s never been a next. There’s never been, "Okay. The World Wide Web is now stable." Döpfner:  How close are we today to your original vision of it, and how far are we away from that? Berners-Lee:  Well, of course, the original vision didn’t foresee that the search algorithms would become so good. When people gave talks about the Web initially, the search engines were the butt of all the jokes because their results were terrible. But then the Google guys discovered this algorithm which looked at the links instead of the words.  Döpfner:  When did you meet the Google boys first? Berners-Lee:  I met Larry Page back a few years ago. Mathias Döpfner:  But not in the early days. They didn’t consult you? Tim Berners-Lee:  No, not at all. During those boom days, nobody had time to talk to anybody. Lots of things have happened that I could never have imagined. For example, the first maps that Steve Putz of Xerox PARC made were really clunky. You had to click to move the app, the whole thing. Then later on, you could switch the maps around. Now people using an online map find it so easy, and they’re so powerful, and they know when the buses run and everything. So we’ve come a huge long way. Döpfner:  What is the best thing so far that you have seen happening with and because of the World Wide Web and what is the worst? Berners-Lee:  I don’t put things in order. Döpfner:  If you don’t put it in order, is there any moment where you really had the feeling, "Oh my God, what they did, they simply abused my invention?" Berners-Lee:  One example of the system not really working as designed was the interaction between the for-pay advertising system and political system last year when these guys in Veles, Macedonia, just had websites where they were trying to attract traffic. They were using the Google Ad system. So Google would financially reward them very quickly if they could get more people to follow the links and click on more links. So these people during the election season, they ended up finding that, if you just wanted to tweet out a headline and get somebody to click on it, then the US election is definitely a great topic. Then the Google Ad system trained them just like you train a dog. In a way, it just gave them more money for the things which were more clickable. So they learned that untruth was more clickable than truth. Döpfner:  I think it was found out that Uber is tracking your movements not only while you are using the product, but they identify you or rather your mobile phone by means of a sort of digital fingerprint even if you deleted the app at some point. Is that something where you’d say, "Well, we should have expected that because everything that is doable will be done, and that’s all fine?" A sign is seen during a news conference to announce Uber resumes ride-hailing service, in Taipei Thomson Reuters Berners-Lee:  Absolutely not. No, I’m not one of those people. You might find Eric Schmidt, who famously says that privacy is over, get over it, but actually, no, I’m not one of those people. I believe that privacy is really fundamental to all. Döpfner:  Or they say that he who has nothing to hide has nothing to fear.  Berners-Lee:  Absolutely. That attitude is very sinister, but also, the idea that we have privacy only for things which we feel guilty about. We have privacy. Any company has things it discusses within the company. That’s how it functions. It can plan its new products. It can look at its successes and failures. You have groups within the company as well which don’t share things with the other groups.  Döpfner:  I think it’s an element of a free society that you have the freedom to define – within the framework of legality – what you want to share and what you don’t want to share within the framework of legality. If that is defined by other people, by political authorities, or by companies, actually, I think it is changing our model of free democracies. Berners-Lee:  Yes, exactly. Döpfner:  Would you agree that total transparency can lead to totalitarianism? Berners-Lee:  Well, that’s too simplistic. I don’t like to use the word transparency for that. If you’re having a meeting about how Berlin is going to fix the holes in the road and how much money should be spent on this, that should be public. It’s information by the public, for the public. The public is paying for it. So there is a duty of transparency. You don’t have the right to keep that private. I’m very much in favor of privacy. I think that Germany has been a great leader for the rest of the world in that case and so should hang in there. There have been times when Germany has led the EU into insisting on privacy throughout the European Union, and that’s been beneficial for everybody. Döpfner:  In a way, you could say there have been two iconic and culture-defining experiences in America and in Europe regarding privacy. In Europe, it’s the Holocaust. It is an example how total transparency was used an abused by the Nazis. They knew who was Jewish, where which Jews were living, what they did und thought. They registered and tracked each and every one of them, they even tattooed a number on their arms before putting them in a concentration camp. That was unlimited control, totalitarian transparency.  In contrast, the United States – their traumatic experience is 9/11. After 9/11,  in order to avoid terrorism of that kind, the most efficient way was total transparency. You know everything about your potential enemies, which means you know everything about your own population. You track everything. You spy on everything because that is considered to be the best way to avoid terrorism and ensure security. So it may be that these two traumatic experiences led to very different conclusions. Here is a deeply rooted sensitivity for too much transparency, there it cannot be enough transparency.   How do you experience these differences in mentality when talking to your colleagues in England and in the Silicon Valley? Berners-Lee:  So it is interesting to live half and half. When it came to open data, both the UK and the US were pretty good leaders. When it comes to privacy, then I think, to a certain extent, as I said, Europe has done better, but there are strong privacy guarantees in the States. The strongest things are the things that are constitutionally based. The most interesting example recently, when a loudspeaker manufacturer was taken to court, because when you listen to the speaker, if you use Spotify on your phone, you could hand off the Spotify playlist to that speaker using Spotify Connect, and then the speaker would then play it by itself. So the speaker would know which songs you were playing, and the speaker was reporting the songs to Bose, the manufacturer of the loudspeaker. So we noticed it. I tweeted about it. I don’t normally read the terms and conditions at all, but for the Bose speaker, I thought, "Why do I have to get an account at Bose just to use a loudspeaker?" And it turns out that they were monitoring them. So that is an example. They were successfully sued under wiretap laws, and they appealed to a high court, and they lost. So basically, the idea that you can do what Uber does, I think that the wiretap law is basically the interception of messages, and the interception of data is illegal in the States. Döpfner:  Some peope might be surprised, mainly because you can hardly be blamed for being anti-progress or anti-technology. It’s very difficult to say who should decide those questions of anonymity and accountability. Is it the company? Is it the legal system of a market, a country? I think that these developments are posing a whole set of completely new questions. Berners-Lee:  I think, by the way, that whereas initially it might be an AI, and then it may be the company, at the end of the day, the arbiter has to be the court system.  Döpfner:  Right. But was does that mean for fake news? Berners-Lee:  What’s the fake news? How do they define fake news in this case? Döpfner:  Well, that’s already where the problem starts. That means that, in the end, Facebook or another social media platform can define what fake news is, and I think it should always be the prosecutor and not a private company. Facebook should be a neutral platform. People exchange all kinds of things, good and bad, truth and lies. However, only if something is illegal, the prosecutor should intervene. If Facebook with its almost two billion users – ushered by well-intentioned politicians – morphs into a universal media monopoly making editorial decisions and even judging on who gets to read what, then we have a problem. And it is exacerbated if that happens in a closed system.  Berners-Lee:  Let’s talk first about a monopoly and then about data. We know about monopolies. Before the Web, there was the telephone system. A large number of countries had monopolies because that’s the way they decided to do the telephone system. It did mean that, if you were a telephone engineer and you had a brilliant idea and you weren’t working for the telephone company, you were out of luck because the telephone company was the only entity who’s allowed to sell telephones. But then they changed that and increased the amount of competition. Competition was improved. AT&T was broken up. Adam Berry / Stringer / Getty Images There was AOL, of course, which was pretty much a monopoly pre-Web. When the Web started, people were worried Netscape was far and away the most popular browser. So there was the concern that the company Netscape had potentially complete control over the whole Web until, one day, people turned around and realized that, actually, no, Microsoft not only has a dominant browser, but they have the operating system, and they’ve locked them together. So it’s worse. Why were they ever worried about it? Bring Netscape back in. So then they were worried about Microsoft, and they continued to be worried about Microsoft as being the dominant software player until, suddenly, they realized they weren’t worried about Microsoft anymore because they realized, no, it doesn’t matter which browser you use if you always go to the same search engine. So they worried about Google. Some, still worry about Google, but then some, they stopped worrying about Google because, actually, what people do is they Google Facebook, and they go to Facebook, and they spend the entire day on Facebook. Döpfner:  But that’s exactly the point. Berners-Lee:  There have always been monopolies. They have always been an issue. They’ve always been a concern. They have not always been permanent. Döpfner:  No, almost no monopoly in the history of business has been permanent. That’s why you could say we shouldn’t worry about monopolies because they will always be disrupted by other big aggressive players. In the long run, neither Standard Oil nor Bell Telephone Company survived as monopolies. Most of the monopolies were disrupted by competition, but in some cases, the regulator could help and had to help. Peter Thiel wrote that book on monopolies with an underlying theory or main theory that monopolies are for winners, and competition is for losers. Where is the balance? What should the regulator do in dealing with monopolies, basically leave it up entirely to the market because the market will resolve it in the long run, or restrict the dominant positions of certain players? Berners-Lee:  I think the antitrust system is really important. The market works while there’s a mix of people, while there’s a mix of big players and small players all in the same market. The moment that mix is gone, then the market’s not functioning anymore. Döpfner:  Is there a particular challenge for the digital world because of the effects of the network economy? There is that book by the famous Chief Economist of Google, Hal Varian, who used to be an independent professor and wrote a book about the network economy, where he basically proved that, in the digital world, you use or abuse your existing monopoly in order to create new monopolies because the old monopoly’s going to be disrupted. But if you let a player go that way too long, then the combination of monopolies with a search algorithm, with a browser, with devices and everything, can be simply too dominant. By the way: It’s funny that this principle has been implemented very systematically by Google. Berners-Lee:  I think one of the nice things about the digital world is the fact that the Internet was net neutral. The net was built as a neutral space without attitude. That’s why it has “permissionless”. That’s why I could build the WWW product on top of it. So the markets for the websites, the markets for content, the wide markets for whatever you build on top of the Web have been independent of the market for connectivity. So you could choose to get fiber at your house from a competing market without that affecting which movies you can watch tonight, so different from the American paid cable system, which the net replaced. So net neutrality has been a really, really important part of these new markets, but you can’t join them together. You shouldn’t bundle together the content. David McNew/Getty Images Döpfner: Are you advocating net neutrality without exception? Berners-Lee:  Yes. It’s been really important, and it is very important now. We should fight for it whenever it’s threatened, as it is currently under threat . Döpfner:  Again: How about the whole fake news phenomenon? How should society deal with that? Should publishers help Facebook to correct their fake news stories, or is it basically more about media education, that people should learn that not everything that is distributed on a social media platform is necessarily true? Berners-Lee:  I think we have to be very scientific and look at how these systems interact. The Macedonian websites we talked about earlier generated ad revenue by making up things about the US election, and affected that election even though their motivation was not at all political, only commercial. The ad network trained them that lies can generate more revenue than truth. As a system engineer, I look at that and say, "Well, now, something’s broken here." So one of the possibilities is for Google at that point to tweak the way they reimburse people not just on the clicks, but on some other function.  Döpfner:  So you could say the fact that Facebook is incentivizing people to distribute bad content, fake news, has to be changed in the very interest of the social media platform. Berners-Lee:  The guys in Veles, Macedonia, they were indepenent , they were not on Facebook. They were only on websites. They pointed at them with Twitter. So it wasn’t a Facebook phenomenon. There’s a separate Facebook phenomenon which I’m told was an important factor in the election. That is targeted advertising. Targeted advertising on social networks is very effective. There’s a blog. He claimed that what they did was divided the entire American voting population into 32 different subtypes, like Myers-Briggs, different sorts of people, different demographics, and so they could then send targeted information. So to one group with children, you’d say, "Our candidate is going to fight for education." Then there’s a group without children, and they can say, "Our candidate is going to save money by cutting down education"“ Because it’s targeted advertising, it’s not public so nobody can check. So one simple rule could be that you could say, actually, targeted advertising by political bodies is not democratic. Therefore, from now on, if you want to advertise as a political person, you have to say same thing to everybody because, that’s what democracy is. Döpfner:  You said at the very beginning that you think net-net, of course, the World Wide Web and the whole digitization of our society has more positive elements than negative ones, but among the negative ones, which is your biggest worry? A Turkey national flag is hung on a balcony in Istiklal Street near the scene of Saturday's bomb explosion, in Istanbul, Sunday, March 20, 2016. AP Photo/Emrah Gurel Berners-Lee:  I used to say blocking and spying and Web censorship. The censorship, of course, is bad, but if censorship is bad, spying is worse. The really bad regimes, they let you go to the sites they don’t like, and then they monitor you, and they find your family, throw you in jail. Döpfner:  Is there a government that is particularly worrying you? Berners-Lee:  Turkey is a classic example of blocking. They blocked Twitter, and they put it back on. I hope they realize that that’s no way to run a country and that it will just become so inefficient, and I imagine there will be protests. Döpfner:  Yeah, absolutely. And now they block Wikipedia. Berners-Lee:  That will be a battle. Some of the Middle Eastern countries have been pretty reprehensible in the past when it comes to spying on people and using that to round up their critics. Döpfner:  How about companies? Governments and their possibilities to manipulate and abuse data is one thing. The other thing is big international conglomerates that could also end up in the hands of certain governments. How do you see that? The first ring is governments, but the second ring is big companies, or are you less afraid by the role that big corporations are playing? Berners-Lee:  I’m just as afraid really. It’s funny. Growing up in the UK, and UK people have a fond trust of their government, but they’re deeply suspicious of companies. And in America... Döpfner:  …it’s the other way around. Berners-Lee:  Yes, they have a faith in corporations but are taught as children to distrust their government. I think the British contingent will end up overtrusting their government, and the Americans will end up overtrusting their corporations. Of course, sometimes, in China, it’s hard to tell the difference. Sometimes, in America, it’s hard to tell the difference, too. Döpfner:  But you are deeply rooted in the free market economy, aren’t you? Berners-Lee:  In the free market, yeah. Döpfner:  And free market needs competition. Berners-Lee:  It does need competition. Döpfner:  And diversity. Berners-Lee:  It does need to have a separate market for connectivity and for content. Döpfner:  To which degree will virtual reality, augmented reality change the Web and change the world? Is it hype, or is it a game changer? Berners-Lee:  In 1994 when we had the first Web conference at CERN, one of the sessions was on virtual reality, and it was on designing Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML). So we thought that, within a few years, by the end of the ’90s, all the websites would be 3D. They would just be so much more interesting. So I think it’s going to be really hard to make predictions. I think augmented reality is to an extent already there because when we use a map, then you have the ability to see more logical details about the things you’re looking at. Augmented reality will increase. Virtual reality, I think it would be great fun to try a world in which you and I can have this conversation. Döpfner:  Without being in the same room. Berners-Lee:  But where really the pixels or the stereoscopic system is so good, I really have to look at you very carefully to realize that you’re not here. Döpfner:  That you’re not here, yeah, and you can even have a certain simulation of the senses. Do you share the vision that, in a couple of years, maybe the normal conversation that people are having is not happening on the phone, it’s not happening through email? It is really happening like a virtual reality conversation where you basically meet without being in the same room? Berners-Lee:  I think a lot of people do that now. A lot of people meet on Skype and Facetime. Döpfner:  Yeah, but that’s a two-dimensional experience. You don’t really have the feeling, as you just described it, that you’re really sitting in the same room. Berners-Lee:  I don’t know. We’ll see. Döpfner:  So looking, let’s say, 50 years ahead, what will the world look like, particularly with regard to communication and the effects that digitization has on it? Berners-Lee:  Well, we’re at an interesting time now. The World Wide Web has been increasing exponentially, but now it’s got to 50 percent of the world. It’s pretty amazing that this proportion of the world is using it at all. We set up the Web Foundation a decade ago when the concern was that only 10% of t the world was using the Web. The challenge was the other 90%.   Now as we have got to 50% and people are getting online faster than ever, and soon the issues will change as they online world becomes the majority.  Then different things become a concern when most of sub-Saharan Africa villages are online, when 3G, 4G, 5G cell towers will be ubiquitous. People who can’t get online at that point will need a different sort of technology. There will be low earth orbit satellites, for example or something or balloons, but there has to be a new push to get them online. That push may have to be subsidized because those people will be in remote areas. But the problem will be that the discrimination against them will be much more intense because it’ll be so efficient for any company to assume their customers are online.. Döpfner:  So a widening gap? Isn’t digitization closing the gap? Berners-Lee:  A widening gap between those who have and those who don’t have because there will be a mounting assumption from anybody providing a service that you’re online. For a government or a company, just it will be economic nonsense to go to the trouble of catering to the people who haven’t bothered to connect. Döpfner:  But so far, until today, you could find very good facts and figures to prove the opposite theory, that digitization has closed the gap or that digitization has redistributed money from the wealthy to the not wealthy. Basically, if you look to the developing countries, they are more and more benefiting from digitization with regard to the accessibility of knowledge and the distribution of wealth. Berners-Lee:  It’s absolutely true, yes. No, I was talking about the last 10 percent. So as they benefit, yes, then the benefit to humanity is lots and lots of people can get healthcare information. It’s huge, clearly, although when you look at that sort of thing, you might see the benefit to the people who were poor are now less poor and are connecting throughout the developing countries. You might also look at where some of that money has all gone, and you might be very concerned about the economic distribution in the developed countries, which is worse than ever before. Döpfner:  The historian Yuval Harari just wrote a book called Homo Deus, where he basically says that mankind has had to deal for the last centuries with three main challenges. That was war, famine, and plagues. He said that these things are basically resolved. More people are dying from too much sugar than from not enough food. Never in history were less people dying from war and violence. most of the plagues are resolved because modern medicine has basically killed pests, pocks and almost everything. then he says the new project of mankind will be longevity or immortality. Is that something that you see as a big trend for the next decades if we’re speaking of a 50-year time horizon that people could live for 120, 150 years, or that they may even be able to live forever, like Ray Kurzweil has described it with his singularity theory? Is that something that you take seriously? Berners-Lee:  Yes, I do. Döpfner:  You do. That’s good news. Tell me why. Berners-Lee:  I take it seriously because, when I talk to people who build robots, they complain that it’s so hard to make them smart. They can’t imagine the singularity coming when they’ll be smarter than them. However, but when you step back and you look at the steps, the huge tasks that the AI community has checked off of machine understanding, machine translation, motion, all this planning, finding your way across a city, playing chess, that sort of thing, playing Jeopardy, diagnosing medical things, I feel that there’s certainly reason to imagine that the machines that we build will at some point become smarter than us. We have to decide what our priorities are and whether our priority is in fact to promote exclusively the human race or whether we’ll be promoting other machine intelligence. TED Döpfner:  So do you think, like Elon Musk, that there is a likelihood that artificial intelligence is going to be smarter than human intelligence and is going to win the battle? Berners-Lee:  I find it very hard to argue against that, yes. Döpfner:  So a last question, in that context: do you think that man and machine, robots and human beings are going to merge? Or is it more purely medical progress that makes it easier for people to live longer? Berners-Lee:  I think machine intelligence will help. It’ll be machines which aids, but a great intelligence I think will be designed by people, but it will be not a person in itself. Döpfner:  Timothy Berners-Lee is a living legend as an inventor of something that really has changed the world. Has that ever put pressure on you? Did it cause certain crises about your next projects or scientific research or invention? Berners-Lee:  Well, my day job for many years has been as the Director of W3C, and that has been a great community of people. It’s been very collaborative. It’s involved wonderful sparkling minds from across the industry getting together to build the Web from being the World Wide Web of static webpages as documents to webpages as programs and so webpages as a computer. Konrad Zuse invented the computer. In a way, what we’re doing is we’re making that invention but within the website. A webpage is now something you can program. So that’s been a huge change, been very exciting. Most of the time, in day-to-day life, people at W3C just know me as this guy who has got certain sometimes annoying personal feelings about how the architecture of the Web should be. People in the Lab, (MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, CSAIL), know me as another guy that builds things. Döpfner:  What’s the most important project that you’re working on at the moment? Is there anything that is particularly on top of your mind? Berners-Lee:  One of the things which we’re doing in the lab at MIT is we’re reacting to the world in which people don’t control their data by designing a technical solution that’s called Solid. The idea is that we imagine a world in which you completely control your data. So when you start an app, it says, „Where do you want to store it?“ I’ll store this on this computer, and I’ll store this in my Cloud. But whether it’s your computer or your Cloud, it completely reports to you, and you determine who gets to use it for what. So we’re imagining that world. It’s not just about privacy, but it’s much more about enabling you because we believe that the data that you have about yourself is actually more valuable to you than to anybody. Döpfner:  What are the books that you’re reading? You’re reading scientific literature, history books, or also novels, and if so, which? Berners-Lee:  I read all kinds of stuff, but I suppose I rarely read a book from beginning to end. I get pointed at so many things. I follow a few news sources on Twitter of reliable news. Random people introduce me to things. I’m in lots of different discussions on different media. Döpfner:  Is there any book that changed your life? Berners-Lee:  It would be tempting to talk about Enquire Within Upon Everything, but really, that was just the title of the book. The book didn’t change my life.  that was a Victorian book in which it was a sort of a Wikipedia. It was on my parents’ shelves, and I used it as a programmer as a title for the program I made in 1980 way back then in the days of green screens, so Enquire Within Upon Everything. Mathias Döpfner:  Do you believe in God? Tim Berners-Lee:  Not in the sense of most people. I’m atheist and Unitarian Universalist. Mathias Döpfner:  Thank you very much.  Disclosure: Axel Springer is Business Insider's parent company. Read the original article on Die Welt. Copyright 2017. Follow Die Welt on Twitter.

"Our health costs have gone up (incredibly) and will go up a lot more ... that is a problem this society is having trouble with and is going to have more trouble with. It almost transcends (political party)."If you talk about the world competitiveness of American industry, (health costs are) the biggest single variable where we keep getting more and more out of whack with the rest of the world."(The Obamacare repeal) is a huge tax cut for guys like me ... either the deficit goes up or they get the taxes from someone else."ON BERKSHIRE'S DURABILITY "I can't think of anything that can harm Berkshire in a material, permanent way except weapons of mass destruction."If that ever happens, there'll be more to worry about than the price of Berkshire."CHARLIE MUNGER ON PUERTO RICO "Who would have guessed a U.S. territory would wind up in bankruptcy? I would because they behaved like idiots." ON NOT BUYING AMAZON "I was too dumb to realize what was going to happen."I did not think (Jeff Bezos) could succeed on the scale that he has ... I underestimated the brilliance of the execution. It takes a lot of ability."It always looked expensive ... and I never thought he would be where he is today."We miss a lot of things."ON BERKSHIRE'S BREAK-UP VALUE "If I die tonight, the stock would go up tomorrow. There'd be speculation about breakups. Some of the parts might (temporarily) sell for more than the whole."ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE "Trade is beneficial to society but the people who see the benefits ... are getting small benefits, invisible benefits. The guy who's getting hurt by it ... is feeling it very specifically."ON STOCK BUYBACKS "When the time comes, and it could come reasonably soon ... we have to re-examine what to do with funds that (can't) be deployed well. It could be repurchases, it could be dividends. "At the moment, we're still optimistic enough about deploying the capital ... There will be markets where we can do (interesting) things on a big scale." ON JOBS "Our kids will live better than we do because America does get more productive ... It's essential to America that we become more productive." ON HIS LONGEVITY "We've been very, very lucky in life and so far our luck seems to be holding."ON HIS LEGACY "I really like teaching. If somebody thought I'd done a decent job of teaching, I'd feel pretty good about that."ON UNDERSTANDING TECH INVESTMENTS "I make no pretense whatsoever of being on the same level as some 15-year-old (who has) an interest in tech. "I've gained no real knowledge on tech, well, since I was born, actually."ON FUTURE ACQUISITIONS "We could do a very large deal if we thought it was sufficiently attractive ... We spent $16 billion back when we were much smaller ... in the fall of 2008. It never (created) a problem for me sleeping at night."Charlie and I really do not discuss sectors much ... we're really opportunistic. We're looking at all kinds of businesses all of the time. We're hoping, we get a call ... and we know in the first five minutes whether (a deal) has a reasonable chance of happening."We (like) companies where consumer behavior can be (predicted) further off."We don't really say we'll go after companies in this field or that field."If you're (primarily) interested in getting the highest price for your business, we're not a good call (to make)."ON BOARDS' STOCK HOLDINGS "I looked at a company the other day and seven of the directors had never bought a share of stock ... They've been given a lot of stock."What you want is a system that works well in spite of human nature."American business overall has done very well for Americans."ON A BERKSHIRE CEO'S SKILLS "You need a sensible capital allocator in the job of being CEO of Berkshire. And we will have one."Capital allocation probably should be close to their main talent."Berkshire would not do well if someone was put in with skills in other areas but didn't have the ability for capital allocation. "We certainly don't want somebody if they lack a 'money mind.'"ON PAY CONSULTANTS "If the board hires a compensation consultant after I go, I will come back."ON HOW HIS SUCCESSOR MIGHT BE COMPENSATED "I would actually hope that we would have somebody A) That's already very rich, which they should be. Working a long time and really not motivated by whether they have 10 times as much money ... and they might even wish to set an example by engaging for something far lower."ON HEDGE FUNDS "We've got two guys in the office managing ($20 billion) ... we pay them $1 million a year plus (more based on) the amount by which they beat the S&P. ... How many hedge funds managers say, I only want to get paid if I do something for you? ... It just doesn't happen."ON COAL "Over time, coal is essentially certain to decline as a percentage of the revenue of the (BNSF) railroad. We are looking for other sources of growth (besides) coal."In my mind, we're going to be shipping less coal 10 or 20 years from now. The coal aspect (of the business) is going to diminish."ON EATING JUNK FOOD "I don't mind having 500-600 calories for dessert. I'll let someone else have the broccoli."ON RUNNING A HANDS-OFF CONGLOMERATE "I think our hands-off style actually can add significant value to many companies. We free up at least 20 percent of the time for a CEO (compared to running) a public company."I think we bring something to the party." ON TECHNOLOGY HOLDINGS IBM AND APPLE "When I bought IBM six years ago, I thought it would do better in the six years ... than it has. Apple is much more of a consumer products business. In terms of analyzing moats around it, consumer behavior ... they are two different types of decisions. I was wrong on the first one, and we'll find out whether I was right on the second. "I could be making two mistakes on IBM. It's harder to predict in my view ... how much price competition will enter in something like cloud services.""We missed (Amazon.com) entirely. We've never owned a share."ON AIRLINES "It's a fiercely competitive industry. The question is if it's a suicidally competitive industry. It has been operating at 80 percent or better of capacity for some time. ... It's fair to say they will operate at higher degrees of capacity over the next five or 10 years than at historical rates. They actually at present are earning quite high returns on invested capital, I think higher than FedEx or UPS."It is no cinch that the industry will have more pricing sensibility in the next 10 years, but the conditions have improved for that."ON INTEREST RATES "I do not think it's easy to predict the (course) of interest rates at all." ON VOLATILITY "It is the nature of market systems to occasionally go haywire in one direction or another."When the rest of the world is fearful, we know America is going to come out fine."ON MARKET SPECULATION "(Keynes said) there's always some speculation. ... People can get very excited about speculating in markets. There's nothing more agonizing than to see your neighbor (getting richer). Early on in the development of markets there's probably some tendency to be more speculative than markets that have been around for a couple hundred years. Markets have a casino characteristic that has a lot of appeal. "China being a newer market ... is likely to have some pretty extreme experiences."Fear spreads like you cannot believe. The way the public can react is really extreme ... and that offers opportunities for investors."Markets are there to be taken advantage of."CHARLIE MUNGER ON BERKSHIRE'S ADVANTAGE "I think we have one big advantage. A lot of other people are trying to be brilliant, and we're just trying to stay rational." MUNGER ON BUFFETT "You're a fatter version of Mahatma Gandhi." ON WELLS FARGO, IN WHICH BERKSHIRE OWNS $27.8 BLN STAKE "At Wells Fargo, there were three significant mistakes, but one dwarfs all of the others. ... You have to be careful what you incentivize. There was an incentive system built around cross-selling. ... That was incentivizing the wrong kind of behavior."The main problem was they didn't act when they learned about it."ON BERKSHIRE'S EARNINGS REPORT "The realized investment gains or losses in any period really mean nothing ... We don't really think about the timing of what we do. We do not make earnings forecasts."I feel very good about the first quarter even though our operating earnings were down a little bit." ON VANGUARD FOUNDER JACK BOGLE "It was not in the interests of Wall Street to have the development of index funds, because it brought down fees dramatically. When Jack started, very few people, certainly Wall Street did not applaud him. He was the subject of some derision. And now we're talking trillions when we get into index funds. "Jack at a minimum has saved, in the pockets of investors, he's put tens and tens and tens of billions into their pockets. It's Jack's 88th birthday on Monday. Happy birthday, Jack and thank you on behalf of (investors)."ON AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES "Driverless trucks are a lot more of a threat than an opportunity to Burlington Northern."Autonomous vehicles, widespread, would hurt us if they spread to trucks, and they would hurt our auto insurance business. They may be a long way off. That will depend on experience in the first early months of the introduction. If they make the world safer, it will be a very good thing but it won't be a good thing for auto insurers."

Not being able to use the apps we’ve come to rely on daily, pull up information with a few taps, or even capture photos with our phones seems like it would be a modern-day hell. Even worse, going back to before we could send text messages by typing them out on a numeric keypad. And yet, for some people, that’s the kind of experience they want to return to. And it’s exactly what The Light Phone offers. Beginning life as a Kickstarter project back in 2015, The Light Phone is a credit card-sized phone that has none of the modern features we’ve come to expect. It’s got an almost Apple-like level of minimalist design, but no touchscreen. It can make and receive phone calls, display the time, and store up to nine numbers in memory. Emailing, photos, internet connectivity, and messaging are not possible. The Light Phone is priced at $150 and is available for pre-order to those who didn’t back the original project. The original Kickstarter backers began receiving their orders in January, and new orders are expected to begin shipping at the end of this month. The device has its own unlocked SIM card that’s compatible with 2G GSM networks in the US, and service is priced at $5 per month. Owning a smartphone is still required, however, as once owners sign up for an account, they install an app on their existing device that allows calls to be forwarded to and from the Light Phone. The convenience here is that users don’t need a second phone number. If you’re ready to experience what it was like before smartphones, or just want to be able to leave your glass slab at home and carry something that handles the basics, the Light Phone comes in black or white, offers 3 days of battery life on standby, and includes a SIM card and Micro USB cable for charging.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Mon, May 08, 2017 - Page 15　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Catcher’s Q1 net profit shrinks on forex losses Staff writer, with CNA Catcher Technology Co (可成) suffered a significant drop in its net profit for the first quarter of this year, mainly due to large foreign exchange losses caused by a stronger New Taiwan dollar. Catcher said on Friday that the fall in its earnings for the January-March period also came because its major clients were in a transition period before launching new models. Catcher is a metal casing supplier to Apple Inc and its statement echoed comments made by Apple chief executive Tim Cook last week that a delay in consumer purchases resulted from “reports about future products,” which affected iPhone shipments in the first quarter. Apple’s iPhone shipments in the first quarter totaled 50.8 million units, lower than the market expectation of 52 million units. Catcher said it posted NT$2.104 billion (US$69.7 million) in net profit for the quarter, down 77.9 percent from the previous quarter and down 49.5 percent from the same period last year, with earnings per share (EPS) at NT$2.71, compared with an EPS at NT$12.37 in the fourth quarter of last year and NT$5.40 in the first quarter last year. The company said gross margin fell 1 percentage point from a quarter earlier to 49 percent in the first quarter. Catcher said its non-operating losses amounted to about NT$2.27 billion, mainly from foreign exchange losses, as the NT dollar rose about 6 percent against the US greenback. It was just one of many Taiwanese export-oriented high tech firms to report foreign exchange losses. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電), the world’s largest contract chipmaker, lost about NT$6 billion, while Largan Precision Co (大立光), a smartphone camera lens supplier to Apple, lost NT$1.14 billion. Catcher said that the first half of the year is a traditional slow season for it, but momentum is expected to pick up and it expects to bounce back in the second half of the year. It left its forecast unchanged. From January through last month, Catcher’s consolidated sales fell 13.8 percent from a year earlier to NT$19.71 billion. Catcher has decided to expand a factory in Jiangsu Province, China, by investing US$1 billion to buy production equipment to meet future demand. Analysts said that the investment aims to secure more orders from Apple, which is expected to launch the next generation iPhones in the second half of the year. This story has been viewed 1646 times.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Mon, May 08, 2017 - Page 14　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Warren Buffett addresses arena crowd ONE THAT GOT AWAY:Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s top two executives acknowledged that they missed out on investing in Google years ago, but expressed pride in their firm AP, OMAHA, Nebraska Listening to chief executive officer Warren Buffett never gets old for the thousands of Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders who filled an arena on Saturday to listen to the billionaire investor at the company’s annual meeting. More than 30,000 people came to Omaha to hear Buffett and Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger talk. The 86-year-old CEO and his 93-year-old partner have been leading the conglomerate for more than five decades, but the crowd is always listening for new nuggets of wisdom. Buffett is known for his candor and plain speaking. Berkshire’s top two executives on Saturday acknowledged that they missed out on investing in Google years ago, but they expressed pride in the company they built through acquisitions and said they believe it would thrive for decades to come. “In retrospect, I think we were smart enough to figure out Google early, and we didn’t,” Munger said. Buffett and Munger avoided technology investments for most of their careers because they said it was too hard to figure out which companies would win. Berkshire now owns 133 million Apple Inc shares, but it just sold off one-third of its 81 million IBM Corp shares, saying that Buffett had misjudged that firm. Buffett had harsh words for Wells Fargo & Co managers who failed to respond promptly to a sales practices scandal that cost the then-chief executive officer his job last year. The bank last fall said that its employees opened up 2 million bank accounts without customer approval to meet unrealistic sales goals. “The main problem was they didn’t act when they learned about it,” Buffett said. Berkshire is Wells Fargo’s biggest shareholder. Buffett said he still believes in the long-term prospects of the bank even though Wells Fargo mishandled the scandal. Buffett said there is no change in Berkshire’s plan to eventually replace him, adding that one of the most important qualities his successor would need is a talent for wisely investing Berkshire’s cash. “We need a money mind as CEO,” said Buffett, who has no plans to retire. Berkshire plans to name one of its existing managers chief executive officer after Buffett is gone and the decentralized structure of the company allows Berkshire’s subsidiaries to largely run themselves. “We have an extraordinary group of good managers,” Buffett said. The executives who run Berkshire subsidiaries look forward to the meeting just as the shareholders do. Brooks Running chief executive officer Jim Weber said he is always careful about how much of Buffett’s time he takes up when he talks to him, so those conversations tend to focus just on Brooks’ running-shoe business. The annual meeting offers one of the few times Weber gets to hear Buffett discuss other topics. “I want to hear him talk about the economy and investing,” Weber said. “I’m looking forward to hearing him as much as everybody else.” Dozens of companies Berkshire owns set up booths in an adjoining 18,580m2 exhibit hall to sell their products and take questions about their businesses. The event offers Geico insurance quotes, See’s Candy, Justin cowboy boots, recreational vehicles and homes manufactured by Clayton Homes. “I think it’s a neat way to keep the enthusiasm up in shareholders,” said Jerry Meyer, who drove to Omaha with family from Coffeyville, Kansas. Buffett is the celebrity that everyone wants to get close to at the meeting. When Buffett toured the exhibit hall, he was surrounded by a pack of reporters, shareholders and security officers. While Buffett met Mr Peanut at the Kraft Heinz booth, Miami Dolphin player Ndamukong Suh wandered about 1m away without a crowd. This story has been viewed 1572 times. Comments will be moderated.

Jerick Ternida: A health-conscious model Jamie Marie Elona October 6, 2016 2:41 pm Branded PinoyLIFESTYLE 2.4K 0 Age: 45 Height: 5’5” Current Location: Abu Dhabi Philippine Hometown: Taytay, Rizal Hobbies:  Going to the gym, playing Basketball, singing, and watching movies Job: Personal Trainer at City Gym Meet our Branded Pinoy this week, Jerick. He started joining bodybuilding competitions in 1994 like Mr. Philippines and Musclemania World Championship. He won a number of times from the contests. He was the over-all winner in the “Muscleman Universe 2008” held in Miami, Florida, USA. Jerick is currently focusing in coaching since he retired in 2012. What’s inside your bag? I carry my needs inside my bag like my food and vitamin supplements on a daily basis. I also bring my daily important stuffs such as towels, toothbrush, sunglasses, extra shirt, keys, power bank, workout suits and baking soda. Baking Soda has so many uses like alternative for soap and also serves as natural deodorant. What electronic gadgets are you currently using? I am a big fan of Apple. I use iPhone 5S because I prefer a phone with a smaller screen size.  It is comfortable to use and easy to place on my pocket. I intentionally did not upgrade my phone for the mentioned reason. When I go for workout, I like to use my Dr. Dre Beat headphone that helps me feeling good during my workout. For my camera, I am using Canon DSL Camera. What’s inside your closet? I place all my important stuff inside my closet from T-shirts, top tank, shorts, jogging pants, jackets and other personal stuffs. I do have also my formal and casual collections. I bought a vault to keep my important documents like my passport What is your style of clothing? Being a trainer in the gym, I like wearing shorts, top tank, T-Shirts, sports shoes and it also depends on the weather. During winter season, I like to wear formal coat and a jacket especially when I go for strolling. What clothing brands do you think closely fit your sense of fashion? A brand for me has no significant preference when it comes to purchasing clothes. For me, the comfort and the genuine design are the factors I consider in buying clothes. Most of my outfit are from Nike, Billabong and EFS. What is your favorite perfume? It is very seldom that I wear a perfume not unless during special occasion. I have several collections from Dior Sauvage, Giorgio Armani and Hugo. I believe in the carcinogenic effect of the perfumes in our body that’s why I try to limit using it. What is your favorite brand of shoes? My favorite NBA player is Lebron James that’s why I am collecting some pair of shoes from Nike Lebron 12 and I am planning to purchase the Lebron 13 White. For some casual wears, I like the collections from Adidas. Since I am  New Wave baby, I like the Dr. Martens Boots and Creepers shoes by Underground UK. Are you a shopaholic? No. I only purchase an item if it’s necessary and could really pleases me to decide to buy it. That’s why I always keep my favorite quote in my mind “Buy what you need, not what you want”. During weekends when I get bored, I usually go out and visit health stores to explore what are the new offers for vitamins and body building supplements. I like to go out with my family to visit some restaurants as well.  We need to be always practical for us to reach our financial goals. What inspires or influences you to buy an item? Personally, my choice in buying something and availing services is largely affected by the celebrity endorsers from different fields. It has a big impact and influence to consumers. One important factor I consider is the advocacy for a certain product or brand where they get involve like in helping Charitable institutions. What brands do you trust for your skin care? When it comes to skin care, the natural is much better. I like to apply organic and natural products to my skin like apple cider vinegar, avocado, raw honey and baking soda. It is the best way to maintain a healthy skin and get rid of those toxic chemicals which some beauty products are using. What is a Branded Pinoy for you? Being Branded Pinoy means a Filipino who showcase his/her good character traits genuinely. We are known to be a hardworking people. We always show passion to our work that enable us to excel in any field. Ever since I started in body building, I have made a promised that I would excel and make my fellow countrymen proud of me. I have accomplished it when I won the major competition.  Facebook Comments Website Comments come here March 6th, 2017 Reply XY1nAw Muchos Gracias for your blog article.

Derby Telegraph Live: News now and traffic updates for A50,... 1 Jail for prolific Derby drug dealer Michael Falconbridge... 1 Derby burglar Damien Round back behind bars after committing... 1 Comments (0) These days our mobile phones, computers and tablets are among the most expensive items we own but, despite their value, we often fail to take action to protect them from theft. But there are things we can do to protect our property, according to Derbyshire police, and it only takes a few minutes. Police say: "It's always a good idea to write down the make and model of your phone, as well as your handset's unique identification number (IMEI number). This can be found behind the battery, or by dialling *#06# on most phones. Keep these details in a safe place and completely separate from your phone, as you'll need to give them to your service provider if your phone is lost or stolen. OTHER NEWS: Speeders, thieves and fraudsters: Who's been before Derbyshire's courts? "Whatever model of phone you have, your handset has in-built security features that you can use to protect it. If you don't know how to use them, take a look at your phone's instruction manual. For example, you can set up a PIN number that you have to key in before you make a call. This stops anyone else using your phone and protects any personal details your have in your phone book or your text message inbox. You can also install an application on some devices that helps you find it should it be lost or stolen." Police point out that you can register the details of your handset with the National Mobile Phone Register at http://www.immobilise.com/ This is a free service that allows you to record the details of as many of your possessions as you wish on a secure, offsite inventory. If you wish you can upgrade your free account and add photographs and certificates of ownership. It is the largest service of its type with over 15 million registered users, 22 million items registered, and over 16 million stolen items recorded. The recorded information can help you after loss, theft or fire when completing insurance claims and reporting stolen or lost property to the police and mobile phone networks. You should also register your phone's details with your network provider. BEWARE! This incredibly clever text message scam could cost you thousands What should I do if my phone is stolen? If your phone is stolen, report it immediately to the police. Call Derbyshire Constabulary on 101. You should also contact your network provider. They'll be able to block both the handset and the SIM card so that they can't be used any more. The police are more likely to recover your phone if you've registered it iPhone and iPad security Find My iPhone is an Apple app which uses the GPS device inside your iPhone, iPad and Mac to track it's location in the event that it is lost or stolen. It is a free application which can be downloaded from the Apple App Store and configuration information can be found on the Apple website. iOS devices with iOS7 have Find My iPhone's Activation Lock within the software, and can be found in Settings > iCloud. In the event that your iPhone, iPad or Mac is lost or stolen, you can log into your iCloud account on your computer and it will display where your iOS device is as long as it is turned on. From here, you can also lock your device, place a message on the lock screen and even wipe the contents of the device, returning it to its factory settings. As with any application it downloads directly to your home screen and is visible to anyone that physically looks at the screen. Therefore to prevent a thief deleting the app, it is worth hiding the icon in a folder so that it is not obviously visible. Find My iPhone is compatible with iPhone 4 and above, any iPad or iPod Touch 4th Generation or above with iOS 4.3 or above installed (just make sure your device is up to date via iTunes). In any cases of your items being stolen, report this to the police. OTHER NEWS: Mugger grabs mobile phone from Derby woman - in the middle of a call! Android security Similar to Find My iPhone, modern Android devices also have a remote locate and access feature with Android Device Manager. It allows you to locate GPS-enabled Android devices associated with your Google account, make it ring at maximum volume, lock the device, reset your device's screen lock PIN, and erase all the data on the phone, returning it to factory settings. Visit the Google Play store to install Android Device Manager. Derbyshire police offer more security advice on their website. Click here to find out more. LOOKING FOR A NEW JOB?

They even drew a diagram, which was shared with MacRumors, showing Touch ID placed below the Apple logo on the rear. Such a placement would make Touch ID easier to reach and help Apple avoid some of the criticism leveled against Galaxy S8, which has relocated its fingerprint sensor from the Home button found on the front of previous Galaxies to the back of Galaxy S8, next to its camera. Here’s an excerpt from the report: iPhone to ditch fingerprint sensor? We don’t think so. Both Samsung and Apple tried to enable in-display fingerprint sensing on full-screen OLED phones in 2017, but their optical tech seems immature and the major iPhone 8 bottleneck. Some thus speculate the fingerprint sensor will be removed and replaced by 3D sensing. Our latest supply chain checks indicate that iPhone 8 will still have the sensor given security, user-friendliness and a need for payments infrastructure, but there is a high chance it will be on the back like Samsung’s Galaxy S8. The diagram CLSA shared, seen below, suggests that iPhone 8 could be slightly larger than iPhone 7 but smaller than its Plus brethren at 144mm tall, 71mm wide and 7.69mm deep. Other features we can infer from the drawing include a vertically aligned dual-lens camera out the back and new sensors for the front-facing camera, possibly to support the previously rumored 3D sensing, facial recognition and augmented reality functionality. According to Benjamin Geskin on Twitter, his own source has dismissed CLSA’s drawing as fake and their research note as ”1000 percent false”. On the other hand, Android Police has called Geskin’s own leaks as fake, so there’s that. All that we see today, maybe it's the iPhone 7S with glass back and wireless charging. And not the #iPhone8 What do you think? — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 7, 2017 Be that as it may, CLSA’s report would definitely be in stark contrast to the recently leaked iPhone 8 manufacturing molds and technical drawings that show what appears to be a wireless charging mat on the back, but no rear Touch ID. For what it’s worth, older iPhone 8 schematics—some of which have been dismissed as possibly doctored—did depict a circular cutout on the back of the device, right below the Apple logo, that may or may not indicate a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. Apple is said to be prototyping as many as ten different iPhone 8 models this year, with some of them possibly being Apple’s fallback iPhone 8 model with Touch ID on the back. JPMorgan analysts speculated this week that iPhone 8 could feature enhanced stereo sound and waterproofing via an improved earpiece. JPMorgan added that iPhone 8 could ship with Apple’s $159 AirPods, potentially replacing the wired $29 EarPods with Lightning connector that come in the box with existing iPhone models.

It seems rather ridiculous economically – switching from a $29 headphone to one that costs $159. ravinigga I dont believe this anymore. The dummy show fingerprint on display or power button but back?

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS US Edition Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides Samsung Galaxy S8 iPhone 8 LG G6 Project Scorpio Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus VPN News Analysts tip edge-to-edge display, rear Touch ID and free AirPods for iPhone 8 Analysts tip edge-to-edge display, rear Touch ID and free AirPods for iPhone 8 By David Nield Mobile phones   The rumors keep arriving Shares Two high-profile teams of analysts have weighed in on the speculation about what we can expect from this year's iPhone 8, iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S - those companies who monitor supply chains and other secret sources to predict where the market will go next. According to JP Morgan (via 9to5Mac), the high-end iPhone 8 will feature an edge-to-edge display, a dual-lens camera on the rear, improved waterproofing, enhanced speakers around the front... and a free pair of AirPods. The firm also claims the lower-end iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus models will be backed by glass rather than aluminum. This mostly ties in with rumors we've heard before, so we're starting to get a very clear picture of what the iPhone 8 will involve. That said, JP Morgan doesn't have a perfect track record when it comes to Apple predictions, and the AirPods claim seems a bit of a stretch - especially with their high price and problems with supply. Touchy feely Elsewhere, CLSA (via MacRumors) signs up for the theory that Apple's going to put the Touch ID sensor on the back of the iPhone 8 because it can't work out how to embed it in the display on the front - an issue Samsung has also struggled with this year. Again, the provided schematics show a dual-lens rear camera. The rear Touch ID sensor is something we've heard about time and time again over the last few months, so it seems safe to assume that Apple is at least finding it tricky to work in a satisfactory sensor on the front, even if it manages to pull it off in time for September. As we've already alluded to, analyst firms have some well-connected sources, but don't always get everything right - consider these reports some extra speculation to assess rather than anything you can bet your house on. The iPhone 7S, iPhone 7S Plus, and iPhone 8 are expected to be announced in September, though there may be a delay on availability for the iPhone 8. iPhone sales flatten out in the run up to the iPhone 8 launch Related news Amazon deals for Mother's Day give you big Echo and Kindle discounts Download of the day: CyberGhost VPN Facebook's original shows could be arriving next month 10 Touch Bar tools that will change the way you use your MacBook Pro See more Mobile phones news Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!
