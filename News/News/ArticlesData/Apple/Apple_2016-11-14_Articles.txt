Apple.Com/Mac Apple launched its newly revamped MacBook Pro during a company event in California last month. The flagship laptop underwent a large-scale upgrade for the first time in four years and now features a new OLED touchscreen panel situated above the keyboard called the Touch Bar. But is the new feature really worth buying the new Apple laptop? Thankfully, owners of old MacBook Pro models can try out the new Touch Bar feature on their current laptops by using a new app called Touché. The app is currently made available to download and it is not complicated to install. It can be launched and shut down easily just like any regular app. Users can also produce screenshots of the Touch Bar and what it displays. The Touché app was created by Daniel Jalkut, who has also developed other apps like the blogging utility MarsEdit. He founded Red Sweater Software after leaving his job as a software engineer at Apple. The Touché app is free to download and use. A number of Apple apps have Touch Bar support with the most recent macOS version. According to 9To5Mac, The 1Password app and similar third party utilities have also added Touch Bar support. The Touché app allows users to detect exactly how macOS and certain apps shall handle the Touch Bar without the need for a new MacBook Pro to adequately visualise it. While the app is free, it requires the latest macOS Sierra version 10.12.1, specifically build 16B2657. Users can update to the required version at Apple’s official support site. The new MacBook Pro model’s Touch Bar has several functional capabilities that enable a variety of commands on certain apps, but it doesn’t quite captivate users that long for full touchscreen displays. Those who have pre-ordered the latest Apple laptop may see their new Macs arrive soon as initial shipments were made on Saturday.

Apple Pay support for charitable donations kicked off on Tuesday with nonprofits ranging from global organisations such as Unicef and WWF. "We're making it incredibly easy to give back with Apple Pay," said Apple Pay's Vice President Jennifer Bailey. "We think offering such a simple and secure way to support the incredible work nonprofits will have a significant impact on the communities they serve," Bailey added. More nonprofits will offer Apple Pay over the coming months so their supporters can make easy, secure and private payments, the Cupertino-based company said in a statement. "We are thrilled that more people will help WWF tackle urgent conservation issues this holiday season and beyond with their donations via Apple Pay," said Senior Vice President Terry Macko of Marketing and Communications, WWF.

Citing people familiar with the matter, the outlet says it’s still the exploration phase, but if the project is given the green light, the glasses could launch as early as 2018. The glasses would connect wirelessly to iPhones, and project images and other information into the wearer’s field of vision. Sources say it’s possible that they could utilize augmented reality, and it seems likely given Apple’s public interest in the tech. Apple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, the people said. Apple hasn’t ordered enough components so far to indicate imminent mass-production, one of the people added. Should Apple ultimately decide to proceed with the device, it would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, another person said. The Cupertino, California-based company tests many different products and is known to pivot, pause, or cancel projects without disclosing them. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. With iPhone sales stagnating, Apple is under pressure to find success in new product categories. The wearables space is particularly hot right now, and several tech companies are exploring digital glasses, but the jury is still out on growth potential.

Reuters/Stefan Wermuth The iOS 10 jailbreak tool is still elusive and fans, who look up to Chinese hacking group Pangu for regular jailbreak tools, are frustrated. The hacking group has not released anything since September when Apple first launched its operating system. Many believe that Apple’s regular updates on its operating system are the primary reason for the delay. Fans are still waiting for the iOS 10.0.1 jailbreak tool. Meanwhile, known hacker Luca Todesco has claimed that he has a jailbreak ready. pic.twitter.com/7AaG3ZyVkB &mdash; qwertyoruiop (@qwertyoruiopz) November 6, 2016 “Updated my stuff so it works on 10.1 too now,” Todesco wrote on a Twitter post. Updated my stuff so it works on 10.1 too now. &mdash; qwertyoruiop (@qwertyoruiopz) November 6, 2016 Numerous followers of the hacker want him to help out Pangu in releasing a mass jailbreak tool for the people. However, such a partnership seems unlikely. Todesco has earlier come up with jailbreak tools but never offered help to Pangu. However, the hacker’s Twitter posts do prove that an iOS 10 jailbreak is very much possible. Other groups have also claimed to have jailbroken the iOS 10 operating system though Todesco claims they are all fake claims. If at all there is any truth behind these claims, hacking groups need to release the iOS 10 jailbreak tool quickly as Apple could be working on a beta test of iOS 10.2 already. Only registered beta users will have access to this. Many however believe that it is impossible this time to jailbreak Apple’s new operating system and that finally the Cupertino-based tech giant has been able to stump hacking teams. Hackers have also claimed that they can’t promise an iOS 10 jailbreak tool as the tool is still unstable. In fact, there may not be any public release. As per The Bitbag, a team named Unlock-Jailbreak has claimed to have cracked open Apple’s iOS 10 though they have not posted any details on how to download it. Thus, jailbreak hunters can do nothing but wait for a foolproof tool.

Login Search Tech Stock Roundup: AAPL Upgrade, GOOGL-EU, BABA Singles Day November 14, 2016, 03:04:00 PM EDT By Sejuti Banerjea, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo The election was the biggest event last week, easily blotting out everything else, especially because of the surprise President-elect. But that didn't stop a hot Apple AAPL rumor from KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo; or Alphabet's GOOGL defense of its Android ecosystem; or the gangbuster Singles Day numbers from Alibaba BABA . So read on… Apple May Not Upgrade iPhone SE KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo is famous for breaking Apple product-related news. This time, he's saying that the company may not refresh the budget iPhone "SE" line next year. The rationale is purportedly to boost demand for the more expensive and higher-margin iPhone 7, while also pressuring SE component makers to reduce prices. This pressure may increase because Apple is now selling refurbished, certified iPhones from its online store. The iPhone SE is a very competitive and lighter phone, especially if you can make do with a smaller screen and 64GB storage, don't mind a somewhat weaker front camera and more limited water resistance, and also really want the headphone jack. The analyst feels that not refreshing the SE, weaker China demand and lower 4.7-inch volumes will impact iPhone sales next year. He forecasts an iPhone shipment volume decline to between 35 and 40 million (40.4 million units were shipped in 2Q16). He also has reservations about component price declines. Google Defends Android Google has its rival Yandex to thank for this one, as the leading Russian search engine's (until it was displaced by Google) complaint to the Competition Commission precipitated proceedings. In 2013, Google rivals Microsoft MSFT , Nokia and Oracle ORCL had gone to the EU through an umbrella organization called Fairsearch. But it was hard to pin Google guilty, leading to the case dragging on. But when in Russia, Google required phone makers to pre-install Google search (just as everywhere else) instead of Yandex, the company went to court. In this case, the EU is investigating 3 angles as Techcrunch pointed out so well- that Google is allegedly "requiring and incentivizing" smartphone and tablet manufacturers to exclusively install its own services, and in particular its search engine that it is allegedly bundling certain Google products with other apps & services whether Google is hindering the ability of smartphone and tablet makers to use and develop other OS versions of Android (aka Android forks) If found guilty, Google will have to pay up to 10% of revenue, or around $7.4 billion. The crux of Google's response of more than 100 pages is that Google's practices are with a view to prevent fragmentation of the platform without which Android would be weakened and competition would in fact be impaired. It says that the Commission's decision to omit Apple as a competitor appears arbitrary and partisan. It makes no sense because the Commission's own survey revealed that 89% of respondents consider Apple and Android as competing platforms . Besides, it allows the Commission to conveniently ignore the fact that 39 out of 39 pre-installed apps on iPhone 7 are from Apple, and 39 out of 47 pre-installed apps on the Microsoft Lumia 550 are from Microsoft. Android has allowed phone makers to bring cheaper phones to the market and has helped millions of app developers. A weak platform would be bad for everyone. In the words of Kent Walker Google's general counsel, "The response we filed today shows how the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers, and mobile network operators. Android hasn't hurt competition, it's expanded it." Alibaba Singles Day Alibaba had a record Singles Day with sales of $17.79 billion, up from the record $14.3 billion last year and short of the $20 billion analysts were projecting. But these sales are nothing to scoff at: 2015 sales in the U.S. on Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined and from all stores (both online and offline) totaled $19.4 billion. This year, Singles Day moved across the border, with the top markets for Chinese goods being Russia, Spain, Israel, Ukraine and France. Top markets selling to the Chinese were Japan, U.S., South Korea, Australia and Germany. The most popular brands were Apple, Nike, New Balance, Siemens, Philips and Adidas. Around 37% of shoppers bought from international stores with virtual reality creating new experiences like Chinese customers browsing the isles of Macy's store in New York without ever leaving their seats. But clouds are looming for Alibaba with the election of Donald Trump. The company's business hinges on China-U.S. relations, so it will be negatively hit by Trump's decision to charge a heavy tax on Chinese goods. If the Chinese government reacts with similar duty on U.S. goods, Alibaba will be affected very badly. The other concern is with respect to its accounting practices, particularly with respect to its Singles Day sales, for which the company is being investigated both in the U.S. and in China.

Adam Mosseri, VP of product management at Facebook says, "In Newsfeed we use various signals based on community feedback to determine which posts are likely to contain inaccurate information, and reduce their distribution. In Trending we look at a variety of signals to help make sure the topics being shown are reflective of real-world events, and take additional steps to prevent false or misleading content from appearing. Despite these efforts we understand there's so much more we need to do, and that is why it's important that we keep improving our ability to detect misinformation." The company earlier formed an alliance with various media houses for similar reasons although the possibility of potential business partners colluding to suppress or misinform the public for vested interests is a bit unsettling. Singapore Civil Service Chooses Facebook Workplace : Singapore's civil service is adopting the Facebook Workplace platform for its pool of 143K (and growing) public servants by March 2017. The platform is inexpensive at just a dollar per user per month for groups larger than 10K people, so it's a good deal for Facebook as well. In fact, this is the first deal of its kind for Facebook and underscores the platform's popularity in Asia. Legal/Regulatory Irish Finance Minister Will Go to Bat for Apple : The EU Competition Commission has determined that Apple owes taxes to the tune of $14.5 billion for illegally transferring profits generated in Ireland to a titular head office in a tax free zone. Irish Finance Minister Noonan says that the Commission is acting out of its jurisdiction because tax is a matter decided by individual countries and the competition angle is just a back door to meddle in the member nation's internal affairs. The tax breaks enjoyed by Apple are part of state aid that some European countries resort to with the objective of attracting investment in the region. Apple has around 6K employees in Ireland. In September, the cabinet approved Ireland's joining Apple in appealing the EU's demand, and Noonan submitted his appeal last week. LinkedIn Banned in Russia : The professional network faces a ban in Russia because of a law passed in 2014, requiring websites storing personal data of Russians to store it in servers within the country, says Russia's Roskomnadzor communications watchdog. LinkedIn reportedly has 6 million users in the country, so it could be a near-term blow. However, the problem may not be long-lived given its pending acquisition by Microsoft. Amazon Refunds for In-App Purchases : A federal judge has ruled that Amazon AMZN must take the responsibility of informing and then refunding parents, when their kids run up bills related to unauthorized in-app purchases. While judge Coughenour agreed with Amazon that the $26.5 million decided by the FTC was too high, he ruled out lump sum payments and gift cards for the amount as Amazon would collect profit on goods sold through gift cards. In similar dealings, Apple and Google coughed up around $32.5 million and $19 million, respectively. Unauthorized purchasing has been curtailed however, with the help of improved controls since then. New Technology/Products Pre-Owned iPhones Now on Sale : Last September, when Apple introduced the concept of iPhone annual upgrades and AppleCare+ for $32 a month, I had speculated that they wanted to build inventory of phones on which manufacturing cost was already recovered to target emerging markets like India. But competitors protested this in India, so Apple needed a Plan B (which may have also been in the works actually). With the anniversary up, Apple would be receiving these phones about now. So it is selling these refurbished (new battery and outer shell) phones after testing and certifying them at a 15% discount through the app store and making a huge profit. Apple is reportedly selling eight versions, all with a one-year warranty. The decision is also of great strategic importance as it could prevent users from moving away to cheaper phones from competitors. It's also a way for Apple to further expand its user base, enabling it to sell more services. The current rates are $399 for the 4GB model, which sells for $499 at full retail and $499 for the 8GB model, which sells for $599. Facebook App for Emerging Markets : Facebook is determined to eat Snapchat's lunch and the leading social network is doing about all it can to replicate Snapchat-like features such as Instagram stories, "secret" (erased after some time) conversations and more. Now it's launched Flash, a Snapchat-like platform targeted at emerging markets like Brazil, Indonesia and India where the Facebook brand name is very well recognized. This may cap Snapchat's progress in emerging markets while strengthening Facebook versus this picture-sharing networking platform. Intel's New Chip Tech : Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland has called out Intel's high-speed, in-package optical interconnect silicon photonics technology as a product with the capacity to "revolutionize the semiconductor industry". As the analyst says, it will definitely mitigate the effects of a slowing Moore's law by reducing the interconnect time between Intel's Xeon Server CPUs and Altera's FPGAs, i.e. until Intel integrates the technology into a single piece. The analyst also said that Intel has "proof of concept" chips and is looking to improve current low production yields. This could lead to a commercial product just three to five years down the line. Rolland estimates that data transfer rates may start at 50 to 100 gigabits per second with the new chips, but could increase to a half terabit or 2 terabits by early next decade, he said. Google, Apple App Store Updates : Both Google and Apple have huge app marketplaces, which might make it difficult for developers to reach buyers. The two companies are therefore always looking for ways to help developers get their apps seen. Google had many encouraging announcements such as a) allowing developers to offer limited-time discounted subscription pricing for their apps b) a promise to expand the Google Play Store to wearables, VR headsets, and Chromebook laptops for easier distribution from a single marketplace and c) a decision to employ machine-learning algorithms more heavily to provide app recommendations for Google Play users. Apple, which earlier this year promised developers a bigger revenue share and more reviews for new apps, announced that they can now create early-access promotional codes for new apps that can be offered to journalists and reviewers. These should help them generate more publicity for their new apps and in-app purchases. Some Numbers Google Home vs. Amazon Echo : IHS Markit says that Google Home will solidly beat Amazon Echo by 2020, shipping 5.4 million units that year, while Amazon will be stuck at 2.4 million units. Amazon does have a first mover advantage right now, but it will evaporate over the years as Google uses its treasure trove of data to more fruitfully apply artificial intelligence according to the research firm. Apple is also expected to join the fray with a device based on Siri. The Google device is fifty bucks cheaper at $129, but lacks Amazon's skills (app ecosystem). This should be a very short-term hurdle as Google has the wherewithal to more than catch up here. NVIDIA Results : NVIDIA reported solid results this past quarter with its adjusted EPS of 83 cents far outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents on the back of solid revenues that also beat our expectations by a wide margin.

TOUCH. A guest checks the Touch Bar on a MacBook computer shown in a demo room. (AP PHOTO) The new Touch Bar, which is both a narrow display and a control panel, replaces the old physical function keys on a traditional laptop. It will offer a variety of controls that change according to the app or website that’s open. It also has functions that will be familiar to many iPhone users — showing word suggestions as you type, for example, or letting you scroll through a library of emojis. New features, higher price The company unveiled the laptops at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, where executives showed how the Touch Bar works with a variety of apps and software — providing playback and editing controls for videos or music, for example, and search functions for Apple’s maps and photos apps. Apple is also opening the Touch Bar to work with outside software, including Adobe’s Photoshop editing program and Microsoft’s Word, PowerPoint and Skype. Along with faster processors and brighter screens, two of Apple’s new laptops will also get a fingerprint sensor, similar to the one on iPhones. The sensor can unlock the device, authorize software installations or recognize a different user and quickly switch to that person’s settings. It works with Apple Pay, so users can authorize an electronic payment for online purchases. At least for now, the new Touch Bar and Touch ID features will be available only on higher-end models — a 13-inch MacBook Pro that starts at about $1,800 and a 15-inch MacBook Pro at about $2,400. Both ship in a few weeks. Apple is also selling a 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar or Touch ID, but with other improvements, for about $1,500. DEMO. An experienced design manager at Adobe Photoshop gives a demonstration of using Touch Bar during an announcement of new Apple products. (AP PHOTO) Baby steps in TV Cook also used the event to promote a newer endeavor, Apple TV, and a new unified menu feature that shows recommendations and new episodes of recently watched shows, so viewers don’t have to search through different apps to find them. Apple’s app, though, is short of a full-fledged streaming-TV service, which reports say Apple has been pursuing. Rather, it brings together TV shows and movies viewers already get through individual subscriptions. The TV app, coming in December, will be synced with iPhones and iPads, so viewers can catch the next episode regardless of device. Apple said its Siri voice assistant will also direct viewers to live events, such as streaming sports. Apple said Apple TV already has 8,000 apps, including more than 2,000 games. The addictive building game “Minecraft” will come later this year. (AP) Shortlink: Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

By Tony Park - 14 Nov '16 23:17PM (Photo : Stephen Lam/Getty Images) Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller introduces the all-new MacBook Pro during a product launch event on October 27, 2016 in Cupertino, California. Apple Inc. is expected to unveil the latest iterations of its MacBook line of laptops. The mid-level 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro offers a new experience for Mac aficionados - a Touch Bar with Touch ID- which gives users another way to interact with the laptop's programs and data. Some find the new function's usefulness obvious and immediate while others see it as overly complicated and unnecessary. Overall, the Touch Bar is a useful and versatile function. Advertisement Priced at $1,799, the Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is probably among the best ultraportable laptops available in the market right now, says PC Magazine, which describes the 13-inch MacBook Pro as thinner, lighter, and more powerful MacBook Pro. The magazine highlights the MacBook Pro's compact and sturdy chassis. The Touch Bar is an additional innovation to the well-designed and powerful 13-inch MacBook Pro. It replaces the useful function keys which include brightness up and down, volume up and down, and mute. A set of always-present buttons allows users to use those controls on the right hand side of the Touch Bar. According to The Verge, the MacBook Pro' Touch Bar can be customized by developers with their apps. There will future support for Photoshop, Office, Pixelmator, and DaVinci Resolve. The website finds the Touch Bar's simplest uses as often its best such as having a button in Photos that allows users to flip back and forth between edited and original picture. As for the MacBook Pro 13-inch's hardware, the laptop comes with an Intel i5-6267U processor with Intel Iris 550 graphics, four USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB solid-state drive. An option of up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of SSD space at purchase is also available at purchase. Advertisement The MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar is designed for interoperability with iOS, Apple TV, and watchOS. Battery life will last all day. The Touch Bar adds some genuine innovation, but adapters and all-new peripherals are required as with all new Apple laptops.

Photo: Apple If you’re itching to get your hands on a new MacBook Pro — and your fingers on its new Touch Bar — the wait will soon be over. Sources have revealed to 9to5Mac that the newly updated MacBook Pro will be available to try and buy at Apple Stores as soon as Thursday. The new MacBook Pro made waves with tweaked specs, including a surprisingly low 16GB ceiling for RAM. It also tosses out traditional function keys in favor of the slim new Touch Bar, a color OLED strip with keys that change according to the program you are using at the. MacBook Pro finally ships Prior to this, the new MacBook Pro was only available via online orders, with an estimated wait of four to five weeks for delivery. Shipping times have continued to slip after orders started, but early birds who pre-ordered started receiving notifications that their Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pros are preparing for shipment last week. The units should start shipping soon. Along with the new MacBook units, Apple stores will start stocking the latest LG UltraFine 4K and 5K displays, which were announced at Apple’s October event. They will be sold exclusively at Apple stores as well as on Apple’s website, where you can already order the 4K model (assuming you’re willing to wait up to six weeks for it to arrive). Plenty of people were scratching their heads at the news that new MacBook Pros would feature USB-C ports exclusively, requiring adapters and dongles for any other type of connection. The backlash led Apple to slash prices on its line of USB-C adapters. The company also dropped prices for a limited time on both the new LG displays. As for the new MacBook Pros, exactly which stores will have them in stock remains unclear. It’s a pretty safe bet that most of Apple’s mainstay locations will roll them out later this week. And if you’re still looking to find out more about the new MacBook Pros with Touch Bar, the first raft of official reviews from sites like The Wall Street Journal, The Verge and CNET have gone up ahead of the launch.

It was going to be my first macbook pro. I have used Dell for years and I am not happy about the windows 10 garbage fire. However, I am extremely disappointed in the new macbook pros. Was there no one at apple that was like “hey, I’ve got a better idea, instead of pissing off all of our customers with expensive dongles to connect ANYTHING to our laptop, why don’t we have a transition model where it is part USB type C and party regular USB”…… At least they kept the headphone jack. I guess I will go buy a razor laptop. It’s only 1/4 of a pound heavier, and has better EVERYTHING. RyanTV You’d let a $9 USB adapter keep you from buying a MBP? Please.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple The Better One Between MacBook Pro Sans Touch Bar vs. MacBook Air Corazon Victorino IBTimesNovember 14, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share The MacBook Air is still not dead, even though Apple did not introduce a late-2016 upgrade alongside the new MacBook Pros. For the most part, the 13-inch MacBook Air is internally competing with the MacBook Pro without Touch Bar. Find out which laptop is better in this comparison review.More Apple dropped a bombshell last October when it announced three new MacBook Pros and not a single upgrade for its MacBook Air line. In addition, it decided to end the 11-inch MacBook Air series and to simply move forward with the unchanged 13-inch MacBook Air. What’s worse is that the 13-inch Air now internally competes with the MacBook Pro without Touch Bar for market attention. If you are wondering which Apple laptop is better between the two, this comparison review can help you decide. Performance On paper, the 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar easily trumps the 13-inch MacBook Air because the former comes with either a 2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor or a 2.4GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost technology that can speed up the cores for up to 3.4GHz. On the other hand, the the 13-inch MacBook Air only comes with either a 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor or a 2.2GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor. When Turbo Boost kicks in, the Air’s cores can speed up to 3.2GHz. Both have 8GB of RAM, so the two devices are expected to do well in handling multiple tasks. When it comes to their tested performance, their Geekbench ratings also show the significant difference on the performance they can deliver. The Core i5 MacBook Air has a single-core score of 2624 and a multi-core score of 5210, while the Core i7 got 3019 and 6320, respectively. Contrariwise, the new MacBook Pro with Core i5 processor has a 3600 single-core score and a 6998 multi-core score. The Core i7 variant, meanwhile, scored 3817 and 7501 for the single-core and multi-core benchmarking tests. In spite of its impressive scores, however, 9To5Mac says those who are planning to buy the MacBook Pro sans Touch Bar should not expect for it to impeccably perform at high speeds for an extended amount of time because of its power-sipping 15W TDP. Display The Cupertino giant is clearly stepping up its display game with its new laptops. Apple lists on its official site the differences between the display technology present on the two laptops. The 13-inch MacBook Air continues to sport the relatively dated LED-backlit Widescreen display with 1440 x 900 screen resolution. It has 300 nits brightness and standard color gamut. On the contrary, the MacBook Pro comes with Retina display that has 2560 x 1600 screen resolution, 500 nits brightness and wide color gamut.  Notebook Check confirmed early November that the new MacBook Pro does have improved brightness. The computer review site even pointed out that the results of its tests showed that the new laptop has over 600 nits brightness at the center of the display panel, but the luminance slightly dropped toward the edges of the screen. Nevertheless, the distribution of brightness is considered remarkable at 89 percent. Notebook Check also claimed that the luminance of the new MacBook Pro’s display stands out among many other devices on the market, with the Dell XPS 13 9360 being the only one to beat the MacBook Pro in terms of contrast ratio.  According to 9To5Mac, the 2016 MacBook Pro is the first laptop from the Cupertino giant to feature wide color display, which it first introduced on the 5K iMac. This advanced display technology is said to give off more vibrant greens and reds, so images appear more real. This is very evident when the new MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air are placed side by side. Without a high-resolution display, the MacBook Air readily falls behind the new MacBook Pro.  Design Just like what previous rumors claimed before Apple’s Oct. 27 launch event, the new MacBooks are redesigned iterations of the Cupertino giant’s famous laptop series. The MacBook Pro without Touch Bar is no exception, since it sports a thinner body and a smaller form. Its chassis even looks like a combination of the 12-inch Retina MacBook and the previous version of the MacBook Pro. It does not have the tapered front like the Air series, so it’s thicker at the front. But at their thickest points, it’s easy to see that the new MacBook Air is the thinner device.  Although both laptops sport 13-inch screens, the MacBook Pro manages to afford a smaller form factor because of the thinner bezels surrounding its display. The commendable thing about the smaller frame of the device is it still managed to feature a full-size keyboard and loud speakers on either side. Speaking of keyboard, it is important to note that the new MacBook Pro comes with Apple’s improved butterfly switches, so the typing experience is improved and more satisfying than with the 12-inch MacBook that debuted with the original butterfly key switches. Each key in the new MacBook Pro also has its own LED, so backlight bleeds are very minimal. Read More The new MacBook Pro sports a larger Force Touch trackpad. Force Touch means the trackpad does not function through a mechanical button anymore. It simply has this force-sensitive technology to identify touch commands and it utilizes haptics and sound to produce clicks that may seem real to the user. Unfortunately, the MacBook Air still has a Multi-Touch trackpad, so clicking anywhere on the trackpad does not feel the same as when pressing the Force Touch trackpad. The main advantage of the latter — aside from saving component space underneath — is how clicks feel the same throughout the entire trackpad. This then allows users to register clicks on any part of the trackpad.  Special Features The new MacBook Pro comes with Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports. These ports are fast, reliable and quite versatile. They can be used for data transfer, charging, video output and other functions for different peripherals. Because the Thunderbolt 3 port is highly versatile, Apple designed its new MacBook Pro to come with only this type of port. Thus, users would need to buy dongles if they need to connect their laptop to monitors, or use external storage and flash memory cards. For consumers who still prefer the traditional ports, the MacBook Air features two USB 3 ports, two Thunderbolt 2 ports, a MagSafe 2 power port and an SDXC card slot.  To state the obvious, the MacBook Air has a glowing Apple logo — the one that was considered the trademark of previous-generation MacBook devices. Given that the new MacBook Pro is excessively thin, it wasn’t possible for Apple to include the glowing Apple logo on its back. Instead, the new MacBooks sport a color-matched inset logo. Since it lacks the trademark glowing logo, however, Apple decided to give the new MacBook Pro a new color variant. So instead of just seeing Silver MacBook Pros in Apple stores, there will be Space Gray units for those who want a premium Apple laptop with a different color. Miscellaneous  Storage space for the 13-inch MacBook Air starts at 128GB and can go up to 512GB SSD. As for the MacBook Pro without Touch Bar, its storage option starts at 256GB and can go as high as 1TB of SSD. At this point, it is important to note that the SSD module of the new MacBook Pro is removable, so users can still upgrade it after purchase. MacRumors pointed out in late October that with the smaller form factor of the new MacBook Pro, it seemed impossible for it to come with removable SSD just like the previous models.  The 13-inch MacBook Air is powered by a 54 watt-hour lithium-polymer battery that lasts up to 12 hours of iTunes movie playback on paper. The MacBook Pro, on the contrary, has an 54.5 watt-hour lithium polymer battery that is expected to last for up to 10 hours of iTunes movie playback. However, The Verge’s executive editor Walt Mossberg claims there really isn’t an accurate estimate to go by when it comes to the longevity of both laptops. In fact, when he tested the new MacBook Pro, it only managed to stay on for 8 hours and 22 minutes before totally running out of battery.  In terms of pricing, the 13-inch MacBook Air with 128GB SSD sells for $999, while the 256GB SSD variant is priced at $1,199. The new MacBook Pro without Touch Bar, on the other hand, comes with a $1,499 price tag — more affordable than the base model of the Touch Bar version that starts at $1,799. For Mashable, however, the price of the MacBook Pro sans Touch Bar is too much considering it does not feature the advanced OLED strip, has less processing power than the Touch Bar variant and it doesn’t have Touch ID as well.  Which do you think is the better Apple laptop between the 13-inch MacBook Air and the new MacBook Pro without Touch Bar?

With specs for both laptops closely similar to one another, which laptop is the better option?  ( Andrew Burton | Getty Images ) Advertisement There is no denying Microsoft and Apple have been rivals for at least the past three decades. This year is no exception: both companies revealed their new flagship laptops just a few hours apart, with the hope of tempting customers away from the other. Microsoft unveiled the Surface Book i7, a revamped version from last year's flexible laptop with a funny hinge, on Oct. 26. Representing Apple, on the other hand, is the latest MacBook Pro variant complete with a new Touch Bar display right above the keyboard. But which is the better option? Design Microsoft has not changed the physical appearance of the Surface Book i7 model. It still has the matte gray color and dynamic hinge, a spring-like system that folds into itself, leaving a noticeable gap between screen and keyboard when closing the laptop, in which the tech giant takes pride. More importantly, users can completely detach the screen from the keyboard, leaving a 13.5-inch tablet to use, something that the MacBook Pro 2016 does not offer. Meanwhile, Apple slimmed and lightened the MacBook Pro 2016 and added a new Touch Bar feature above the keyboard that changes the controls it shows according to the application currently in use. For example, bookmarks and favorites appear when opening the Safari browser, while editing tools show up when viewing photos. It can also display emoji suggestions or predicted words when typing out sentences. In terms of size, the MacBook Pro is available in 13-inch or 15-inch variants whereas the Surface Book i7 only has the 13.3-inch model. As for the resolution, the former can render up to 2,880 x 1,800 pixels while the latter has 3,000 x 2,000 pixels. Specs and Battery Life Both laptops use Intel's latest 6th generation i7 and i5 chipsets. Both devices use SSD drives and dedicated graphics cards for gaming and video rendering: NVIDIA GTX 965M for Microsoft and Radeon Pro 455 for Apple. In fact, both devices are so alike that it is difficult to exactly pinpoint which performs better straight out. One thing the Surface Book i7 has an advantage over the MacBook Pro is battery life: the former reportedly lasts up to 16 hours while the latter only promises 10 hours of laptop usage. Price To put it mildly, pricing for both laptops is quite expensive. The entry level Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar display costs $1,799 while the 15-inch variant costs $2,399. A 13-inch MacBook Pro sans the feature retails for $1,499. Microsoft's Surface Book i7 starts at $1,899 for the 8 GB RAM and 256 GB storage option, while the higher 16 GB RAM and 1 TB variant retails for a whopping $2,999 thanks to a $200 discount. Conclusion Microsoft clearly edges out Apple in terms of pricing. As regards specs too, it would appear that the Surface Book i7 is slightly better with its superior battery life and screen resolution than the MacBook Pro 2016. Of course, there are other things to consider such as software, operating system, and compatibility with other devices. Apple's MacBook Pro would work better with an iPhone or iPad. For those who want more customizability and compatibility options, Microsoft's Surface Book i7 could be a better choice.

By John Gruber Archive The Talk Show Projects Contact Colophon RSS Feed Twitter Sponsorship The New Touch-Bar-Equipped MacBook Pros and the State of the Mac Monday, 14 November 2016 I think there’s been a lot of confusion over the nomenclatural transition Apple is going through in its MacBook lineup. Back in 1998, Steve Jobs presented a simple four-quadrant lineup for Apple’s entire Mac line: a consumer notebook (iBook), pro notebook (PowerBook), consumer desktop (iMac), and pro desktop (Power Mac). No one could be confused by the difference between an iBook and a PowerBook. The PowerBook was more expensive, faster, had a better display, and even used more “serious” design language — iBooks were candy-colored and the PowerBooks were matte black. Much has changed since then, including all those product names (except for the iMac). About midway between then and now, Apple introduced what I believe to be the best-selling Mac notebook in history: the MacBook Air. At the time the Air was introduced in 2008, Apple’s other notebooks were the “regular” MacBook and the MacBook Pro. Sound familiar? The MacBook and MacBook Pro played the exact same roles as the iBook and the PowerBook. One was significantly less expensive, and accordingly, not as nice. Plastic vs. aluminum, slower vs. faster. I used a white iBook for several years. My wife used a white MacBook for several years about a decade ago. These were good notebooks and I remember them both fondly. But the only reason we bought those machines was that we couldn’t or didn’t want to spend the money for a PowerBook or MacBook Pro. The PowerBook “pro” alternative to my old white iBook was one of the most ahead-of-its-time designs Apple has ever made: the 12-inch PowerBook G4. Just look at it. It’s thick and heavy by today’s standards, but it foretold much of Apple’s aluminum-era design language. I wanted one badly, but couldn’t justify the price difference compared to the iBook, especially for what was going to be a secondary machine. One notebook that was slower but cheaper. One notebook that was faster and more expensive. The MacBook Air didn’t fit into this matrix at all. It was slower than the regular MacBook but as expensive as a MacBook Pro. What you were paying for wasn’t “power” but instead right there in the (then utterly perfect, today somewhat confusing) name “Air”: remarkable thinness and lightness. Apple moved from the names PowerBook and Power Mac to MacBook Pro and Mac Pro when they shifted from PowerPC to Intel processors. At the time, I chalked this up entirely to wanting to distinguish the Intel-based machines from the “Power” in “PowerPC”. In hindsight, though, I think it also signified a subtle shift in Apple’s design priorities for its very best computers. For decades, computers were starved for raw performance. CPUs were slow, RAM was scarce, disks were slow (and unreliable), graphics were slow. Printing was slow. Networking was slow. Everything was slow. And the more money you spent, the more you could alleviate these problems with faster components, and more ports and peripherals. Just about everyone agreed the original MacBook Air was beautiful to behold and that something so light and thin would be nicer to carry around than something thicker and heavier. But many critics thought Apple had lost its goddamn collective mind by breaking the rule that you spend more money on “faster”. From EveryMac’s page describing the differences between the original MacBook Air and the then-current regular MacBook: Upon viewing the respective specifications pages for the original MacBook Air and a “regular” MacBook at the time the original MacBook Air was introduced — the MacBook “Core 2 Duo” 2.4 13” (Black- Early 2008), for example — two users might come to very different conclusions. A style-conscious user might view the MacBook Air as sleek and beautiful and the “regular” MacBook as comparatively clunky. A cynical user might instead view the MacBook Air as half the system for twice the price. Both of these viewpoints could be legitimate. Most would agree that the MacBook does look rather “clunky” compared to the MacBook Air. Likewise, there is no denying that the MacBook Air does have substantial limitations compared to the “regular” MacBook in performance (it’s slower and uses the same lackluster integrated graphics), connectivity (it only has one USB 2.0 port and no onboard Ethernet, compared to the “regular” MacBook with two USB 2.0 ports, a Firewire “400” port, Gigabit Ethernet, and optical digital audio in/out), and expansion (no swappable battery or upgradable RAM and it is a pain to upgrade the hard drive, compared to the “regular” MacBook which has a swappable battery, upgradable RAM, and it is relatively simple to upgrade the hard drive). The “regular” MacBook also has a convenient internal optical drive whereas the MacBook Air requires the usage of an external one or software workarounds. Costs more. Not faster. Fewer ports. Fewer user-replaceable components. Sound familiar? MacBook Air buyers were paying a premium not for performance (or to use the old word, power) but instead for niceness. Apple effectively bifurcated the premium side of the MacBook lineup: Air for niceness, Pro for performance. But then a funny thing happened. MacBook Airs got steadily faster and cheaper. Moore’s Law at work. The regular MacBooks went away, and eventually the 11-inch MacBook Air dropped to $899, and the more popular 13-inch Air to $999. The MacBook Air transitioned — not in one fell swoop, but slowly and steadily, year after year — from being a premium product to being Apple’s most decidedly consumer-oriented Mac. The go-to Mac for students, casual users, and the budget-conscious. Last year Apple reintroduced the no-adjective MacBook brand for a device that was thinner, lighter, had a better display, one single expansion port that doubles for charging — and came at a premium price. Oh, and it’s quite arguably slower not just than the old MacBook Airs that are still sitting there in Apple’s lineup, but also slower than an iPhone. The regular MacBook’s value proposition today is exactly what the Air’s was in 2008. The MacBook Air’s value proposition today is exactly what the MacBook’s was in 2008. They’ve flipped. But the Air is the device whose name implies “thin and light”. Here’s what I wrote back in May: The outrage is coming from people who want Apple to update the MacBook Airs with retina displays. That’s not going to happen. The Airs are now Apple’s low-priced models. The Pros will get thinner (and thus more Air-like) and the new MacBook will get faster (and thus more Air-like). But the MacBook Air as we know it serves only one purpose: to hit the $899/999 price points. Back in March 2015, after the debut of the current one-port MacBook, I wrote: The key to understanding the new MacBook is that it didn’t replace any existing models in Apple’s lineup. In fact, the 11- and 13-inch Airs and the 13-inch MacBook Pro all got speed bump updates last week. If you need more ports or better performance, or if you frequently need to work while your MacBook is plugged into a power outlet, this machine is not for you, today. That’s why it didn’t (yet) replace anything in the lineup. The original 2008 MacBook Air was slow, expensive (based on specs), lacked storage, only had one USB port, was the first Apple notebook without an optical drive, etc. It was not for everyone. It was not for most people, in fact. But some people loved it. The new 2015 MacBook is the same thing — some people will love it today, and it shows us Apple’s vision for the future of the notebook form factor. So forget about the word Air. Apple’s vision for computers — notebooks, phones, tablets, even desktops — is thinner and lighter. Everything Apple makes today is an Air model in spirit. The name “Air” is no longer meaningful. My Thoughts on the New MacBook Pros I’ve spent almost three weeks testing a few models of the new MacBook Pros: the 13-inch model that lacks the Touch Bar, a mid-range (Core i5) 13-inch with the Touch Bar, and a 15-inch model with the Touch Bar. By way of comparison, my personal MacBook is a top-of-the-line 13-inch MacBook Pro that I bought just about exactly two years ago. As I’ve used these new models, the thought I keep turning back to is this: What Apple means by “pro” is tied very much to being nicer. A rundown of details and observations: The build quality is decidedly nicer. This is particularly noticeable with the display hinge. It feels better when you open it, it moves smoother as you adjust it to your preferred angle, and it closes with a more satisfying snap. iFixit’s teardown contains some interesting observations about how Apple achieved these improvements. Space gray looks amazing. I wish it were even a little darker, but it’s very cool. In very bright light, it doesn’t look that different from the traditional silver finish. In darker lighting, though, the difference is very noticeable. The trackpad is excellent. I enjoy that it’s bigger, and Apple’s palm detection has worked perfectly. Not once has it gotten in the way. The reduction in bezel area surrounding the display is noticeable. The combination of device thinness, bezel reduction, and the space gray finish all serve to make my previous MacBook Pro look old. The keyboard is, for me, a mixed bag, and it’s probably the one thing that many people will like least about these machines. I find less key travel to be less pleasant while typing. But I’m so far out there on this issue that I use a 20-year-old Apple Extended Keyboard II, with mechanical key switches, at my desk. I’ve never liked any notebook keyboard compared to an actual mechanical keyboard. But every time Apple makes its keyboards thinner, I get used to it. I always do, and I’m already pretty used to these new ones. And here’s the mixed bag part: the new MacBook Pro key switches do have a premium feel to them. I now can’t stop noticing how much the key caps on my old MacBook Pro jiggle around when I’m just resting my fingers on the keys. The new keys don’t do that. It feels like a premium keyboard — just one with incredibly short key travel, alas. [Update: Is the new MacBook keyboard too loud?] The keyboard change I’m having the most trouble with is the arrow key arrangement. Starting with the 2015 new MacBook, Apple has made the left and right arrow keys full-height; previously all four arrow keys were half-height, in an upside-down T arrangement. I’m having a devil of a time getting used to this. I use those keys frequently and do so without looking at them, and my fingers just can’t find what they’re feeling for. I’ll get used to it, I suspect, but this is one of the few things I’d change if I could. I like the Touch Bar a lot, especially Touch ID. It also feels like the right way to do a keyboard for the emoji age.1 I’m still not entirely used to it, and I’m unsure how best to use it to suit my needs. What I’m sure of is that the wrong way to think about the Touch Bar is to expect it be to be a game-changing input method. It’s just a modern, dynamic replacement for a fiddly, static set of cryptic buttons. And it’s really nicely done. It looks less like a screen and more like a button bar with dynamically changing labels. It took about three days using Touch ID on this review unit before I instinctively tried to use it to unlock my old MacBook. Typing my login password now feels archaic. The Esc is the one button in the classic function key row that some people really use a lot. I’ve heard from them. “How’s the Esc key?” is the number one question I’ve gotten from readers about the Touch Bar. For some reason, the Esc key doesn’t sit flush with the left edge of the Touch Bar. It’s inset by about the width of a key. (My best guess is that it is inset for visual symmetry with the Touch ID sensor on the other side, but it’s possible there were engineering constraints.) But about half of the blank area at the left edge is touch sensitive, even though there is no display under that part of the bar. I made a brief video about this that shows it better than I can explain it. The bottom line is that it’s pretty easy to hit Esc accurately without looking — the team that made the Touch Bar was clearly aware that some people really do use the Esc key a lot. My main wish for the next-generation Touch Bar: Taptic Engine support. Fake clicks like those on the Magic Trackpad, or even like the iPhone 7’s 3D Touch haptics, would be great. This might be trickier for Apple to pull off than I’m imagining, though. The trackpad has better haptics and works with much less pressure from your fingers, but the trackpad doesn’t have a display. The iPhone has a display, but 3D Touch on the iPhone takes more pressure to activate than I think a keyboard button should. This might take a few years. I miss MagSafe. I think what it gets down to is that Apple sees the future as being battery only while using it. Charge it like your phone — overnight — and then just go all day. And I also see the beauty in having just four USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports that all work the same way. But boy, MagSafe sure was a great idea, and it will be missed. (Even leaving aside the “trip over the cable accidentally scenario”, MagSafe is great on a daily basis just because it’s so effortless to connect. It feels like a cable that connects itself.) Speaking of battery life, it has been amazing. I watched Game 7 of the World Series with the 13-inch Touch Bar-equipped model open on my lap, for following Twitter and messaging a few friends about the game. It was a long game, over four hours, and I had the brightness on the display set as high as I wanted. (Maximum brightness would have been way too bright.) When the game ended the MacBook Pro still had 70 percent of its battery remaining. That’s probably the definition of “light use”, but my two-year-old MacBook Pro never got that much battery life under similar conditions. It is almost criminal that the extended power cord is now a $19 peripheral, and not included in the box. These machines cost upwards of $4,000 and they’re going to nickel-and-dime you over a power cord? Nickel-and-dime move number two: Not including a USB-C to Lightning cable with the iPhone 7. You can walk into an Apple Store today and drop thousands of dollars on a new MacBook and iPhone, but you can’t connect the two without a $19 cable (which will cost $25 again come January). I don’t know if this is a nickel-and-dime move or just a design decision, but the wall charger no longer has flip-out arms for wrapping the cable. That was a great little thoughtful detail, and I miss it. As promised, sound is way better from the built-in speakers. There’s almost no comparison. Where the Mac Stands Within Apple To me, an iPad in notebook mode — connected to a keyboard cover — is so much less nice than a real notebook. And the difference is more stark when compared to a great notebook, like these MacBook Pros. There are advantages to the tablet form factor, but no tablet will ever be as nice as a notebook as these MacBook Pros. I also prefer MacOS over iOS for, well, “doing work”. I think I’m more productive on a Mac than I am on an iPad. I can’t prove it, but even if I’m wrong, the fact that I feel like it’s true matters. I always feel slightly hamstrung working on an iPad. I never do on a Mac (at least once I’ve got it configured with all the apps and little shortcuts, scripts, and utilities I use). There are a lot of Mac users who feel the same way I do, and these new MacBook Pros have debuted at a time when many of these users look at Apple’s laggardly update pace for new Mac hardware (including the 1,000-plus day-old Mac Pros) and have come to the conclusion that Apple is sunsetting the Mac. They think Tim Cook really does want them to switch to an iPad. I think these new MacBook Pros, and the Touch Bar in particular, stand as refutation to that. These are very nice machines, designed and made with great care. And the Touch Bar is clearly no afterthought. A lot of teams from across the company worked for a long time on this. It’s an embedded iOS device, with the accompanying characteristics you’d expect: 60 FPS animation, seemingly instantaneous touch latency, well-done animation as things like the Control Strip expand and retract, and more. The Touch Bar is also, clearly, a costly component, making the Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pros more expensive. Price aside, the new MacBook Pro with the old-school function keys shouldn’t exist. But the Touch Bar won’t be expensive forever. It’s just so clear to me that these machines share the design ethos of the original MacBook Air. They’re designed for the future — the near future, I think — but until then, we’ll buy compatibility dongles and wait another year to see versions that support more than 16 GB of RAM. There’s much griping about these machines now, just like there was much griping about the original Air then, but these are exactly the MacBooks I want Apple to be making — ones that show that the company is putting very hard work into every aspect of them. I’d be more worried about Apple’s commitment to the Mac if they did the easy thing — easier both technically and in terms of initial critical response — and just stuck a retina display in a MacBook Air and called it a day. I do wish my most-used emoji characters synced across my various devices through iCloud, the way my keyboard text substitutions do. It seems weird that every device I use has a different set of most-used emoji. ↩︎ Previous: On Hiding vs. Encapsulating Complexity, in the Context of Twitter’s Experimental Reply Interface Display Preferences Copyright © 2002–2016 The Daring Fireball Company LLC.

Different continuation patents for Apple’s future head mounted display device cover a different set of specifics that Apple wants protected,” Purcher reports. “The original patent was first published in 2010, yet filed in 2008, is the master invention that goes deeper into the details of the invention including device’s face plate, its camera possibilities, exterior controls, its use of haptics and more. Apple’s invention was granted a patent back in February 2015.” Purcher reports, “Then in March 2016 Apple began to tweak the patent claims of this future device and today Apple is seen once again further tweaking their patent claims as detailed below providing us with a glimpse of what’s on their engineer team’s mind as well as their legal team.” Read more in the full article here.

Comment Feed One Comment Xennex1170 Thursday, November 10, 2016 - 5:55 pm · Reply Two highlighted items in the source article sound very close to some things Google has already done in placing a button on the device to control the inserted smartphone (e.g. Google Cardboard) and the touch area on the support structure (e.g. Google Glass). Though for the latter they seem to specify a wheel control so if they stay within that it seems to be covered. The design described in the patent seems interesting but I wonder how well they’ll be able to spread the weight that seems to be placed primarily on the bridge of the nose when used with the inserted smartphone. This is in contrast to current offerings by Google, Sony, Occulus, etc. that seem to distribute the weight to the entire area under the eyes including the nose. Perhaps indication that iPhones will get lighter still? Add Your Feedback Name (required) Email (required) Web cancel reply Notify me of new comments via email. Notify me of new posts via email.

Tags business apple Business Why Apple could suffer most from this election CNBC | Anita Balakrishnan | Tuesday, Nov 15, 2016 Photo: AFP Anita Balakrishnan CNBC Tuesday, Nov 15, 2016 A growing threat of a US trade war with China has only exacerbated existing problems for Apple, according one of the company's biggest critics on Wall Street. "When you focus in on Apple in particular, the concern is that if we have a trade war with China, that Apple is going to suffer - and it will suffer more so than the other multinational tech companies," Colin Gillis, senior technology analyst and director of research at BGC Financial, told CNBC's "Power Lunch" on Monday. Shares of Apple have fallen more than 4 per cent over the past week, as technology companies like Amazon and Alphabet have also tumbled. After the election of Donald Trump to the US presidency, Chinese media warned that any tariffs on Chinese goods would be met with higher prices, especially for iPhone, which is made with parts that are Chinese-made and assembled. Trump has vowed to drive a hard bargain with the Asian superpower. There could be positives in a Trump presidency for Apple, Gillis said. But one factor - a tax holiday for repatriation of Apple's overseas cash - has already been "factored in" to the share price by investors, he said. Gillis said that unlike rival Google, Apple has fewer products, and thus fewer opportunities to monetise their users. Plus, Gillis said, Apple faces growing competition from local Chinese smartphone makers. "It's a one-product company," Gillis said. "So does it deserve to trade at a premium? No, it doesn't." To be sure, Gillis is in the minority among analysts. At $85 a share, his target price for Apple's stock is by far the lowest of any analyst listed in FactSet. Gillis dropped his price target in July, maintaining a "sell" rating despite a 16 per cent rise in Apple's shares in the past six months, according to FactSet data. Apple saw revenue fall 30 per cent from a year ago in the fourth quarter in Greater China, its third-largest market based on its financial reporting. In the second calendar quarter, Chinese companies Oppo and Vivo saw year-over-year worldwide smartphone shipments increase 136.6 per cent and 80.2 per cent, respectively, according to IDC. Apple CEOTim Cook has said he's still very bullish on China's long-term prospects. CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment. But Gillis said that unless Apple can grow beyond its main source of revenue, the iPhone, it's simply "GoPro on steroids." "There are risks embedded in China, both for consumer tastes and government regulation," Gillis said. No comments yet.

Even though it’s still too early to predict what the 2017 iPhone will be like, many can’t help but speculate the new changes Apple has in store for their iPhone 8 smartphone. One of the biggest rumors is that the iPhone 8 will be equipped with a major redesign; something that was promised when Apple released this year’s model. According to the rumors, Apple is currently working on a bezel-less design and a larger screen size for its coming devices. This leads to some speculation that Apple will be releasing a 5-inch screen for the iPhone 8 and a 5.8-inch screen for the iPhone 8 Plus models. And although Android smartphone manufacturers have been trying hard to come up with less bezel displays, no one has successfully unveiled a real ‘bezel-less’ device. This might change once Apple unveils the iPhone 8 model. These reports come from Barclays Research analysts, who claim that the iPhone 8 design is not ‘100 percent locked down.’ Apart from Barclays, other analysts have noted that Apple’s next device could have a major chassis change. After all, Apple retained the iPhone 6 design on the iPhone 7 model even if it was introduced in 2014. Supporting this claim, KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has mentioned that the next iPhone could have an all-glass design along with an AMOLED screen.  There have been plenty of other sources that believe the iPhone 8 will have a 0.3-inch increase on its screen. Apart from a bezel-less display, Apple is expected to start its mass production for the AirPods by December. According to reports, Apple will be producing 10 million units of the truly-wireless earbuds initially. There is no word on whether Apple intends to launch the AirPods in December but a supply chain report said that these will make a debut in January 2017. Originally, Apple planned to launch the earbuds in late October. Due to hardware and software bugs, however, the company had to delay the release. If Apple pushes through with its major redesign for the iPhone 8, analysts expect that next year will have a significant impact on Apple’s growth as a company. Let’s just wait and see if the iPhone 8 will truly have a bezel-less design.

Apple Watch bands are divided into two collections, Utility and Artisan. Utility bands, priced at $49, come in Light Blue Stripe, Black, and Olive for 42mm Apple Watch models, and Dusty Pink, Light Blue Stripe, and Clay for 38mm Apple Watch models. Artisan bands, priced at $75, feature a full leather backing on the band and are more expensive than Utility bands. Artisan bands come in Black Diamond (38mm and 42mm), Royal Blue Diamond (38mm), and Red Diamond (42mm). All of TOMS Apple Watch bands feature stainless steel lugs and buckles, which match the stainless steel Apple Watch models. GIVE TIME is etched on each buckle with gold TOMS embossing on the band itself. Each TOMS Apple Watch band purchase provides one year of solar light to families who lack access to reliable electricity.

And not the sexy kind of moaning either. More like a wounded zebra moan. Rating: 15 Votes ipedro 14 hours ago at 07:50 pm Jesus Christ these are ugly! They take a sophisticated watch and make it look like a free-in-your-cereal-box gadget! Rating: 10 Votes fisherman188 15 hours ago at 07:28 pm Yes! I've been waiting for new watch bands! Expected them in late October but all we got were MacBook Pros... Lame Rating: 9 Votes stiligFox 14 hours ago at 07:56 pm All these people complaining about Watch bands, but it's nice to actually see more name brand third party bands coming along even a couple years after the initial release. Isn't that one of the biggest things about watches? That they are customizable and can be tailored to the users tastes? Now all we need is a watch face App Store so devs can design custom style watch faces a la Pebble. Rating: 4 Votes wemclaughlins 14 hours ago at 07:47 pm Are these made out of recycled fish nets and unicorn fur, like their ridiculously goofy shoes? And +1 on the watch band comments. If I ever DID bring myself to buy an Apple watch (likelihood=not) it would be a basic sport band and bands would never even be an afterthought. Why Apple thinks so highly of the watch band concept is beyond me. Rating: 4 Votes krause734 14 hours ago at 07:39 pm It's about time! Rating: 3 Votes C DM 12 hours ago at 09:55 pm Oh god Tim (face palm) And what does this have to do with Tim again? Rating: 3 Votes adamneer 14 hours ago at 08:21 pm You people are inscrutable. These are some very nice watch straps for their prices (coming from a name brand and one that donates to charity as well). NATO and Zulu style watch straps are quite popular, and these do well to bring the typically cheap nylon construction of common NATO bands up to par with more quality offerings. The only thing I can find objectionable about these is the obnoxious "Artisan" branding of the full backed models, which is just a bit too self-congratulatory for my liking.

By: Bloomberg | Published:November 15, 2016 9:42 am Apple CEO Tim Cook is under pressure to deliver new products amid slowing sales of the iPhone, which accounts for two-thirds of Apple’s revenue. Apple Inc. is weighing an expansion into digital glasses, a risky but potentially lucrative area of wearable computing, according to people familiar with the matter. While still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a secret project. Apple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, the people said. Apple hasn’t ordered enough components so far to indicate imminent mass-production, one of the people added. Should Apple ultimately decide to proceed with the device, it would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, another person said. The Cupertino, California-based company tests many different products and is known to pivot, pause, or cancel projects without disclosing them. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is under pressure to deliver new products amid slowing sales of the iPhone, which accounts for two-thirds of Apple’s revenue. In July, he expressed enthusiasm for augmented reality after the rise of Pokemon Go, a location-based game that uses the technology. AR, as it’s known, adds images and other digital information to people’s view of the real world, while virtual reality completely surrounds them with a computer-generated environment. The glasses may be Apple’s first hardware product targeted directly at AR, one of the people said. Cook has beefed up AR capabilities through acquisitions. In 2013, Apple bought PrimeSense, which developed motion-sensing technology in Microsoft Corp.’s Kinect gaming system. Purchases of software startups in the field, Metaio Inc. and Flyby Media Inc., followed in 2015 and 2016. “AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this,” Cook said in a July 26 conference call with analysts. “We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.” Apple has AR patents for things like street view in mapping apps. It was also awarded patents for smart glasses that make use of full-fledged virtual reality. Apple is unlikely to leverage VR in a mass-consumer product, Cook suggested in October. “I can’t imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you’re sitting in here with me, but I could imagine everyone in here in an AR experience right now,” he said during an onstage discussion in Utah. Apple’s challenge is fitting all the technology needed into a useful pair of internet-connected glasses that are small and sleek enough for regular people to wear. Google’s attempt to develop internet-connected eye wear flopped in part because its tiny battery ran out quickly. Google Glass, as it was called, also suffered a privacy backlash and poor public perception of its external design. After that disappointment, technology companies largely turned their immediate focus to VR and away from AR. Google recently introduced a VR headset alongside its Pixel smartphone, and Facebook Inc.’s Oculus VR unit has teamed up with Samsung Electronics Co. on a similar headset. Microsoft has the most public AR offering. Its HoloLens product shows holographic images in a user’s field of vision. Apple’s effort may be more difficult because the chips, batteries and other components that will be available in a year or two may still not be small enough and powerful enough to build slim glasses capable of handling compelling AR experiences. However, given time, technical challenges may play to Apple’s strengths. The company specializes in turning technology that others have struggled with into easy-to-use devices for the masses. For example, Apple simplified fingerprint technology into an unlocking mechanism for the iPhone and took touch screens mainstream with the original iPhone.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « MacBook Pro Reviews fly in while Apostle Schiller continues to Warns us of the Evils of a Touch Display on Macs | Main | Apple Granted a Patent for a Sports Version of Apple EarPods » November 14, 2016 Apple Reportedly working on Digital Glasses Supporting Telephony and Augmented Reality   Last Thursday Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Refines their Head-Mounted Display Device for a Second Time this Year." The report covered Apple updating their patent to include possible touch sensor on the headset to control various functions be it volume or perhaps answering an incoming phone call and beyond. Tonight Bloomberg is reporting that Apple's experimental prototype "would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer's field of vision, and may use augmented reality." Apple getting serious about a future headset was covered in our January report titled "Apple's 'Secret' VR Team isn't that Secret Anymore," that touched on the Financial Times that broke that story.   Bloomberg's speculative report hints that the project is still well in the distance and could make it's way to market in a few years. Apple has ordered some materials to support prototypes but it hasn't progressed far beyond that at this point in time.   Bloomberg further noted that "Apple's challenge is fitting all the technology needed into a useful pair of internet-connected glasses that are small and sleek enough for regular people to wear. Google's attempt to develop internet-connected eye wear flopped in part because its tiny battery ran out quickly. Google Glass, as it was called, also suffered a privacy backlash and poor public perception of its external design."   The Bloomberg report is so vague that it's not really of much value at this point in time as it brings little to nothing to the table. Though if Apple is hoping for this headset or glasses to be of value, they're likely going to wait for 5G networks to arrive and that should be around 2020.   Realtime Augmented Reality is going to require networks that are much faster than they are today and that will give Apple the time needed to have a revolutionary device ready for that timeline.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

New Report Claims Cupertino Giant Working On Smart Glasses With AR By Corazon Victorino On 11/14/16 AT 10:33 PM Close Over the weekend, a limited number of Snapchat’s Spectacles sunglasses went on sale. The high-tech glasses that work with both Android and iOS devices records 10-second video clips that can be uploaded into Snapchat story. Since the $130 device is making waves and getting attention from the techie community, could Apple be also planning to release its own version of the Spectacles? On Monday, unnamed sources told Bloomberg that Apple is planning to expand into digital glasses for its next endeavor in the wearable market. The Cupertino giant’s glasses project is said to be in the exploration phase for now, but the company could already have the fixed goal of producing glasses that would show images and other real-time data in the wearer’s field of vision. The glasses are also expected to connect wirelessly to Apple’s iPhones and work using augmented reality.  Given that the product is not going to focus on recording short video clips, the device couldn’t technically be considered as Apple’s direct competitor to Snapchat’s Spectacles. Instead, this could be Apple’s attempt at capturing the market that showed interest in Google’s dormant Google Glass wearables. Should this project progress, the tech community could expect Apple’s digital glasses to arrive possibly in 2018.  Related Stories Snapchat Spectacles Release Date: Buy Them From Snapbot Mobile Vending Machines Facebook Flash Unveiled For Developing Countries: Report New Snapchat Update For iOS Adds Support For Spectacle Glasses But When Will They Release? Per the leaksters who shared the information about Apple’s next wearable, a clear sign that Apple is serious about the project is how CEO Tim Cook has been acquiring projects and teams of developers to beef up the company’s AR technologies. Also, Cook, himself, has been quite vocal about his interest in AR, as per AppleInsider.  The Google Glass was introduced as an advanced head-mounted display that utilized augmented reality to display weather information directly in the user’s field of vision. It also allowed users to make calls and take photos. Unfortunately, privacy concerns caused a huge blow to the project, such that it was eventually stopped in January 2015. However, on the project’s official website, it is stated there that the journey of Google Glass has not ended yet. Google also stated that consumers will see the future versions of the smart glasses when they are ready.  Since the Google Glass is not an active product for the time being, this could be the perfect timing for Apple to introduce its own smart glasses, which are now believed to be part of the augmented reality projects of the tech giant. Another project that is making headlines recently pertains to the rumored full VR headset that the company could be launching in the near future.

Kantipur The Kathmandu Post saptahik Nepal Nari Radio Kantipur Kantipur TV 0Shares Share on facebookShare on twitter Entertainment Mi Mix: A vision into the future of smartphones Mi Max is not a perfect phone, but does bring a lot of innovation that could drive smartphone design in the days to come - Prajesh SJB Rana The Mi Mix’s true allure lies in the display of the phone. The device features a 6.4 inch IPS LCD display at a resolution on 1080 x 2040 pixels in a form-factor as big as the iPhone 7 Plus which features a smaller 5.5-inch display Nov 15, 2016- In 2016, we’ve seen a lot of innovative products that have pushed the boundaries of the tech industry. We’ve seen VR technology turn into a reality and we’ve even seen high-quality camera drones that have made aerial shots commonplace in low-budget music videos and films. We’ve also seen Microsoft’s innovative Surface Pro that redesigns how professional content creators work with a computer. While, unfortunately, Google modular phone design concept, Project Ara, was cancelled earlier this year; we got to see their Pixel line of phones which hints at a truly Google phone. Apple, however, disappointed most of their customer base with mediocre improvements to the iPhone line and the MacBook line. In the growing area of consumer technology, Apple seems to be slowly losing their innovative edge. Apple played it safe with both the iPhone 7 and 2016 MacBook Pro releases and while Apple had hinted at a bezel-less iPhone 8, where the company’s true innovation would start. Unfortunately, however, for the Cupertino company, their hopes of awing their consumer-base with a truly innovative device has been cut-short by the Chinese company Xiaomi. The recently released Xiaomi Mi Mix is a technological marvel to behold because of the device’s bezel-less edge-to-edge display. But no matter how innovative Xiaomi’s bezel-less device is, they weren’t the first company to dabble in a phone with a bezel-less display. The first phone to feature a bezel-less display would be the Sharp Aquos Crystal, a phone Sharp released in 2014. While the Aquos Crystal did feature a beautiful bezel-less screen that awed consumers, the phone suffered because of sub-par hardware and a notoriously thick chin at the bottom that worked against the overall aesthetic of the device. The phone also had horrible call-quality issues because of the technology used by Sharp. Sharp used a technology called Direct Wave Condenser, which vibrated the whole screen to produce sound waves that entered the user’s ear. This, which looked great in theory, did not work well in practical use since a lot of the Aquos Crystal users complained of horrible call-quality. The second version of the Aquos Crystal, released in 2015, suffered from similar issues which hindered the overall adoption-rate of the phone. As a result, the Sharp Aquos Crystal phones did not do well commercially and seemed more like a concept phone rather than a phone ready for consumer use. While the Mi Mix is also a concept phone at this point, the true innovation of the Chinese company comes forward in the different ways that Xiaomi has managed to overcome all of Sharp’s initial shortcomings. The Mi Mix has exceptional hardware since it comes equipped with top-of-the line Snapdragon 821 SOC, four or six GB of RAM depending on the model. The device is also equipped with a massive 4400 mAh battery that ensures exceptional battery life. The phone performs exceptionally well on benchmark tests where the Mi Mix beat both the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and Google Pixel. While the Mi Mix performs better than the Sharp Aquos Crystal phones, the phone also implements better technology to ensure better call-quality. While Sharp’s Direct Wave Condenser failed in delivering good call-quality, Xiaomi’s Peizoelectric Ceramic Actuator works exceptionally well. While the technology works by converting electric energy to mechanical energy, slightly similar to the technology used by Sharp, call-quality on the Mi Mix feels natural and easy on the ears. While these specifications and technology might be impressive, the Mi Mix’s true allure lies in the display of the phone. The device features a 6.4 inch IPS LCD display at a resolution on 1080 x 2040 pixels in a form-factor as big as the iPhone 7 Plus which features a smaller 5.5-inch display. The device is a tad bit on the heavier side, weighing at 209g, and is even a bit thicker at 7.9 mm. While I could argue that for such a premium device, Xiaomi should have opted for a QHD display, the display on the Mi Mix actually performs really well. The screen itself is sharp, the colours vibrant and the great brightness at 783 Lux. Watching videos or playing games on the bezel-less 6.4-inch screen is a pleasure. When taking a photo, the way the screen blends in with the real-world is astonishing. But as much as I’ve been advocating the device’s bezel-less screen, it’s not completely bezel-less since there is a visible bezel next to the display but this is so minimal that it can easily be ignored. But taking into account how well the screen looks and performs, the Mi Mix’s screen can be touted as a natural evolution to the Sharp Aquos Crystal displays. But, to utilise a bezel-less display, a lot of compromises have to be made. Since the top chin of any phone contains essential parts such as light-sensors, proximity-sensors and the front-facing camera, having a bezel-less display without the top chin would expose the company to some extremely specific problems. Sharp handled these issues by moving all of the top-chin components to the bottom-chin which is the reason why the Sharp phones featured such a large chin, but the Mi Mix’s bottom chin is thin too. For Xiaomi to reduce the size of the bottom chin, they had to get rid of some essential features like the earpiece and the proximity sensor. Instead of the proximity sensor, the Mi Mix comes with an ultrasound technology that determines proximity with the use of algorithms and software. Without these two components to hog space on the chin of the phone, Xiaomi has managed to considerably reduce the size of the bottom chin; but the smaller front-facing camera and the ambient light sensors have been moved to the bottom. The front-facing selfie camera suffers because of this. Every time you’re taking a selfie, the camera is bound to be obstructed by your finger. Palm rejection technology also needs to be on point on a bezel-less display because while grabbing the phone, your palms are bound to rest on the screen. The Mi Mix is also made out of ceramic which adds to the premium look and feel of the phone. The device is also the first phone to use Zirconia ceramic and the glass feel of the ceramic body makes touch input of both the body and the screen feel seamless. But the main concern here would be durability. By the looks of it, the Mi Mix is not very durable. Accounting how the screen does not have a bezel to protect the screen during an accidental fall or even how ceramic, even though it’s a durable material, is weak on the corners which would be fatal should the phone fall on one of its corners. But the phone looks good enough to turn heads when you use it in front of other people. The Mi Mix also comes in an 18k model, which features the eight GB RAM module that comes equipped with real 18 karat gold rings around the fingerprint reader and the rear camera modules. The use of ceramic also makes the phone slippery and more prone to drops but thankfully, Xiaomi includes a decent leather case for the phone in the box. The Mi Mix is currently marketed as a concept product which is why it has been produced in limited qualities and is available only in China. But even though Xiaomi has labelled the Mi Mix as a concept, it does bring new technology to the field of smartphones. While earlier Xiaomi had been criticised as blatantly copying Apple’s design aesthetics, the Mi Mix is a phone concept that looks original and innovative. There are a lot of flaws on the Mi Mix phones, like how poorly the camera performs on the device or even how the design aesthetics leaves the phone more vulnerable to accidental drops. The Mi Max is not a perfect phone as of right now, but does bring a lot of innovation that could drive smartphone design in the days to come, especially since smartphone designs have been stagnating for a long time. The Mi Mix brings a lot to the table and compromises very little, an effort for which Xiaomi should be lauded. All in all, Xiaomi has managed to create a truly beautiful phone and even though the Mi Mix is not being mass marketed, it is one of the most innovative products to come out this year.

Reuters/Jason Reed The iPhone 7 Plus is Apple’s highest-end offering in the current market. While the device looks largely like its predecessor, the iPhone 6S Plus, the Cupertino-based company did make meaningful changes as well. READ: Apple iPhone 8 release date, news & update: Both iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus to become larger and have no bezel Apple’s dual lens camera debuted in the iPhone 7 Plus, and the technology definitely shows. The photo-quality is notably better than any of its predecessors especially when taking low-light images. The new camera system also allows users to zoom in to images twice as much, which is more significant in terms of quality rather than actual distance. The iPhone 7 Plus also improves from its predecessors in terms of battery life. In addition, the new A10 processor from Apple and the 3GB of RAM allow it to work quicker than the iPhone 6S Plus. The Cupertino-based company also made improvements to the home button, which provides better feedback, is more responsive and is generally easier to use in the current Apple flagship. Water resistancy was also included into the iPhone 7 Plus, which has an IP67 rating. This technically means that the device can be submerged only until a meter of water for a maximum of 30 minutes. It has been speculated that the infamously missing 3.5mm audio jack is a reason for this new feature. READ: Apple iPhone 8: Why Samsung will benefit from the future iPhone For individuals with Optus, C|Net previously reported that the best deal is to purchase the 128GB model, which requires $107 per month. In the span of two years, the entire payout is $2,568.  Then there is Vodafone’s deal for the same variant at $113 per month, which will equate to $2,712 at the end of 24 months. On the other hand, Telstra offers the same model at $122 per month, which will set the user back by $2,928 at the end of the contract.

This round of updates target developers and users enrolled in the Apple Beta Software Program, although a public beta could arrive soon.  ( Sean Gallup | Getty Images ) Advertisement Apple seeded another round of beta versions for the macOS 10.12.2 Sierra, tvOS 10.1, and iOS 10.2. The news comes a week after the most previous beta versions were offered. macOS 10.12.2 The third beta update for the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 was released to developers right before the final version comes out to the public, merely a few days after the Cupertino company outed the second 10.12.2 beta for the macOS and three weeks after the public release of the final macOS 10.12.1 version. macOS Sierra is the latest Mac operating system available since September. It includes support for Siri, which is Apple's dedicated artificial intelligence assistant that was present only in the iPhone and iPad until recently; Apple Pay for the web; Apple Watch auto-unlocking; Universal Clipboard; Picture-in-Picture multitasking; improved iCloud Drive integration, and other small features. Users can download the third beta update via the Apple Developer Center and through the software update mechanism in the Mac App Store despite the latter reportedly having issues updating apps for some users at the time of writing. maOS Sierra 10.12.2 beta 3 includes new emoji and introduces new Unicode 9 characters such as the face palm, selfie, clown face, shark, owl, fox face, butterfly, pancakes, avocado, bacon, croissant, and many more. Additionally, there are new emoji based on professions in both male and female genders. Furthermore, Apple has updated the artwork of various existing emoji by adding more detail to make them look more realistic and less cartoonish. Apart from the addition of new emoji, a few other changes could be seen, which include bug fixes and performance enhancements that address issues since the release of macOS Sierra 10.12.1. No watchOS Update? What is noticeably missing from the current set of beta updates was watchOS 3.1.1, which was not totally surprising since the version numbers would imply that iOS, tvOS and macOS beta 3 were minor updates targeting smaller bug fixes, without any eye-catching features. iOS 10.2 And tvOS 10.1 Meanwhile, the most notable change from this current lineup of builds is the TV app running on tvOS 10.1, which arrived last week to devices running iOS 10 but took another whole week before arriving to Apple TV devices. Thus far, no significant changes can be found in the iOS 10.2 beta 3 build except that the new TV app would entirely replace Videos. Luckily for users who prefer retaining the Videos app on their iPhone or iPad, they can still download the app back via the App Store. Additionally, Apple returned the Feedback app in iOS 10.2 beta 3. For now, all the major and minor changes for the third set of betas have yet to be discovered.

These glasses may be some type of Apple-edition Google Glass with finalizations and features that’ll patch up all the flaws and caveats of Glass and other smart glasses that have attempted to make it on the market. In other words, Apple wants to try to be Apple. Apple Inc. is weighing an expansion into digital glasses, a risky but potentially lucrative area of wearable computing, according to people familiar with the matter. The way these glasses would work is by connecting to your iPhone wirelessly to display images and information in the field view of the wearable. Personalized content would likely be displayed in order for users to enjoy a more immersive experience, while there’s also a possibility that some type of AR may also be used to show users more content. While still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality, the people said. It wouldn’t come as a shock if Apple chose to use AR in these glasses since the company has expressed plenty of interest in the technology. CEO Tim Cook has brought up the subject many a time in various interviews, while the tech giant has acquired many AR startups and companies alongside experts in the field and those familiar with the technology. Therefore, a pair of glasses may be the first place where we see the company’s efforts in the field of AR. Of course, you should always take reports like this with a grain of salt. Even though there’s quite a lot of information shared here, you have to keep in mind that Apple is still “considering” further development of their possibly next wearable. With the failure of Google Glass and other smart glasses not performing fairly so far amongst the public, Apple’s ultimate decision may be negative toward the project. On the other hand, if Apple were to go ahead with the new device, it wouldn’t launch at least until 2018. This would be the minimum time required in order to get the design just right and production partners bonded, however it’s likely we’d have to wait longer than this somewhat short time span. Nevertheless, the question now rises: would you use a pair of smart glasses built by Apple? Let us know in the comments!

The product would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing an unnamed source. The project is advanced enough to be in talks with suppliers, the report said. The smart glasses would be Apple's first in a category of product that was originally pioneered by Google with its Google Glass product. Like Google Glass, Apple's smart-glasses product would be geared toward information conveyance instead of immersive augmented-reality experiences like the products that Magic Leap is developing and Microsoft's HoloLens. Bloomberg cited sources saying the glasses "may use augmented reality." The project is in "early product testing," the Bloomberg report said. The smart glasses would be designed to connect to an iPhone for processing to keep their weight down and keep the design of the frames stylish without adding too many additional electronics. A main component of any pair of Apple smart glasses would be the lenses. Last week, Upload VR entrepreneur-in-residence Robert Scoble wrote in a Facebook post that Apple's optics partner was Carl Zeiss, which produces a lens called Zeiss Smart Optics. Thomas Alt, who joined Apple after the company bought Metaio, an AR company he was the CEO of, is listed as an inventor on a glasses patent assigned to Carl Zeiss. His LinkedIn profile lists him as "Director of Procurement, Strategic Deals Team" at Apple. A Zeiss representative declined to comment on any partnership with Apple. "I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day, it will become that much a part of you," Apple CEO Tim Cook said last month in Utah. Apple develops many projects internally, and those efforts often do not ultimately result in a full product that goes on sale. Apple is working on integrating augmented reality into its software, and the glasses would most likely be its first hardware product targeted the AR market.

And now Apple may be planning a similar device. Apple is looking at introducing smart glasses that would show images and information into the wearer’s field of view, say sources speaking to Bloomberg. The device would connect wirelessly to the wearer’s iPhone and could also use augmented reality. The glasses are said to still in the early stages at Apple, with the company only ordering a small number of near-eye displays from one supplier for its internal testing. If Apple does decide to launch these glasses to the public, the release wouldn’t happen until 2018 at the earliest, says a source. Apple hasn’t made any official announcements about these digital glasses, and it’s possible that this product will be killed off and never see any kind of public reveal. Apple is a huge company, and so it makes sense that it would regularly investigate new products but ultimately decide to scrap them if it can’t build those products exactly how it wants. All that said, Apple CEO Tim Cook has expressed interest in augmented reality in the past, saying things like “AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this” and “We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.” While Google Glass ultimately failed, Apple could learn from Glass’s mistakes and use improved technology to release headwear that fares better than Google’s effort. What do you think of today’s report? Would Apple have success with its own pair of digital glasses?

Photo: Apple Donating to your favorite charity or nonprofit organization is now as simple as using Apple Pay. Apple revealed today that it is lifting the ban that kept iOS apps from collecting funds for charities via the secure payment system. With the change, charities like the Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders can now place “donate” buttons in their apps to make the payment process faster than ever, which will hopefully increase donations. “So many people want to give, but complicated and clunky donation systems discourage them,” said Scott Harrison, CEO of charity: water. “Integrating Apple Pay makes the giving experience incredibly simple and convenient, and we hope it will encourage more people to join our mission and enable us to transform lives within seconds.” Apple Pay nonprofits To help programs get a jump start, Apple worked with Benevity to launch an online application form for nonprofits looking to accept Apple Pay. Now that Apple Pay is supported on iOS and macOS Sierra, donations can be made quickly via Safari on Mac, iPhone or iPad. The list of of nonprofits supporting Apple Pay at launch includes American Red Cross, American Heart Association, charity: water, Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, COPD Foundation, Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA), Doctors Without Borders, Feeding America, GlobalGiving, International Rescue Committee, Red, St.Jude Children’s Research Hospital, The Nature Conservancy, The Water Project, UNICEF, United Way, WNET, World Vision and the World Wildlife Federation. Other organizations such as American Cancer Society, CARE, DonorsChoose.org, Save the Children, and PBS plan to add Apple Pay support soon.

A total of 19 organizations are already on board, with more to follow in the coming months.  ( Apple ) Advertisement Tis' the season of giving, and Apple wants to make it easier by allowing users to donate to nonprofit organizations via Apple Pay. Starting today, nonprofits in the United States can accept donations made using Apple Pay, while donors can save time by sending money to a number of charities quickly and easily. "Apple Pay is making it easier and more secure to donate to your favorite nonprofit organizations with just a touch," says Apple. Nonprofits Supporting Apple Pay Apple Pay users can now donate to a wide range of nonprofits, 19 in total, from global organizations such as UNICEF to startups such as "charity: water" and more. The American Red Cross, World Wildlife Fund, Save the Children, Doctors Without Borders and more are already accepting donations via Apple Pay. More nonprofits such as CARE, American Cancer Society, DonorsChoose.org and others will start supporting Apple Pay donations in the following months, making it easier for their supporters to make private and secure investments quickly and hassle-free. How It Works Charitable organizations can use Apple Pay for the web to accept Apple Pay donations on their websites, but users will also be able to make financial contributions using specific charity apps that accept Apple Pay donations. Donating through Apple Pay doesn't require users to enter contact and billing information, make an account or fill out forms to check out. With Apple Pay, users can make instant donations and save time. "We're making it incredibly easy to give back with Apple Pay," says Apple Pay vice president Jennifer Bailey. Apple Pay Leads The Way Moreover, Bailey says that Apple learned from apps and websites that twice as many users complete purchases with Apple Pay than with any other payment method. "We think offering such a simple and secure way to support the incredible work nonprofits do will have a significant impact on the communities they serve," Bailey adds. The Season Of Giving With Apple Pay making the whole donation process easier and more secure, many charitable organizations may see more contributions from supporters this holiday season after supporting the mobile payments system. Until now, nonprofit organizations had been unable to support Apple Pay because the rules would not allow iOS apps to power fundraisers for charity using Apple Pay. Charities had to collect funds outside of their apps, which made things complicated. With Apple's support, however, nonprofits can now add built-in donate buttons.

Comments CIO | Nov 14, 2016 8:07 AM PT Like this article? thumbsup +1 thumbsdown RELATED TOPICS MacBooks MacOS Hardware Laptops Comments Apple has finally announced the much-awaited upgrades to its Pro line of MacBooks. As expected, Apple made some unorthodox decisions and they are getting beaten up for it. I use a mix of technologies. I have a MacBook, Chromebook, Google Pixel C, Windows 10 PC and I primarily use openSUSE on my main desktop. As a result, I consider myself well educated on the advantages and disadvantages of each platform, without any bias. Although my 2013 MacBook with 8GB of RAM is in great shape and is my go-to device when I am not on my desktop, I am looking at upgrading it to the new MacBook. Should I? In this post I am addressing some of the unfair criticism of the new MacBook Pro and also talking about the facts that make them great devices. First things first: Hardware specs The new MacBooks are running on Intel’s 6th generation Sky Lake processors and not the newly released Kaby Lake. Does that matter? It would have been better if Apple used the latest chips, but for a MacBook user Kaby Lake doesn’t really make a big difference. Both processors are 14nm and are literally identical. The only slight difference you may notice is in the battery life if you watch 4K video. Period. Don’t forget, MacBooks have a long shelf life (Apple claims four years, but they go beyond four years depending on your usecase). Since Intel is moving away from tick-tock model they will probably be releasing a new processor every year. No matter which processor Apple pack into their MacBooks, it’s going to be old by the following year. So don’t keep falling for the newer hardware madness telling you that you should always have the latest and greatest hardware. Is 16GB RAM enough? The short answer is yes. I have the 2013 MacBook Pro that came with 8GB of RAM. Initially I fretted  whether this device is future proof or not. We are approaching 2017 and I am heavily using Adobe Premier, Photoshop, Lightroom and 3d modeling software, and MacBook is serving me very well. In fact it outperformed a high end 2016 laptop with 16GB of RAM. Yes, it would be great to have a 32GB model, but I won’t go over 16GB of RAM for an ultrabook. Why? Because RAM is not a magic potion, you need an equally powerful processor to process the data. USB Type C Thank you Apple for removing all legacy USB ports from the device. USB has been nothing more than a mess. There are at least 7 legacy USB ports. I have to carry around at least 5 types of USB cables  to be able to connect to my devices. My Western Digital external hard drive uses USB B, whereas Nikon d750 uses UC-E17 USB Cable, headphone charger uses Micro USB and Xoom Dictaphone Mini USB, plus USB Type C for my Nexus phone. Yes. That’s legacy USB mess. And don’t forget all those HDMI cables. Please kill the legacy USB!. Get rid of all that mess and everyone, please move to USB Type C. One type to rule them all: from audio video output to charging to data transfers.Needless to say, I am very happy there are no legacy USB ports in MacBooks. Initially I will have to carry 2 adapters, but as soon as the rest of the world moves to USB Type C the better. I am already carrying 5 different cables to survive the legacy USB world. Lack of SD card reader The new MacBooks don’t have a SD card reader. How many people actually use the SD Card reader? The only use case that I can think of is photographers who may prefer SD Card. But it’s not a deal breaker for a professional photographer. Have you seen the bag of a photographer? All you will see is cables, connectors, filters, lenses, SD Cards…one more USB Type C SD Card reader is not going to break their back and chances are they already own one. Missing Magsafe Come on folks. MacBooks are the only devices that offered Magsafe. Do you have MagSafe in your Dell, HP, Lenovo, ASUS laptops? Are you tripping and falling all the time? What do you do with your iPad, iPhone, Android phones? Yes, MagSafe was a good approach but that’s not the end of the world and I am much happier to use the same USB Type C port for charging than MagSafe. Touch bar is a gimmick Finally someone is doing something for those useless function keys. If you are a Chromebook user, you already know how ‘valuable’ those are. All I care about is ‘Esc’ key as I use it heavily in the text editor, and that’s going to stay with the ‘Touch Bar’. Touch Bar is going to expand the functionality of the keyboard and applications and give me more control over features. In fact it creates new ways to interact with apps, without having to lift your fingers from the keyboard area. I love the new Touch Bar. The hidden secrets of MacBook Pro Trackpad Let me say this straight out: Apple is the only company that got the touch pad right. I have yet to come across a non-Apple laptop where trackpad is nothing more than an extension of the mouse. With the new MacBook, the trackpad is doubled in size. In addition, there is a secret that most people don’t know: with the new force field touch pads, you can convert it into a tablet by using a stylus. Apps like Inklet allow you to enjoy pressure sensitivity so all those aspiring graphic artists don’t need to buy expensive tablets. I can’t tell you how excited I am about it. They don't have touchscreen As a Chromebook Flip and Dell XPS 13 user, I can tell you touchscreens on laptops are pure waste. No one uses them. Touch screens do make sense for those devices that lack keyboard and mouse, but not on laptops. Also these touchscreens work more or less like input devices, like a mouse, so unlike iPad or Surface Pro like devices, you really can’t use them for drawing due to lack of palm rejection, it’s counterproductive. So, no, I don’t need touchscreen on my laptop. MacBooks are expensive I often hear people say Apple products are overpriced. May I ask what wasthe price of Chromebook Pixel? You get 32GB of storage for $1600. Check out laptops from Dell, HP, Lenovo … look at any vendor out there  matching the MacBook specs and you are talking about over $2000. You still get the crappy touchpad and Windows 10 that doesn’t scale apps very well for HiDPI monitors….and I won’t get into the 45 minute long downtime every time there is a system update. Yes, you can get a laptop under $300 but don’t complain about creaky hinges, unresponsive touchpad, 3Kg of weight and 4GB of RAM. The bottom line is good hardware is expensive. Just check the price of Pixel XL phone. It’s the same price of MacBook Air. Resistance to change Apple is finally pushing  laptops into new territories. Unlike Ubuntu Linux or Gnome, it’s not creating new interfaces that require users to relearn everything. It’s sticking to the WIMP paradigm and yet making game-changing improvements to hardware. That’s what we need. In all these years, the only innovation that we saw in the non-Apple market was more RAM and new CPUs. Period. Apple is pushing the envelope. I think the latest MacBook Pro is the rightful successor and I will be buying one. If you have any doubts, don’t listen to critics and get one. You won’t regret it. Trust me.

With the holiday season, #GivingTuesday, and goodwill all right around the corner, Apple has announced that its mobile payments platform now supports instant donations to nonprofits. So now, in addition to buying yourself that new winter coat, you can help keep someone else warm this holiday season, too. “Apple Pay is making it easier and more secure to donate to your favorite nonprofit organizations with just a touch,” Apple announced on Monday. “Apple Pay support for charitable donations kicks off today with nonprofits ranging from global organizations such as UNICEF to startups … more nonprofits will offer Apple Pay over the coming months so their supporters can make easy, secure, and private payments.” This could be huge news for nonprofits, as recent figures suggest that just 10 percent of donations to charities currently come from mobile. But as Apple Pay makes giving easier, it may become a more frequent activity for the generous souls of the world. More: Here are all the places that support Apple Pay, now in Japan and 10 other countries “We’re making it incredibly easy to give back with Apple Pay,” said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay. “Websites and apps tell us they see twice as many people actually completing a purchase with Apple Pay than with other payment methods. We think offering such a simple and secure way to support the incredible work nonprofits do will have a significant impact on the communities they serve.” This is a considerable change from Apple’s previous policy, which forced charities to take donations outside the Apple Pay app. But now they can embed “donate” buttons directly into their own apps and process gifts through the mobile platform.

The Touch Bar provides the distinct advantage of being programmable, both by MacOS itself and by applications, to provide an optimized input experience. In order for the Touch Bar to achieve its true potential, that means that developers need to write support for the innovative new input method into their applications. Because finding apps of any kind, and particularly those that support a new feature like the Touch Bar, can be a challenge, Apple has started highlighting them in the Mac App Store, as MacRumors reports. More: Apple’s Touch Bar like having an iPhone built into your MacBook Pro If you open the App Store on a MacOS machine, you’ll find a highlighted section titled “Our Top Picks for MacBook Pro.” Clicking on it takes you to section that includes “Enhanced for Touch Bar” apps, of which currently 15 are listed: Final Cut Pro Motion Compressor Djay Pro 1Password Day One Mail Designer Pro 3 OmniGraffle 7 Drop — Color Picker Focus PicFram Live Desktop Artistry Photo Pro PocketCAS Mathematics Toolkit QuickQuad Each app varies in how significantly it uses the Touch Bar, but you can expect at least a selection of settings and shortcuts that might be otherwise buried behind a menu or using physical function keys on non-Touch Bar MacOS machines. Whether users can more easily search and add passwords in 1Password or scrub through a video in Final Cut Pro, the Touch Bar should make using each app more efficient to one degree or another. As is always the case with new technology, users can be impatient to see its full capabilities make their way to applications and the operating system. Time will tell just how much support the Touch Bar will receive, but with major developers like Microsoft bringing support to important applications like the Office suite of productivity apps, the MacBook Pro’s shiny new tool should be of ever-increasing value as the machines start rolling out to early buyers.

The MacBook Pro's touch bar is one thing, but adding touch to a 27-inch iMac would be absurd and it's not going to happen, says Apple's Phil Schiller.  ( Stephen Lam | Getty Images ) Advertisement Apple tried enabling touch screen support on its desktops and laptops, but the result was disastrous, according to Phil Schiller, Apple SVP of Worldwide Marketing. The MacBook Pro 2016 drew lots of attention with its new Touch Bar, which adds somewhat of a part-time touch experience without going full on as a touchpad. Nevertheless, some saw the Touch Bar as a stepping stone toward real touch screens adorning Macs and MacBooks sometime in the future, but that's not the case. As Schiller explains to Backchannel, a multi-touch display on a MacBook would not work out and would not be enough, as it would start a divide between the iMac and MacBook. Implementing a full-on touch display on an iMac all-in-one PC would be "absurd," Schiller says, because it would make it really cumbersome to interact with the screen rather than the traditional keyboard and mouse. It Would Be A Disaster, Absurd Despite its instincts, however, Apple decided to try it out just in case it was wrong. To ensure it's not missing out on anything, Apple tested touch screen technology on the Mac and it bolstered its belief that it would be a "disaster." "Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd," Schiller explains. He further points out that adding multi-touch would imply a complete redesign of the menu bar for touch, which would in turn mar the experience for users who continue to rely on more standard pointer devices such as a mouse. "You can't optimize for both," adds Schiller. "It's the lowest common denominator thinking." MacBook Pro Touch Bar Is As Close As It Gets Over the years, Apple has revisited the idea several times and tested touch screens on a Mac, only to be more convinced that it wouldn't work well. It would be cumbersome and inconvenient, quite the opposite of what Apple is trying to achieve with its devices. When asked whether the MacBook Pro Touch Bar was the start of a larger bid to bring iOS influences to the macOS platform, Schiller assured that it's not the case. The idea behind the Touch Bar gracing the latest MacBook Pro was not to port iOS to the Mac, but rather to tap iOS technology to improve the Mac experience. What About The MacBook Pro Ports? The MacBook Pro also raised a bit of controversy over its port situation, adding only USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports. This drew plenty of criticism from Apple fans who didn't want to be forced into purchasing additional adapters, cables and dongles to connect other Apple devices to their MacBook Pro. In this respect, Schiller stands by the company's decision to redesign ports and says that Apple is "absolutely more sure than ever" that it was the right thing to do because USB-C will become the standard. MacBook Pro 2016: Love It Or Hate It Lastly, according to Schiller, the most major difference between MacBook Pro fans and critics comes down to one thing: those who have interacted with the MacBook Pro and those who haven't. For the latter category, things would perhaps change soon since the first batch of MacBook Pro 2016 laptops has started shipping out to preorder customers.

While the company has yet to formally reveal the effort, the bands are live on TOMS.com, as is the new One-to-One initiative to go alongside the accessories… TOMS says that every time an Apple Watch band is purchased, it will provide one year of solar light to a person in need, continuing the matching charitable component of its products that have been a staple for the company: A classic look designed for travel and adventure. TOMS for Apple Watch bands do more than just make a personal style statement; they make a difference by helping bring solar lights to people who need them the most. When individuals have access to safe, reliable light sources, one more child will have the TIME to study into the night, one more person will have the TIME to work after dark and earn extra income, and one more family will stay healthy and safe. As for the bands themselves, TOMS is offering a handful of different options for both 38mm and 42mm Apple Watch wearers. There are two different tiers of bands, $49 and $75. The former offers a light blue stripe option, a black option, a clay option, an olive option, and a dusty pink option. These bands are made out of a “durable grosgrain fabric” with leather detailing: Designed for the Apple Watch Durable grosgrain fabric Genuine leather detailing, stainless steel buckle with black finish GIVE TIME etching on buckle, gold TOMS emboss Apple Watch sold separately The $75 tier offers a black diamond design, a royal blue diamond design, and a red diamond design. These bands feature: Designed for the Apple Watch Woven fabric with genuine leather backing Stainless steel detailing with silver finish GIVE TIME etching on buckle, gold TOMS emboss Apple Watch sold separately TOMS got its popularity largely due to the charitable efforts that see it donate one pair of shoes to a person in need every time a pair of shoes is purchased, and the company is keeping those efforts in place with its Apple Watch accessories. The new TOMS Apple Watch bands are available now from TOMS’ website.

It's 1999, the turn of the millennium, quality online gaming is a thing of the future, Limp Bizkit are still in the charts and flip phones are all the rage. A dark, dark time. Or at least it was, until Apple released the iBook G3, a quirky, fun take on laptop design with an... interesting look to entice the artiste and the average Joe alike. Its rounded, plasticky design makes it look more like a cheap children's toy than a top of the range computer nowadays, especially when compared with Apple's more recent models, but in 1999, the iBook was pretty cool. Join us as we take a trip down memory lane and see why the Apple iBook G3 was so chic: APPLE IBOOK G3 - WHAT'S THE STORY? More than a decade ago, Apple had yet to unleash its iPod, and the only people that used its computers were creative types with angular haircuts. Then, in 1999, came the “toilet seat” iBook. With its eye-catching trim it dropped a splash of colour into a dreary world of grey slabs designed for dreary boardroom meetings, and suddenly made laptops desirable. Even if it did look like a lavatory after a visit from the Changing Rooms team. WHY SHOULD I WANT ONE? Because the iBook G3 introduced some features that we take for granted these days – and some we kinda miss too. It had a built-in handle (useful as it weighed about the same as a small dog) and was the first mainstream laptop to come with Wi-Fi. However, with a maximum 6GB hard drive and 366Mhz processor, these days the specs look about as up-to- date as Gandhi riding a penny-farthing. WHAT SHOULD I LOOK FOR? The few iBooks up for sale on eBay seem to be reluctant listings, which says a lot about why they’re so scarce. As with any second hand laptop, chances are its life on the road will have taken its toll but aside from a few bumps and scrapes, iBooks seem to age fairly well – even the battery charge tends to hold strong. The hardest bit, in fact, will be convincing someone to sell one.

Reuters/Sergei Karpukhin A report has revealed that the Apple iPhone 8 could come with a never-seen-before wireless charging technology. It is believed that the 10th anniversary smartphone from Apple would come with a receiver inside. When the device needs to be charged, the receiver would connect to a transmitter plugged into wall socket. The flagship from Apple is said to have a radical new design. As per latest reports, Apple is working with Energous to introduce the wireless-charging technology for iPhone 8. If rumours are to be believed, the iPhone owner has to be within 15 feet of the transmitter for successful charging, writes BGR. Neither Energous nor Apple has confirmed this for iPhone 8 though the very concept of wireless charging has been on the cards for some time. Samsung introduced dual wireless charging for its Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge devices. The circular pads charge the device without the need to connect the device to a cable. Charging pads and stands are available that can support up to three devices though the wireless charging devices available currently require connecting to a socket with a cable. The technology being developed by Apple with Energous for iPhone 8 is new and eliminates all use of cables. As per The Indian Express, the Apple iPhone 8 could feature an OLED display and a glass back. The 2017 iPhone may not sport an aluminium back. A Nikkei report has also stated that Apple could release an additional screen size for iPhone 8. The 5-inch variant may have a 2.5D glass. Other reports have revealed that the Apple iPhone 8 will remove the physical Home button. A bezel-free curved design is also on the cards. The handset may also have an edgeless design. Moving towards a curved design seems like a strong possibility as talks have been there for quite some time now.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News TVC Mall Now Sells Samsung and Apple Phone Accessories on Both Wholesale and Retail Basis Shenzhen, China — (SBWIRE) — 11/14/2016 — TVC Mall, an ecommerce store that is in itself a one-stop store for gadgets and accessories, recently announced that they are now selling both Samsung and Apple phone accessories on wholesale and retail basis. The e-store now sells accessories for iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6 and all other Apple phones as well as of Samsung and many other brands. The owners of the e-store said that selling the phone accessories on wholesale and retail basis would help them in reaching out to more customers, both the individuals as well as B2B buyers. “We have also launched a range of Android phone accessories for Samsung and other brands only this month. We hope that our exhaustive collection of phone accessories would put a stop to the frantic search that many retailers and ordinary and individual customers undertake while they are in a need of quality and compatible phone accessories for their gadgets”, said the sales and marketing head of TVC Mall during a recent trade fair. The trade fair, which was held in Shanghai, was also the platform for TVC Mall to launch a series of mobile phone accessories which has just arrived. The owners said that the newly launched Samsung phone accessories and other sorts of accessories have generated investor interest and they have received a slew of trading proposals from prospective investors over the past one week. Besides the Shanghai trade fair, TVC Mall also participated in the 2016 HongKong trade fair. The CEO of TVC Mall led the team there himself, he said that they are optimistic about further growth and presence in the wholesale market, each trade fair meant a fresh new opportunities for their business.  He thought the only weakness that may hold back the growth speed of TVC Mall would be their supply chain and logistic system. Therefore, TVC Mall had made some efforts optimizing their supply chain for months and the progress had been promising. “TVC Mall has its commitment to both the infidel buyers and the retailers. We know many of the accessories we sell are not available in the aftermarkets as these are all quality Samsung and Apple phone accessories that made by branded manufacturers. At the same time, we are also committed to make shopping an enjoyable and cost-saving affair for the individual buyers who visit our e-store to buy mobile phone accessories for various brands every day. We always strive to strike a balance between cost, quality and afer-sales services”, he was quoted by local press.

The emphasis was intentional. Samsung’s target customers are carmakers who’d love to give their vehicles smartphone-like capabilities but are leery of surrendering unfettered access to their dashboards. They’ve largely kept a distance from Google, which could mine driver data for its own uses, or Apple Inc, which until recently had designs on building its own car. Samsung wants to marry its consumer electronics expertise and the fast 5G cellular network it’s developing with Harman’s presence in dashboards all over the world. If it works, they can offer carmakers a lightning-quick connected system for infotainment, mapping, concierge services and autonomous driving — and all without the worry that the automakers would be helping a future competitor. “This is not about building a car,” Young said in an interview. Several automakers “came to us and asked us to help with technologies like 5G, or artificial intelligence or memory. We can harness technologies to provide a better experience to automakers.” Samsung offered US$112 a share in cash for Harman, which was 28 per cent above the Stamford, Connecticut-based company’s closing price of US$87.65 in New York on Friday. The stock closed up 22 per cent to US$109.72, the biggest gain since its 1986 initial public offering. Samsung’s own shares rose on the deal, which was announced after the market closed yesterday. The stock climbed as much as 1.8 per cent as of 9:45am in Seoul. The acquisition reverberated through the car business, with Wells Fargo analyst David Lim saying in a research note that the deal could “ignite additional mergers and acquisitions of higher technology auto suppliers.” The shares of automotive electronics maker Visteon Corp. jumped 9.6 per cent — the most since August 2012 — and larger rival Delphi Automotive Plc gained 2.2 per cent. Deals like Samsung’s for Harman could be welcome by automakers, who want to control the revenue from connected car services and the customer data it generates as much as possible, said Jim Hines, a research director at Gartner. ‘Competitive dynamic’ “There is definitely a competitive dynamic that has emerged between the established automotive industry and these large tech companies that are looking to get a piece of that market opportunity,” Hines said. As automakers have rolled out connected services in their cars, they have been very careful in how they work with Google and Apple. General Motors Co allows its customers to connect their smartphones into the dashboard through Apple’s Car Play and Google’s Android Auto — but only with selected apps, and the phones cannot access a car’s data. Toyota Motor Corp. doesn’t allow its cars to connect to either system. The fear among carmakers is that Apple and Google could either mine the data inside the car, tracking everything from driving patterns to engine performance, to either become a new face to the consumer or to help them build cars. The fact that Harman is already a supplier and that Samsung doesn’t have a system that competes with the in-car connected services sold by carmakers could make them a more attractive partner, Hines said. Partner or threat? “They might be viewed as less of a threat in terms of tech partner for some of these leading automotive brands,” Hines said. Samsung wants to become a high-tech supplier capable of building connected systems. Its expertise is making the hardware, like microprocessing units, and a faster 5G network to deliver more data to cars faster. Harman sells — among other technologies — 3D navigation, apps for integrating other devices into the car, active safety systems and audio systems that can access the cloud. There are a lot of opportunities once the companies combine, Harman Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dinesh Paliwal said in a phone interview. Imagine a car that that can read a driver’s daily schedule and automatically dial into a conference call, Paliwal said. Autonomous driving will only give drivers access to more connected capabilities for work or entertainment, he said. “We’ll be in the best possible position because we have all the capabilities,” Paliwal said. Overcoming weaknesses Assuming the merger goes through, Samsung will need to develop other capabilities, especially in software, said Cyrus Mewawalla, lead analyst at CM Research. Like Google and Apple, Samsung wants to own and provide the servers, the hardware that’s doing all the computing and the memory storage for connected cars. They also want to own the platform that runs the apps, in the way that Apple’s iOS and Android do now. While they have expertise in some things like microprocessors, they don’t have all of those capabilities, Mewawalla said. “They’d need more than just this acquisition,” he said. “The two key weaknesses Samsung has is the software ecosystem and cloud infrastructure, and that’s where it needs to be acquiring.” Artificial intelligence, in which Samsung has recently made a deal, should be a particular area of focus in the near future, he added. If it chooses, the company could also have the resources to develop such capabilities on its own once Harman’s 8,000 software engineers and join Samsung, which spends US$13 billion a year on research and development and US$23 billion in capital expenditures. “Imagine the scale of our R&D,” Paliwal said. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Nepal PM phones India’s Modi over rupee chaos Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year United to delay taking Boeing jets in US$4.8b savings push Bursa Malaysia ends higher on window-dressing, higher oil prices Macau sets US$25b gaming target for 2017 below estimates Oil slumps as prospect of Trump victory roils global markets Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Malaysia growth push stymied by banks cautious on loans US stocks decline after rally as election takes centre stage BNM: Ringgit fell against most world currencies in third quarter Most Watched Now Week MMOTV: Time to show up with daughter, Indira tells ex-husband NYT Video: ScienceTake — how dolphins know who’s who Reuters Video: Groin-flashing frog discovered in Australia Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Related Articles US stocks mixed as Samsung announces US$8b Harman deal (VIDEO) Samsung seeks redemption with AI-infused Galaxy S8 phone Samsung Electronics to invest more than US$1b in US chip production Samsung Electronics’ third quarter profit guidance beats estimates despite Note 7 woes Samsung targeted by activist investors to restructure company Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The wearable headset would show images, along with other information and may use augmented reality, according to the report. Chief Executive Tim Cook, who has been struggling with a slowdown in iPhone sales in recent quarters, said earlier this year that the company would continue to invest a lot into augmented reality. Apple, the world’s largest technology company, has ordered a small number of near-eye displays for testing but has not obtained enough for production on a larger scale, the report added. Apple declined to comment. The move would make Apple the latest tech company to venture into wearable glasses. Alphabet Inc’s discontinued its own wearable glass headset, Google Glass, and closed the social media account linked to the device earlier this year, ending its attempt to popularize the expensive devices with consumers. The device received plenty of attention when it was launched in 2012, but quickly ran into problems with its awkward appearance and privacy concerns over video recording.

While still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer's field of vision, and may use augmented reality, the people said.

Apple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, the people said. Apple hasn't ordered enough components so far to indicate imminent mass-production, one of the people added. Should Apple ultimately decide to proceed with the device, it would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, another person said. The California-based company tests many different products and is known to pivot, pause, or cancel projects without disclosing them. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Apple CEO Tim Cook has talked up the benefits of augmented reality in the past. Photo: Bloomberg CEO Tim Cook is under pressure to deliver new products amid slowing sales of the iPhone, which accounts for two-thirds of Apple's revenue. In July, he expressed enthusiasm for augmented reality after the rise of Pokemon Go, a location-based game that uses the technology. AR, as it's known, adds images and other digital information to people's view of the real world, while virtual reality completely surrounds them with a computer-generated environment. The glasses may be Apple's first hardware product targeted directly at AR, one of the people said. Cook has beefed up AR capabilities through acquisitions. In 2013, Apple bought PrimeSense, which developed motion-sensing technology in Microsoft Kinect gaming system. Purchases of software start-ups in the field, Metaio and Flyby Media, followed in 2015 and 2016. Advertisement "AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this," Cook said in a July 26 conference call with analysts. "We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity." Apple has AR patents for things like street view in mapping apps. It was also awarded patents for smart glasses that make use of full-fledged virtual reality. Apple is unlikely to leverage VR in a mass-consumer product, Cook suggested in October. Google Glass was widely criticised.  "I can't imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you're sitting in here with me, but I could imagine everyone in here in an AR experience right now," he said during an onstage discussion in Utah. Apple's challenge is fitting all the technology needed into a useful pair of internet-connected glasses that are small and sleek enough for regular people to wear. Google's attempt to develop internet-connected eyewear flopped in part because its tiny battery ran out quickly. Google Glass, as it was called, also suffered a privacy backlash and poor public perception of its external design. Bloomberg Advertisement 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Apple Pay Can Now Be Used For Donations Posted: Nov 14 2016, 4:56pm CST | by Noel Diem, in News | Apple   Photo Credit: Getty Images   Apple has announced that they will work with nonprofits, allowing them to take donations using Apple Pay. This will include Apple Pay on the internet as well as on mobile apps. There are hopes that it will increase charitable giving. Don't Miss: Best Amazon Black Friday 2016 Deals Apple previously had a rule that iOS apps couldn't collect funds for charities or fundraisers using Apple Pay. It means that if they collected funds, they'd have to go through Safari or SMS. Now they will be able to go straight through the app. On mobile, users will be able to use TouchID. Online, users can click the Apple Pay button and confirm using iPhone or Apple Watch. Already, online stores that take Apple Pay have said that conversion rates are up and customers check out faster, according to TechCrunch. The reason that this system works is because everything is streamlined. Apple Pay has millions and millions of customers, and will add more each and every week. The technology is integrated into many iOS apps. In fact, Apple Pay transactions have increased by nearly 500% and more were made in one month this year than in all of last year. Many nonprofits are launching Apple Pay, including the following: American Red Cross, American Heart Association, charity: water, Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, COPD Foundation, Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA), Doctors Without Borders, Feeding America, GlobalGiving, International Rescue Committee, Red, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, The Nature Conservancy, Save the Children, The Water Project, UNICEF, United Way, WNET, World Vision and WWF (World Wildlife Federation). A few others will join soon.

Donating via Apple Pay means you don't need to enter billing and contact info, create an account, or fill out long forms. “We’re making it incredibly easy to give back with Apple Pay,” said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay. “Websites and apps tell us they see twice as many people actually completing a purchase with Apple Pay than with other payment methods.

The science is in; global warming is a scam. The increasing CO2 isn't a "deadly greenhouse gas" at all; it's causing plant life to increase exponentially and thereby increase oxygen. Global temperatures are not increasing. The polar ice caps will never go above freezing and they are gaining ice mass in the center. Don't fund the fear.

While still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a secret project. Apple has reportedly discussed the project with potential suppliers and has ordered a small quantity of 'near-eye displays' for testing. So far the company hasn't ordered enough components to suggest it will enter production. It's likely that if Apple decides to pursue the project it would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company is investing a lot in AR and is 'high on AR for the long run'. Augmented reality "is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there, but it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it," Cook said last month. "Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today." Notably, a recent report from Robert Scoble predicts that the next iPhone will be a clear piece of glass that can be inserted into a headset which has eye sensors on it. The iPhone would be able to put holograms on top of the real world. Another report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims that Apple is working on augmented reality technology for use in key products and autonomous driving.

New York, NY (Top40 Charts / Beijing TaiHe Music Culture Development) Chinese Star Kris Wu (Yifan Wu)'s new single "July" was released on Apple Music + iTunes yesterday, announcing his return as a singer. The new single of Kris draws huge public attention immediately by its strong beat, quality production and advancing "Future Bass" style. Several hours after the debut on Apple Music and iTunes on November 3rd, "July" has become the second single by a Chinese artist to enter the Top 50 iTunes charts in the US, ranking No.1 in its own genre. Aside from iTunes, it will be available on other international digital platforms, including Spotify, KKBOX, Omusic and Deezer. "July" has quickly swept the entire Asia-Pacific region by leading the popular song list in many countries. According to Kris studio, Kris participated the composing and writing for the new single "July". By mixing electro R&B and EDM elements alongside with the popular "Future Bass" style, produced by world class producer, "July" was recorded in the same studio where Michael Jackson recorded "Bad". About Kris Wu Kris is an actor, singer and fashion icon. Kris has appeared in multiple box office movies, and he will be in Galaxy Agent and Triple X3. On October 14, 2007, Kris auditioned for S.M. Entertainment's Canadian Global Auditions, which were held in Vancouver. After passing the auditions, he moved to South Korea in January 2008 and became a trainee for the company. Kris debuted as one of the members of EXO on April 8, 2012 with MAMA. The group quickly rose to fame only a year after their debut and Kris became one of the most popular members and the captain of the group. Music is the best birthday gift Kris released the single "Bad girl" on his birthday last year, which caused a huge reaction from his fans. Kris said that he would keep releasing a new song on every birthday as a tradition, because he wanted to make his birthday a carnival, and he wished to have special gift for everybody on his birthday.

Is The New MacBook Pro With TouchBar A Good Computer? Nov 14 2016, 3:32 PM 32 diggs Save Share Tweet 'nana Blacklist story Blacklist domain Today, the brand new MacBook Pro with TouchBar, which was unveiled just a few weeks ago, arrives in the hands of the consumer. It's also the day that, evidently, the review embargo was lifted. So, is a computer with a touchscreen worth $1,799? Here's what the reviews say. Is The TouchBar Actually Useful? As its name suggests, the MacBook Pro with TouchBar comes with a thin multi-touch LED screen where the function keys used to be. Gimmick or not, the TouchBar's ability to display context-sensitive actions for whatever application you're using is one of the few hardware interface experiments in the PC industry. But does it actually work? According to The Verge's Jacob Kastrenakes it does... almost: The Touch Bar is often used like a menu, rather than a quick set of controls. Having those menu options exposed so clearly can be helpful at times — I’m bad at finding formulas in Keynote, for instance, and the Touch Bar makes them easy to access — but mostly it’s not. These apps don’t need more menus; they need better context for people just starting out in them, and a streamlined way for experienced users to get stuff done. [The Verge] Ars Technica's Andrew Cunningham points out that the utility of the TouchBar lies squarely in the hands of the developers. Sure, it works in Apple's own apps, but outside of that you're likely to forget the TouchBar even exists: The ultimate utility of the Touch Bar is going to depend entirely on the apps you use and, to a lesser extent, how you use your computer. If it’s being used as a desktop with an external keyboard a significant amount of the time, the Touch Bar does nothing for you. When I went out of my way to use Apple’s apps, I liked the Touch Bar a lot. It just takes one or two useful buttons—creating a new tab in Safari, looking up a main page in Terminal, changing font sizes or creating checklists in Notes—to make you glad the Touch Bar is there. However, a typical day for me is spent mostly in Word, Outlook, Slack, Tweetbot, and Chrome. Microsoft is bringing Touch Bar support to Office, but if other app makers don’t start adding in support, a big chunk of that bar is going to end up sitting empty most of the time. [Ars Technica] Based on the impressions of CNET's Dan Ackerman, who seems to really enjoy the TouchBar, at best it'll make your life a little easier here and there but won't totally change the way you use a computer: Having spent some serious hands-on time with the Touch Bar version of the new 13-inch MacBook Pro, and testing its capabilities with a wide range of apps, it feels like a tool that can enhance your computing experience, but won't revolutionize it. It does less than a full touchscreen might, but Apple has found a way to use it to cut down on keystrokes, streamline tasks and add additional levels of fine control. [CNET] The Port Situation Is A Hassle Perhaps you've heard some frustrated criticisms of Apple's Decision to equip the MacBook Pro with just four USB-C ports. There is no MagSafe charging port. There is no DisplayPort. There is, as the gaming bros over at Razer pointed out, no SD card slot. Just four USB-C slots and a whole mess of dongles. The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern explains, like the loss of the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, the switch to USB-C is necessary in the long run, but annoying today: USB-C is a wonderful port. A faster, single type of port for connecting chargers, hard drives, phones, monitors? It’s the dream. Today, though, it’s a dongle nightmare. Until the entire tech industry catches up, you’re stuck dragging around pricey, flimsy adapters to connect everything. Apple has slashed USB-C adapter pricing for now, but it should have included that $9 USB-C to USB adapter in the box [The Wall Street Journal] The Keyboard Is A Bit Odd But The Speakers Are Good Apple completely redesigned the MacBook Pro to be both thinner and lighter. This quest for doing more with less has it's winners and losers, however. To save space, Apple opted for its shorter-travel butterfly key design, originally found on the MacBook. For Endgadget's Dana Wollman, who was very familiar with the older, softer keys, they new butterfly design took a few weeks to stick: Though Apple claims the butterfly mechanism allows for more even button presses, my key strikes would sometimes fail to register, leading me to make typos and forcing me to go back and reenter my long password a second or even third time. By now, though, after some two-odd weeks of testing, I'm typing at a faster clip. I still sometimes screw up my passwords, but my emails and first drafts (including this review!) are mostly clean. I've gone from merely tolerating the new keyboard to actually appreciating it. [Endgadget] Somehow, the thinner design brought us better speakers? According to Macworld's Susie Ochs, they're on-par with a Bluetooth speaker: What isn’t a bummer are the new speakers, my favorite non-Touch Bar feature of the new machines. Apple explained that since they are connected right to the battery with no transformer between them, the speakers can get twice the peak power—and you can really hear the difference. Music sounds great when you turn the volume all the way up, and the speakers are powerful enough to provide satisfying sound while watching movies, TV, and sports. The 15-inch model’s speakers seem to have more oomph than the 13-incher’s, but both can ably fill a hotel room with music, if you should want to leave your portable Bluetooth speaker at home. [Macworld] It's Powerful Enough A major gripe within those who have an eye for hardware specs is that Apple neglected to include Intel's newest processor, their fifth-generation Broadwell CPU, and instead opted for the fourth-gen Haswell. A curious omission for what Apple calls it's most powerful MacBook yet. Still, practically speaking, not being on the bleeding edge doesn't seems okay? It's fine, says Fast Company's Harry McCracken: Given that some of Apple's most demanding professional users are fretting about these machines' processors and RAM capacities, should those of us who don't need tippy-top-of-the-line performance be concerned? I'll leave benchmarking to experts such as the folks at AnandTech, but these Macs have more than enough horsepower for non-superhuman computing tasks; even though Apple didn't use Intel's latest processors, it called on technologies such as high-speed solid-state storage to keep things fast. [Fast Company] Ultimately, It Might Be Good To Just Wait A TouchBar developers have yet to quite figure out, an I/O port standard that's still in its infancy, a slightly underwhelming choice of processor — there are a few teething issues with the new MacBrook Pro. And for a minimum $1,799 entry fee, well, that's an iffy proposition. WIRED's David Pierce suggests that, like the original iPhone, it might be better to just wait for the second go-round: Do you desperately need a new laptop right this second? If not, wait. Run your current (and probably still excellent) machine into the ground, then buy a new one. In a year or two USB-C accessories will be everywhere, developers will have figured out what the Touch Bar is good for, and Apple may even give the Pro spec bump.

Firefighters responded to a structure fire at 13663 Navajo Road a little before 1:15 a.m. and found heavy smoke coming from one of the units of a strip mall with threat of spreading through the entire structure. The fire district responded with three engines, a chief officer and fire investigator, with assistance from San Bernardino County Fire Department and Cal Fire. Firefighters attacked with “swift and aggressive ventilation” and contained the fire to the single unit. Fire officials said explosions were heard during the fire fight. The entire unit was damaged from heavy smoke and fire. The cause of the blaze was unknown and under investigation, fire officials said Monday afternoon. “Investigators are in the process of reviewing surveillance video and interviewing witnesses,” fire officials said. The investigation is ongoing and anyone with information is asked to call the AVFPD at 760-247-7618.

Apple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now. The American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. Apple said that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods. Separately, Samsung said a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent. They will be redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products. Americans are just starting to warm up to mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. Although usage is growing, mobile payments are still a small portion of overall sales.

All eyes are also looking at Pangu to release a new iOS 10 jailbreak tool. The Chinese team remains one of the most renowned hacking groups, especially when it comes to Apple jailbreaks. As per the latest iOS Jailbreak news, team Pangu is planning to introduce the most awaited jailbreak tool no later than December. This will be a huge holiday gift to jailbreak fans, but a big setback for Apple, which has been waging war against hackers that tinker with its mobile OS for years now. CNET reported that iOS 10.2, currently in public beta two, will most likely debut around December. It will come with new features and bug fixes that are said to be “worth the upgrade.” However, the jailbreak community is more concerned about the bug fixes. iOS Jailbreak News: Releasing This December The last working tool by team Pangu was iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak which seems like it came out ages ago. Meanwhile, some not-so-renowned individual hackers have claimed to have iOS 10 cracks. Among the other names is Lucas Todesco, but nothing has been made public. Considering that, the claims look nothing more than hoaxes. Todesco tweeted on November 5 and shared the news with their followers. “Updated my stuff so it works on 10.1 too now,” he captioned a photo of his phone. Many of his followers asked him to help Pangu release a mass tool for iOS 10. It cannot be said if Todesco will share his findings with Pangu. Rumors have it that Team Pangu is waiting for next big iOS jump to complete the tool. Since the release did not happen with versions 10.1 and 10.1.1 jailbreak fans are expecting 10.2 to come out in December. Many question if team Pangu is working on a jailbreak for iOS 10. The team showed off Apple’s latest mobile OS being jailbroken months ago. Cydia was demoed running on iOS 10 and that was taken to be a promise that the JB tool will come out soon. Contrary to the expectations, the Chinese hackers maintained quiet until now. Yet people hope that an iOS 10 jailbreak will be released soon. As of now, December is said to be the month when the team is expected to release iOS 10 jailbreak tool to  the public. Do you think team Pangu will come up with the much-awaited tool by this December?  Let us know in the comment box below. For more updates, stay tuned to TechPLZ.

Instant donations can be made in this way to 19 organisations, with more due to accept it soon. Apple Pay offers a secure way to donate to a nonprofit with just one touch. It is similar to contactless payments but with the addition of two-factor authentication for security. It makes the giving process faster and easier by removing the need to enter billing and contact information on web forms. It can be used on a compatible iOS device or on the web with Safari through macOS Sierra. Charity: water accepts monthly gifts to its regular giving programme via Apple Pay. Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay, explained: “Websites and apps tell us they see twice as many people actually completing a purchase with Apple Pay than with other payment methods. We think offering such a simple and secure way to support the incredible work nonprofits do will have a significant impact on the communities they serve.” Apple Pay was announced in September 2014 and initially available only to merchants in the USA. It has been expanded internationally since then, with payments being handled in the UK for the first time in July 2015. Christmas giving The extension to nonprofits comes at an opportune time, as US nonprofits gear up for the Christmas season of giving and the year-end campaigns that typically generate major spikes in giving.   Nonprofits have had to wait behind for-profit merchants for Apple payment systems before. Apple had a policy of not allowing developers to add ‘donate’ functionality to apps, including in-app payments, in its iTunes app store. Aware of the missed opportunity for charities, nonprofit staff and others triggered a petition in 2010, asking the company to change. Now developers will be able to integrate Apple Pay directly within nonprofits’ apps, avoiding the need to direct people to give outside the app on the web or via SMS. First nonprofits to accept Apple Pay donations The first US nonprofits to accept donations by Apple Pay are: American Red Cross American Heart Association charity: water Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals COPD Foundation Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) Doctors without Borders Feeding America GlobalGiving International Rescue Committee (RED) St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital Save the Children The Nature Conservancy The Water Project UNICEF WNET World Vision WWF (World Wildlife Fund) They will be followed by: American Cancer Society CARE DonorsChoose.org PBS and its local stations United Way charity: water and Apple Pay charity: water is integrating Apple Pay across all giving platforms on desktop and mobile to provide a seamless experience for supporters. Donors can use Apple Pay when they join charity: water’s monthly giving program, The Spring, make a one-time donation, or give to birthday or fundraising campaigns. In addition to Apple Pay, donors can also give to charity: water through PayPal, credit card, or linking their bank account directly. Scott Harrison, founder and CEO of charity: water explained how and why the nonprofit was one of the first to use the payment tool: “At charity: water, we’re always looking for new ways to make funding clean water projects easier than ever. We’re thrilled to be one of the first charities that supports donations through Apple Pay. “663 million people around the world live without clean drinking water, but solutions are readily available and clean water transforms lives and communities. By integrating Apple Pay and making giving effortless – whether someone’s making an end of year donation or joining our new monthly giving program, The Spring – we hope to impact more lives than ever before.” Using Apple Pay How significant is Apple Pay for charities? Should UK charities plan to adopt it when it becomes available in the UK? Roger Craven of mobile payment specialists RSM 2000 told UK Fundraising that it was still too early for most UK charities to commit time and resource to this issue. He said: “Each charity needs to make a judgement about the benefits of additional donations that they might turn away versus the disruption and confusion that introducing a new payment mechanism will add. “If Apple Pay is to be seen as purely substitutional for existing payment methods then how does getting involved in Apple Pay further any charity’s objectives? Apple Pay could in the long run be a game changer, but its short term impact will only be significant to the sector if it can be used to solve particular problems that fundraisers face. “Charities should be looking to explore using Apple Pay to open up cost effectively new giving propositions (e.g. unattended) or make existing ones more cost effective (e.g. street fundraising) or tapping into particular donor segments (e.g. elite high rollers).”   When will UK charities be able to accept donations via Apple Pay?

It was only last week that Cuscal announced that it had signed a deal that would see 31 of its partner financial institutions, including a range of smaller banks and credit unions, adopt Apple Pay as a payment processing platform with the promise that Apple Pay would be available "soon". Soon in this context is today, with many of the insitutions on Cuscal’s original list announcing Apple Pay compatibility from today. The move expands the number of institutions offering Apple Pay quite markedly, as previously it had been open only to ANZ and American Express Card customers where the card was issued by American Express itself. The other big three banks are engaged in an ongoing fight with Apple over access to the NFC hardware that enables contactless payments. Apple argues that the big banks aren't interested in competition in the payments space. Not every financial institution initially named by Cuscal (you can check the list here) appears to have jumped on board just yet. While several larger outlets, including Teachers Mutual Bank and Bank Australia, are displaying Apple Pay compatibility notices on their homepages, a number of other smaller financial institutions are not displaying an indication that they’re doing so. That may be because they plan to come on board with Apple Pay at some later stage, or could simply be that they haven't updated their sites. they’re not displaying it directly on the respective web sites just yet. If you're not sure if your bank or credit union has activated the service, the best move would be to contact it directly. Cuscal had already signed a deal that allowed its banks and credit unions to adopt Android Pay as well, which means that customers of those institutions now have access to a wide range of contactless, smartphone-based payment solutions. Check our list of banks offering Android Pay and banks offering Apple Pay to see who is on board.

By Asha McLean | November 15, 2016 -- 00:12 GMT (16:12 PST) | Topic: Banking CUA has announced the launch of Apple Pay, allowing customers of the member-owned financial organisation to use their CUA Visa Debit card through the iPhone maker's digital wallet. In a statement, CUA said the launch of Apple Pay feeds into the institution's focus on digital capability and investing in digital channels. Latest Australian news ​Department of Finance to rebuild two-year-old IT system Telstra launches Smart Home devices and pricing ​Turnbull's DTA to establish a whole-of-government program management office Vodafone continues losing customers as Telstra, Optus, Amaysim gain: Kantar Australian banks dismiss Android NFC past in Apple Pay negotiations "CUA members have been asking when we'd be rolling out Apple Pay and we are excited that they can now enjoy the benefits and convenience of making payments using their Apple devices," said CUA chief operating officer for member services Andy Rigg. Apple Pay was launched in Australia in November, with American Express the only financial institution partner joining the iPhone maker's near-field communication (NFC) payments at the time. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) was then the first bank in the country to integrate Apple Pay, with ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott admitting in April that the launch was in direct response to the "hounding" he received from customers on Twitter and via email. ANZ is the only member of Australia's big four to embrace Apple Pay by leaving the group of banks requesting collective bargaining rights with Apple. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank, Westpac Bank, and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank have been seeking regulatory approval to collectively negotiate with third-party mobile providers such as Apple on conditions relating to competition, best practice standards, and efficiency. Specifically, they want non-exclusive access to the NFC chip, standardised security for all mobile payments systems, and price transparency on transaction costs within Australia. "Collective negotiation is necessary in a context where Apple has the ability and incentive to lock competitors out of the iPhone's NFC technology needed to make integrated mobile payments," the banks said in their joint response to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) last month. According to a list published last week by Australian independent payment solutions provider Cuscal, 31 financial institutions will be soon joining ANZ and CUA in offering Apple Pay in Australia. The list includes: Bank Australia, Catalyst Money, Credit Union SA, Defence Bank, My State Bank, People's Choice Credit Union, Police Bank, Customs Bank, QT Mutual Bank, Teachers Mutual Bank, UniBank, and Woolworths Employees' Credit Union. CUA announced its partnership with Android Pay in August, allowing CUA Visa debit card and CUA credit card customers to pay with the digital wallet. "The way our members choose to pay is changing with a rapid increase in contactless payments over the past year. The launch of Android Pay is the next stage of the exciting evolution of banking in Australia," Rigg said at the time. "CUA has a track record of working with third parties to leverage external expertise to make us a leader in providing mobile payment technologies to our members." CUA was also the first financial institution in the Asia Pacific to launch a mobile tap-and-pay app, with its with redi2PAY platform that turns any NFC-enabled smartphone running the latest Andorid operating system into a contactless payment device.

Brian McDonagh has brought a challenge against Bord Pleanála’s decision last August to allow Apple build the data centre, which is one of eight such proposed developments, at lands at Toberroe, Palmerstown, Derrydonnell at Athenry in Co Galway. Mr McDonagh, who was previously given permission to have the board’s decision judicially reviewed, wants the decision quashed on grounds including it breaches EU directives on forestry. At yesterday’s sitting of the commercial court, Apple Distribution International, the entity which seeks to develop the data centre and a notice party to Mr McDonagh’s action, applied to have the case admitted to the fast-track court list. READ NEXT Tullow Uganda may be delayed Representing himself, Mr McDonagh of Unit 1, Ballymount Cross Business Park, Dublin 24 said he “did not oppose Apple coming to Athenry” but wanted to ensure they “comply with proper planning procedures”.  He said he wanted the case heard by the High Court or in Europe. Seeking to have the matter fast-tracked, Rory Mulcahy SC for Apple, said that Mr McDonagh had been refused permission by the High Court to include the argument about an alleged breach of the forestry directive in his action. He has appealed that ruling to the Court of Appeal, counsel added. Counsel said Mr McDonagh did not make any submissions to Galway Co Council in respect of the original planning application, nor did he appeal to the board. Mr McDonagh “only came on the field after the board made its decision”, counsel said.  Having considered the submissions, Mr Justice Brian McGovern said he would admit what was an appropriate case to the list. The court heard that last week a separate action was brought by Sinead Fitzpatrick and Allan Daly who are also challenging Bord Pleanála’s decision.  Ms Fitzpatrick and Mr Daly of Lisheenkyle, Athenry, which is close to the proposed centre claim the decision to grant permission to Apple is invalid on grounds including that the board failed to carry out a proper assessment of the effects the proposed development will have on the environment. The judge also ruled that the two cases are to be heard together next March. Apple says the proposed centre is a critical piece of infrastructure.

The wearable headset would connect wirelessly to iPhones and show information that is superimposed onto a user's view of the real world. The firm has talked about the project with potential suppliers for Google Glass-style headsets. It is unclear when a finished product will be unveiled, but the earliest time frame for a reveal is 2018. Scroll down for video  Apple looks like it may be moving into the world of augmented reality, by considering expanding into wearable glass headsets. Chief Executive Tim Cook, said earlier this year that the company would continue to invest a lot into augmented reality THE END OF GOOGLE GLASS  Alphabet discontinued its own wearable glass headset, Google Glass, and closed the social media account linked to the device earlier this year. This ends its attempt to popularise the expensive devices with consumers. The device received plenty of attention when it was launched in 2012, but quickly ran into problems with its awkward appearance and privacy concerns over video recording.  A report by Bloomberg cites 'people familiar with the issue' who asked not to be identified.  . Chief Executive Tim Cook, who has been struggling with a slowdown in iPhone sales in recent quarters, said earlier this year that the company would continue to invest a lot into augmented reality (AR). Augmented reality is a tool that overlays digital information with the user's environment in real-time.  The glasses would be Apple's first product targeted directly at AR, according to the report.  The firm has built up its AR research through the acquisition of several firms, including PrimeSense, which developed motion-sensing technology in Microsoft's Kinect Gaming syste. 'AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this,' Mr Cook said in a conference call with analysts.  'We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.' RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next From your travels to your diet, the molecules left on your...

The company is still exploring the smart glasses market, the report states, so it’s unclear when a finished product will materialize. The earliest time frame for a product reveal is 2018, yet Apple could sit on the project for much longer or change its direction as it has with its automotive ambitions. Apple is exploring both AR and VR It’s been well known for months now that Apple has been collecting AR talent and putting minds to work in secret on some type of consumer product. CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly answered AR-related questions on quarterly earnings calls, saying he thinks the technology has more potential than its virtual reality counterpart and coyly hinting at Apple’s plans to enter the space. However, as of September of this year, Apple continues to hire both AR and VR experts, leaving open the possibility that it could develop products in both categories. According to Bloomberg, Apple has already had talks with potential suppliers for components like near-eye displays. It also has the expertise behind companies like PrimeSense, Metaio, and Flyby, all startups that were focused on AR software, 3D mapping, and computer vision before Apple acquired them over the course of the last three years. The goal is to develop a pair of glasses that could connect wirelessly to an iPhone and overlay information on the wearer’s field of vision. Apple has acquired a number of startups specializing in AR software AR is not without its hurdles. Google Glass was a massive flop, giving AR a sour public image and showing just how far the technology needs to go before it can be worn on our face. The most capable headset available to the public right now is the developer version of Microsoft’s HoloLens, which costs $3,000. Another startup, Magic Leap, continues to work in secret on AR technology it will not discuss in detail. Meanwhile, the rest of the tech community has turned its focus to VR. Google has its Daydream platform and new View headsets, while Facebook-owned Oculus VR and Samsung are working on all manner of high-end and mobile headsets. It’s unclear where Apple will fall on the spectrum, but Cook remains bullish on AR. “There are some really hard technology challenges there, but it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it,” he said of AR last month. - Source: Bloomberg News Next Up In Circuit Breaker Toms-branded Apple Watch bands are for when you want to look like a woke bae Aiaiai’s modular headphones can be upgraded to Bluetooth with this swappable headband Roccat's new over-ear headphones let you switch mics for mobile gaming Nokia's canceled smartwatch appears in leaked video Lyft is replacing the pink mustache with a psychedelic dash display that knows your name Some 'Enhanced' games are having frame rate issues on the PS4 Pro Now Trending MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: a touch of the future WhatsApp opens up video calling to everyone The Walking Dead Redemption Club season 7, episode 4: Service This Article has a component height of 10.

For the ECB, the issue is what to do about its bond-buying program, which pumps new money into Europe's struggling economy each month to try to accelerate growth and inflation. The Fed and the ECB two of the world's most important central banks will be making its policy decisions before Trump is inaugurated Jan. 20, while still weighing what he might do as president. ___ Trump set to roll back Obama policies on energy, environment WASHINGTON President-elect Donald Trump is considering an oil billionaire and a North Dakota lawmaker for top posts as he moves to roll back President Barack Obama's environmental and energy policies and allow unfettered production of oil, coal and natural gas. Trump pledges to sharply increase oil and gas drilling on federal lands while opening up offshore drilling in the Atlantic Ocean and other areas where it is blocked. Topping Trump's to-do list is repealing the Clean Power Plan, Obama's signature effort to limit carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. ___ Siemens to buy Oregon-based Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion FRANKFURT, Germany German industrial equipment maker Siemens AG says it has agreed to buy U.S.-based software firm Mentor Graphics Corp. for $4.5 billion, broadening Siemens digital capabilities. Siemens said it would pay $37.25 a share in cash, or 21 percent more than Mentor's closing price on Friday. Mentor, based in Wilsonville, Oregon, specializes in software used to design computer chips, technology with broad potential applications to smart and connected devices such as autonomous vehicles. It has customers in industries ranging from aerospace to consumer electronics and 5,700 employees in 32 countries. ___ American Apparel files for bankruptcy protection, again WASHINGTON American Apparel is seeking bankruptcy protection for the second time in just over a year, unable to find its footing in a shifting retail landscape and after a fight for control with its founder Dov Charney. Canada's Gildan Activewear is buying the American Apparel brand for $66 million. The retailer first filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2015, about a year after it fired Charney for violating its sexual harassment policy. Charney's lengthy legal campaign to retake control of the company was rejected by a bankruptcy court judge in January. ___ US stocks finish level as tech losses cancel out bank gains NEW YORK U.S. stocks came back from an early loss and finished almost unchanged Monday. Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week's election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump's policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. ___ Vroom: Gov't to require hybrid, electric cars to make noise WASHINGTON New hybrid and electric cars are required to make noise when traveling at low speeds so that pedestrians, especially those who are blind or have poor eyesight, will hear them coming, under a new rule released Monday by the Obama administration. The new rule could help prevent about 2,400 pedestrian injuries a year, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The rule requires hybrid and electric vehicles to make audible noise when traveling in reverse or forward at speeds up to about 19 mph. The sound alert isn't required at higher speeds because other factors, such as tire and wind noise, provide warning. ___ Samsung's $8B ticket into the red-hot automotive tech race SEOUL, South Korea Samsung Electronics' $8 billion acquisition of the U.S. auto electronics company Harman will instantly transform the tech company into a major player in the highly competitive market for auto infotainment, software and connected car technology. Samsung announced Monday that it would pay $112 per share in cash for the company, its largest acquisition by far. Harman International Industries Inc. makes touch screens that control vehicle functions and infotainment systems, and it's dominant in automotive sound systems with brands such as Harman Kardon, JBL, Infinity and Mark Levinson. ___ Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay to offer rewards NEW YORK Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. Apple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services until now. The American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. ___ Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway invests in major airlines NEW YORK Warren Buffett is changing his mind about airlines and buying stakes in several major carriers including American Air Lines and Delta Air Lines. The billionaire investor has famously avoided the sector in the past, although his Berkshire Hathaway does own NetJets, which sells partial ownership interests in business jets. Buffett disclosed the new investments, which also include United Continental Holdings, Monday in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ___ SEC Chair White leaving at end of Obama administration WASHINGTON The Securities and Exchange Commission says the agency's head, Mary Jo White, will leave office at the end of the Obama administration. White, a former federal prosecutor and private securities lawyer, was appointed by President Barack Obama in February 2013. Her term doesn't end until 2019. President-elect Donald Trump is due to take office Jan. 20 and likely will name his own choice to head the market watchdog agency in the near future. ___ PetSmart fined for not reporting injury-causing fish bowls NEW YORK PetSmart will pay a $4.25 million civil fine for not quickly reporting defective fish bowls that caused serious injuries at least a dozen times. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday that injuries included deep cuts requiring stitches and severed tendons that required surgery after bowls cracked or shattered. The pet products retailer sold the bowls under the "Grreat Choice" and "Top Fin" brands from March 2010 through September 2013. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,868.69. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 0.25 points to 2,164.20. The Nasdaq composite slid 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped 9 cents to $43.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 32 cents to $44.43 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.28 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.39 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 13 cents, or 5 percent, to $2.75 per 1,000 cubic feet. Copyright 2016 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Yesterday AAPL: 105.71 -2.72 Report: Apple exploring digital glasses, could release its offering as early as 2018 Chance Miller - 18 hours ago @ChanceHMiller AAPL View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit According to a new report from Bloomberg, Apple is currently weighing the possibility of expanding into the field of digital glasses. While the report is sparse on details, it notes that the market could be particularly lucrative for Apple. Apple is weighing an expansion into digital glasses, a risky but potentially lucrative area of wearable computing, according to people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg News reports. The report goes on to explain that the idea is still in the “exploration phase,” but that digital glasses would connect wirelessly to a user’s iPhone and present media such as images in the user’s field of vision. The glasses may also take advantage of augmented reality, an area that Tim Cook has been very vocal about in the past. Apple has reportedly already reached out to potential suppliers about the idea, ordering small quantities of near-eye displays “from one supplier for testing.” The company, however, hasn’t ordered enough components to indicate a mass-production launch anytime soon. In fact, today’s report notes that should Apple decide to move forward with its digital glasses initiative, it won’t be until 2018 at the earliest that they’re released. Apple, however, is known to test many products and cancel them before they see the light of day, and that’s still a very real possibility with the digital glasses. Apple has acquired a handful of companies with expertise in augmented reality over recent years, including Metaio and several top experts in the field. When it comes to hardware for digital glasses, however, Apple will face many challenges. Fitting the necessary components for the device in a form factor that’s comfortable enough for 24/7 wearing is a problem that has plagued earlier offerings in this market. Though, as Apple has proved in the past, it doesn’t let the efforts of other companies dictate what it attempts to do. The news of Apple’s interest in digital glasses comes as Snapchat is experimenting with its own offering in the market. While they’re hard to come by and in the early stages of their lifecycle, the Spectacles have been met with mixed reactions from early reviewers but allow users to easily record and upload first-person video content.

USB Type-C: What You Need to Know Consumer Reports 18 hrs ago © Provided by Consumer Reports Smartphone and computer connectors have come in all shapes and sizes over the years. But now, a new connector called USB Type-C is emerging as the standard that all of your electronics devices may someday use. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 106.48 +0.77 +0.73% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 58.64 +0.52 +0.89% Bank of America Corporation BAC ▼ 19.88 -0.21 -1.02% Cisco Systems Inc CSCO ▲ 31.69 +0.32 +1.02% The USB Type-C got a lot of attention recently after Apple unveiled new MacBook Pro laptops that had ports only for the new connector (along with a 3.5mm port for audio, unlike new iPhones). Many consumers complained, so Apple recently slashed the prices of adapters needed to connect your old devices to the new laptops.  A lot of consumers are still confused about Type-C connectors and how they differ from all the other connectors out there. And, ready or not, USB Type-C devices, cables, and chargers will be all over electronics stores this holiday season. So here's what you need to know about Type-C connectors to avoid gadget confusion: What Is a USB Connector? USB stands for Universal Serial Bus. First introduced more than 20 years ago, USB has become the standard way to connect printers, scanners, storage devices, smartphones, and other gizmos to your computer and AC outlets. If you plug a keyboard into a computer, you're using a USB port. USB connectors come in all shapes and sizes. The largest, Type-A, is the flat rectangular plug that most people are familiar with (and are always plugging in upside down). The smallest is the 5-pin Micro-B.  What Is a Type-C Connector? Type-C simply refers to the shape and size of the connector. It is the newest USB and is much smaller and shorter than the traditional Type-A connector that most people still use. USB Type-C was introduced in 2014, but it really began to take off this year. It is now in Apple laptops, Google’s Pixel C tablet and Pixel phones, HTC and LG smartphones, and a handful of laptops from Dell and HP. Why Could It Beat Out Type-A? The problem with Type-A connectors is that they are too big and cumbersome for many new devices, especially smartphones. Type-C attempts to resolve that. What Are the Benefits of Type-C? Type-C plugs can do the work of any other USB connector, but they are small enough to fit into phones as well as computers. They’re about the same size as Micro-B and just half of the height of Type-A ports. That means electronics makers won't need to use the Micro, Mini, and other types of USB ports anymore. Ultimately, you should be able to pack fewer cables into your travel bag, leaving more room for snacks and cheap paperbacks. Here's another benefit: USB Type-C plugs are reversible—there's no upside down, so they'll work no matter how you plug them in. Do All Type-C Devices Work the Same? No. There's a lot of variety in how fast data can be transferred through a USB Type-C cable and how long it takes to charge your device. Type-C connectors will work with devices that support USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and USB 3.1, which are standards that control the speed at which data is transferred. The higher the number, the better the performance.  With USB 3.0, the maximum rate you can transfer data is 5 gigabits per second. The newest standard, USB 3.1, has a data rate up to twice as high, 10 gbps. Keep in mind that the slowest device controls the speed at which data moves. So if you're plugging your new laptop into a hard drive that follows USB 2.0, the max rate is just 480 megabits per second. Now, the truth is your files won’t move from one device to another quite as fast as the spec would suggest. So it’s best to consider these as relative numbers—USB 3.1 is up to twice as fast as USB 3.0, and up to 20 times as fast as USB 2.0. To add a big wrinkle to this discussion, the USB Type-C ports on new MacBook Pros double as Thunderbolt 3 ports. They support speeds of a whopping 40 gbps, and USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3 cables are interchangeable. You can usually identify USB 3.x devices by the blue plastic tabs inside the ports. What About Charging With Type-C? Like data, the amount of power that can flow through a Type-C connector depends on the device you're charging. The maximum is 100 watts—which is more than enough to charge most laptops. Other USB Type-C chargers may deliver less power, such as 45 or 60 watts. The power can flow in either direction, and data can flow right alongside it. Some USB ports and cables also support "alternate modes" that allow them to transmit data in other forms in addition to USB. That includes video and audio, which is why you can connect a DisplayPort monitor to the MacBook's Type-C port. And USB Type-C ports will soon be able to support a variation on the HDMI signals used to carry hi-def video. It’s called HDMI Alternate Mode (Alt Mode), and new devices that support it should be appearing next year. Are All Type-C Connectors the Same Quality? No. It depends on the manufacturer and whether the connectors comply with technical standards. Earlier this year there was a lot of buzz online about USB Type-C adapters wreaking havoc with people’s electronics. In those cases, the problem was poor product design and manufacturing, including cables that looked like USB Type-C but didn’t actually meet the standards. A Google engineer provided a public service by reviewing lots of different cables, and he’s still a great source of updates on USB Type-C news. Jeff Ravencraft, president and COO of USB-IF, says that sticking to well-known brands is probably a good idea, even if they cost a little more. "If you're buying your USB cable at a convenience store from a jar near the cash register and it costs less than the bottle of Coke you're also buying, you might want to think twice," he says.

"I smell a trade war. That is what I think this market has become all about," the "Mad Money" host said. Stocks initially rallied last week from the prospects of tax cuts and infrastructure and defense spending. On Monday, however, investors finally realized that President-elect Trump could crack down on trading partners who take advantage of the U.S. market without opening theirs, Cramer said. They are starting to see what it could mean if Trump does more than just talk tough about imports and dumping. Apple shares declined more than 2 percent on Monday, revealing the company's vulnerability to a Trump regime. "Trump has stated repeatedly that Apple should make more products here. Apple might be caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place ... I know the Chinese picked the wrong day to single out Apple," Cramer said. Carlo Allegri | Reuters A ship is unloaded in Miami, Florida. Harman International Industries CEO Dinesh Paliwal told Cramer on Monday that he is thrilled that Samsung Electronics is acquiring the company for $8 billion. "Frankly when we see that the integration of these two companies, when we put it together, this is really dynamite because it's so complimentary," Paliwal said. Shares of Harman skyrocketed 25 percent on the news that Samsung is acquiring the company for $112 per share, a nearly 28 percent premium over where it traded on Friday. It signaled a major push for Samsung into auto-related technology. Moving forward, Paliwal added that he plans to double down in cybersecurity. He believes that the threat has now extended into individuals homes, cars and personal devices. Cyberark Software's CEO Udi Mokady echoed the same sentiment to Cramer on Monday, stating that anything connected to the internet can be hacked. Cyberark is the Israeli cybersecurity company that helps companies to protect administrator and privileged accounts. These are the accounts frequently targeted by hackers with the aim of getting the "keys to the kingdom." Mokady commented on the changing landscape of the cybersecurity industry. "I think in the last couple of years we have seen a change. It's called the post-breach proactive security measure," Mokady said. "We are coming in ahead of time to help secure against these advanced attacks, but we are seeing that the modern day customer is thinking 'OK we will be breached, let's make sure it's contained.'" Ashlee Espinal | CNBC Dinesh Paliwal, Harman International CEO Bank stocks have also rebounded since the presidential election. Cramer noted that all of the signals were there for investors to buy the banks, starting when JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon purchased 500,000 shares in the open market for $26.6 million on Feb. 11. With JPMorgan closing at $79 on Monday, those shares are worth nearly $40 million. "Maybe Dimon was lucky. Maybe he's just good. Either way, he's obviously still optimistic about JPMorgan, or else he would have taken up Trump on his offer to be Treasury secretary," Cramer said. After years of outperformance, the stock of CVS Health suffered a 10-point straight decline last week, leading Jim Cramer to wonder if it is a broken company or merely a broken stock. "CVS has gone from a market darling to a total dog, as its once-vaunted pharmacy benefit manager business has become an albatross around its neck and the company loses share to its rivals," Cramer said. Shares of CVS tripled from the summer of 2011 to the summer of 2015, but then fell into free-fall. They closed at $76 on Monday. The business includes both its 7,800 retail pharmacies, and its pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) segments. "Maybe they can turn things around, but for now, CVS remains in the penalty box until we see them take concrete steps to lessen their dependence on what was once the golden goose, now just a turkey headed for a carving," Cramer said. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few caller favorite stocks: American Tower: "There was a piece out today that Sprint might merge with T-Mobile and everybody decided to dump on American Tower. My thinking is when you get this kind of a move, you've got to wait until tomorrow mid-day because there are so many sellers out there." AmSurg Corp: "This group is under pressure. Everything is so in flux in healthcare because of the new President that we just have to be on the sidelines. It's tough, because it looks so inexpensive. But sidelines is where we have to be."

If you are running Windows on your Mac - like I'm doing on my 2015 retina MacBook Pro because macOS is far too unoptimised to run on it - and it's using an Intel graphics chip, be sure to replace Apple's own Boot Camp graphics drivers with Intel's own latest drivers. The reason why you should do this is kind of fascinating. I noticed that while Windows as a whole ran quite fast and snappy - much more so than macOS with its crappy responsiveness, FPS drops, and hangs, even after reinstallations - two applications had responsiveness issues: Chrome and Microsoft Office. With Chrome, I chalked it up to #justchromethings and moved on. With Office though, I was perplexed. The past few versions of Office, including the current one, are fast, snappy, and instant. The days where Office applications were slow and cumbersome are long gone, even on lower-end hardware like the 2015 retina MacBook Pro. However, Office applications were slow, rendering was terrible, and things like dragging and resizing Office windows was literally a slide show - and I wanted to know why. I found out that on Windows, Microsoft Office uses its own rendering pipeline (framework? I'm not really sure what the accurate terminology is here), different from both Win32 and Metro applications. As it turns out, Office does its own check of the video card and driver to determine if hardware acceleration for Office should be disabled or not. By default, hardware acceleration is automatically disabled in Office programs if certain video card and video card driver combinations are detected when you start an Office program. If hardware acceleration is automatically disabled by the program, nothing indicates that this change occurred. Well, except that Office now runs like a total dog, of course. Apparently, the Office team maintains its own list of video card/driver combinations and keeps this list a secret. The list of video card/video driver combinations that trigger this automatic disabling of hardware graphics acceleration is not documented because the list is hard-coded in the Office programs and will be constantly changing as we discover additional video combinations that cause problems in Office programs. When I ran the Intel Driver Update Utility on my retina MacBook Pro to determine if the Apple-provided Intel graphics driver was up-to-date, the tool found a newer driver, but warned me that my OEM (Apple) had modified the already-installed driver, and that I would lose those customisations. I proceeded to download the new driver anyway, only to be hit by a very peculiar dialog upon trying to install the driver Intel told me was newer than what I had installed: the installer warned my I was installing an older driver than what I had installed. So, I decided to download the latest driver (the latest beta) manually, installed it, and this fixed not just Office, but also Chrome - which I find particularly baffling (maybe Chrome maintains a similar list?). The list that the Office team maintains is not of good drivers, but of bad drivers. For Office's hardware acceleration to fail, the driver needs to be on the list. This means that the combination "Apple-modified Intel graphics driver/Iris 6100" was, at some point, added to the list, triggering the disabling of hardware acceleration for Office. The combination "Intel's own graphics driver/Iris 6100" is not on the list. There's a number of possible explanations here, and I'm not really sure which one makes the most sense. Apple cares too little about Boot Camp users to intentionally cripple the Apple-supplied Intel drivers, so that's definitely not the cause. I also don't think the Intel driver magically improved a ton in the span of just a few weeks (there's only a few weeks of difference between the two versions, but I'm not trusting version numbers here) - but maybe it did? I honestly don't know. It's Intel's beta driver that isn't even signed by Microsoft, but somehow, the Office team tested it and removed it from their list? My first instinct was to think that because Apple had modified the driver, it wasn't on Microsoft's list - but since the list is for bad drivers, that makes no sense. The most logical explanation I have right now - suggested by Steven Troughton-Smith - is that Apple changes a few things in the Intel driver to optimise Windows' battery life, which in turn tune down the performance, causing the Office team to add this specific driver/video card combination to the list. I've been keeping an eye on battery life since installing the driver, but haven't noticed much of a difference. I don't think this little tip will be useful for a lot of people, but I really enjoyed trying to figure out what was going on.

Unfortunately for people who came up with this speculation, Apple’s vice president of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller, has revealed that this is not the case. On Monday, Backchannel’s Steven Levy published a story about a conversation he had with Schiller in which the latter revealed that the tech giant did test out touch screens for the Mac devices. “We think of the whole platform. If we were to do Multi-Touch on the screen of the notebook, that wouldn’t be enough — then the desktop wouldn’t work that way,” Schiller said. “Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd.” According to Schiller, creating touch-screen Mac devices would just ruin the user experience of its established computers since optimization for both the touch display and pointer devices would be impossible. “You can’t optimize for both. It’s the lowest common denominator thinking,” Schiller said before confirming that the company’s teams did try creating touch screens for the Mac for a “number of times over the years.” However, by testing the technology, Schiller said that they have understood why it did not make sense for them to come up with MacBooks and Mac computers with touch-screen display.  Related Stories Is The Touch Bar Of New MacBook Pro Worth The Upgrade? The Better One Between MacBook Pro Sans Touch Bar vs. MacBook Air Apple To Replenish Touch Bar Supply For MacBook Pro With The Help Of New Supplier Tackling the issue on whether or not Apple is planning to officially ditch the physical keyboard of its Mac devices, Schiller said that the idea is “not on the horizon right now.” He did not say that this is never going to happen. Instead, he clarified that as of this time, there is no need to do this because Apple is focused more on making a better keyboard and not removing the physical keys of its computers.  Meanwhile, to address the issue on why the Cupertino giant decided to switch to Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports for its new MacBook Pros, Schiller maintained that they are certain about this move because USB-C will soon become the new standard in the tech industry. He said this despite of confirming that they value the feedback of their customers, and many people have since been complaining about the need of purchasing dongles to maximize the use of the Thunderbolt 3 ports. "There are people who want us to innovate faster and when we do there’s people who say, ‘Whoa, whoa, you’re going too fast,'” he said. Despite the controversies that are being thrown at Apple for adding a feature to its new MacBooks that no one asked for and removing ports that consumers have grown accustomed to using, the company’s new premium laptops are expected to perform well in the market. Fortune has learned that the new MacBook Pro has surpassed all of its professional-focused predecessors in terms of the number of preorders the company got from customers since it was announced. Digitimes reported last week that Apple is expected to ship 15 million units of its new MacBook Pros before 2016 ends. Then, the company is expected to ship the same number of units the following year. As of today, the tech giant has satisfied the preorders of the first customers to secure their own MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. However, it isn't clear yet how many units the company delivered for its first round of shipments.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    U.S. stocks came back from an early loss and finished almost unchanged Monday. Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week's election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump's policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. "The market is sniffing out the belief that some of these Trump policies may drive some better economic growth but also may in fact be somewhat inflationary," said PNC Chief Investment Strategist Bill Stone. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple gave up $2.72, or 2.5 percent, to $105.71 while Facebook declined $3.94, or 3.3 percent, to $115.08 and Microsoft slid 90 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $58.12. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $18.53, or 2.4 percent, to $753.22. Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump's spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to 2.25 percent from 2.14 percent late Thursday. Bond trading was closed Friday for the Veterans' Day holiday. The day before the Nov. 8 election, the yield was 1.83 percent. That's a huge move for that benchmark rate. Goldman Sachs rose $5.24 percent, to 2.6 percent, to $209.18 and Bank of America rose $1.06, or 5.6 percent, to $20.08. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.82, or 3.7 percent, to $79.51. Stone said investors are focused on potential corporate and individual tax cuts, a "wave of deregulation" that eliminates some of the rules governing businesses like energy companies and banks, and more protectionism on trade, which could hurt sales for companies that do a lot of business overseas. Investors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. For example, Trump's election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Stone added that corporate dealmaking could increase if Trump's administration takes a looser approach to antitrust regulation. Several companies announced deals or deal offers Monday. South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes electronics for cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.07, or 25.2 percent, to $109.72. German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor's stock rose $5.61, or 18.3 percent, to $36.29. Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.75, or 15 percent, to $13.40 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it's too low. Belden stock added $1.52, or 2.2 percent, to $71.22. The dollar rose against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.51 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0726 from $1.0845. Investors are also selling companies that pay big dividends like utilities and phone companies as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income. Verizon fell 51 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $46.18 and American Electric Power lost $1.27, or 2.1 percent, to $58.72. Oil prices bounced back from a big loss early on. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped just 9 cents to $43.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 32 cents to $44.43 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.28 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.39 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 13 cents, or 5 percent, to $2.75 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $2.60 to $1,221.70 an ounce. Silver lost 49 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $16.89 an ounce. Copper picked up 1 cent to $2.52 a pound. France's CAC 40 rose 0.4 percent and Germany's DAX added 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed 0.3 percent higher. In Japan the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 percent after a strong reading on Japan's economic growth. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.5 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 1.4 percent. © Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

According to Barclays Research analysts, the 5-inch and 5.8-inch bezel-free iPhones with borderless design will allow for the new iPhones to be the same overall size as current 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models, MacRumors.com reported. SEE ALSO: Real Life Images of Huawei Mate 9 Pro Leak Online: Dual-Curved Display Revealed "Larger and bezel-less iPhone 8 design did not sound 100 per cent locked down but we believe the move is to a bezel-less design with screen sizes getting larger and curved edges in the original envelope," the report quoted analysts as saying. Of the two prospect releases, only the 5.8-inch model will use OLED display technology, "which can be sharper, brighter, and more energy efficient than LCD technology". Samsung and LG, joined by Foxconn-owned Sharp by 2018, are said to be Apple's primary OLED suppliers. An analyst from KGI Securities Ming-Chi Kuo had in March said that Apple will launch a 5.8-inch iPhone with a curved OLED display and glass casing next year, the research note mentioned. According to Japanese website Nikkei, the larger-screened iPhone will be a premium model, positioned alongside 4.7-inch and 5-inch iPhones with LCD displays. SEE ALSO: Vivo V5 and V5 Max to Sport a 20MP Front-Facing Camera: 5 Things You Should Know There are reports that a bezel-free design by Apple will be achieved by removing the iconic Home button on the next iPhone. Barclays expects that the screen will extend vertically as well as horizontally.

Written by Monica Savaglia Posted November 14, 2016 It’s true... it happened. Last week, Donald J. Trump was elected America's 45th President. On Tuesday night and very early into Wednesday morning, you saw all of media scratching their heads. They were completely baffled by how close this race was turning out to be. How could this happen? Their polls told them something totally different... Clinton was in favor, and she was on her way to be America's first woman president.  The only logical conclusion the media could come up with was that the American people were seeking revenge on Washington. Their voices weren’t being heard and haven’t been heard in a really long time... And Donald Trump heard them — he would be their beacon of hope. He’s the only president-elect in U.S. history that will be taking over the Oval Office with no political or military experience. His claim to fame has been more or less being a businessman, a TV celebrity, and a man who “tells it like it is.” As a businessman, he’s been openly critical of several big technology companies such as Apple (NASDAQ: APPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). And as a presidential candidate, he’s in favor of policies that will make it difficult for developmental growth within the industry.  He's proposed policies like taxing companies that manufacture products overseas. He believes tech companies need to stop working overseas and depriving Americans of potential jobs. But what he doesn't realize is his direct criticism towards specific tech companies and his vague policies will have a huge influence on technology's growth, along with current and potential American jobs... Which would contradict one of his most stressed promises to his voters: to bring back jobs. Trump's Tech Vendetta Could Affect U.S. Jobs Earlier this year at an event in Pawleys Island, South Carolina, Trump said: What I think you ought to do is boycott Apple until such time as they give that security number. He was calling for a consumer boycott of Apple when Apple refused to help the FBI gain access to the phone of one of the shooters in the San Bernardino, California, terrorist attack. Trump went even further, saying:  First of all, the phone isn’t even owned by this young thug that killed all of these people... Tim Cook (Apple’s CEO) is looking to do a big number, probably to show how liberal he is. Well, if Trump is concerned about jobs in the U.S., he should look at these numbers... According to Apple, in the U.S: Apple directly employs 66,000 people. It has 627,000 jobs that support its iOS ecosystem. In its 265 retail stores, Apple employs about 30,000 people. There are 20,000 construction-related jobs that are needed to build Apple’s retail stores. The company has added 52,000 jobs in the past 10 years prior to 2015. That’s a lot of U.S. jobs being put into jeopardy because Trump isn't particularly fond of certain CEOs or the way these companies conduct business. Another instance was during an interview with Fox News earlier this year. While being interviewed, Trump said: Every hour we’re getting calls from reporters from The Washington Post asking ridiculous questions and I will tell you, this owned as a toy by Jeff Bezos, who controls Amazon. Amazon is getting away with murder taxwise. And he went even further by saying: Amazon is controlling so much of what they’re doing, and what they’ve done is he bought this paper for practically nothing and he’s using that as a tool for political power against me and against people and I’ll tell you what, we can’t let him get away with it. Amazon reported in December 2015 that it has more than 90,000 full-time employees working in its fulfillment and sorting facilities throughout the country. Again, that’s a lot of jobs being put in jeopardy because of what seems like a personal vendetta against the Washington Post and Jeff Bezos. Trump wants to bring back and add more industrial jobs to the workforce, which is all well and good. But his exclusion of another thriving job force won’t be beneficial to the U.S. economy or population, especially to the Americans who have or are currently getting an education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. STEM fields have been at the forefront of innovation while providing jobs to many individuals, especially U.S. citizens. The Department for Professional Employees reported that in 2015, there were 4,360,000 people employed in computer and mathematical occupations, while there were 2,954,000 people employed in architecture and engineering occupations. These professions are the driving force behind advancing technology and enhancing our way of life, and if we want to remain a relevant global leader, we'll need to continue growing in this industry, instead of ignoring it and considering it a “problem” that needs to be fixed by policies that will ultimately hinder global growth. Trump’s policies are kind of up in the air right now, and it’s hard to predict how or if any of them will actually come into fruition. But if they do, technology and the economy could definitely see some changes.

This comes a week after the second build of the future OS upgrade for the Apple TV became available. In tvOS 10.1, Apple finally brings to life Single Sign-On which allows users to sign into their cable provider once and automatically log into all apps that require the credentials. This makes the process of setting up various apps like CBS and NBC much simpler. In addition, we’re also expecting the recently announced TV app to make its was to the public via this software, however the app doesn’t appear to be currently live in this beta. On the other hand, iOS 10.2 beta testers do have access to the app. Finally, additional bug fixes and security improvements are also present in tvOS 10.1 beta 3. If we haven’t mentioned something here you think is worth noting, please email us at mbedded@icloud.com.

For the ECB, the issue is what to do about its bond-buying program, which pumps new money into Europe's struggling economy each month to try to accelerate growth and inflation. The Fed and the ECB — two of the world's most important central banks — will be making its policy decisions before Trump is inaugurated Jan. 20, while still weighing what he might do as president. ___ Trump set to roll back Obama policies on energy, environment WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump is considering an oil billionaire and a North Dakota lawmaker for top posts as he moves to roll back President Barack Obama's environmental and energy policies and allow unfettered production of oil, coal and natural gas. Trump pledges to sharply increase oil and gas drilling on federal lands while opening up offshore drilling in the Atlantic Ocean and other areas where it is blocked. Topping Trump's to-do list is repealing the Clean Power Plan, Obama's signature effort to limit carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. ___ Siemens to buy Oregon-based Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — German industrial equipment maker Siemens AG says it has agreed to buy U.S.-based software firm Mentor Graphics Corp. for $4.5 billion, broadening Siemens digital capabilities. Siemens said it would pay $37.25 a share in cash, or 21 percent more than Mentor's closing price on Friday. Mentor, based in Wilsonville, Oregon, specializes in software used to design computer chips, technology with broad potential applications to smart and connected devices such as autonomous vehicles. It has customers in industries ranging from aerospace to consumer electronics and 5,700 employees in 32 countries. ___ American Apparel files for bankruptcy protection, again WASHINGTON (AP) — American Apparel is seeking bankruptcy protection for the second time in just over a year, unable to find its footing in a shifting retail landscape and after a fight for control with its founder Dov Charney. Canada's Gildan Activewear is buying the American Apparel brand for $66 million. The retailer first filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2015, about a year after it fired Charney for violating its sexual harassment policy. Charney's lengthy legal campaign to retake control of the company was rejected by a bankruptcy court judge in January. ___ US stocks finish level as tech losses cancel out bank gains NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks came back from an early loss and finished almost unchanged Monday. Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week's election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump's policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. ___ Vroom: Gov't to require hybrid, electric cars to make noise WASHINGTON (AP) — New hybrid and electric cars are required to make noise when traveling at low speeds so that pedestrians, especially those who are blind or have poor eyesight, will hear them coming, under a new rule released Monday by the Obama administration. The new rule could help prevent about 2,400 pedestrian injuries a year, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The rule requires hybrid and electric vehicles to make audible noise when traveling in reverse or forward at speeds up to about 19 mph. The sound alert isn't required at higher speeds because other factors, such as tire and wind noise, provide warning. ___ Samsung's $8B ticket into the red-hot automotive tech race SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Samsung Electronics' $8 billion acquisition of the U.S. auto electronics company Harman will instantly transform the tech company into a major player in the highly competitive market for auto infotainment, software and connected car technology. Samsung announced Monday that it would pay $112 per share in cash for the company, its largest acquisition by far. Harman International Industries Inc. makes touch screens that control vehicle functions and infotainment systems, and it's dominant in automotive sound systems with brands such as Harman Kardon, JBL, Infinity and Mark Levinson. ___ Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay to offer rewards NEW YORK (AP) — Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. Apple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now. The American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. ___ Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway invests in major airlines NEW YORK (AP) — Warren Buffett is changing his mind about airlines and buying stakes in several major carriers including American Air Lines and Delta Air Lines. The billionaire investor has famously avoided the sector in the past, although his Berkshire Hathaway does own NetJets, which sells partial ownership interests in business jets. Buffett disclosed the new investments, which also include United Continental Holdings, Monday in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ___ SEC Chair White leaving at end of Obama administration WASHINGTON (AP) — The Securities and Exchange Commission says the agency's head, Mary Jo White, will leave office at the end of the Obama administration. White, a former federal prosecutor and private securities lawyer, was appointed by President Barack Obama in February 2013. Her term doesn't end until 2019. President-elect Donald Trump is due to take office Jan. 20 and likely will name his own choice to head the market watchdog agency in the near future. ___ PetSmart fined for not reporting injury-causing fish bowls NEW YORK (AP) — PetSmart will pay a $4.25 million civil fine for not quickly reporting defective fish bowls that caused serious injuries at least a dozen times. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday that injuries included deep cuts requiring stitches and severed tendons that required surgery after bowls cracked or shattered. The pet products retailer sold the bowls under the "Grreat Choice" and "Top Fin" brands from March 2010 through September 2013. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,868.69. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 0.25 points to 2,164.20. The Nasdaq composite slid 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped 9 cents to $43.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 32 cents to $44.43 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.28 a gallon.

President Young Sohn said when talking about the South Korean company’s $8 billion deal to buy Harman International Industries Inc. is that the electronics giant has no intention of building a car. The emphasis was intentional. Samsung’s target customers are carmakers who’d love to give their vehicles smartphone-like capabilities but are leery of surrendering unfettered access to their dashboards. They’ve largely kept a distance from Google, which could mine driver data for its own uses, or Apple Inc., which until recently had designs on building its own car. Samsung wants to marry its consumer electronics expertise and the fast 5G cellular network it’s developing with Harman’s presence in dashboards all over the world. If it works, they can offer carmakers a lightning-quick connected system for infotainment, mapping, concierge services and autonomous driving -- and all without the worry that the automakers would be helping a future competitor. “This is not about building a car,” Young said in an interview. Several automakers “came to us and asked us to help with technologies like 5G, or artificial intelligence or memory. We can harness technologies to provide a better experience to automakers.” Samsung offered $112 a share in cash for Harman, which was 28 percent above the Stamford, Connecticut-based company’s closing price of $87.65 in New York on Friday. The stock closed up 22 percent to $109.72, the biggest gain since its 1986 initial public offering. Samsung’s own shares rose on the deal, which was announced after the market closed Monday. The stock climbed as much as 1.8 percent as of 9:45 a.m. in Seoul. The acquisition reverberated through the car business, with Wells Fargo analyst David Lim saying in a research note that the deal could “ignite additional mergers and acquisitions of higher technology auto suppliers.” The shares of automotive electronics maker Visteon Corp. jumped 9.6 percent -- the most since August 2012 -- and larger rival Delphi Automotive Plc gained 2.2 percent. Deals like Samsung’s for Harman could be welcome by automakers, who want to control the revenue from connected car services and the customer data it generates as much as possible, said Jim Hines, a research director at Gartner. ‘Competitive Dynamic’ “There is definitely a competitive dynamic that has emerged between the established automotive industry and these large tech companies that are looking to get a piece of that market opportunity,” Hines said. As automakers have rolled out connected services in their cars, they have been very careful in how they work with Google and Apple. General Motors Co. allows its customers to connect their smartphones into the dashboard through Apple’s Car Play and Google’s Android Auto -- but only with selected apps, and the phones cannot access a car’s data. Toyota Motor Corp. doesn’t allow its cars to connect to either system. The fear among carmakers is that Apple and Google could either mine the data inside the car, tracking everything from driving patterns to engine performance, to either become a new face to the consumer or to help them build cars. The fact that Harman is already a supplier and that Samsung doesn’t have a system that competes with the in-car connected services sold by carmakers could make them a more attractive partner, Hines said. Partner or Threat? “They might be viewed as less of a threat in terms of tech partner for some of these leading automotive brands," Hines said. Samsung wants to become a high-tech supplier capable of building connected systems. Its expertise is making the hardware, like microprocessing units, and a faster 5G network to deliver more data to cars faster. Harman sells -- among other technologies -- 3D navigation, apps for integrating other devices into the car, active safety systems and audio systems that can access the cloud. There are a lot of opportunities once the companies combine, Harman Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dinesh Paliwal said in a phone interview. Imagine a car that that can read a driver’s daily schedule and automatically dial into a conference call, Paliwal said. Autonomous driving will only give drivers access to more connected capabilities for work or entertainment, he said. "We’ll be in the best possible position because we have all the capabilities," Paliwal said. Overcoming Weaknesses Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Assuming the merger goes through, Samsung will need to develop other capabilities, especially in software, said Cyrus Mewawalla, lead analyst at CM Research. Like Google and Apple, Samsung wants to own and provide the servers, the hardware that’s doing all the computing and the memory storage for connected cars. They also want to own the platform that runs the apps, in the way that Apple’s iOS and Android do now. While they have expertise in some things like microprocessors, they don’t have all of those capabilities, Mewawalla said. “They’d need more than just this acquisition,” he said. “The two key weaknesses Samsung has is the software ecosystem and cloud infrastructure, and that’s where it needs to be acquiring." Artificial intelligence, in which Samsung has recently made a deal, should be a particular area of focus in the near future, he added. If it chooses, the company could also have the resources to develop such capabilities on its own once Harman’s 8,000 software engineers and join Samsung, which spends $13 billion a year on research and development and $23 billion in capital expenditures. “Imagine the scale of our R&D," Paliwal said.

For the ECB, the issue is what to do about its bond-buying program, which pumps new money into Europe’s struggling economy each month to try to accelerate growth and inflation.

The Fed and the ECB — two of the world’s most important central banks — will be making its policy decisions before Trump is inaugurated Jan. 20, while still weighing what he might do as president. ___ Trump set to roll back Obama policies on energy, environment WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump is considering an oil billionaire and a North Dakota lawmaker for top posts as he moves to roll back President Barack Obama’s environmental and energy policies and allow unfettered production of oil, coal and natural gas. Trump pledges to sharply increase oil and gas drilling on federal lands while opening up offshore drilling in the Atlantic Ocean and other areas where it is blocked. Topping Trump’s to-do list is repealing the Clean Power Plan, Obama’s signature effort to limit carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. ___ Siemens to buy Oregon-based Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — German industrial equipment maker Siemens AG says it has agreed to buy U.S.-based software firm Mentor Graphics Corp. for $4.5 billion, broadening Siemens digital capabilities. Siemens said it would pay $37.25 a share in cash, or 21 percent more than Mentor’s closing price on Friday. Mentor, based in Wilsonville, Oregon, specializes in software used to design computer chips, technology with broad potential applications to smart and connected devices such as autonomous vehicles. It has customers in industries ranging from aerospace to consumer electronics and 5,700 employees in 32 countries. ___ American Apparel files for bankruptcy protection, again WASHINGTON (AP) — American Apparel is seeking bankruptcy protection for the second time in just over a year, unable to find its footing in a shifting retail landscape and after a fight for control with its founder Dov Charney. Canada’s Gildan Activewear is buying the American Apparel brand for $66 million. The retailer first filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2015, about a year after it fired Charney for violating its sexual harassment policy. Charney’s lengthy legal campaign to retake control of the company was rejected by a bankruptcy court judge in January. ___ US stocks finish level as tech losses cancel out bank gains NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks came back from an early loss and finished almost unchanged Monday. Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week’s election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump’s policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. ___ Vroom: Gov’t to require hybrid, electric cars to make noise WASHINGTON (AP) — New hybrid and electric cars are required to make noise when traveling at low speeds so that pedestrians, especially those who are blind or have poor eyesight, will hear them coming, under a new rule released Monday by the Obama administration. The new rule could help prevent about 2,400 pedestrian injuries a year, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The rule requires hybrid and electric vehicles to make audible noise when traveling in reverse or forward at speeds up to about 19 mph. The sound alert isn’t required at higher speeds because other factors, such as tire and wind noise, provide warning. ___ Samsung’s $8B ticket into the red-hot automotive tech race SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Samsung Electronics’ $8 billion acquisition of the U.S. auto electronics company Harman will instantly transform the tech company into a major player in the highly competitive market for auto infotainment, software and connected car technology. Samsung announced Monday that it would pay $112 per share in cash for the company, its largest acquisition by far. Harman International Industries Inc. makes touch screens that control vehicle functions and infotainment systems, and it’s dominant in automotive sound systems with brands such as Harman Kardon, JBL, Infinity and Mark Levinson. ___ Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay to offer rewards NEW YORK (AP) — Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. Apple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now. The American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. ___ Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway invests in major airlines NEW YORK (AP) — Warren Buffett is changing his mind about airlines and buying stakes in several major carriers including American Air Lines and Delta Air Lines. The billionaire investor has famously avoided the sector in the past, although his Berkshire Hathaway does own NetJets, which sells partial ownership interests in business jets. Buffett disclosed the new investments, which also include United Continental Holdings, Monday in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ___ SEC Chair White leaving at end of Obama administration WASHINGTON (AP) — The Securities and Exchange Commission says the agency’s head, Mary Jo White, will leave office at the end of the Obama administration. White, a former federal prosecutor and private securities lawyer, was appointed by President Barack Obama in February 2013. Her term doesn’t end until 2019. President-elect Donald Trump is due to take office Jan. 20 and likely will name his own choice to head the market watchdog agency in the near future. ___ PetSmart fined for not reporting injury-causing fish bowls NEW YORK (AP) — PetSmart will pay a $4.25 million civil fine for not quickly reporting defective fish bowls that caused serious injuries at least a dozen times. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday that injuries included deep cuts requiring stitches and severed tendons that required surgery after bowls cracked or shattered. The pet products retailer sold the bowls under the “Grreat Choice” and “Top Fin” brands from March 2010 through September 2013. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,868.69. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 0.25 points to 2,164.20. The Nasdaq composite slid 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped 9 cents to $43.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 32 cents to $44.43 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.28 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.39 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 13 cents, or 5 percent, to $2.75 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Beyond the reviews, Phil Schiller or Phil the Philosopher is back on his stump preaching the Gospel of Apple about how touch displays are a temptation of the devil. It reminds me of the line in the movie Poltergeist, just don't look into the light! I've always liked Phil Schiller and was glad that Steve Jobs kept him on board as he cleaned house back in 1997. But at times I'd prefer if Phil just focused on what Apple does best without having to preach to me that what I may like is wrong. Apple sometimes reminds me of Hillary Clinton and the Democrats saying that if I'm not for open borders and allowing all illegals to flood into the country and stay, then I must be a racist xenophobe or at best a deplorable. It's what turned off many independents. She should have stayed on message of why to vote for her rather then telling me that I represented the dark side if I happened to disagree with her point of view. Sometimes Apple gets a little too preachy. Many Apple pros are still seething that the new MacBook Pro limits ports and forces them to use dongles. And Apple just decided they no longer wanted to support an SD Slot. Apple's apostles tell us that an SD slot is a tool of the devil and if we wanted it, then we'd surely turn into pillars of salt. So repent and go there no more.   A Few Quick Review Flashes on the Touch Bar   In Mossberg's review he notes that "I have reservations, and you should too. Many pro users are already vocally complaining about issues particular to them. But, even for mainstream Mac users, there are questions about price, ports, the Touch Bar feature, the keyboard and — surprisingly, for a Mac — battery life. Mossberg really slams Apple on battery life. On the Touch Bar, Mossberg notes that "I don't think the Touch Bar is a gimmick, but I don't think it changes much, at least yet, for everyday Mac users. The Touch Bar has potential, but it's not magic." Mossberg finally says that "if you're a Mac devotee ready to move past the Air — not back to a lower-powered MacBook — this is what Apple is offering. Take it or leave it." It's certainly a mixed review that you could fully check out here.   The Wall Street Journal's review by Joanna Stern starts off in your face: "We've been conditioned: Every new Apple Product is the best Apple Product ever… until, of course, the next best Apple Product ever. The exception? The new MacBook Pro laptops.   Even if you have enough spare cash to buy a Tesla for your kitten, it isn't abundantly clear that you should choose one of the new $1,500-and-up models over their predecessors. The new models even defy our expectations on power and pricing. Not only are they missing the newest Intel chipset, they don't even fit in the standard Apple-nomics model where hot new products slot in at last year's pricing.   On the Touch Bar Stern noted that "I can accomplish many shortcuts faster with the keyboard or trackpad. (Example: Cmd-B bolds words quicker than I can lift a finger to hit the Touch Bar's little "B.") Plus, you always have to look up since the controls keep changing and your sense of touch doesn't help at all."   The Bottom Line for Stern is one not to offend. Stern notes "So how do you decide? Do you invest in the present—the "old" MacBook Pro with performance, good-enough portability, a keyboard to cherish and lots of ports? Or do you invest in the future—a beautiful, highly portable machine with new tricks? Or maybe you do what I'm doing: Stare down at your three-year-old laptop and wonder if you can tough it out another year or two while this sorts itself out." Click here For more on the WSJ review.   Engadget's review by Dana Wollman was brutally honest. Dana notes that "I'm one of many Mac owners out there who has been waiting for Apple to upgrade the MacBook Pro line. Now that it finally has, I find the new laptop isn't quite what I wanted.   For me, this is both a step forward and a step backward. I'm sure Apple disagrees, and not just because its job is to sell lots of computers. Apple seems to earnestly believe it knows how people should be getting work done -- so much so that it has the chutzpah to ask loyal customers to unlearn old habits. Get used to using dongles to attach your existing accessories. Say goodbye to your memory card slot, creatives. Resign yourself to adjusting the brightness or volume with taps and swipes, instead of a simple button press. Accept the risk that your existing Thunderbolt 3 peripherals might not work.   On the Touch Bar, Wollman notes that "What's annoying about this whole setup is that either way, some of the most important system controls are now buried in Touch Bar menus. Want to lower the volume? You can either hit the volume icon and hit the slider, or hit the arrow key and tap the volume up or down key. That's less efficient than just pressing a dedicated volume button in the function row. It's inconvenient enough that I eventually started using my mouse to do things like pause Spotify or raise the volume on a track. Apple made me change my way of doing things, and not necessarily for the better. That pisses me off."   Although Wollman complains, she knows that die-hard Apple will flock to it and it gives it a decent 8 out of 10 score.   On the Touch Bar, the review by The Verge was mixed. "I've been using the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar for more than a week now, and I have mixed feelings about what it brings to the MacBook experience. In some cases, the Touch Bar's usefulness is obvious and immediate. But in many others, it's overly complicated or just plain unnecessary. It's an addition that very much can improve every MacBook — but it's going to take some time to get there, if it ever does."   Phil the Philosopher   Back in 2012 Samsung's Phablet had been out for about a year and Apple's VP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller wanted to downplay what many consumers were running to, the Phablet. So Schiller put on his preacher's robe and went into Phil the Philosopher mode. Patently Apple's report at the time noted that "In Describing the new iPhone, Phil Schiller stated that "It is really easy to make a new product that's bigger. Everyone does that. The challenge is to make it better and smaller."   Schiller went on to make an obvious point that Samsung forgot: "What is the design center for a Phone? It's this: it's your hand. A phone should feel great in your hand and more importantly it should be easy to use with a magical device we all carry called the horizontally opposed thumb. It does most of the hard work for us. So when you carry your phone it should feel beautiful in your hand."   As one who liked the phablet idea right out of the gate, I found it funny to listen to Phil having to defend Apple's position. More more importantly, Phil basically tried to convey the message that we just didn't get it, and if we happened to like a phablet, then surely we had lost our way.   According to Phil, my thumb had to be satisfied and that could only happen on a tiny iPhone display. Keep in mind that this isn't me conveniently looking back with 20/20 hindsight. I reported on this back in 2013 after Apple had missed delivering a phablet for a second year in a row in a report titled "Apple Passing on a larger iPhone Display still a Head Scratcher."   Well, Apple is back at it again and Phil the Philosopher is there to just lay down the law and to set us all straight. When it came to dropping ports and the SD slot that Pro users loved, Phil was there to slap them on that back and make it very clear that Apple cares "about what they love and what they are worried about. And it's our job to help people through these changes." Yes, true, at a cost and inconvenience of having multiple dongs on our desks like our cover graphic illustrates. That's helping us through the changes? Ka-ching for Apple.   It's not what Apple fans or pros wanted from a new MacBook Pro, but hey, Phil will help us through these changes because we're all just morons who just don't get it. We just don't see the light of genius in changing every port so that they look alike and are more importantly, nice and neat in a row! You know, it's just so condescending and yet I'm sure it's done with a smile. Thanks Phil.   Of course the biggest in our face position that Apple won't budge on is giving us a MacBook or iMac with a touch display. That argument should be dead by now but the tech community of writers never let it go. It's obvious that these writers and Apple fans would still like to see that come to be. But Apple continues to say that god handed them down the law on stone tablets like Moses. Phil, it's doable because Windows 10 proved it's doable so it just comes down to ideology and not because it's absurd as you claim it to be.    You know, it reminds me of people who have to eat each thing on their plate in a particular order never mixing a damn thing. Their brain isn't wired to enjoy peas and potatoes together in one scoop. It just isn't the order of things in their universe.   In a new report today Phil told Backchannel that "We think of the whole platform. If we were to do Multi-Touch on the screen of the notebook, that wouldn't be enough — then the desktop wouldn't work that way." And touch on the desktop, he says, would be a disaster. Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd."   How many times have I been at my kitchen table in the evening and just leaned over to touch the Safari or iTunes icon on my iMac like I do on my iPad to launch an app, just to laugh at what I was doing because my iMac was of course just too stupid to do that. What was I thinking, that we could have it both ways like on Windows devices?   Yet at the end of the day, most Apple fans will appreciate Apple's MacBook Pro with its new Touch Bar. On the other hand, many reviewers and fans couldn't care less about the Touch Bar, and some like me would still prefer a hybrid notebook-tablet like the invention that Apple's engineers came up with; their intelligent engineers that had their idea stolen from them by Microsoft's Surface Book. But when I get a Surface Book someday in the future, I'll always think of those Apple engineers and say thanks guys, too bad Apple didn't listen to you because it was a great idea.     Roundup of More In-Depth MacBook Pro Reviews   Philosophy aside, if you're trying to decide on whether to pass or buy that shiny new MacBook Pro for Christmas and need a nudge either way, below are a few more interesting and more in-depth reviews that might help you decide:   Ars Technica: Touch Bar MacBook Pros give an expensive glimpse at the Mac's future USA Today: MacBook Pro review: Touch Bar comes at high cost AppleInsider: Review: Apple's late-2016 15" MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Gizmodo: The MacBook Pro's Touch Bar Is a Gimmick That's Not Worth the Money (Yet) Mashable: Apple's MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is worth the wait Macworld: MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: The best bits of iOS in a really great Mac --- They love the new Touch Bar as noted below in their overview video.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Per the company's most recent earnings report, Apple now has more than $237 billion in cash and other securities, anchored of course by the company's insanely lucrative iPhone. Though the iPhone only has a thin slice of smartphone marketshare, Apple's iconic smartphone accounted for an astonishing 104% (yes, you read that correctly) of the profits across the smartphone industry last quarter. DON'T MISS: Watch Dave Chappelle’s hilarious SNL opening monologue tackle all things Trump With so much money in the bank, it's only reasonable to ask what the company plans to do with all of growing cash pile. The situation is a bit tricky because the vast majority of Apple's cash (more than $200 billion) resides in overseas accounts. The following chart, compiled by Statista this past August, provides an instructive illustration of Apple's current cash position. View photos apple-cashMore As a result, if Apple were to bring that cash back stateside, it would be subject to the United States' uniquely high 35% corporate income tax rate. Apple, therefore, has opted to let its cash sit overseas rather than take a huge tax hit and bring it back. Apple's strategy in this regard, we should point out, is hardly unique. On the contrary, many large companies -- from Google to Pfizer -- hold billions of dollars in offshore accounts because they too want to avoid a large tax hit. With Donald Trump poised to assume the Presidency this coming January, Apple may be able to repatriate some of its overseas holdings sooner rather than later. Per Donald Trump's tax plan, companies like Apple would be afforded the opportunity to repatriate foreign holdings at a significant tax discount. As detailed on Trump's website, Trump's tax plan for businesses "will provide a deemed repatriation of corporate profits held offshore at a one-time tax rate of 10 percent." The language here might also suggest that company's with vast cash holdings overseas will be taxed at 10% regardless of whether or not the cash is repatriated. That said, we'll have to wait and see what Trump's tax plan actually looks like once he assumes the Presidency. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWWB5uhvoYs The savings Apple would enjoy with Trump's tax plan would be immense, to say the least. In a hypothetical scenario where Apple opts to repatriate, say, $50 billion, Apple under Trump's plan would save more than $12 billion. Apple and other large multinational companies have been lobbying for a one-time tax holiday for years now. As a quick example, Tim Cook back in 2013 had this to say on the topic during an interview with the Washington Post. "If you look at it today, to repatriate cash to the US, you need to pay 35 percent of that cash," Cook said. "And that is a very high number. We are not proposing that it be zero. I know many of our peers believe that. But I don't view that. But I think it has to be reasonable." The last time we saw the powers-that-be approve a one-time tax holiday was back in 2004 when companies were allowed to repatriate their offshore holdings with a generous 5.25% tax rate. Strictly speaking, Trump isn't exactly offering a tax holiday if the 10% tax rate is enforced across the board, but the posited rate is low enough such that many companies like Apple would likely bring back their cash happily.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple has always been cagey about the possibility of a touchscreen Mac, and new comments suggest a Surface Pro-like device from the Cupertino company is unlikely to happen. Speaking to Backchannel, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller called a full touchscreen desktop experience “absurd.” “We think of the whole platform,” Schiller said. “If we were to do multi-touch on the screen of a notebook, that wouldn’t be enough—then the desktop wouldn’t work that way. Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try and do things? That becomes absurd.” With a portfolio that includes the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and Surface Studio, Microsoft certainly begs to differ. It’s becoming increasingly clear the companies have two very different visions for what the desktop experience should be. That means Apple will stick to the very old school way of the keyboard and mouse. According to Schiller, making macOS touch-friendly would “ruin the experience for those using pointer devices.” “You can’t optimize for both,” Schiller said. “It’s the lowest common denominator.” Apple previously tested full touchscreen Macs Apple could always change its mind but it sounds as though the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is the closest thing Apple fans will get to a Surface Pro. You either buy the company’s latest MacBook Pro or you buy an iPad Pro; don’t expect Apple to combine the two. Schiller told Backchannel that Apple engineers have tested full touchscreen Macs in the past but concluded, “It isn’t the right thing to do.” Schiller said, “Our instincts were correct.” It’s unclear which company’s approach will win out in the long run. However, recent data suggests Apple’s new MacBook Pro is already selling like hot cakes, so perhaps Schiller’s instincts were right after all.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple The Latest iPhone 8 Rumor Will Probably Make You Mad Mark Spoonauer Editor in Chief Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide)November 14, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share The iPhone 8 should be a stunner of a phone, with a curved, bezel-free design, but you'll probably have to pay more than you want to get the best screen. While both the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to sport all-glass bodies, Touch ID built into the display, wireless charging and new multi-sensor cameras, Apple could be saving the one feature everyone's been waiting for for the larger plus. Credit: Sam RutherfordMore Credit: Sam Rutherford A report from Mac Rumors, citing four Barclays Research analysts with sources in Apple's supply chain, says that the borderless design of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus will allow Apple to offer larger 5-inch and 5.8-inch screens while keeping the same overall size of the current 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models. MORE: Best Camera Phone - Top-Rated Smartphone Cameras That's potentially good news, as you'd get larger panels within the same size chassis as before. A 5.8-inch iPhone would be particularly huge, as it would dwarf most phablets on the market, although there are some 5.9-inchers like the Huawei Mate 9. The gotcha is that these same analysts say that Apple is reserving an OLED display for the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 Plus. The smaller iPhone 8 (and there could be two of them in different sizes) will reportedly use a traditional LCD. As anyone who has seen or used one of Samsung's Galaxy phones in the last several years, you probably already know the advantages of OLED. But just in case you don't, this type of display offers richer colors, deeper blacks and wider viewing angles. Plus, OLED tends to be more energy efficient. This move wouldn't be shocking given the advantages the current iPhone 7 Plus has over the iPhone 7. Only the larger phone has a dual-lens camera, which enables optical zoom and a new portrait mode, and it offers a higher-resolution screen and longer battery life. MORE: 7 Reasons iPhone 7 Plus Beats iPhone 7 Reserving OLED for the iPhone 8 Plus would truly make it pop. The current price difference between the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is about $120, and it could be easier to justify should only the 8 Plus boast an OLED screen. But not everyone wants to carry around a supersized phone, so it would be a real bummer if you couldn't get the best display tech in a one-hand-friendly design. Samsung offers Super AMOLED screens on the smaller 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 and larger 5.5-inch S7 Edge, but Apple doesn't have to follow anyone's lead.

The firm is set to unveil the most radical redesign of its flagship handset so far for the iPhone's 10th anniversary in 2017. The latest rumours claim it will have a radical edge to edge curved screen - and a screen size boost. Scroll down for video  Apple firm is expected to unveil the most radical redesign ever of its flagship handset for the iPhone's 10th anniversary in 2017. Pictured are two concept drawings Barclays Research analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O'Malley, and Jerry Zhang says the screens will allow the handsets to maintian the same overall size as the current 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models The analysts, citing sources 'within Apple's supply chain' said 'iPhone 8 design didn't sound 100% locked down but we believe the move is to a bezel-less design with screen sizes getting larger and curved edges in the original envelope.  'The iPhone 8 moves to 5' (from 4.7') and the Plus moves to 5.8' (from 5.5').'

Share this article Share 22 shares In the research note obtained by MacRumors, the analysts said only the 5.8-inch model will use OLED display technology, which can be sharper, brighter, and more energy efficient than LCD technology.   It comes days after experts predicted the iPhone 8 will also have wireless charging. Foxconn Technology Group in New Taipei City, Taiwan is making wireless charging modules to go with Apple's next iPhone, due for release in 2017, according to an industry source familiar with the matter, Nikkei has reported. 'But whether the feature can eventually make it into Apple's updated devices will depend on whether Foxconn can boost the yield rate to a satisfactory level later on,' the source told Nikkei.  It is not clear whether Apple would offer a wireless charging plate, along the same lines as the one made by Samsung for its Galaxy S smartphones. But a patent application, filed by Apple with the US Patent and Trademark Office in September showed images of a round charging device with a concave top, similar to the plastic wireless charger used by the Apple Watch.  The patent was first filed in late 2015 but was only just published last month.  While the patent is largely focused on brushing and polishing tools for metallic cylindrical and contoured devices, it also refers to an 'inductive charging station', notes Patently Apple. A patent application, filed by Apple with the US Patent and Trademark Office in September showed images of a round charging device with a concave top, similar to the plastic wireless charger used by the Apple Watch (pictured) It appears that the polishing tools are being developed specifically for a wireless charging station with a metal finish, which would match the iPhone. 'In describing how the tools would work, the application includes multiple illustrations of a charging station used to provide electrical current to another device via inductive power transmission,' notes Mac Rumours. END OF THE HOME BUTTON?  A patent granted to Apple recently revealed technology that places the home button underneath the display. The innovation uses an electrostatic lens that connects the connect the screen and sensors, allowing the device to accurately read fingerprints on the screen. Depending on the position of these lenses, relative voltage and shape, the layer or layers are able to shape or bend the electric field associate with the user's finger, reports AppleInsider. These specially designed lenses would also reduce the spreading of the electric field of a user's finger when placed on the screen, as this type of bending can sometimes offset a fingerprint's natural dispersion. 'An inductive transmitter coil wraps around a metal core and is designed to pair with a receiver coil and charge the battery in the electronic device'.  Previous rumours have suggested new MacBook computers could include a wireless charging module on which the device can be placed to power it up. Last week it was revealed Apple is set to launch three versions of the iPhone 8 next year, including a new 5inch handset. Citing a supply chain source, Nikkei said Apple will release the three iPhones in the following  5.5 inches, 5 inches, and 4.7 inches (14cm, 12.7cm and 11.9cm). Apple recently killed the headphone jack and its next victim could be the home button, according to previous rumours. A patent awarded last month describes technology that is capable of scanning fingerprints almost anywhere on the screen of an iOS device - making the home button obsolete. The latest application suggests using a special lens behind the display that connects the screen and sensors, allowing the device to capture an accurate print reading. Rumours of Apple doing away with the iconic home button are not groundbreaking - many believed the firm would leave it out of the iPhone 7 design. Apple killed the headphone jack and its next victim could be the home button. A recent patent describes a special lens behind the screen that scans fingerprints anywhere on the surface These specially designed lens (pictured) would also reduce the spreading of the electric field of a user's finger when placed on the screen, as this type of bending can sometimes offset a fingerprint's natural dispersion SHOULD YOU WAIT FOR THE IPHONE 8? While details on the iPhone 8 are scarce, new reports suggest it will have a totally different look from previous handsets and will come with better cameras. An unnamed employee at an Apple site in Herzliya, Israel, where hardware is being developed for the iPhone 8, has leaked some details about the new handset. Given that 2017 will be the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, it would make sense that Apple has something big planned. But the unnamed employee told Business Insider that the iPhone 8 would be 'different' from previous handsets, which have been critiqued as being too similar. If those rumours are true, the iPhone 8 could rival the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge which came out in February this year. n January, Apple revisited a patent filed in 2013, which proposed a curved 'glass' case made from an intricate fusion of metals melted together. The design - made from Bulk Amorphous Alloy, which is a mix of titanium, nickel, copper and zirconium melted together - is said to have the smooth texture of glass and the rigid sturdiness of rubber. Despite widespread excitement over the unique design, it still hasn't reached the general public. Apple usually releases a new model, and then an 'S' version of that model the next year, so some people were expected an iPhone 7S to be released in 2017. But the worker used the term 'iPhone 8' unprompted during the conversations, suggesting Apple may be skipping the 7S entirely.  Read more: Exclusive: Foxconn tests wireless charging for iPhone 8: source- Nikkei Asian Review Apple Said to Release Curved, Bezel-Free 5-Inch and 5.8-Inch iPhones Next Year - Mac Rumors Share or comment on this article e-mail 22 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Pres.

Apple Seeds Beta 3 of iOS 10.2, macOS 10.12.2 and tvOS 10.1, Videos App Removed Updated GO The new TV app replaces the old Video application in iOS Nov 14, 2016 22:05 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Today, November 14, 2016, Apple seeded the third Beta versions of its upcoming iOS 10.2, macOS Sierra 10.12.2, and tvOS 10.1 operating systems to developers enrolled in the Apple Developer program, along with the second Beta of Xcode 8.2 IDE. The Beta 3 development builds are here exactly one week after the release of the second Betas of the iOS 10.2 for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices, and tvOS 10.1 for Apple TV (4th generation) devices, and six days after the Beta 2 announcement for the macOS 10.12.2 Sierra operating system for supported MacBook and iMac computers. Also today, Apple seeded the second Beta release of the Xcode 8.2 IDE (Integrated Development Environment) application, which appears to include the SDKs (Software Development Kits) for the newest iOS 10.2, macOS 10.12.2, tvOS 10.1, and watchOS 3.1.1 Betas. Developers should be aware that Xcode 8.2 Beta requires Mac OS X 10.11.5 or later. Old Videos app finally removed from iOS As for the new features and changes, we can mention that starting with today's iOS 10.2 Beta 3 build, Apple removes the old Videos app that no one used, which was replaced by the new TV app unveiled during the "Hello again" event last month. However, as we reported last week, the new TV app won't work for all users in all regions. There are also various other improvements to the new SOS functionality, a new "Send With Love" effect for the Messages app, and lots of bug fixes. As usual, the third Public Beta builds of iOS 10.2, tvOS 10.1, and macOS 10.12.2 Sierra should be seeded to public beta testers in the next few hours or so. Until the iOS 10.2 Beta 3 and macOS 10.12.2 Beta 3 versions arrive for public testing, you can read our "Here's How to Install iOS 10 Public Beta on Your iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch" and "Here's How to Install macOS Sierra 10.12 Public Beta on Your Mac Right Now" if you want to install them. Update: It appears that the Public Beta 3 release of the iOS 10.2 mobile operating system is already avaiable for download.

(Apple) Share Written by Mike Murphy November 14, 2016 After about four years, Apple has finally overhauled its flagship laptop, the MacBook Pro. The new machines are thinner, lighter, and potentially faster than their predecessors. They also come with a fancy new tiny touchscreen sitting atop the keyboard, called a Touch Bar, which replaces the traditional function keys on a keyboard. Reviews for the new machines hit the internet today, and for the first time in years, reviewers aren’t overwhelmingly thrilled by them. Some miss all the ports the older machines had; others bemoan their battery life; and others their price. Quartz rounded up the opinions of some of the major reviewers below, hopefully helping you figure out whether it’s time to get a new laptop. The Touch Bar is gimmicky Apple’s new tiny second screen works well, but isn’t indispensable, at least yet, according to Wired’s David Pierce: “Technically, the Touch Bar works brilliantly. It’s fast and smooth and responsive. The textured glass feels great, and looks fantastic. Using my fingerprint on the Touch ID reader to log in and to pay for stuff is the best. But the implementation feels unfinished.” The screen will change what digital buttons appear based on what programs you’re using at any given moment. “Right now, I’m subject to Apple’s best guess about what I want,” Pierce added. “Apple often guesses wrong.” The Touch Bar, being used to scroll through photos. (Apple) Engadget’s Dana Wollman agreed: “It’s inconvenient enough that I eventually started using my mouse to do things like pause Spotify or raise the volume on a track. Apple made me change my way of doing things, and not necessarily for the better. That pisses me off.” Conversely, Macworld’s Susie Ochs found the Touch Bar to be useful: “The Touch Bar is incredibly handy not only because its controls change to match the app you’re using, but also because it’s so customizable.” (It’s worth noting that the Touch Bar also adds $300 to the price of Apple’s new laptop.) New keyboard The MacBook Pro follows in the new MacBook’s footsteps and removed the chiclet-style keyboard found on old Mac laptops, replacing them with keys that barely move when you press them down. Pierce didn’t mind them: “The keyboard (a refined take on the 12-inch MacBook’s butterfly keys) doesn’t have much travel and takes getting used to, but it’s accurate and crisp and works beautifully.” The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern was a little less impressed: “You will get used to the spring of the keys on the new flat keyboard. You also get used to sleeping on a rock when camping. What won’t the people around you get used to? The loud clacking sound of the keys.” Not a lot of ports. (Apple) No ports The new MacBook Pros only sport four new USB-C ports, meaning that you’re likely going to need adapters to connect any devices that you used to be able to connect to older MacBook Pros with ease. Stern called using the new Macs a “dongle nightmare.” But long-term, Recode’s Walt Mossberg thinks this won’t likely be an issue for the average user: “I honestly don’t think this is a big problem for average Mac users, whose main need will likely be a new Mac-to-iPhone cable ($19 from Apple). And I believe that, over time, most peripherals will switch to USB-C, since other companies—not just Apple—are behind it.” (Mossberg also called the new laptops a “tweener” but I have no idea if that’s a good or a bad thing or even what that means.) There are some advantages to USB-C, however, such as how fast they can transfer data, and the fact that you can’t you won’t spend hours trying to make sure you’re putting your cables in the right way up. As Ochs put it: “That standard is the future, and offers some real benefits like transfer speeds of up to 40Gbps and support for two external monitors up to 5K each. Right now, though, in the year 2016, I would have preferred a mix of USB-C and full-size USB sockets.” Poor battery life The Verge’s Jacob Kastrenakes said the batteries were an issue, and he only get a charge of more than about six hours once: “It turns out, however, that the bigger issue with these machines isn’t the performance, but the battery life. Apple promises 10 hours, but our tests fell far short of that.” Engadget’s Dana Wollman found “inconsistencies” in her battery life tests, only sometimes getting close to the 10 hours Apple promised that the computer would have. Regardless, she said, that’s lower than the 12-ish hours battery life she got on old MacBook Pros she tested. Good design Like just about every Apple product for the last decade or so, most reviewers agree that Apple’s industrial design is still second-to-none. Stern said, “Compared with my rotting MacBook Air and the old MacBook Pro, the new Pros look like they’ve been on a serious juice cleanse.” Kastrenakes agreed: “The hardware is incredible, macOS is a joy to use, and I don’t want to give up this screen and keyboard. It’s a fantastic laptop on build alone.” Many reviewers also commented on the inexplicably massive new trackpad, which is nearly twice as large as the one on last year’s 13-inch model. The new trackpad also has a pressure-sensitive function like the screen on an iPhone 6S or 7, which allows you to access different functions if you press harder. Stern said that “Apple makes the best trackpad on any laptop, regardless of operating system,” but did have issues touching by mistake because of its omnipresence. Use your finger to pay for things. (Apple) The price MacBook Pros have never been cheap machines, and the new ones are no different. The 13-inch model with a Touch Bar starts at $1,800, and the 15-inch model at $2,400. The New York Times’ Brian X. Chen said that storage constraints may be an issue for some owners, adding, “The MacBook Pros are also expensive, and some users may end up spending thousands of dollars above the retail price for add-ons like extra storage.” (The new Pros all ship with either 256 or 512 GB hard drives, and only the more expensive models can be upgraded to 1 TB—for an extra $400). Chen’s review even goes as far as to potentially suggest a cheaper Chromebook, or a “Hackintosh”—a standard Windows PC that’s been modified to run macOS—over the new Macs. Kastrenakes called the 13-inch model “Overpriced and underpowered,” and Pierce put it in even simpler terms: “Laptops aren’t supposed to be this expensive, are they?” Read this next: If you don’t want to get the new MacBook Pro, consider these Windows laptops instead Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Depending on the reviewer, the Touch Bar feature is either a gimmick or a productivity-boosting addition. As for performance, the reviews are mixed: some people are saying that a lot faster SSD and RAM make the machine super snappy and others note Intel’s Skylake chips barely push performance forward versus 2013 or later MacBook Pros. Jason Snell, Six Colors The Touch Bar delighted Snell: The Touch Bar is an animated interface through and through. Items don’t just fade in and out, but also slide smoothly back and forth. The arrow pointing from the Touch Bar to the Touch ID sensor during a request for an unlock grows and shrinks, practically begging you to put your finger down. There’s a lot more personality here than I expected. To balance out the design, the Touch Bar’s OLED screen doesn’t extend all the way to the left edge of the glass. As a result, the Touch Bar always appears inset from the rest of the keyboard. It’s a bit weird. Here’s a video of Snell’s thoughts on the Touch Bar. For those wondering, you can hit the ESC key on the Touch Bar without hitting the button itself. Tapping the corner of the Touch Bar blindly triggers an ESC key event, as you can see in John Gruber’s video below. This is great if you’d like to hit ESC without looking down at the keyboard. Jim Dalrymple, The Loop Jim discusses the RAM non-issue: To see how the new 15-inch MacBook Pro would do with audio, I opened a 40-track Logic Pro project. The song had a mix of loops, drums, and live recorded instruments. I played back the track, recorded some more guitars, added effects and did everything I would normally do with a music project. When I looked at the memory usage for Logic Pro, it was using 1GB RAM. The MacBook Pro has 16GB, so I have a lot of room before I ever have to worry about running out of memory. I know that having 16GB RAM is a concern for some people, but you could never put more than 16GB RAM in a MacBook Pro, so I don’t get the problem. Pros and other customers have been successfully using these computers for years. Just because it takes more RAM to use a Windows machine effectively, that doesn’t mean the same thing for a Mac. You have to look at the entire picture, hardware, software, system software, and memory optimizations. Unlike some other reviewers, Jim does not think that the Touch Bar is a gimmick. Most of us are so engrained in our workflow that we do things without even thinking about. However, when you do think to check the Touch Bar, you can see how things can be done simpler and easier. Here’s a small example. Have you ever opened the calculator app and had to choose to type in the numbers or click with the mouse? No matter what you do, it’s a pain just because of the type of app it is. With Touch Bar, all of the calculator functions are in the Touch Bar, directly above the numbers on the keyboard. This is clearly so much easier. There are a lot of examples like this with Apple’s apps and there will be many more when third-party developers add support for Touch Bar in the next few months. Touch Bar is cool, but let’s not neglect Touch ID. When the system wants your password to make changes, or delete an app, you can just place your finger on the Touch ID sensor and you’re done. The same can be done in System Preferences when making changes. It’s so much quicker than typing in your password. It’s a small thing, but it all matters. Susie Ochs, Macworld Susie was impressed with the more powerful speakers. What isn’t a bummer are the new speakers, my favorite non-Touch Bar feature of the new machines. Apple explained that since they are connected right to the battery with no transformer between them, the speakers can get twice the peak power—and you can really hear the difference. Music sounds great when you turn the volume all the way up, and the speakers are powerful enough to provide satisfying sound while watching movies, TV, and sports. The 15-inch model’s speakers seem to have more oomph than the 13-incher’s, but both can ably fill a hotel room with music, if you should want to leave your portable Bluetooth speaker at home. Her hands-on video is available at the source link. I’m not embedding it here due to Macworld’s ill-practice of auto-starting videos in the background. Should you buy the new Pro now or later? These new MacBook Pros have a lot going for them. Their biggest weakness, across the whole Touch Bar line, is price. These prices could come down a little bit next generation, but if you need a MacBook Pro right now, the late 2016 models are solid performers. If I were buying one for myself, I’d go with the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and max out the storage, although the 15-inch model is even better. Or simply wait (if you can) until prices of the new Pros inevitably fall next year as Apple refreshes them around Intel’s Kaby Lake chips. Walt Mossberg, The Verge WSJ’s former technology columnist took his 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar for a spin, deciding that the notebook that was once mainly aimed straight at people who do especially taxing work like professional video editing or serious design is “now being stretched to suit a much larger audience.” He experienced some problems with the inconsistent battery life: On my rigorous test, which I’ve used for years, the machine actually exceeded Apple’s claim of up to 10 hours of battery life. The test involves setting the screen at 100 percent, keeping it on and undimmed constantly, playing an endless loop of music, and leaving Wi-Fi on to collect email, tweets, and Facebook posts in the background. Result: 11 hours and 38 minutes. I ran a second test with all of Apple’s default energy-saving settings on, the screen at 75 percent and a perfectly normal (for me) mix of tasks like web browsing, email, a few short videos, Twitter, Facebook, some light writing, and Slack. The Pro died at 8 hours and 22 minutes. To make things worse, Apple’s built-in prediction of how much time the battery had left before dying fluctuated a lot and was mostly wrong. According to Mossberg, Apple says this is a known problem caused by the fact that modern processors can power up and down rapidly over a much wider range than in the past, making estimates much more difficult. In conclusion, he wrote: The new 13” MacBooks—even the base model without the Touch Bar—are costly. And they may make pros unhappy. But, for everyday Mac lovers—users of the Air or maybe the older low-end Pro—they are now your only thin, modern, option with a full-fledged processor. The Touch Bar has potential, but it’s not magic. The battery isn’t likely to deliver on Apple’s claims. You can’t count on liking the keyboard. But, if you’re a Mac devotee ready to move past the Air—not back to a lower-powered MacBook—this is what Apple is offering. Take it or leave it. The new MacBook Pro is a “fast, slim tweener,” wrote Mossberg. Joanna Stern, The Wall Street Journal Even with the faster chips and new hardware features like the Touch Bar and Touch ID, you’ll get the same performance and battery as in the older model, notes WSJ. So how do you decide? Do you invest in the present—the “old” MacBook Pro with performance, good-enough portability, a keyboard to cherish and lots of ports? Or do you invest in the future—a beautiful, highly portable machine with new tricks? Or maybe you do what I’m doing: Stare down at your three-year-old laptop and wonder if you can tough it out another year or two while this sorts itself out. Here’s her video hands-on. Brian Heater, TechCrunch Brian likes the speed bump provided by faster chips, SSD and RAM, saying these features make the new MacBook Pros worthy upgrades, “particularly for those who have been suffering through their old system’s death rattles (or fan buzzing, at least), waiting for a significant update” from Apple. Better processors, more storage, a brighter display and better speakers are all wrapped up in a sleeker and lighter package than before. The Touch Bar feels like a nice bonus for the time being. It’s a compelling new input device that has the potential to alter the way we interact with applications on a laptop. In conclusion, the author wrote: For those who have been holding out on buying a new MacBook, the time is right, with an upgrade that should be sufficiently future-proof to take on the next few years — or however long it takes for the next major upgrade. Hopefully you’ve been saving up in the meantime. Brian X. Chen, The New York Times Brian calls the new MacBook Pros light and fast—“probably powerful enough for most professionals”—but notes these machines aren’t for everyone because the Touch Bar so far “feels gimmicky” and “not many devices or accessories come with USB-C connectors yet.” One thing is sure: For casual users or anyone buying their first laptop, who may just want a computer for web browsing and lightweight apps, the MacBook Pro is overkill. So if you aren’t ready to make the jump to USB-C and you don’t want to spend a big chunk of your savings, it’s reasonable to wait for the new Apple notebooks to realize their potential or drop in price. Dan Ackerman, CNET Dan thinks Apple’s new mainstream MacBook Pro is going to be liked by a whole lot of new customers. On the downside, he notes that the Touch Bar itself “isn’t a must-have” right now. In his opinion, the 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar is likely going to be the default mainstream choice for price-sensitive consumers. While the five percent of the laptop buyers who consider themselves true creative professionals may take various issues with the machine, the remaining 95 percent should see it as a compelling choice. It’s far and away Apple’s most-advanced laptop. The touchpad has double the surface area of the previous model, it’s about as light as a MacBook Air but much thinner (14.9mm versus 18mm), and the flatter butterfly style keyboard has been subtly tweaked to work better here than it does in the 12-inch MacBook. Andrew Cunningham, Ars Technica Andrew notes that folks who use their notebook connected to an external display most of the time with its lid closed won’t have much use for the Touch Bar shortcuts. If it’s being used as a desktop with an external keyboard a significant amount of the time, the Touch Bar does nothing for you. When I went out of my way to use Apple’s apps, I liked the Touch Bar a lot. It just takes one or two useful buttons—creating a new tab in Safari, looking up a main page in Terminal, changing font sizes or creating checklists in Notes—to make you glad the Touch Bar is there. However, a typical day for me is spent mostly in Word, Outlook, Slack, Tweetbot, and Chrome. Microsoft is bringing Touch Bar support to Office, but if other app makers don’t start adding in support, a big chunk of that bar is going to end up sitting empty most of the time. Moving on to graphics, Apple states that the discreet Polaris-based AMD chip (Radeon Pro 450, Radeon Pro 455 and built-to-order Radeon Pro 460) inside the new Pro can drive up to four 4K external displays at 60 Hz simultaneously or two 5K displays at 60 Hz simultaneously (alongside the built-in screen). This is possible thanks to a technique called Multi-Stream Transport (MST) which permits the machine to push two DisplayPort 1.2 streams to the monitor over the single Thunderbolt 3 cable. When you hook one of LG’s 5K monitors to one of the new MacBook Pros, what you’re actually seeing on the screen is two pictures stitched together to make a single seamless image. This is because the version of the DisplayPort specification supported by Intel’s GPUs and almost all monitors these days—version 1.2—doesn’t have enough bandwidth to drive a 5K display at 60Hz all by itself. There’s nothing wrong with this method, except that it cuts down on the number of external displays your computer can support. Intel’s integrated GPUs can drive a total of three displays, but you use up two of those three streams to drive one 5K monitor and one of them to drive the laptop’s internal display. AMD’s GPUs support up to six displays, so you can use two of those connections for one 5K monitor, two of them for the other 5K monitor, one for the laptop’s internal display, and still have one left over for yet another monitor if you really wanted to use one. Switching from Intel’s integrated Iris Pro graphics in favor of dedicated AMD GPUs has resulted in significant graphics performance improvements over previous models, Andrew observes. In his tests, the mid-range 2.7GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro model with AMD’s built-in Radeon Pro 455 graphics chip showed a “significant boost” over this year’s revised twelve-inch MacBook and older 2012-2015 MacBook Pros dedicated GPUs (Nvidia’s built-to-order GeForce GTX 650M and GeForce GTX 750M, plus AMD’s Radeon R9 M370X). Omg the flip side, the new Pros lack the oomph required for high-end gaming and VR. Is it disappointing that Apple didn’t decide to push the envelope a little more? Sure. Is it too bad that performance and power efficiency were apparently sacrificed in the name of external display support? Yes. Are these midrange GPUs in any way inconsistent with any MacBook Pro released in the last decade? No. Here’s how the new Pro scored in the GFXbench synthetic GPU benchmark. Apple says that the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch ID has 130 percent faster graphics and up to 2.5x more computing power per watt versus the previous-generation 15-incher, but keep in mind that Apple’s numbers are based on AMD’s built-to-order Radeon Pro 460 chip. Andrew doesn’t think Apple should have used Nvidia’s Pascal-based GPUs instead of AMD’s even though Nvidia chips do provide support for the latest DisplayPort 1.3 specification. That’s because Thunderbolt 3 and external displays currently max out at DisplayPort 1.2 and are yet to implement support for DisplayPort 1.3. Apple will have more flexibility again when DisplayPort 1.3 becomes more common. Those future laptops will be able to drive two 5K screens plus a laptop’s internal screen using just three DisplayPort streams instead of five. For now, though, if pushing two high-end 5K screens at once was a design goal for Apple, AMD was the only way to go. Fun fact: Pascal GPUs from Nvidia cannot drive dual 5K displays via MST. Does he recommend buying the new Pro? If you’ve got a MacBook Pro that you bought in 2012 or earlier and if you’re convinced of the potential utility and novelty of the Touch Bar, these 2016 MacBook Pros were just about worth the wait. Replace a four- or five-year-old laptop with one of these and you’ll get a great new design, a respectable performance boost, a nice screen, the single most versatile port you can get in any computer, and a new input device…The main problem at this point isn’t that the Touch Bar is a bad idea, but that these laptops cost a whole bunch of money. Great, premium PC laptops are available for half this price, even if Apple still maintains an edge when it comes to graphics and SSD speeds. It really feels like the Touch Bar needs to be included in the $1,499 model, and that versions of the new designs without Touch Bars should be the entry level systems—right now, Apple’s entry-level Mac laptops were all released in mid 2015, and that’s only going to get more embarrassing as time moves on. Lance Ulanoff, Mashable On the removal of all the legacy ports from the new Pro and the Dongle Hell: Removing all those ports was certainly a risky move for Apple, but, in truth, the most you could fault them for is maybe leaping a little too far into the future. Apple is not the only company adopting USB-C. It’s a standard, after all, and just like USB spelled the end of the line for parallel and serial ports, USB-C will eventually be the port to rule all ports, and those peripherals you’re clinging to will someday, in the not too distant future, be deemed too slow or feature-poor to keep you competitive. Is “Dongle Hell” a real thing? In the short term, yes. In the long term, a single multipurpose port will always be the winner. src=&#8221;http://mashable.com/videos/embed?video=qBSPfJH2&#038;player=offsite&#8221; width=&#8217;593&#8242; height=&#8217;333&#8242; Lance criticizes the new Pros as being a bit on the expensive side, but they’re still “an excellent upgrade with a fascinating and highly extensible new Touch Bar.” Dana Wollman, Engadget I’m one of many Mac owners out there who has been waiting for Apple to upgrade the MacBook Pro line. Now that it finally has, I find the new laptop isn’t quite what I wanted. For me, the ideal MacBook Pro is actually a mashup between this and last year’s model. She disliked the fact that some system controls are buried within Touch Bar menus: What’s annoying about this whole setup is that either way, some of the most important system controls are now buried in Touch Bar menus. Want to lower the volume? You can either hit the volume icon and hit the slider, or hit the arrow key and tap the volume up or down key. That’s less efficient than just pressing a dedicated volume button in the function row. It’s inconvenient enough that I eventually started using my mouse to do things like pause Spotify or raise the volume on a track. Apple made me change my way of doing things, and not necessarily for the better. That pisses me off. Touch ID and a thinner design are nice, but she wants her ports back. There’s lots to like about the new MacBook Pro: its slimmed-down design, brighter screen, improved audio, faster graphics and disk speeds. But by doing things like removing full-sized USB ports, the memory card reader and even the Function row, Apple seems to forgotten how many of us actually work. An even better MacBook Pro would be one that doesn’t require users to make “drastic changes to their workflow,” she says. Then, of course, there would be no progress if Apple didn’t challenge the status quo. Christina Warren, Gizmodo To Christina, the new MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar is currently a gimmick that’s not worth the money until more third-party applications support it. It’s somewhat useful, but it’s still so undersupported for apps beyond Apple’s that, at least for right now, the Touch Bar is not reason enough to get a new MacBook Pro. Particularly if you’re already satisfied with the performance of your existing machine. If you need a new MacBook Pro and you can’t wait for the Kaby Lake refreshes already rumored, the benefits of the internal specs matched with the cool-factor of the Touch Bar make this a good Mac. For everyone else this is a gimmick on a very good, way too expensive laptop. Third-party support for the Touch Bar is sparse but growing. Expect apps focused on design and coding to adopt first. My favorite Touch Bar app so far is 1Password, largely because it uses the Touch Bar and Touch ID. I really hope Google chooses to support the Touch Bar. It could be very useful, especially with extensions. On the other hand, she totally loves Touch ID and thinks it’s an “awesome” addition to the Mac, but is also  ”bummed” about the lack of a rose gold color option. Dongle Hell? To use your old peripherals, you’ll be in dongle hell for the short term, but the 4 Thunderbolt 3 ports at least give lots of connectivity options for the future. As for the performance, her review states that both the base 13-inch model without Touch Bar and the base 15-inch model with Touch Bar were performant across Gizmodo’s benchmarks. Christina offered a word of advice to would-be buyers: “If you’re getting the 13-inch, consider spending the extra $200 on 16GB of RAM now, since you cannot upgrade later.” Harry McCracken, FastCo Beyond the svelter design, Touch Bar, and new ports, the new MacBook Pros shows multiple refinements that, on their own, wouldn’t prompt anyone to splurge on a new computer. They just make that new computer better once you have it, and are the sort of improvements that Apple never gets enough credit for making. The MacBook Pro’s high-resolution Retina display would have been one of the biggest reasons to upgrade from a MacBook Air no matter what. But it’s also brighter than previous screens—at full blast, it makes my eyeballs tingle—offers better contrast, and has a wider color gamut for more accurate reproduction of photos. Edward C. Baig, USA Today Edward likes using Touch ID to get into the computer and approve purchases. He’s not too concerned about the removal of legacy ports in favor of USB-C. In fact, USB-S, he writes, at least gives consumers more choices in terms of the chargers. You can use pretty much any USB-C charger to juice up your Mac, though if you try a cellphone charger as I did, it might not charge quite as fast as using the supplied USB-C power adapter, which incidentally replaces the old MacSafe adapter. He’s a fan of the redesigned speaker system that Apple says provides twice the dynamic range of earlier MacBook Pros (“What I can say is that the speakers are loud and crisp, and the overall audio quality is excellent”) and likes the new low-profile keyboard: I never fully cozied up to the “butterfly” style Qwerty keyboard on Apple’s MacBook notebook and was worried when I first learned that the MacBook Pro keyboard was based on the same technology. But the refined second-generation butterfly mechanism used here represents a marked improvement. The keys are responsive. I felt perfectly comfortable, for instance, typing this column out on the keyboard. Like many other reviewers, he balked at the MacBook Pro’s high price which makes the powerful notebook pricier than it’s ever been before and out of reach of many notebook buyers like myself. Chris Davies, Slashgear In dropping almost all legacy ports in favor of Thunderbolt 3, ignoring the Windows 10 style of touchscreen in favor of supplementary Touch Bar and adopting the low-profile butterfly keyboard, Apple has created a pretty “contentious machine,” Chris writes. In his opinion, Apple has not really forgotten the “professional” in recreating the MacBook Pro as other commenters have claimed before him. Has Apple forgotten the professionals which are arguably its most vocal advocates? I don’t think that’s true, though I do suspect that group now finds itself at the fringe of MacBook Pro users. Such is the side-effect of a user group in general expanding. Like Touch ID, the Touch Bar as a brand new hardware feature is currently in infancy and will need some time to take off and realize its potential in full: Ergonomically, I’m among those still content with a non-touch primary display. My experience with the Touch Bar, meanwhile, has left me mighty curious to see what comes next as third-party developers get to grips with the potential of the added interface. Right now, a large part of its usefulness is in replicating keyboard shortcuts: that’s handy if you’re unfamiliar with them, but it’s no great surprise that longtime Mac users have been less wowed. The new MacBook Pros have huge trackpads, but Chris saw no issues resting his hand on them due to flawless palm rejection. All that extra room makes macOS gestures easier, and there’s less swipe-and-lift involved in general navigation. I was a little worried about palm-rejection, given the size of the trackpad means there’s a reasonable chance some part of your hand or wrist might be resting on it at times, but Apple’s improved algorithms there have seemingly done the trick, and I’ve not noticed any issues. The sheer size of the trackpad makes him wish that Apple had added Pencil compatibility for repurposing the trackpad as a graphics tablet. Now, that’s a clever idea!

Apple's list includes 14 apps that now work with the Touch Bar, like Day One, OmniGraffle 7, PocketCAS, Mail Designer Pro 3, Focus, and 1Password. Some of the apps, like Final Cut Pro and djay Pro, were previously shown off by Apple on stage when the MacBook Pro was announced. The scope of Touch Bar support varies by app, but in many apps, once-buried settings and frequently used shortcuts are now available in the Touch Bar, allowing users to speed up their workflows. In djay Pro, for example, the Touch Bar can be used for full music manipulation, while in 1Password, it offers options for quickly adding or finding passwords. One of the chief complaints in MacBook Pro reviews released today was the lack of support by third-party apps, but that should soon improve as developers finish updating their apps with Touch Bar compatibility. Many apps, including popular titles like Pixelmator, Photoshop, Affinity Design, and Microsoft Office, will be introducing Touch Bar support in the coming weeks.

Comments By Mike Elgan Follow Computerworld | Nov 14, 2016 12:10 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Wearables Mobile & Wireless Comments Where did wearables go wrong? Futurists promised a "wearable computing" world in which you could buy gadgets that could perform a thousand functions and live anywhere on your body. Instead, the vast majority of wearables are biometric wristwatches, measuring mostly heart rate and bodily movement. The top-selling wearables come from Fitbit, Apple, Xiaomi, Garmin and Samsung -- all watches that measure movement and heart rate. The overwhelming predominance of fitness watches is problematic in four ways that hardly anybody talks about. 1. You can wear only one. If you're inclined to own a smartwatch, you already have one. Your wrist is taken. So the hundreds of new smartwatches on the market are unusable and irrelevant to you as a consumer. 2. Wrist-worn biometrics don't work well. The most heavily touted feature is heart rate monitoring. A JAMA Cardiology study found that the Apple Watch is the most accurate heart rate monitor among the popular fitness wearables they tested, and its accuracy was only around 90%. Others grouped into the low 80% range, according to the report. (No watch comes close to the accuracy of chest straps for heart rate monitoring because they can track the heart's electrical activity, which suggests a promising future for heart-rate-monitoring sports bras for women.) 3. Fitness watches don't boost fitness. Separate from the inaccuracy of wrist-based heart rate monitoring, the general idea of using biometrics to boost fitness probably doesn't work for most users. Take weight loss, for example. A two-year clinical trial conducted at the University of Pittsburgh put hundreds of people on a behavioral weight loss program. Half the participants were given consumer fitness wearables. But the group without wearables lost more weight. (My guess is that fitness trackers tend to make you feel like you're getting more exercise than you're really getting.) 4. People lose interest in fitness watches. More than half the fitness wearables purchased end up in a junk drawer, according to a survey by Endeavour Partners. (Over the next two years, that situation will improve with the entry of choice in smartglasses and hearables.) Despite all this, biometric-capable smartwatches get most of the wearables attention, and most of the sales. But what about those of us who aren't in the market for another wristwatch, and already have a way (or don't want) to track our heart rate or movement? Are there any interesting consumer wearables beyond biometric fitness watches -- and glasses and earbuds, for that matter? Turns out the answer is: Yes! Here's the world of innovative wearables you never hear about that don't go on your wrist, face or ears and which don't primarily track biometrics. Jewelry An Indian startup called Leaf Wearables sells a line of smart jewelry that includes a $60 pendant, bracelet and key chain. Each device revolves around a big fake jewel. By squeezing the jewel twice, Leaf Wearables (working through a Bluetooth-connected smartphone app) notifies your list of emergency contacts with a text-based "SOS" telling them you're in danger and giving the location. They can track you on a map over time as well. If you look at your phone, you can see the nearest hospitals and police stations. The Leaf battery lasts a week between charges. Wearsafe Labs The Wearsafe tag is a panic button that places your emergency contacts into a chat room, where they can hear a live audio stream of your situation -- and call 911 if necessary. Another panic-button wearable comes from a Connecticut-based startup called Wearsafe Labs. Their wearsafe is a clip-on device called the Wearsafe Tag, and works with a smartphone via Bluetooth. By pressing a large button on the device, you alert your network of family and friends about your location via text and email. It also streams audio, so they can hear what's going on. (It also has an optional auto-DVR function, which means it's constantly buffering audio, then streams the audio beginning 60 seconds before you pressed the button.) When alerted, your contacts are linked to a dedicated "chat room" where they can talk to each other about your situation and decide what to do. The Wearsafe is free, but requires a $4.99 monthly subscription fee. Pins Collective The Pins Collective pin is like any sort of promotional badge you might wear, but it can display anything, from a photo to text to a GIF.  A Swedish startup called Pins Collective is crowdfunding what is effectively a $69 smart badge. It's a screen for communicating with the world using graphics, including motion graphics, which you can set on the accompanying app. You can use your words, or upload a graphic or photo. You can use it as a nametag, or to support a cause or campaign. Advertise your website or business. Make yourself easy to identify when you're meeting strangers. Pins Collective reportedly intends to launch a PinOS platform and a SDK this year, and the product should ship in February. Senstone Inc. The Senstone can be worn just about anywhere, and records your voice notes with the push of a button. The Senstone is a pendant that can be worn as a clip-on, necklace, bracelet or carried as a keychain. By pressing the button or snapping your fingers, you record voice memos, which are translated into text on the app and automatically organized, according to the company, Senstone Inc. Like most wearables, it connects to an app. But unlike most, it still works even if your phone is off or elsewhere. It can record up to two hours of your yammering, which are transferred and processed later when the phone is in range. The company expects to ship in the spring. Orion Labs offers a vaguely similar device, which you wear as a clip-on or necklace. But instead of recording your voice, the Onyx conveys it to another person. Like the Star Trek communicator, the Onyx conveys your voice instantly when and while you push the button. When you're done talking, let go to let the other person speak (like a walkie-talkie). The Onyx has actually been around for a couple of years, but will gain Alexa support by the end of this year, according to a representative for the company, which means you'll be able to interact with Amazon's virtual assistant as if you owned an Echo. The Onyx costs $199.99 for a pack of two or $129.99 for a single unit, and you can customize the colors. Jacket and shirt When Google sold Motorola to Lenovo, it kept Motorola's groundbreaking research group, called Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP). One of its signature initiatives is Project Jacquard, which weaves smart sensors directly into fabrics. The first consumer product to come out of this initiative is a Jacquard-enabled jacket, which should go on the market next year. The jacket sleeve functions as a touch controller for your smartphone. A USB-chargeable tag snaps on the jacket and communicates to your phone. That enables sleeve gestures (tapping and swiping) to affect apps on your phone, such as music playback and phone call control. Levi's says the smart jacket will cost the same as dumb jackets, probably under $200. A product called the Fan Jersey from an Australian company called Wearable Experiments is a shirt for football fans (either the international football, a.k.a. soccer, or American football varieties), which delivers real-time haptic feedback while you're watching a game. You can feel the heartbeat of specific players, or feel the impact of a kick or tackle high on your chest along the collarbone. (The shirt connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth.) When your team scores a goal or touchdown, you'll feel the roar of the crowd. These are just a few of the hundreds of wearables that you can buy now or sometime soon. Best of all, they don't involve biometrics, fitness or require you to replace whatever it is you currently have on your wrist, on your face or in your ears.

Courtesy of Lenovo via AP, File Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email NEW YORK -- Can the venerable laptop keyboard get more touchy-feely — and in a good way? We’re about to find out. Higher-end models of Apple’s MacBook Pro now come with a narrow touch screen above the regular keyboard for quick access to common settings and tasks, while Lenovo’s Yoga Book laptop loses the physical keyboard entirely. The traditional keyboard has never struck me as needing much improvement, although people who’ve grown up on touch screens might well feel differently. These touch innovations, in fact, may mostly be aimed at luring such users to laptops. So how do the new touch features improve typing and computing? Touch screens, not keyboards Many Windows laptops and tablets with physical keyboard accessories have long had touch screens. You still type primarily on a traditional keyboard, but you can poke screen icons and menus directly with your finger instead of navigating with a mouse or trackpad. This can be useful for basic tasks such as opening apps, moving the cursor to the search bar and rebooting the machine. But when fixing typos in documents, selecting email to delete and even editing photos, my trackpad is generally more precise than my fat fingers on the screen. A stylus helps, but I’m prone to misplacing it. It’s also generally faster to just keep your fingers on the keys. Touch keys Largely for these reasons, Apple has shunned touch screens on its notebooks. But its high-end MacBooks are getting a separate, narrow strip that replaces the top row of function keys you’ll find on most keyboards. This Touch Bar offers the same functions, but instead of hitting F11 or F12 to change volume, for instance, you tap the speaker icon to bring up a volume slider. Play Video CBSN Apple unveils upgraded MacBook Apple is rolling out an upgraded version of its popular MacBook laptop computer. CBSN's Reena Ninan has more. You can fix up to four icons in place; the initial defaults are brightness, volume, mute and the Siri voice assistant. The rest of the strip changes based on context. When you’re using the Safari browser, for instance, you typically get thumbnails of individual tabs for easy switching between websites. But that changes to play and pause if you’re watching Netflix, while your name and address pop up as choices when filling out online forms. Apple’s Maps app offers one-touch access to nearby businesses or directions. Mail and Messages offer auto-complete suggestions as you type, plus a button for emojis, similar to what you’d find on iPhones and iPads. You get touch access to system controls, such as “cancel” and “save,” so you don’t have to move your cursor. Third-party apps can add their own functionality, too, though the ones I use regularly have yet to do so. Habits and discoveries The new volume and brightness sliders are much easier to use than tapping the appropriate function key multiple times to get the level I want. In Photos, I can scroll through my library more quickly than using arrow keys. And the Touch Bar does make it easy to include emojis in messages. Because I use it frequently, I made the screenshot function a default icon. No more opening Grab, navigating a menu and returning to the window I’m trying to preserve. I’ve also discovered functions I never knew existed, such as the ability to highlight text in Preview with different colors. This may matter less if, like me, you’re a pretty good typist with a command of keyboard shortcuts. The Touch Bar will be more useful for those who look down at the keys when typing. One suggestion: The mute icon stays the same regardless of whether the Mac is already on mute. How about a distinct icon to unmute, now that the options are dynamic? Fingerprints The Mac now turns on automatically when you open the lid. In place of a power button is a fingerprint scanner, similar to what’s found on mobile devices. You still have to type in my password occasionally as a security measure, but you can avoid doing so most of the time when resuming a session or installing new software. People sharing a computer can instantly switch profiles with their own fingerprints. What else The MacBook Pro has a larger trackpad and is lighter and thinner than previous models, thanks in part to shorter keys that don’t feel awkward. You no longer get regular USB ports or an SD memory card slot for photos. That means buying adapters to connect older printers, scanners and your iPhone to the new USB-C ports. On the plus side, you can now connect the power charger on either side, depending on where the outlet is. And the MacBook retains a headphone jack, something the latest iPhones dropped. If you don’t need the Touch Bar or the fingerprint scanner, you can save $300 with an entry-level MacBook Pro, but it is slower and has ports only on one side. The Touch Bar models start at about $1,800 for a 13-inch screen and $2,400 for 15 inches. Disappearing keyboard Meanwhile, the 10-inch Yoga Book (about $500 for Android, $600 for Windows) retains the clamshell design of a laptop but has a second touch screen where the keyboard normally goes. Unlike pop-up touch keyboard in tablets, this one doesn’t block the main display as you type. Without physical keys, the device is just 0.38 inch thick, or about two-thirds the thickness of the new MacBooks. The touch keyboard also doubles as a handwriting pad for notes and doodling with the included stylus. The Yoga provides both tactile and audio feedback when you hit the keys, although it’s still easy to miss the ones you’re aiming for. It takes longer to type because of all the typos, which gets annoying very quickly. You would think that with a touch keyboard, the Yoga could reconfigure the keys to toggle between upper and lower cases and switch languages, much the way a touch keyboard on a phone or tablet does on the screen. But the keys themselves always appear in standard English and in upper case, even when you’re typing in Thai. Call it a missed opportunity. An Australian startup called Sonder is already planning to ship such a keyboard for $199 this year, but who wants to carry around an extra accessory? If it makes it onto a future laptop, it could mark a true revolution that goes well beyond the minor changes the Touch Bar and the second touch screen offer. © 2016 The Associated Press.

The app, which works in conjunction with AppleTV, plays recordings of various classic children's stories and shows images of the pictures from those same books. StoryTime for tvOS uses a new feature on Apple's iBooks called 'Read-Aloud.' While all the books' narrations are read by actual humans (to reduce the uncanny effect of robotic voices,) Read-Aloud couples the books with subtitles running at the bottom of the screen. The hope is that StoryTime will not only provide a soothing way for parents and kids to read their favorite stories, but it will also help kids to learn to read thanks to the clear fonts.

The 15-inch MacBook Pro hooked up to some external 5K displays. Andrew Cunningham The 15-inch Pro and the 13-inch Touch Bar model. Andrew Cunningham The new Pro comes in both space gray and silver. Andrew Cunningham The glowing Apple logo on the back is no more. Andrew Cunningham The new 15-inch model has a big trackpad and big speaker grilles to the left and right of the keyboard. Andrew Cunningham The Touch Bar models have four Thunderbolt 3 ports, unlike the $1,499 model. Andrew Cunningham The Touch Bar displaying emoji. Other Ars staffers who saw the Touch Bar were impressed that it had the same amount of color and detail as any old Retina display. Andrew Cunningham Buttons have, by and large, been replaced by sliders. Andrew Cunningham Customizing the Touch Bar buttons in software. The new design of the MacBook Pros is nice, and Apple’s decision to put in nothing but Thunderbolt 3 ports has prompted a fresh wave of dongle talk, but the signature feature of the new MacBook Pros was always going to be the Touch Bar. This little touch-enabled strip represents a bunch of things. It’s a melding of Apple’s traditional Intel-driven software platform and the company’s own homegrown chips and its touch-driven iOS platform. It’s Apple’s answer to the touchscreen, a model that Apple steadfastly resists in its computers even as Microsoft and its partners embrace it. And it's the biggest thing about these Macs that’s truly new—Macs in the last half-decade have gotten thinner and lighter and have better battery life than before, but, Touch Bar aside, they all still run basically the same software in basically the same way. So, yes, these new laptops have new CPUs and GPUs, new designs, new ports, and new screens. We’ll spend plenty of time with all of those things. But the biggest question for buyers is whether the Touch Bar is worth it and what it adds to the experience that you can’t already get if you keep the latest version of macOS installed on your laptop. Differences between all three MacBook Pros Specs at a glance: 13-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro (Four Thunderbolt 3 ports) Screen 2560×1600 at 13.3" (227 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.9GHz Intel Core i5-6267U (Turbo up to 3.3GHz) RAM 8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 (soldered, upgradeable to 16GB at purchase) GPU Intel Iris 550 (integrated, 64MB eDRAM) HDD 256GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 1.3Gbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 2x Thunderbolt 3, 2x Thunderbolt 3 with reduced bandwidth, headphones Size 11.97" × 8.36" × 0.59" (304.1 mm × 212.4 mm × 14.9 mm) Weight 3.02 lbs (1.37 kg) Battery 49.2Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $1,799.99 Price as reviewed $1,799.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, three integrated mics We've been over this a few times, but let's list the differences between the $1,499 MacBook Pro and the Touch Bar model. There are a couple of new details I can confirm now that I’ve actually been able to use both models. The low-end Pro uses a 15W Core i5-6360U CPU with an Intel Iris 540 GPU; the high-end model uses a 28W Core i5-6267U CPU with an Intel Iris 550 GPU. The difference, aside from small boosts to CPU and GPU clock speeds, is that the 28W model can run faster for longer and throttle less frequently. The 15W model can also consume less power. The low-end Pro uses a single “Alpine Ridge” Thunderbolt 3 controller from Intel, while the high-end Pro uses two Thunderbolt controllers. The two ports on the right side of the MacBook Pro have "reduced PCI Express bandwidth," which Apple says means they have two PCIe 3.0 lanes’ worth of bandwidth at their disposal instead of the four lanes dedicated to the ports on the left side (Intel’s mobile Skylake chipsets include a total of 10 PCIe lanes, four of which are already being used by the SSD). You can connect all the same things to both ports—displays, storage, power adapters—but especially high-performance storage arrays should be plugged in on the left side to maximize the available bandwidth. The low-end Pro uses 1866MHz LPDDR3 RAM while the high-end Pro uses 2133MHz LPDDR3. Apple has said it’s using LPDDR3 to save power, but it’s also the reason the systems max out at 16GB. The low-end Pro actually has a larger battery than the high-end one: 54.5Whr compared to 49.2Whr. Apple says both laptops have 10 hours of battery life, but the lower-power processor, the larger battery, and the lack of a little second screen above the keyboard all mean that the low-end model actually lasts a bit longer than the Touch Bar model. The low-end model includes two integrated mics, while the high-end model includes three. The low-end Pro’s 802.11ac Wi-Fi tops out at 867Mbps, while both the Touch Bar MacBook Pros can do a maximum of 1.3Gbps just like last year’s models. And here are a few further differences between both 13-inch models and the 15-inch models, all of which include Touch Bars. 15-inch Pros have enough thermal headroom to fit in quad-core Skylake processors. The base model includes a 2.6GHz (3.5GHz Turbo) Core i7-6700HQ, while our review unit uses a 2.7GHz (3.6GHz Turbo) Core i7-6820HQ. Either model can be configured with a 2.9GHz (3.8GHz Turbo) Core i7-6920HQ. All models use their processors’ Intel HD 530 integrated graphics when possible to save power, but they also include dedicated AMD Radeon GPUs. The Radeon Pro 450, 455, and 460 are all based on AMD’s latest Polaris architecture—we’ll go into more detail about each component later in the review. The trackpad in the 15-inch model is larger than in the 13-inch models. All four Thunderbolt 3 ports in the 15-inch Pros offer the same amount of PCIe bandwidth, since Intel’s quad-core CPUs add more PCIe 3.0 lanes to the amount that the chipset includes (in total, Apple is using four lanes for the SSD, eight lanes across all four Thunderbolt 3 ports, and another eight lanes for the dedicated GPUs). Using the 15-inch model Specs at a glance: 15-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro Screen 2880×1800 at 15.4" (220 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-6820HQ (Turbo up to 3.6GHz) RAM 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 (soldered) GPU AMD Radeon Pro 455 with 2GB RAM, Intel HD 530 HDD 512GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 1.3Gbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 4x Thunderbolt 3, headphones Size 13.75" × 9.48" × 0.61" (349.3 mm × 240.7 mm × 15.5 mm) Weight 4.02 lbs (1.83 kg) Battery 76.0Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $2,399.99 Price as reviewed $2,799.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, three integrated mics The reduced size and weight of the 15-inch Pro are both really nice when you’re carrying the machine around. At just four pounds, it actually weighs less than the 4.5 pound 13-inch MacBook Pros did before the jump to Retina, and it’s a pound-and-a-half lighter than the pre-Retina 15-inch models (there’s a less consequential but still nice half-pound reduction compared to the older Retina models). When you're using it, though, it’s still very much a 15-inch laptop. I use 13-inch laptops almost exclusively these days, and the more cumbersome size and larger palmrest make the 15-inch models just a little unwieldy compared to what I’m used to. In other words, even with the size and weight decreases, the 15-inch model isn't small enough to be a good replacement for a 13-inch notebook. I will say that my minor palm rejection problems with the 13-inch Pro’s larger trackpad aren’t really problems here. It may be because the trackpad is larger, so the corners of my hands are always firmly placed on the trackpad as I type rather than hitting it intermittently. Beyond this, the experience of typing and of using the trackpad is identical. The 2880×1800 screen has the same resolution as the older Retina models, albeit with the added brightness and contrast and the wide color support. But like the MacBook and the 13-inch Pros, the screen’s default resolution is 1680×1050 mode. As with the previous models, you can also select 1024×600, 1280×800, 1440×900, and 1900×1200 modes depending on what’s the most comfortable for you. Finally, the speakers here are much larger than the ones in the 13-inch model, and they sound pretty good for laptop speakers. They have respectable bass and dynamic range. While they aren’t as good as the speakers in a desktop like an iMac or some good dedicated speakers, they’re good enough for movies and TV, and they aren’t bad if you need to fill a room with music for a small party.

Stocks are opening modestly higher on Wall Street, led by gains in banks as interest rates continue to rise. (Richard Drew/Associated Press) By Marley Jay | AP November 14 at 4:46 PM NEW YORK — U.S. stocks came back from an early loss and finished almost unchanged Monday. Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week’s election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump’s policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. “The market is sniffing out the belief that some of these Trump policies may drive some better economic growth but also may in fact be somewhat inflationary,” said PNC Chief Investment Strategist Bill Stone. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple gave up $2.72, or 2.5 percent, to $105.71 while Facebook declined $3.94, or 3.3 percent, to $115.08 and Microsoft slid 90 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $58.12. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $18.53, or 2.4 percent, to $753.22. Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump’s spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to 2.25 percent from 2.14 percent late Thursday. Bond trading was closed Friday for the Veterans’ Day holiday. The day before the Nov. 8 election, the yield was 1.83 percent. That’s a huge move for that benchmark rate. Goldman Sachs rose $5.24 percent, to 2.6 percent, to $209.18 and Bank of America rose $1.06, or 5.6 percent, to $20.08. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.82, or 3.7 percent, to $79.51. Stone said investors are focused on potential corporate and individual tax cuts, a “wave of deregulation” that eliminates some of the rules governing businesses like energy companies and banks, and more protectionism on trade, which could hurt sales for companies that do a lot of business overseas. Investors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. For example, Trump’s election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Stone added that corporate dealmaking could increase if Trump’s administration takes a looser approach to antitrust regulation. Several companies announced deals or deal offers Monday. South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes electronics for cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.07, or 25.2 percent, to $109.72. German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor’s stock rose $5.61, or 18.3 percent, to $36.29. Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.75, or 15 percent, to $13.40 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it’s too low. Belden stock added $1.52, or 2.2 percent, to $71.22. The dollar rose against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.51 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0726 from $1.0845. Investors are also selling companies that pay big dividends like utilities and phone companies as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income. Verizon fell 51 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $46.18 and American Electric Power lost $1.27, or 2.1 percent, to $58.72. Oil prices bounced back from a big loss early on. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped just 9 cents to $43.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 32 cents to $44.43 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.28 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.39 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 13 cents, or 5 percent, to $2.75 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $2.60 to $1,221.70 an ounce. Silver lost 49 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $16.89 an ounce. Copper picked up 1 cent to $2.52 a pound. France’s CAC 40 rose 0.4 percent and Germany’s DAX added 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed 0.3 percent higher. In Japan the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 percent after a strong reading on Japan’s economic growth. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.5 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 1.4 percent. ____ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

SUBSCRIBE Microsoft execs share plans for making Bing ‘pervasive,’ say search is about to become very different At an event in Redmond, Microsoft shared its vision of the future in which Bing is at the heart of day-to-day experiences without users even realizing it. Ginny Marvin on November 14, 2016 at 2:03 pm More In a day of high-level presentations that included Microsoft’s global branding initiatives, HoloLens and the future of an algorithm-driven economy, Bing Ads executives conveyed the strengthening embrace of Bing across Microsoft. No longer a sideline money loser, Bing is now a revenue-positive, rich data source for the company. Bing has been bundled into flagship Microsoft products like Office and Xbox and is being positioned at the forefront of the machine learning and artificial intelligence developments Microsoft is betting on. At the fourth annual Bing Ads Next event in Redmond on Thursday, Rik van der Kooi, corporate vice president of the Microsoft Advertising Business Group, built on his declaration last year that Microsoft was “all in on search.” Calling Bing an “intelligence fabric” that is now woven into Windows 10, Xbox, Cortana and other products, van der Kooi said “Bing is going to be pervasive.” Beyond the Microsoft ecosystem, Bing is also the search engine for Apple’s Siri and Amazon assistant devices, and more partnerships are expected to come. There will be integrations with LinkedIn after the acquisition deal by Microsoft closes next year. The future of search “When we think about the future, search is going to change pretty dramatically,” said van der Kooi, adding, “We are going to collectively define with our customers what the new business models are when people talk to their devices and we go beyond 10 blue links on a page.” Gurpeet Singh Pall, partner director of program management for Bing and Cortana, said, “The future of Bing is going beyond the search box to a personal, pervasive and predictive experience in which it might not be obvious users are even interacting with the search engine. Consider product search on the Hololens in which users test couches from a product catalog looks in their living rooms, for example.” Current initiatives While most of the corporate presentations focused on the somewhat-near-future rather than present-day feature development for Bing Ads, the company did touch on a few current initiatives: Dynamic native ads pilot: Bing Ads introduced native ads on MSN.com inventory over a year ago. A pilot for dynamic native ads is now running with a small set of advertisers and publishers. The aim is to build what the company is calling an Intent Network to differentiate it from standard display networks — and more specifically, the expansive Google Display Network. Bing’s focus is on developing a curated network of sites around key commercial verticals such as automotive and financial services. The company is planning to make more announcements about the intent network in the beginning of next year. Ads are matched using a variety of dynamic signals from publishers and advertisers and Microsoft data that users opt in to share.” Growing mobile share: According to comScore data, the Bing Network has grown  to 31.9 percent of US search share on desktop. On mobile, however, Bing’s share is minuscule. Bing Ads executives acknowledge they can’t grow mobile share on the backs of Microsoft’s first-party platforms alone. “We think of it first in terms of partnerships like Apple and think about Bing in those kinds of partnerships for mobile supply opportunities,” said Steve Sirich, general manager, marketing for search advertising. “We will continue to build experiences like the Cortana apps and Bing apps, but the first priority is on building the third-party supply chain and partnerships.” Machine Learning & AI Will Underlie Everything From a vision-of-the-future perspective, Microsoft shared updates on several products that are further away in terms of having direct practical applications for advertisers: Decision Service: Microsoft introduced its testing and optimization product called Decision Service to the audience. Currently, it is only being deployed with a small set of customers in Azure, but Decision Service has use cases for content optimization, ad optimization, product recommendation optimization, pricing optimization and so on. From an ads standpoint, Decision Service could be layered on top of an ad server or eventually integrate directly with Bing Ads. Cortana & Conversation As a Platform (CAP): This is where Microsoft sees the new opportunity for developers, where bots are the monetization drivers for developers, not apps. “You can interact more naturally and search without searching” because bots surface information to you in a predictive manner, said Singh Pall. Cortana, Microsoft’s digital assistant, is on Skype, Office, Outlook and Windows 10 and is powered by Bing. Microsoft says Cortana now has 133 million monthly users. The Cortana SDK is being released soon, and the developer focus will be on improving personal productivity. Singh Pall spoke of Bing and Cortana integrations with third-party APIs, noting 2,000 developers have signed up to use Microsoft’s augmented services. “What we are aiming for with Cortana is native skills that will continue to grow, but the third parties are going to be integrating skills into it,” said Singh Pall. “When it comes to work productivity, Microsoft has the context that a lot of others don’t have. We will bring more into the fold to enhance that and grow the life aspect of it.” HoloLens: Margeau Veenstra, who oversees HoloLens commercial strategy and Windows experiences at Microsoft, said that consumer applications for the augmented reality device are not far off. “It will rapidly become the expected way to engage with content and become part of our everyday device experience,” she expects. For example, Microsoft is working with Houzz to help users see how furniture options can look in their homes. A new vision for digital success In this new framework in which bots replace apps, machine learning powers our engagement with technology (and that includes ad management and optimization) and artificial intelligence fulfills its promise to increase productivity, the days when businesses base their digital presence on a website are numbered. The question now, says Microsoft, is: How do you take what you’ve already invested in — apps, websites — and shift? Businesses need to meet customers anywhere and cannot expect users to leave wherever they are to go to your website “Going forward, it is going to be about whether you are helping me be more productive. Consumers don’t mind paying when there is convenience included in the process,” said Singh Pall in discussing the new paradigm of customer engagement. Gurpreet Singh Pall discusses changing methods of customer engagement. This vision is reflected in Bing’s own plans. When asked about  driving mobile share and engagement, David Pann, general manager for search advertising, explained in an interview on Thursday, “Our strategy is we have to be everywhere and have a multi-pronged approach instead of just a singular focus of getting the default on devices. We also realize mobile experiences are going to dramatically evolve over the next three to five years to the extent that consumer intent won’t be typed in — it may be location-based, it may be understanding what’s on your schedule. The notion of search could move to a more passive approach. We don’t know, so our strategy is we have to try it all … We believe that this multi-pronged approach will be a way to aggregate sufficient mobile supply that is interesting and will provide great sticky experiences for consumers and great experiences for advertisers.” Given Microsoft’s “be everywhere and reward productivity first” viewpoint and the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, one can begin to envision a significantly more complex ad auction that can ingest and react to a wide ranging and ever-changing set of signals. This is the future in which humans efforts at optimization can’t possibly keep up. Microsoft wants to make sure we don’t have to. Bing Ads itself was conspicuously missing from most of these discussions, however. The platform has come a long way, but it still has challenges that keep more advertisers from adopting it and current advertisers from spending more with it. This vision seems to demand more than block-and-tackle improvements — instead, a wholesale rebuilding of the Bing Ads platform that puts it on the leading edge of this new near-future.

Opinion | 14 Nov 2016 | Print  | Comment (0) Four Reasons Why Apple Should Bid on Time Warner by Josh Centers Telecom giant AT&T is seeking to purchase content giant Time Warner (which is no longer affiliated with Time Warner Cable, see “AT&T Aims to Buy Time Warner for $84.5 Billion,” 24 October 2016). However, the deal could run into regulatory obstacles, with politicians on both sides of the aisle questioning the merger. It also doesn’t help that the Department of Justice is suing AT&T subsidiary DirecTV. There might be an opportunity for Apple to swoop in and outbid AT&T, which is something I’ve been shouting from the social media rooftops since it became clear that Apple’s new TV app wouldn’t support Netflix or Amazon Prime Video (see “Apple’s TV App Seeks to Unify the Apple TV Experience,” 27 October 2016). I’m not alone: Goldman Sachs is reportedly pushing Apple to make a competing bid for Time Warner, but Apple is resisting. However, I think Apple should consider the possibility. Here are four reasons why: Content Is a Unique Form of Currency -- If Apple wants to play in the content arena, and it does, the company has to own content that it can use as a negotiating chip with other content providers to expand its library. You’d be right to ask: “Apple has nearly $238 billion in cash. Can’t it afford to license or create any content it wants?” Yes… in theory, but it’s not that simple. Let’s say Apple wants to sell new episodes of Amazon’s award-winning show “Transparent” in iTunes. You can buy the first season there, but the second season is still exclusive to Amazon Prime Video. If Apple really wanted to get access to those new episodes as they drop, it might be able to pay Amazon for that privilege, but not necessarily, because “Transparent” is more to Amazon than merely a popular, award-winning TV show. “Transparent” sells Amazon Prime memberships, Fire TV boxes, and helps reward partners who fit into Amazon’s overall strategy, like Sony, whose video players usually offer an Amazon Prime Video app. It doesn’t matter how much money you have if the other party doesn’t want to sell. With most goods, negotiations come down to money, but content is special, because it’s impossible to predict. For instance, the recent movie “Inferno” was a flop, despite being directed by Ron Howard, starring Tom Hanks, and being based on a Dan Brown story — on paper, “Inferno” should have been a huge hit. Meanwhile, one of the biggest hits of the year has been “Deadpool,” a low-budget superhero movie helmed by an inexperienced director and starring Ryan Reynolds, who, despite good looks, charisma, and talent, spent years starring in flops. Content is unique. Because you can’t just buy good content, content has become a form of currency. Since no company can make all the content it wants to provide to customers, the best way to get content can be to trade. An example: Right now, one of Amazon Prime Video’s biggest selling points is that it streams HBO shows for free. Time Warner owns HBO, and if Apple bought Time Warner, Apple would own HBO, which might encourage Amazon to create an Amazon Prime Video app for the Apple TV. Likewise, Time Warner owns “Arrow” and “The Flash,” which are popular Netflix exclusives (Time Warner owns DC Comics, which originated the characters and Time Warner owns half of the CW network that airs those shows). If Netflix wanted to keep those exclusives, it might be more inclined to support Apple’s new TV app. So why shouldn’t Apple buy Netflix, as analyst Ben Thompson recommends? Buying Netflix Would Be Dangerous -- Thompson correctly points out that owning content would give Apple a seat at the table it wouldn’t otherwise have, but I fear that owning Netflix would only make the problem worse. Netflix’s catalog has shrunk by half in the past four years, for the simple reason that Netflix scares the hell out of Hollywood. The studios don’t want to be beholden to Netflix, so they’re seeking deals with Netflix competitors like Hulu to make their content available to streamers, which limits piracy while reducing Netflix’s power. Apple engenders the same sort of fear in Hollywood, which still holds Apple responsible for ruining the music business. That’s nonsense — if anything, Apple saved the music industry — but TV and movie studios are desperate to avoid becoming dependent on Apple. Companies like Amazon and Sony can cut deals that Apple can’t because Apple frightens content owners. Apple disrupts existing business models, and the last thing these companies want is disruption. Hollywood’s nightmare is that Netflix becomes the next Apple, and if Apple buys Netflix, that fear comes true in spades. “But Netflix makes its own content,” you might counter, and that’s true. Netflix makes a lot of great content, but you only ever see it on Netflix. Netflix hasn’t been willing or able to share its content as a negotiating chip. Instead, it’s a way to make sure Netflix is relevant even if some content owners abandon it entirely. Apple could potentially turn Netflix’s content into bargaining chips, but there hasn’t been much precedence for that, and Time Warner offers better chips anyway. Despite owning some tasty Marvel franchises like “Daredevil” and “Jessica Jones,” Netflix has nothing to compare with Time Warner’s catalog, which includes the likes of Batman, Superman, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones. Time Warner is a much, much bigger player than Netflix, owning Adult Swim, CNN, Cartoon Network, DC Comics, HBO, 10 percent of Hulu (more leverage), Looney Tunes, NBA TV, TBS, the CW, and TNT. Again, I’m just scratching the surface. The full list of stuff owned by Time Warner is staggering. Time Warner has a lot to offer, and Apple is in a position where it can afford it. It’s Time to Spend that Money, Apple -- AT&T is offering $84.5 billion in cash and stock for Time Warner. Apple has $238 billion in cash. Apple could easily outbid AT&T with plenty of money to spare. But is that a good deal? On paper, maybe not. Time Warner’s market cap is only about $68 billion, less than even AT&T’s bid. But, since content is a form of currency, measuring in terms of cash value is tricky. Besides, Time Warner is a healthy business. It saw a profit of $1.5 billion in its most recent quarter, which, while dwarfed by Apple’s Q4 $9 billion in profits, isn’t chump change. However, Apple may not be able to spend its money freely, given that much of it is held offshore. But even those opposed to the deal, such as Mashable’s Kerry Flynn, agree that money isn’t the problem. Many have speculated over the years that Apple clings to its cash out of a sort of survivor’s trauma after it nearly closed its doors in the 1990s. But content is going to be key to Apple’s long-term prospects. Time Warner is a profitable business with a wealth of content to offer Apple, but most importantly… Time Warner Can Take Care of Itself -- One of the more compelling arguments against Apple acquiring Time Warner is that there would be a culture clash between the companies. But here’s the thing: Time Warner can take care of itself. It’s a profitable, growing business that doesn’t need a babysitter. Tim Cook wouldn’t have to run that show — Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes seems to be doing a fine job — nor would he have to be on the set of “Game of Thrones” every day (though that might be tempting for other Apple executives, who shall remain nameless). Another counter argument is that owning a movie studio and a record label doesn’t seem to be doing Sony any favors. It’s true: the hardware and content divisions of Sony are notoriously hostile. One of the reasons Sony lost the music player market is because Sony Music objected to the adoption of MP3 for Sony’s music players. However, Apple isn’t Sony, and more importantly, Apple and Sony are from countries with very different corporate cultures. Japan’s business culture places a heavy emphasis on consensus — that is, not making a decision until all parties are in agreement. This is often smart, but it backfired in Sony’s case because some of Sony’s units had conflicting goals. When Sony got into the music and movie businesses in the late 1980s, it did so to feed its core hardware business. But at some point, the company lost sight of that goal, so content became the tail wagging the dog. I can’t see Apple suffering a similar fate. Apple has never been a consensus-based company, but rather a benevolent dictatorship. Cook might rely more on his lieutenants than Jobs did, but there’s no question about who’s in charge. The key to success in an Apple/Time Warner merger would be maintaining a firewall between the two businesses, with Apple leaving Time Warner alone unless it needed a content deal. However, that’s not to say there wouldn’t be risks involved with Apple purchasing Time Warner… Potential Dangers -- The biggest risk for Apple would be competing with and thus alienating long-time ally Disney. That would be a tricky relationship to maintain. Some have asked why Apple just doesn’t buy Disney. I think that would be an ideal scenario, but who’s to say that Disney is even for sale? Bidding on Time Warner might also tick off AT&T, which hopes to have Time Warner for itself. AT&T might respond by trying to find ways to undercut the iPhone. But AT&T isn’t the only cellular carrier, and Apple now offers its own iPhone installment program, so it’s unclear how much leverage AT&T would have. But here’s the bottom line: Apple wants to be in the content business. Apple needs to be in the content business if it hopes to grow its increasingly important Services category. And there are only two ways to achieve that goal: Create content, such as Apple is doing with its upcoming “Planet of the Apps” and “Carpool Karaoke” shows. But this is a difficult, risky business with no guarantee of success, and it won’t make Apple any friends either. Buy existing content that is known to have an audience. Apple is currently just dabbling in the content-creation business, but the major content companies are watching it with an eagle eye. If Apple appears to be encroaching on their turf, they’ll be quick to put pressure on Apple to back off. Apple’s best hope for content is a quick move that would make it a major player overnight, and buying Time Warner is currently the best path toward that. Or at least the most dramatic.   TextExpander: Your knowledge at your fingertips. From email to code, gather your text "snippets" for reuse, each only a keystroke away.

Macs & Mac OS X | 14 Nov 2016 | Print  | Comment (3) iMac Gets Competition from Microsoft’s New Surface Studio by Julio Ojeda-Zapata Apple has recently been taking heat for its Mac line, which is seen by some as moribund over the past few years. The Touch Bar built into the new MacBook Pro notebooks is a bright spot, but the machines otherwise struck many as lackluster (see “New MacBook Pros Add Context-sensitive Touch Bar,” 27 October 2016). Then there are the Mac Pro and Mac mini, which haven’t seen significant upgrades in years. What about the iMac? That desktop machine has seen a consistent stream of upgrades over the years — including improvements in screen resolution and under-the-hood revisions. But its basic design — a tiltable display on a metallic base — has remained essentially unchanged since the iMac G5 in 2004. The iMac would appear to be the target of Microsoft’s latest product reveal: a new desktop PC with a 28-inch touchscreen that can be lowered to a 20-degree angle for use as a “drafting table” of sorts for stylus-driven creative projects. This computer, called Surface Studio, was unveiled the day before Apple showed its laptops, causing a flood of commentary about how Microsoft is supposedly out-innovating Apple. That’s open to debate. Tiltable touchscreens on Windows desktop machines aren’t new, though the PC world has never seen anything quite like the Surface Studio. Microsoft’s first-ever desktop machine raises questions. Why has the iMac’s design evolved so little over more than a decade? Can a case be made for Macs with touchscreens, regardless of the existence of the iPad? Has Microsoft conjured up a fresh approach to desktop computing that will lure creative professionals from Apple… or is the Surface Studio an overpriced dud? New Surface Surfaces — The Surface Studio is a departure for Microsoft’s hardware division, which until now has focused on mobile computers. These include four generations of the Surface Pro, a laptop/tablet hybrid with a flip-out stand and a keyboard cover, and two generations of the Surface Book, a laptop with a touchscreen that can be removed for tablet-style manipulation (see “Microsoft Surface: A Tale of Two Computers,” 11 March 2014). Microsoft has enjoyed some success with its Surface computers — enough, it would seem, to keep expanding into form factors that increasingly resemble and compete with Apple’s Macs. The Surface machines are a shift for the once software-focused Microsoft, as it aspires to become a dominant hardware purveyor. The Surface Studio is unquestionably an iMac competitor, though a pricey one, starting at $2999. In comparison, Apple’s top-of-the-line 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display is seemingly a steal at its base price of $2299. Microsoft, which will sell its new machine this year in only limited quantities, is positioning the Surface Studio as a tool for creative professionals with deep pockets. It’s not a product for the frugal masses. For creatives, the Surface Studio has a host of enticing features. It includes a 28-inch display that shifts effortlessly on two metallic arms and what Microsoft calls a Zero Gravity Hinge from an upright position to its drafting-table mode. It sports a low-profile base unit that users can drag across a desktop nearly effortlessly when repositioning is required, which is often. Microsoft also offers a cylindrical accessory called the Surface Dial that adheres magnetically to the display and operates as a controller for certain apps. Artists can employ a stylus in conjunction with the Surface Dial for sketching, drawing, and photo-editing projects. The keyboard features a numeric keypad and is a dead ringer for the classic Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, though with grayish keys. Finally, the Surface Studio’s mouse is far more comfortable than Apple’s Magic Mouse 2. All but the $99.99 Surface Dial are bundled with the Surface Studio — but those who buy before 1 December 2016 will get the Surface Dial for free. Speeds and Feeds — In terms of specs, the iMac and Surface Studio aren’t far apart. Both machines offer sixth-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 chips, between 8 and 32 GB of RAM, 1 or 2 TB “Rapid Hybrid Drives” — Microsoft’s answer to Apple’s Fusion Drive — a quartet of USB 3.0 ports, and an SD-card reader. The iMac boasts two Thunderbolt 2 ports while the Surface offers a single DisplayPort without added Thunderbolt capabilities. Both have stereo speakers, dual microphones, a headphone jack, and support for Bluetooth 4.0 and the latest Wi-Fi. Both weigh 21 pounds (9.5 kg). The Surface Studio’s 28-inch PixelSense display has 4500 by 3000 pixels (13.5 million pixels at 192 dots per inch), but the 27-inch iMac retains the edge here with a Retina display that has 5120 by 2880 pixels (14.7 million pixels at 218 dots per inch). Despite the nominal sizes, the screens have different proportions. The Surface Studio’s screen measures 25.09 by 17.27 inches (63.73 cm by 43.87 cm), whereas the iMac’s screen is 20.3 by 25.6 inches (51.56 cm by 65.02 cm). Apple’s unholy fascination with thickness has apparently infected Microsoft as well, since the company says the Surface Studio display is the thinnest ever at this size. Whatever. Touch or No Touch? — In terms of hardware, the Surface Studio’s major difference from the iMac is touch. Microsoft has it; Apple does not. It’s unclear if that gives the Surface Studio an edge over the iMac and positions Microsoft to take a bite out of Apple’s iMac revenue. The Mac’s lack of touchscreen technology has been long-running discussion fodder, with some believing it makes zero sense, and others lamenting how it puts Apple at a disadvantage. Mac users having to diagram, draw, paint, or sketch need to seek workarounds — such as graphics tablets — to compensate for their machines’ lack of touchscreens. Even the iPad has been retrofitted into a graphics tablet courtesy of apps such as Astropad that permit Macs and iPads to work in unison for visual, stylus-driven projects. But while Apple has kept its non-touch Macs and its touch-focused iPads separate, PC screens have increasingly incorporated touch. This is most common on mobile machines, but it’s also true of many desktop PCs. In some cases, those screens are even designed to flatten on a desk or table. The Surface Studio is therefore not breaking new ground, but it offers the most advanced such implementation yet. With the screen at its 20-degree angle, users can lean over the computer with their arms on the display while working with the stylus, and the Surface Studio is smart enough to ignore pressure from elbows and wrists. The Surface Dial — when used with apps that support it — is a useful sidekick. In the app Sketchable, for instance, spins and presses of the dial provide instant access to color palettes and more. Alas, in my brief tests, the Surface Dial tended to slide down the tilted display, instead of sticking in place as intended. My Surface Studio tests revealed another shortcoming that could be a deal-breaker for many potential buyers. That glossy display, when lowered to drafting-table mode, shows a reflection of the ceiling — which invariably incorporates lighting fixtures. What office does not have ceiling lights? How usable will a Surface Studio be under such conditions? The Surface Studio does have a major supporter in Mike Krahulik, co-creator of the famed Penny Arcade Web comic, and a longtime Surface devotee. Writing as usual as his Jonathan “Gabe” Gabriel cartoon alter ego, Krahulik gave the Surface Studio a big thumbs-up after being allowed to use the PC for a week. The iMac’s Future? — The release of the Surface Studio raises important questions: Could Apple radically improve the iMac design, much as Microsoft is trying to do with the Surface Studio? If so, does (or should) the Surface Studio offer inspiration for Apple? I’m a journalist, not a product designer, so I can’t answer those questions. But I can’t deny that I felt a shiver of excitement when I used the Surface Studio for the first time. It was marvelous to use a computer that takes risks and pushes boundaries — though at an exorbitant price and with an, um, glaring shortcoming. The 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display is gorgeous, and a wonderful Mac, but it’s also a little boring. Apart from adding the Retina display and keeping up with CPU and connectivity specs, the iMac hasn’t really changed in years. If the Surface Studio is a hit with creative professional, perhaps Apple will feel some pressure to think different again.   READERS LIKE YOU! Support TidBITS by becoming a member today!

Could Apple draw inspiration from the Surface Studio for future iMacs? Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Grant  2016-11-14 17:09 My comments represent only that of a simple Mac desktop user since 1984. I think the touch screen is cool, but in my dream iMac desktop I really have simple requests: a keyboard with a 10-key numeric key pad; as much RAM as I can self-install, and the fastest processor available. Sure, a nice clear, high resolution screen is nice as is an internal SuperDrive. A "nice to have" is more external ports on the back of the iMac. I do not keep up with technology like most folks do, but recently I spent two days with an Apple Engineer from Cupertino. One comment that really struck me was that "innovation is hard when you're already 5-7 years ahead of much of the competition." The other statement (true/false -- I do not know) is that the "fundamental underpinnings of technology, networks, security, wifi, BlueTooth...has not changed a heck of a lot in the last 5 years." Please do not misinterpret the preceding quotes as my position. I just think we're going to hit a few plateaus between great surges in technological advancement. The iPod, iPhone, and iPad weren't even sold 11-12 years ago. Give me a top of the line iMac with memory, speed, and longevity for the same price point we are used to seeing (or lower). My iMac of the future doesn't have to be the coolest desktop sold, just the best in terms of performance and integration with my other products. Apple strives for seamless integration in its product lines. Perhaps that is its appeal and advantage. Just my thoughts. Reply Michel Angelo  2016-11-15 06:16 Putting your fingers on the screen is a magnificent ways of acquiring a gorilla arm, a sickness derived from the effort in your shoulder, which is not easy to cure. Poorly used, the mouse itself, or a keyboard located too high, is already a cause for gorilla arm. I am retired, have witnessed numerous instances of that gorilla arm sickness, simply with mouse heavy usage by secretaries. A sensitive screen is a "no thanks" for me. For sensitive screens, I use my ipad, on a couch, for short periods and with nearly no inputs. Reply Rene Albert  2016-11-15 07:40 Microsoft has no innovation skills, and must now resort to being an iMac wannabe... Plus, only Bill Gates can afford to buy the new Surface Studio. It should focus instead on fixing their Windows 10 software which has been a disaster according to user reviews online!

The new beta adds support for the limited Single Sign-On feature. We also expect Apple to unlock the new TV app in this beta as well, but that’s not confirmed as of now. It’s highly not recommended to run this beta as it may cause problems with your Apple TV down the road. However, to proceed: head to Apple’s Developer portal and download the necessary profile to your Mac or PC. Plug the device in via the USB-C port on the back of your Apple TV and fire up iTunes. From there, tap Option (Mac) / Shift (Windows) + Update and select the profile. Once completed, head over to your Apple TV’s settings > system > Software Update. If it does not appear, reboot your Apple TV and it should prompt you to update. Update: Some users (including myself) are reporting that the update is getting stuck at ‘Waiting for update server…”. If you spot anything interesting, be sure to leave us a comment below!

"When you focus in on Apple in particular, the concern is that if we have a trade war with China, that Apple is going to suffer — and it will suffer more so than the other multinational tech companies," Colin Gillis, senior technology analyst and director of research at BGC Financial, told CNBC's "Power Lunch" on Monday. Shares of Apple have fallen more than 4 percent over the past week, as technology companies like Amazon and Alphabet have also tumbled. After the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency, Chinese media warned that any tariffs on Chinese goods would be met with higher prices, especially for iPhone, which is made with parts that are Chinese-made and assembled. Trump has vowed to drive a hard bargain with the Asian superpower. There could be positives in a Trump presidency for Apple, Gillis said. But one factor — a tax holiday for repatriation of Apple's overseas cash — has already been "factored in" to the share price by investors, he said. Gillis said that unlike rival Google, Apple has fewer products, and thus fewer opportunities to monetize their users. Plus, Gillis said, Apple faces growing competition from local Chinese smartphone makers. "It's a one-product company," Gillis said. "So does it deserve to trade at a premium? No, it doesn't." To be sure, Gillis is in the minority among analysts. At $85 a share, his target price for Apple's stock is by far the lowest of any analyst listed in FactSet. Gillis dropped his price target in July, maintaining a "sell" rating despite a 16 percent rise in Apple's shares in the past six months, according to FactSet data. Apple saw revenue fall 30 percent from a year ago in the fourth quarter in Greater China, its third-largest market based on its financial reporting. In the second calendar quarter, Chinese companies Oppo and Vivo saw year-over-year worldwide smartphone shipments increase 136.6 percent and 80.2 percent, respectively, according to IDC. Apple CEOTim Cook has said he's still very bullish on China's long-term prospects. CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment. But Gillis said that unless Apple can grow beyond its main source of revenue, the iPhone, it's simply "GoPro on steroids." "There are risks embedded in China, both for consumer tastes and government regulation," Gillis said.

You can also create your own Memories, turning any Memory into a slideshow, which you can share with friends and family. RELATED ARTICLES How to Create Quick Slideshows and Projects with Photos How to Make Sure Your Mac and iPhone’s Photos Sync to iCloud Memories are different from albums. Albums are just folders you put photos into. But you can create Memories from any album or group of photos in your collection. Photos will also create Memories automatically from photos you take, based on a time period or location, turning them into “best of” collections. You might think of Memories as a sort of day-by-day scrapbook collection. For example, if you go to a party and take a bunch of snaps of you and your friends, they’ll appear the next day as a Memory. It’s then up to you what you want to do with it, by saving it, creating a slideshow, sharing it, or just letting it fade away. To use Memories on your Mac, you must first at least be running macOS Sierra. In order to make sure Memories works across all your Apple devices, you will need to set up iCloud, sign in with the same Apple ID, and turn on iCloud Photo LIbrary for each device on which you want to view your Memories. If you want to see your memories on a 4th generation Apple TV, then you need to make sure it is updated to tvOS 10 or later. Viewing Memories in the Photos App You can view Memories on your Mac by opening the Photos app and then clicking Memories in the sidebar and double-clicking on any Memory. When you view a Memory in Photos, it will slowly cycle through the contents, allowing you to preview it before you save it, convert it to a slideshow, or share it. In the example below, we how Memories created a “Best of Last Month” collection. Creating Your Own Memories The Photos app will automatically create Memories based on photos you’ve recently taken. You can create your own Memories, however, from any album. Simply open the album and click “Show as Memory” in the top-right corner. Alternatively, if you’re browsing from the All Photos tab, you can click the group title and it will automatically be converted to a Memory. Save Memories for Access Later The Photos application is always creating new Memories based on new photos you add. In order to preserve Memories so that they’re not overwritten by new ones, scroll all the way to the bottom and click “Add to Memories”. When you want to look at your Memories more closely, simply double-click to open one and then scroll down to check out a summary of photos contained within a particular Memory. Clicking “Show All” will display all the photos in a Memory. Scroll all the way to the bottom of a Memory and you can select a person or group to see more photos like it, click on a place to view more photos taken nearby, or discover other related Memories, which are sorted by events, scenes, places, and people. Turning Any Memory into a Slideshow for Sharing As we mentioned at the beginning, you can turn your Memories into slideshows, which you can share with your friends and family. Once you’re happy with the photos you’ve gathered into your Memory, click the slideshow arrow in the Photos’ toolbar. From there you can choose a theme and accompanying music (the iOS version has a few more options and calls them Movies).   If you want to share a Memory you or the app has created, click the Share button in the top toolbar. As you can see, you can share your Memories through iCloud Photo Sharing, Facebook, Messages, and more. The Memories feature is a great way to distill your photos into something accessible and meaningful. Whether it’s a day at the beach, a vacation to Europe, or just a barbeque with friends, it lets you rediscover photos that might have otherwise gotten lost in the crush of new photos.

Home Industry Companies Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay offer rewards Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay offer rewards Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. By: Associated Press | New York | Published: November 15, 2016 1:44 AM The American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. (Reuters) Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. Apple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services – until now. The American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. Apple Pay can speed up transactions because people don’t have to re-enter card and contact information. Separately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, redeemable for gift cards and products.

Apple announced today that Apply Pay now supports donations to non-profit charities, removing some barriers to contributing money. There’s no waiting between the announcement and roll out, as Apple Pay’s donation functionality is live from today. Obviously, not all charities will support Apple Pay from launch, but there are around two dozen that do. Those include Doctors Without Borders, charity: water, the American Red Cross, Children’s Miracle Network, and the Make-a-Wish Foundation. Apple lists a few that will be coming online shortly, such as the American Cancer Society and PBS. Apple and the charities involved hope that this will encourage more people to give. Since those who are giving can now use Apple Pay, it means that they no longer need to create accounts or fill out forms with contact information. By removing those steps and making the transaction a little more seamless, more people may be encouraged to donate. At this early stage, there seems to be a good range of charities that now support Apple Pay. Whether you’re looking for charities that are centered around conservation or getting help to sick children, this starting roster has those bases covered. Have a look at the full list below: Nonprofits bringing Apple Pay to supporters today include: – American Red Cross – American Heart Association – charity: water – Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals – COPD Foundation – Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) – Doctors without Borders – Feeding America – GlobalGiving – International Rescue Committee – (RED) – St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital – Save the Children – The Nature Conservancy – The Water Project – UNICEF – WNET – World Vision – WWF (World Wildlife Fund) Nonprofits soon to offer Apple Pay include: – American Cancer Society – CARE – DonorsChoose.org – PBS and its local stations – United Way Apple hasn’t said when those last five on the list will launch integration for Apple Pay. It did say, however, than a number of others will be going online in the coming months, so it sounds like we have some additions to look forward to as we transition into 2017.

KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2 percent to 3,204.31 points and Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 was flat at 17,670.77. Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 tumbled 0.5 percent to 5,320.60 and Seoul’s Kospi was almost unchanged at 1,974.27. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.4 percent to 22,314.62. Benchmarks in Southeast Asia and New Zealand were mixed. WALL STREET: Tech companies including Apple and Microsoft took big losses on concern Trump’s policies might hurt their sales in China and other global markets. Bank stocks surged as bond yields rose, which allows them to make more money from lending. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. RISING DOLLAR: The dollar climbed as high as 108.30 yen from Monday’s 107.87 yen as expectations of a U.S. rate hike rose. Trump’s surprise election initially raised expectations the Federal Reserve might put off a rate hike until his plans were clear. But analysts say the latest comments from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan indicate the Fed is sticking to plans to act in December. “There appears no stopping the U.S. dollar’s recent ascent based on the current interest rate trajectory,” Stephen Innes of OANDA said in a report. TRUMP WATCH: Investors were watching for signs of what Trump, who gave few details of his plans on the campaign trail, might do in office. Analysts say his promises of tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending could boost economic growth but also spur inflation. His threats of sanctions against China and other trading partners that he accuses of acting unfairly have rattled trade-dependent Asian economies. ANALYST’S TAKE: “Moving forward, the spotlight could shine on the contentious trade policy proposals that the president-elect had raised during his campaign,” said Jingyi Pan of IG in a report. “The latest soundbite from outgoing President Barack Obama seems to suggest that the incoming president is ‘ultimately pragmatic’,” said Pan. “It is without a doubt that emerging Asian markets would be negatively impacted should a trade war break out between US and China, although the delayed address could mean that the President-elect may indeed be more pragmatic than we have known.” CURRENCY: The euro was little-changed at $1.0752. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gained 89 cents to $44.21 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract shed 9 cents on Monday to close at $43.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 75 cents to $45.19 in London. It lost 32 cents on Monday to $44.43.

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Nov 14, 2016 at 1:21PM What if you could simultaneously tap into a meaningful dividend yield, dividend growth, and an undervalued stock all in a single investment? With Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, this is what you get. Image source: Apple. Here's why Apple is one of my favorite dividend investments, especially after the stock's recent pullback. Solid dividend payments For any investor looking to give his portfolio a boost from a dividend stock, a decent dividend yield is likely a requirement. Fortunately, Apple's stock's dividend yield, or annual dividend payments as a percentage of the stock price, has moved higher in the past 30 days thanks to the stock's 10% pullback during this time. AAPL data by YCharts. Today, Apple's dividend yield is about 2.1%, a meaningful jump from a 1.9% dividend yield just one month ago. Dividend growth potential While some investors may gloss over Apple's 2.1% dividend yield, which is about in line with the average dividend yield of stocks in the S&P 500, it starts to get interesting when investors look at the dividend's growth potential. The prospects for Apple's dividend growth are evident both by the dividend's recent growth history and a look at the cash flow supporting the tech giant's dividend payments. Apple's recent annual dividend increases, along with management's admission that it plans to continue to increase the dividend every year, highlight a rapid growth trajectory for dividend payouts. Since 2012, for instance, Apple's quarterly dividend payments have increased by about 51%, or a compound annual growth rate of 10.8%. Further, Apple's most recent dividend increases remain robust, with 10.6% and 9.6% hikes in 2015 and 2016, respectively. AAPL Dividend data by YCharts. And perhaps making an even stronger case for Apple dividend's growth potential is the company's strong free cash flow. In the trailing 12 months, Apple generated an incredible $52.3 billion in free cash flow, yet paid out only $12.2 billion in dividends. Clearly, the company has plenty of room to maintain its annual dividend hikes. Another way to look at Apple's room for further dividend increases is with the payout ratio, or dividend payments as a percentage of earnings. Apple's payout ratio is just 24.8%. For comparison, dividend stocks McDonald's, IBM, and Microsoft have payout ratios of about 67%, 44%, and 69%, respectively. An undervalued stock Finally, one of the best reasons to buy this dividend investment is that the stock is arguably undervalued. Trading at about 13 times earnings, Apple stock looks considerably cheaper than the average P/E ratio of companies in the S&P 500 of approximately 24.  Sure, Apple's earnings per share is down 10% in the trailing 12 months, suggesting there may be some merit to a conservative valuation. But with the tech giant's pricing power intact and customers as loyal as ever, Apple is likely to return to EPS growth over the long haul, making today's low P/E multiple irrational. Investors who buy Apple stock today get a meaningful dividend, dividend growth, and a low-risk stock. Opportunities like this don't surface every day. Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

Here's how to get your perfect choice Shares Update: The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have just landed in our best iPhone round up, but where does each place? You've woken up, looked out the window and then looked down at the crumbling smartphone that you've been using for what feels like ever. Some part of your mind decides that it's time for an upgrade, and if you're set on owning an iPhone, then you've got some big choices to make. You can spend a fortune on the powerful iPhone 7 Plus that's a part of our best phones list, or spend some time in the secondhand market looking for a cheap iPhone - but will get you just what you need? With a bewildering selection of different specs, screen sizes and price points each of these handsets has something to offer every type of Apple fan - so we've boiled down the choices for you in a simple-to-read format. From the superpowered iPhone 7 to the affordable 4-inch iPhone 5S, these are the best iPhones for a variety of budgets and requirements. 1. iPhone 7 Plus The best iPhone money can buy Weight: 188g | Dimensions: 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm | OS: iOS 10 | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels | CPU: Apple A10 Fusion | RAM: 3GB | Storage: 32/128/256GB | Battery: 2900mAh | Rear camera: 12MP+12MP | Front camera: 7MP Heaps of power for slick performance Excellent camera Very expensive No headphone jack The iPhone 7 Plus is the best iPhone Apple has ever made. It's large though, so if you're after a smaller phone this won't be the best choice for you with its 5.5-inch 1080p display. The big upgrades are the waterproof design and a phenomenal new dual-lens camera that allows you to snap with two 12MP lens at the same time. It allows for better optical zoom as well as a Bokeh mode to blur the background of your photos and put the main focus on the foreground. Battery life on the iPhone 7 Plus is much improved upon the iPhone 6S Plus too, plus it comes stocked with iOS 10 software right out of the box. You probably already know there's no 3.5mm headphone jack. It means you'll have to use Bluetooth headphones or the Lightning cable converter, which comes in the box with the iPhone 7 Plus. The biggest problem you'll likely have will be the price. It's a costly option, but the upgrades are worth the extra money and this is the phone to go for if you're looking for the best iPhone in 2016. Read the full review: iPhone 7 Plus 2. iPhone 7 Your first waterproof iPhone? Weight: 138g | Dimensions: 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm | OS: iOS 10 | Screen size: 4.7-inch | Resolution: 750 x 1334 | CPU: Apple A10 Fusion | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 32/128/256GB | Battery: 1960mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 7MP Good low light camera Water resistant Lacks clear upgrades Same design for last three years Don't fancy the large iPhone 7 Plus above? Why not opt for the iPhone 7, which comes in at position number 2 on our best iPhone round-up. Again there's no headphone jack on the iPhone 7, but it does come with a waterproof design that means your phone is likely to survive the odd dip in the sink rather than just being frazzled right away. There's no dual-lens camera on the iPhone 7, but you can still take some absolutely incredible photography with the 12MP sensor. If you own an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6S, you may not see much difference with the new phone but the new processor and camera tech may be enough to entice you to buy the latest iPhone from Apple. Read the full review: iPhone 7 3. iPhone SE Compact, relatively affordable and very powerful Weight: 113g | Dimensions: 123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6mm | OS: iOS 9.3 | Screen size: 4.0-inch | Resolution: 1136 x 640 pixels | CPU: Apple A9 | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 16GB/64GB | Battery: 1624mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 1.2MP Great power Lower price Tired design Old screen technology As the first 4-inch iPhone since 2013's iPhone 5S the iPhone SE has been a long time coming, but although it's slotting in at the bottom of Apple's range, it's in many ways more a successor to that phone than to the cut-price iPhone 5C. Because, despite the iPhone SE's small size and relatively modest price tag, it's very close to being a flagship. It has the same boxy, yet premium design as the metal-clad iPhone 5S and the same powerful Apple A9 processor and rear camera as the iPhone 6S. It lacks the 3D Touch features and higher-resolution front-facing camera of the iPhone 6S. The screen is also less impressive all round, thanks in large part to a lower contrast ratio. But it compares well to many mid-range handsets. It's the most powerful 4-inch iPhone you can get, so for fans of compact form factors this is an obvious choice. But while it's not as cheap as the discontinued iPhone 5S, it's also still something of a bargain by Apple standards, so it's worth considering if you're on a budget too. Read the full review: iPhone SE 4. iPhone 6S The best iPhone of 2015 Weight: 143g | Dimensions: 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm | OS: iOS 9.3 | Screen size: 4.7-inch | Resolution: 1334 x 750 pixels | CPU: Apple A9 | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 16GB/64GB/128GB | Battery: 1715mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 5MP Great design 3D Touch impresses Battery life low Price high for a low-res screen The iPhone 6S, as you probably know, is Apple's flagship from 2015. The Apple A9 processor and a chunky 2GB of RAM, up from 1GB on the previous model, make it far superior in raw power to 2014's model, and it's got some other tricks too. It's got a 12MP rear camera and an tried-and-true 8MP front-facing camera, making it the best selfie shooter Apple's put on a phone. It does sport largely the same design and screen as the iPhone 6 though and the latter in particular is starting to feel a bit dated in the face of super sharp QHD screens from rivals. Apple has at least added a new feature to the display, in the form of 3D Touch, which makes it pressure sensitive and offers new tricks for enhanced emailing and shortcuts around the homescreen. Ultimately the iPhone 6S is the best 4.7-inch iPhone available and is likely to remain a compelling choice for years to come. Specifically, you'll pay $549/£499/AU$929 and up, which is a lot, but not actually any more than the iPhone 6 Plus. Read the full review: iPhone 6S 5. iPhone 6S Plus A good iOS phablet Weight: 192g | Dimensions: 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm | OS: iOS 9.3 | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1920 x 1080 pixels | CPU: Apple A9 | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 16GB/64GB/128GB | Battery: 2750mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 5MP 3D Touch has exciting potential Bright, vibrant display Big and heavy Expensive The iPhone 6S Plus comes in at upwards of $649/£599/AU$1,079, but for that money you get everything the iPhone 6S has with a bigger and sharper 5.5-inch screen. That makes it more unwieldy than the iPhone 6S, but a big screen also has a number of advantages, making movies and games more immersive - and the extra resolution really helps make apps look even better. It also has a bigger and longer-lasting battery, matching the iPhone 6 Plus in terms of longevity. It's big, powerful, feature-packed and going to last the longest of all the iPhones, making it the best Apple handset for phablet fans with money to burn. Plus, as it comes in sizes of up to 128GB you can store your entire movie collection on it, if that's your thing. Read the full review: iPhone 6S Plus 6. iPhone 6 A good phone with a great design Weight: 129g | Dimensions: 138.1 x 67 x 6.9mm | OS: iOS 9.3 | Screen size: 4.7-inch | Resolution: 1334 x 750 pixels | CPU: Apple A8 | RAM: 1GB | Storage: 16GB/64GB/128GB | Battery: 1810mAh | Rear camera: 8MP | Front camera: 1.2MP Great design Better battery than previous models Still pricey Screen too low-res The iPhone 6 was a big change for Apple. Not only did it sport a curvier chassis than the last few models - complete with a change from metal and glass to all-metal - but it was also bigger, with a 4.7-inch screen. Even that's not massive by smartphone standards, but it's substantially larger than the 4-inch iPhone 5S, bringing Apple into line with the trend of bigger screens that the rest of the competition was peddling. The iPhone 6's screen is sadly no more or less sharp than the 5S though, as the resolution went up in line with the size, where rivals were shovelling in pixels at a rate of knots. It is, however, far more powerful than the iPhone 5S, with an A8 processor giving it extra grunt. It's since been beaten by the iPhone 6S, iPhone 7 and even the iPhone SE, but the iPhone 6 is still one of the slickest performers around for most top apps. Apple also packed in a better battery to help get you through the day. It's still not stellar, but it will keep you going through a day of moderate use, making it a better fit for any phone addicts than Apple's older handsets. You can expect a few years of software updates too and while the design may not be to everyone's tastes we'd argue that the curvy look is an improvement on the angular iPhone 5S. Read the full review: iPhone 6 7. iPhone 6 Plus Apple's first phablet has a stunning design Weight: 172g | Dimensions: 158.1 x 77.8 x 7.1mm | OS: iOS 9.3 | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1920 x 1080 pixels | CPU: Apple A8 | RAM: 1GB | Storage: 16GB/64GB/128GB | Battery: 2915mAh | Rear camera: 8MP | Front camera: 1.2MP Great full HD display Strong camera Too big to use one handed Expensive If 4.7 inches isn't enough for you - you're in luck. Apple launched the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus alongside the iPhone 6 to give the phablet market something to chew over. The extra size makes it a better option for watching movies, browsing the web and generally wasting time on your phone with. It's also sharper than the iPhone 6, with a 1080 x 1920 401ppi screen, in place of a 750 x 1334 326ppi one. In most other ways it's a match for the iPhone 6, with the notable addition of optical image stabilization for the camera offering better snaps, and the improved battery life is something a lot of iPhone owners crave. Read the full review: iPhone 6 Plus 8. iPhone 5S An affordable alternative to the iPhone SE Weight: 112g | Dimensions: 123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6mm | OS: iOS 9.3 | Screen size: 4.0-inch | Resolution: 1136 x 640 pixels | CPU: Apple A7 | RAM: 1GB | Storage: 16GB/32GB/64GB | Battery: 1560mAh | Rear camera: 8MP | Front camera: 1.2MP Touch ID Good camera Battery suspect Dated screen tech Apple followed up the iPhone 5 with the iPhone 5S. It has the same size and resolution screen, so it's a compact 4-inch phone, making it ideal for anyone who doesn't like lugging around an undersized tablet. The premium design is much the same too, with a two-tone metal and glass construction. But it's a little more powerful, with a newer processor under the hood. We're still not in top-end territory here, (not by 2016 standards anyway), but it's slightly nippier under the finger. The camera was also rather improved over the iPhone 5, with the 8MP snapper still taking decent photos despite its age. But perhaps the biggest change from the iPhone 5 is the addition of Touch ID, allowing you to secure the phone with your fingerprint. Plus, as a newer handset it should still have a little bit of life in it, as Apple is likely to keep the OS updated for a while longer. If you don't fancy upgrading again a year or two down the line, that's worth factoring in as you should get to 2018 (or even 2019 if you're a light user) before finally having to give in and upgrade. All this comes at a cost though. You can't get the iPhone 5S direct from Apple any more, but it can be found in other stores from around $335/£270/AU$425. That makes it a fair bit pricier than the iPhone 5, but if you have the money to spare it's probably worth it for the extra power, future-proofing and fingerprint-scanning credentials of the iPhone 5S.

X Court to fast-track legal challenge to Apple data centre in Athenry Brian McDonagh challenging decision to allow Apple build €850m facility in Co Galway about 23 hours ago Aodhan O'Faolain A march and rally held earlier this month in support of Apple’s €850 million data centre project for Athenry. Photograph: Joe O’Shaughnessy         A second legal challenge to permission for an Apple data centre in Co Galway is to be fast-tracked in the Commercial Court. In judicial review proceedings, Brian McDonagh is challenging An Bord Pleanála’s decision last August to allow Apple build the data centre, one of eight such proposed developments at Toberroe, Palmerstown, Derrydonnell and Athenry. Among various claims, Mr McDonagh alleges the decision breaches EU directives on forestry. On Monday, lawyers for Apple Distribution International, a notice party to the case as proposed developer of the data centre, applied to have the action admitted to the Commercial Court. Mr McDonagh opposed the transfer application on grounds including the timescales provided for would not allow him enough time to get documentats from the EU necessary for his case. Representing himself, Mr McDonagh, Unit 1, Ballymount Cross Business Park, Dublin, said he “did not oppose Apple coming to Athenry” but wanted to ensure compliance witbh “proper planning procedures”. Media publicity He said he wanted the case heard either by the High Court or in Europe. He had been subjected to adverse media publicity since bringing his action, he added. Rory Mulcahy SC, for Apple, said Mr McDonagh was previously refused permission by the High Court to include arguments about an alleged breach of the forestry directive in his action but has appealed that ruling to the Court of Appeal. Mr McDonagh had made no submissions to Galway County Council in respect of the original planning application and nor had he appealed to the board, Mr Mulcahy said. Mr McDonagh “only came on the field after the board made its decision”. Mr Justice Brian McGovern said he was satisfied the case was appropriate for admission to the list. Last week, a separate action by Sinéad Fitzpatrick and Allan Daly challenging An Bord Pleanála’s permission was admitted to the Commercial Court. Both cases will be heard in March. ADVERTISEMENT Environmental impact Ms Fitzpatrick and Mr Daly, of Lisheenkyle, Athenry, which is close to the proposed centre, claim the permission is invalid on grounds including the board failed to carry out a proper environmental impact assessment of the development. In seeking to have the cases fast-tracked, Apple argued the proposed centre is a critical piece of infrastructure required to support the worldwide demand for global storage necessary to cater for rapid expansion in wireless electronic communication, entertainment and work. Apple says it needs the centre to deal with the exponential growth in demand for data processing and storage. The cost of the overall proposed plan to build eight data centres in Athenry is some €850 million. If given the go-ahead, the development will create hundreds of jobs directly and indirectly, the company said.       Topics: Allan Daly Aodhan O Faolain Brian Mcdonagh Justice Brian Mcgovern Sinead Fitzpatrick An Bord Pleanála Court Of Appeal High Court Apple Athenry Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Commercial Property Pick-up in pub market as consumer confidence returns Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of International 1:28 RWC 2023: Ireland ready to stage a tournament ‘like no other’ Business Sensors help police curb gang violence in Cape Town Sponsored World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Three sees revenues jump in first full reporting year since O2 buyout 17:41 UK insurer Aviva appoints John Quinlan as new CEO in Ireland 17:37 Pick-up in pub market as consumer confidence returns 17:35 Samsung to buy car tech company Harman for $8bn 17:16 Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway backs big US airlines 17:07 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today Much has not been disclosed officially yet on Apple's iPad Pro roster since Apple Inc. has announced its other flagship variants such the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus along with the redesigned MacBook Pro in October. And while most are purely coming from a speculated standpoint, the rumors about the upcoming iPad Pro model 9 (or models) are nevertheless still worth a try — but not until as of late. According to Barclays Research analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O'Malley and Jerry Zhang, Apple is set to unveil three new iPad Pro variants on March 2017. The launching will reportedly include a refreshed 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch versions along with the much-awaited, bezel-free 10.9-inch model.   Furthermore, MacRumors has shared via a research note that the analysts have revealed that the 10.9-inch version's borderless design will enable the device to be similar to the physical size of the current-generation 9.7-inch iPad Pro model. An indication that the display will have an edge-to-edge design, eliminating the home button. The speculations about the arrival of new iPad Pro models have also surfaced previously with an apparent difference on the models' sizes. Noted KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had stressed months ago that a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro will be launched in 2017. Moreover, Mac Otakara, an established Japanese website, has shared that a new 10.1-inch iPad Pro is slated to be revealed in early 2017. Meanwhile, the analysts from Barclays, along with Kuo, have revealed that the purported 9.7-inch iPad Pro model would be priced at a low price, akin to its 7.9-inch iPad Mini variant. According to the analysts, the Cupertino-based firm will extend the production and marketing of the current iPad Mini 4 which was launched in 2015.  All the upcoming iPad Pro models will be equipped with quad microphones and will still be sporting the 3.5mm headphone ports.  Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Go to the Home Page Top News Christians unhappy as Colorado approves legalization of assisted suicide Professor admits misquoting Christian governor in Jakarta after blasphemy protests turn violent ISIS separates families by abducting newborn babies, virgin girls, says Catholic priest Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

It has been over a month since Apple launched its latest flagship smartphones – the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. A recent report suggested that the latest smartphone has become the best selling device in US within a month’s time. Meanwhile, there are already speculations being made regarding the company’s future device. With next year’s launch, Apple will be celebrating its tenth-year anniversary and in order to make this occasion special, the company is expected to make some major changes. Latest report from Barclays’ analysts Blayne Curtis and Christopher Hemmelgarn suggests that the supposed iPhone 8 will feature a bezel-less design with curved edges on all sides. The analysts claim that the iPhone 8 models will come in the same sizes and that the displays of the smartphone will increase to 5 and 5.9-inches, thanks to the bezel-less design technology. The analysts further stressed on Apple’s shift to OLED display panels which are said to be more battery-efficient and offer a better colour accuracy. The OLED display panels are also reported to allow the iPhone 8 screen to bend at the edges thereby, introducing an all-new, curved-edge design on the sides of the future iPhone. The analysts further suggested that Apple’s 3D Touch will witness a new ‘film-based solution.’ There have been numerous leaks regarding the iPhone 8 in the past. One of them even pointed towards how the iPhone 8 will come with an advanced wireless charging technology that will allow users to charge their devices even from 15ft of distance.

Comments CIO | Nov 14, 2016 8:00 AM PT Like this article? thumbsup +1 thumbsdown RELATED TOPICS Mobile MacBooks Hardware Comments Apple’s recent announcement of new MacBook Pros with a Touch Bar caught the attention of many Mac users who have been waiting a long time to upgrade their laptops. Potential buyers of these new MacBook Pros have been wondering if the new Touch Bar feature is worth the money Apple is asking for the new computers. That's a very valid concern considering that the MacBook Pros with Touch Bar start at $1799 for the 13-inch model and $2399 for the 15-inch model, and go for $1999 for the higher-end 13-inch model and a whopping $2799 for the higher-end 15-inch version. Fortunately, reviews have started to come out of the MacBook Pros with Touch Bar and I’ve compiled a helpful roundup to assist you in making your buying decision. The Verge: A touch of the future Jacob Kastrenakes at The Verge noted that the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is a taste of the future but that that future isn’t quite here yet: I may come off sounding quite critical of the new MacBook Pro, but the truth is that I really do like it. The hardware is incredible, macOS is a joy to use, and I don’t want to give up this screen and keyboard. It’s a fantastic laptop on build alone. But everywhere I look, it feels like this incarnation of the MacBook Pro is shooting for a future it can’t quite reach. One where it can be impressively thin and powerful enough for the pros. Where it can be super light and have all-day battery life. Where its ports and keyboard morph and adapt perfectly to the needs of every user. I have little doubt that in a couple years, the technology Apple has been waiting for will arrive and this vision, or something closer to it, will be complete. Apple just released this machine too soon, or was too aggressive in the decisions it made. That future is almost certainly out there. But it’s not in this machine. Not yet. More at The Verge Ars Technica: Touch Bar, Touch ID, dedicated GPUs, more ports, and a whole lot more Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica indicated that the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has much to offer certain users but that it comes with a high price tag: If you’ve got a MacBook Pro that you bought in 2012 or earlier and if you’re convinced of the potential utility and novelty of the Touch Bar, these 2016 MacBook Pros were just about worth the wait. Replace a four- or five-year-old laptop with one of these and you’ll get a great new design, a respectable performance boost, a nice screen, the single most versatile port you can get in any computer, and a new input device that tries to combine the good stuff about PC touchscreens (fast response, malleable button layouts) while avoiding the bad stuff about PC touchscreens (adapting a mouse-and-keyboard driven operating system to finger input, blocking the screen by poking at it with your hand). The main problem at this point isn’t that the Touch Bar is a bad idea, but that these laptops cost a whole bunch of money. Great, premium PC laptops are available for half this price, even if Apple still maintains an edge when it comes to graphics and SSD speeds. It really feels like the Touch Bar needs to be included in the £1,450 model, and that versions of the new designs without Touch Bars should be the entry level systems—right now, Apple’s entry-level Mac laptops were all released in mid 2015, and that’s only going to get more embarrassing as time moves on. The other problem, and one that resonates for the rest of the PC industry, is that if you bought a MacBook Pro in 2013 or later there’s really very little reason to consider a new MacBook Pro. Intel’s processors deliver much better battery life than they used to, but the company’s new CPU architectures barely push performance forward and there are ever-wider gaps between new releases as it gets more difficult to move to better manufacturing processes. I like these laptops a lot. I bought one to replace my 2013 MacBook Air, which still performs basically fine but doesn’t have the sharp screen or design chops of the PC laptops that have come out in the last two-or-so years. But the rest of the Mac lineup—all of the desktops and the more affordable laptops—are still stuck in the past. It feels like Apple might have a comprehensive vision for the future of its computers, but that it’s only ready to show us a small, expensive peek right now. The sooner the Touch Bar and USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 can spread across the entire lineup and end this awkward transitional phase, the better. The good Nice new designs that are thinner and lighter than their predecessors. Four Thunderbolt 3 ports each, two on each side—this is super convenient for charging, especially. Low-travel keyboard still isn't for everyone, but it's a marked improvement over the first-generation version in the MacBook. Good battery life. Industry-leading storage performance. Non-terrible laptop speakers. 1.3Gbps Wi-Fi, unlike the £1,450 version. The bad 13-inch Touch Bar model doesn't have the same battery life as the non-Touch Bar model. Extremely limited repairability and upgradeability. Intel's CPU speed increases in the last few years have been discouraging. Need for dongles will be inconvenient, especially at first. The ugly Expensive, even for Macs. More at Ars Technica Engadget: A step forward and a step back Dana Wollman at Engadget found that the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar wasn’t quite what she wanted, and that she missed her function keys: I’m one of many Mac owners out there who has been waiting for Apple to upgrade the MacBook Pro line. Now that it finally has, I find the new laptop isn’t quite what I wanted. For me, the ideal MacBook Pro is actually a mashup between this and last year’s model. Let me keep my full-size USB ports, and my function keys, and my longer battery life, but stick with this thinner and lighter design. Stick with this improved display, Touch ID sensor, fast disk performance and more robust audio quality. For me, this is both a step forward and a step backward. I’m sure Apple disagrees, and not just because its job is to sell lots of computers. Apple seems to earnestly believe it knows how people should be getting work done – so much so that it has the chutzpah to ask loyal customers to unlearn old habits. Get used to using dongles to attach your existing accessories. Say goodbye to your memory card slot, creatives. Resign yourself to adjusting the brightness or volume with taps and swipes, instead of a simple button press. Accept the risk that your existing Thunderbolt 3 peripherals might not work. As I said, there’s ultimately a lot to like about the new MacBook Pro. But it’s designed for someone who I’m not sure exists outside Apple’s fantasies of how professionals use computers. The MacBook Pro I want to see is built around real people’s work habits. I still recommend it, and I imagine many of you who have been waiting patiently will indeed buy this. But I’d enjoy it more if it were designed for people like us. More at Engadget Six Colors: A keyboard chameleon Jason Snell at Six Colors was initially skeptical about the Touch Bar in the new MacBook Pro but warmed up to it after using it for a while: I was skeptical of the Touch Bar when it was first rumored, but it’s obvious that Apple has taken great care in refining the concept to focus it on being a contextual extension of the keyboard rather than a very squat iPad. Apple’s implementation of the Touch Bar interface in its apps vary from incredibly detailed to more generic, but I expect that over the next year or two we’ll all learn more about what makes an effective Touch Bar interface and what doesn’t. My gut feeling is that some of the more ambitious, complex interfaces will prove to be less useful than quick shortcuts, and that customization will be invaluable. But we won’t know until we try. If the Touch ID sensor is a little less exciting, that’s because it’s so familiar from iOS that it doesn’t seem that unusual to encounter it on the Mac. And I do like reducing the number of times I need to type in my password. I’m also happy that this is brand-new Apple hardware that’s immediately accessible by third-party software developers, which should limit the really awkward period where early adopters rush to a new feature only to find it supported by Apple but with no hope for more until the next year’s OS update. So who says there’s nothing new under the sun? Here’s a new dimension added to the Mac, with a debt owed to iOS, but undeniably its own approach. It never forgets it’s a companion to the keyboard and trackpad, but adds more flexibility than a static keyboard ever could. I’m looking forward to seeing how it evolves—and I have to admit, I kind of want one to place above the top row of my own external Mac keyboard now. I never felt that way about function keys. More at Six Colors TechCrunch: The Touch Bar is a nice bonus Brian Heater at TechCrunch liked the Touch Bar but noted that the spec bump in the new MacBook Pro was the biggest draw for him: The less celebrated spec bumps are what make the new Pro a worthy upgrade, particularly for those who, like me, have been suffering through their old system’s death rattles (or fan buzzing, at least), waiting for a significant update from the company. Better processors, more storage, a brighter display and better speakers are all wrapped up in a sleeker and lighter package than before. The Touch Bar feels like a nice bonus for the time being. It’s a compelling new input device that has the potential to alter the way we interact with applications on a laptop. In this early stage, it’s a cool feature that further distinguishes the Pro from other similarly spec-ed laptops, proving most useful in the consumption and creation of media like video, audio and images — all part of the creative professional demographic that has long served as one of the company’s core user bases. As Apple and third-party developers continue to play around with the form, its usefulness will only continue to grow. And perhaps it won’t be too long before we start seeing desktop applications built with the Touch Bar in mind, rather than adding such functionality in hindsight. The addition of Touch ID, however, has some immediately welcome functionality, including more secure startups and purchasing. And, as ever, the new MacBook Pro doesn’t come cheap, with a starting price of $1,799 (for the 13-inch Touch Bar version) all the way up through the fully packed model that goes well north of $4K. But let’s be honest, users have never bought Macs because of their rock-bottom prices. For those who have been holding out on buying a new MacBook, the time is right, with an upgrade that should be sufficiently future-proof to take on the next few years — or however long it takes for the next major upgrade. Hopefully you’ve been saving up in the meantime.

Nov 14, 2016 07:43 AM EST | By Godswarrior010 email print Sign Up for GamenGuide's Newsletter and never miss out on our most popular stories. HP is announcing new notebooks at CES 2016, and its star is undoubtedly the EliteBook Folio G1. It’s a super-slim Windows laptop with a 4K touchscreen display that’s going to be in stores this March. (Photo: The Verge/YouTube) The HP EliteBook Folio G1 breaks the conventional mold of mobile laptops and brings many things in store for HP. The notebook unveiled in a CES conference just recently was patterned similarly to Apple's 12- inch MacBook. It also looks sleek and stylish but can it compete with the long-standing reputation of the MacBook Pro? Here's what we know. HP Elitebook Folio G1 Vs. MacBook Pro 2016: Specs HP EliteBook Folio G1 maybe a new kid on the block but it is a solid laptop that is thinner than the MacBook and is built with a silver aluminum chassis. It is slightly heavier than Apple's notebook but is lighter than some of the laptops within its range. Unlike MacBook Pro 2016's Intel Core i5 processor, HP is run by the latest Intel Core i7. The Apple notebook and Elitebook both has an 8 GB memory upgradeable to 16GB. The MacBook Pro 2016 comes along with an Intel Iris Graphics 540, 2,560 x 1,600 Retina display, 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports, a 3.55mm headphone jack and 256GB PCle SSD. HP Elitebook Folio on the other hand boasts of a 2,840 x 2,160 4k Touchscreen display, 2 USB-C Ports, 256GB PCle SSD, 8GB RAM and a full-HD non-touch display. As for the laptop's battery life, HP Elitebook Folio G1 lasts for seven hours while the MacBook Pro 2016 can be used for up to ten hours prior to charging. HP Elitebook Folio G1 Vs. MacBook Pro 2016: Price The Apple Notebook starts at the price of $1,799 while the lowest-end model of HP Elitebook Folio only comes in at $999. The HP Elitebook has 128GB of storage and a 1,920 X 1,080 pixel resolution non-touch display while MacBook has a bigger storage space of 256GB storage with 2,500 x 1,600 pixel resolution non-touch display.   HP Elitebook Folio G1 Vs. MacBook Pro 2016: The Verdict Like the MacBook Pro 2016, HP Elitebook uses Intel's latest Core M-series processors. Both the HP Elitebook Folio G1 and MacBook Pro 2016 are good choices for people looking for a slim, light, portable and powerful device. The two laptops have amazing specs and features that can lure anyone in. The only difference would be their price. HP Elitebook Folio is for those who want an outstanding laptop at an economical price while the MacBook Pro 2016 is for people can afford a superior laptop at a premium price. HP Elitebook Folio G1 is expected to be released on March 2017 while the MacBook Pro 2016 is readily available in Apple stores all over the world.        TagsHP Elitebook Folio G1, MacBook Pro 2016 You May Like These Related Articles 'HTC 10' Latest News & Update: Android 7.0 Nougat Update Will Be Available Soon?

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases Blackbaud Speeds the Pace of Giving with Apple Pay Blackbaud Merchant Services is an end-to-end payment processing solution designed exclusively for nonprofits. The addition of Apple Pay as a new checkout option within Blackbaud’s solution allows nonprofits to offer their donors an easy and secure way to pay — all within the secure, simple and affordable donation processing system they have come to rely on from Blackbaud.  “At Blackbaud, we’re innovating to power every moment that helps nonprofits better understand and engage supporters,” said Kevin McDearis, chief products officer at Blackbaud. “This also means building solutions that create frictionless, integrated and secure experiences across devices and platforms to support the work of philanthropy—from cultivation, to fundraising, donation processing and more. Integrating Apple Pay into our digital payments solution is a great example of how we’re working to help nonprofits provide their donors with a modern, agile checkout experience that mirrors the convenience and mobility they enjoy as consumers.”  Many well-known charities using Blackbaud Merchant Services are already live today with Apple Pay, including American Heart Association, Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA), Feeding America, The Nature Conservancy, WNET and World Wildlife Fund (WWF).  “Donor behavior is constantly changing and we want to be able to quickly respond to those changes. Apple Pay lets Feeding America offer our donors a checkout experience that is as easy and fast as the best e-commerce experiences,” said Liz Nielsen, senior vice president of Direct Marketing & Digital Engagement at Feeding America. “It is critical that we stay on the front-end of mobile technology if we want to continue to grow support for Feeding America and ultimately get more food to more people facing hunger in our country.” Nonprofits have signaled that offering Apple Pay as an option for donors will increase conversion rates from mobile and website visitors, simplify the donation process and reduce the information required for donors to give; potentially even increasing donation frequency as a result.  “We are excited to be among the first nonprofit organizations to offer the ability to donate with Apple Pay,” said Michael Osso, president and CEO of Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America. “CCFA has always been on the forefront of technology to ensure a smooth donor experience. Offering fast and convenient technology that enhances our ability to raise crucial funds, especially during the end-of-year giving season, will help us deliver on our mission to improve the lives of patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.” David Glass, senior director of online marketing for World Wildlife Fund added, “Giving donors new and simple ways to contribute to World Wildlife Fund’s mission to protect the future of nature is critical to our work.” Apple Pay is available today for organizations using Blackbaud Merchant Services to process donations in Luminate Online™. In 2017, Blackbaud will expand Apple Pay functionality across the portfolio. For more information, visit www.blackbaud.com/apple-pay.

Mossberg: New MacBook Pro is a fast, slim tweener The Verge 1 day ago Walt Mossberg © Provided by The Verge Apple is realigning its familiar laptop line, dramatically reshaping and in some ways merging the favorite options for both heavy-duty “pro” users and everyday customers. And the poster child for this more muddled future is the pricey new MacBook Pro, which appears in stores this week. Apple wants you to focus on the new Pro’s boldest feature, called the Touch Bar. It’s a touch-operated strip of buttons and sliders displayed on a thin screen at the top of the keyboard that changes functions depending on what you’re doing. It injects a bit of iPhone and iPad feel into the Mac. And it’s well worth noting. But, the bigger story here to me is that the Pro, once mainly aimed straight at people who do especially taxing work like professional video editing or serious design, is now being stretched to suit a much larger audience. That’s especially true of the 13-inch model (there’s also a 15-inch variety.) It’s thinner and lighter, and is the only modern, easily portable Mac laptop with both a high-res Retina display and a relatively recent, first-class processor (the 6th generation Core i5 or i7). Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 106.46 +0.75 +0.71% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 58.65 +0.53 +0.91% So, I’ve been testing the 13” Touch Bar-equipped Pro for about 10 days, looking at it from the point of view of mainstream users, not pros. Mainstream Mac lovers must assess whether the Pro, now much thinner and lighter, is a good replacement for the brilliant MacBook Air, which Apple will still sell (starting at $999) but which has apparently been consigned to Cupertino’s special purgatory for products it can’t quite kill yet, but won’t upgrade. The Air was the best laptop ever built, in my opinion, but it was never given a high-res Retina display and has fallen behind in processor technology. And Apple’s other Mac laptop, the much newer 12” MacBook, while beautiful and portable, has a weak processor, a small screen, a single port, and a high base price of $1299. The new Pro definitely trounces my three-year-old MacBook Air in power and screen quality. Running the normal set of apps and browser tabs I use every day, my old Air blasts its fans a lot to keep up. The Touch Bar Pro barely notices. But, I have reservations, and you should too. Many pro users are already vocally complaining about issues particular to them. But, even for mainstream Mac users, there are questions about price, ports, the Touch Bar feature, the keyboard, and — surprisingly, for a Mac — battery life. The Basics This new 13” Pro comes in two flavors. One, the base model, costs less (it starts at $1499) but lacks the Touch Bar and Touch ID, the fingerprint-scanner which can be used to log into the computer and to make online purchases. Instead, it has a standard, but severely squished, row of function keys. The 13” Touch Bar model starts at $1799 but can be configured to more robust specs that bring it to $2899. The 15” model, which isn’t the focus of this review, starts at $2399. Design A big part of what makes the Pro double as a successor to the Air is that it has been made much thinner and lighter, even at the cost of enraging some pros, whose favorite ports may have been ditched because they took up too much room. The new 13” Pro is now 12” thinner than the Air, and weighs the same 3 pounds. It’s as if Apple had shrunk the 13” Air, kept the same screen size, added Retina, upgraded the processor, and added the Touch Bar and Touch ID. The screen is just fabulous, even better than the previous 13” Pro’s Retina display. And way better than the display on the Air. The keyboard isn’t anything like the old Air’s or Pro’s. It’a revised version of the flat, limited-travel keyboard introduced on the MacBook. I hated the first one on the smaller computer, yet I like this second generation just fine. For me, it took no time at all to get used to. It’s clicky and responsive. I suspect you’ll like it. But keyboards are a personal thing, so I urge you to try it in a store before ordering. Battery Life The biggest surprise in my tests was just how inconsistent the Touch Bar Pro’s battery life was. I have tested hundreds of laptops over the years and Macs have almost always excelled at meeting or beating their promised battery lives, both in my longtime battery test regime, and in typical daily use. But the 13” MacBook Pro with Touch Bar wasn’t as reliably consistent as previous Macs. On my rigorous test, which I’ve used for years, the machine actually exceeded Apple’s claim of up to 10 hours of battery life. The test involves setting the screen at 100%, keeping it on and undimmed constantly, playing an endless loop of music, and leaving Wi-Fi on to collect email, tweets and Facebook posts in the background. Result: 11 hours and 38 minutes.   Normally, that battery test is an understatement, because people typically do let the screen go dark periodically and they don’t use it at 100% brightness. But, in this case, after hearing that a colleague was seeing much lower results in general use, I ran a second test with all of Apple’s default energy-saving settings on, the screen at 75% and a perfectly normal (for me) mix of tasks like web browsing, email, a few short videos, Twitter, Facebook, some light writing, and Slack. The Pro died at 8 hours and 22 minutes. To make things worse, Apple’s built-in prediction of how much time the battery had left before dying fluctuated a lot and was mostly wrong (Apple says this is a known problem caused by the fact that modern processors can power up and down rapidly over a much wider range than in the past, making estimates much more difficult.) So, my best advice is that even a mainstream, non-pro user can’t count on this laptop lasting the promised maximum of 10 hours — even in light to moderate use — let alone the 12 hour maximum a new Air can pull off. And you won’t have an accurate estimate to go by. The Touch Bar © Provided by The Verge The big innovation Apple touts for the new Pro is the Touch Bar. Some regard it as Apple’s lame substitute for the full touch screen it refuses to install in the Mac. But I see it as an effort to replace the keyboard’s ancient function row with a bit of the touch screen simplicity that’s the magic behind iOS. (The function keys, like brightness and volume, are still there, in virtual form, but they temporarily contract when an app displays its customized keys and sliders.) And, yes, there’s still an Escape key, but it’s virtual. For pros, the Touch Bar holds promise as quick way to scroll through photos, or audio wave forms, or video frames, or color choices. The trouble is, that, right now, I don’t think it does much for mainstream users. For instance, in Safari and Photos, it presents thumbnails of open tabs and photos that are so tiny you can barely recognize them. You mainly just scroll through them.   In Safari, a Touch Bar button allows you to quickly open a new tab. Another starts a search. In Mail, you can do things like start a new message, reply to one, or trash one. None of this is very exciting or creative, especially since you have a gigantic, buttery-smooth Trackpad below the keyboard. You can’t even use the Touch Bar in Apple Mail to move to the next unread message or jump back to the top of a list. The single most useful feature of the Touch Bar, in my view, is that it provides a home for predictive text selections and emojis when you are writing in almost any app or web page that permits text entry. This includes Apple’s word processors, Microsoft Office (coming), Facebook, Messages and more. It’s kind of like a wedding of iPhone and Mac text entry, and I like it. (If you don’t you can ignore it.) Alas, although I wrote this whole column on a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I couldn’t use this predictive text feature because I was writing in Google Docs running in a Safari tab. That’s right: while text entry in any number of web pages works with the Touch Bar, it fails with one of the world’s most widely used web apps. An Apple official said: “Google Docs uses a different model of text entry than the standard text entry used by most websites. This affects the functionality of Touch Bar features. We are working with Google to support these features.” I don’t think the Touch Bar is a gimmick, but I don’t think it changes much, at least yet, for everyday Mac users. Luckily, third party app developers can design ways to use it, and users can customize it to some extent. So it may have a more productive future. But, right now, it’s unlikely to improve most users’ life dramatically when working on their laptops. Ports © Provided by The Verge The new MacBook Pros dispense with traditional SD card, USB and long-standard video connectors. Even the genius, breakaway MagSafe power connector is gone. In their place are simply four of the new USB-C ports, which also work with Thunderbolt 3. These connectors are fast, and highly versatile. They can be used for charging, data transfer, video output and more. And they are likely the future. But you’ll need to buy dongles (adapters) to connect them to most monitors, external storage, and flash memory cards. I fully understand the outrage over this switch from people who make their living on current MacBook Pros and legacy peripherals, like monitors or external storage; and from photographers and editors who rely on flash memory cards. Nobody likes dongles or adapters and some brands are unreliable or unsafe. Apple slashed its adapter prices temporarily in the wake of the complaints. But I honestly don’t think this is a big problem for average Mac users, whose main need will likely be a new Mac-to-iPhone cable ($19 from Apple). And I believe that, over time, most peripherals will switch to USB-C, since other companies — not just Apple — are behind it. Price For everyday Mac users, especially, the new Pro is a costly machine. Even the non-Touch Bar model is $500 more than the Air (at $999) and the cheapest Touch Bar edition is $300 more than that. But Apple has always been a premium PC maker, and its new models have often started off at sky-high prices. People forget that, when it debuted in 2008, the MacBook Air with the then-revolutionary, but puny, 64GB solid state drive cost a breathtaking $3100. You can get a terabyte of solid-state storage in the costliest 13” new model, and pay less. If you’re a mainstream Mac lover who isn’t bothered by its limitations, you can save money with the 12” MacBook, or even buy a new Air, if it works well for you. Or, if those MacBook Pro prices are too high for you, and your current Mac is doing OK, you could wait for them to come down next year. Bottom line  The new 13” MacBooks — even the base model without the Touch Bar — are costly. And they may make pros unhappy. But, for everyday Mac lovers — users of the Air or maybe the older low-end Pro — they are now your only thin, modern, option with a full-fledged processor. The Touch Bar has potential, but it’s not magic. The battery isn’t likely to deliver on Apple’s claims. You can’t count on liking the keyboard. But, if you’re a Mac devotee ready to move past the Air — not back to a lower-powered MacBook — this is what Apple is offering. Take it or leave it.

Apple Pay Will Now Let Users Donate To Charitable Organizations Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple Pay Will Now Let Users Donate To Charitable Organizations November 14, 2016 1:47 pm EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk here you go charity charities charitable donations donations apple pay As we head into the holidays, giving to charitable organizations might be something you’re thinking about. You’ll have another option for how you can do that, with Apple announcing today that Apple Pay now supports donations to non-profits. As of today, U.S. users can donate — either online or from a mobile app — to 19 organizations, with another five charities coming on board in the near future, Apple said. “We’re making it incredibly easy to give back with Apple Pay,” said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay. “Websites and apps tell us they see twice as many people actually completing a purchase with Apple Pay than with other payment methods. We think offering such a simple and secure way to support the incredible work nonprofits do will have a significant impact on the communities they serve.” When donating on your phone, you’ll be able to use TouchID to authorize a payment. If you’re sending money on the web, clicking the Apple Pay donate button will send a confirmation request to your iPhone or Apple Watch. It makes sense for charities to accept donations this way, of course, considering how much time millennials spend with their eyes glued to their technological devices. If they don’t have to put down their phones to donate, perhaps they’ll be more willing to give. Non-profits that now have Apple Pay support: • American Red Cross • American Heart Association • charity: water • Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals • COPD Foundation • Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) • Doctors Without Borders • Feeding America • GlobalGiving • International Rescue Committee • (RED) • St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital • Save the Children • The Nature Conservancy • The Water Project • UNICEF • WNET • World Vision • WWF (World Wildlife Fund) Nonprofits soon to offer Apple Pay include: • American Cancer Society • CARE • DonorsChoose.org • PBS and its local stations • United Way November 14, 2016 By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk here you go charity charities charitable donations donations apple pay Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related give wisely How To Not Suck… At Charitable Giving Where's The Money?

Late last month, the company launched new MacBook Pros that have an OLED Touch Bar that sort-of adds a touch interface to the Mac by way of replacing the existing function row. Apple exec Phil Schiller explains Apple’s reasoning behind not doing a touch screen Mac (via Backchannel). Apple came to this conclusion by testing if touch screens made sense on the Mac. “Our instincts were that it didn’t, but, what the heck, we could be wrong—so our teams worked on that for a number of times over the years,” says Schiller. “We’ve absolutely come away with the belief that it isn’t the right thing to do. Our instincts were correct.” While some reviewers question the usability of the Touch Bar, Schiller is confident that it’s the best approach on a notebook. “Watch, iPhone, iPad, Macbook, iMac,” he said. “They really are all computers. Each one is offering customers something unique and each one is made with a simple form that perhaps is eternal. People in the industry may question them — we don’t, for some very simple reasons.” What this translates to is you shouldn’t be expecting an iPad/MacBook hybrid any time soon, countering Microsoft’s Surface line of products. This is mostly because Apple wants a unified experience across its notebooks and desktops. “We think of the whole platform,” he says. “If we were to do Multi-Touch on the screen of the notebook, that wouldn’t be enough — then the desktop wouldn’t work that way.” And touch on the desktop, he says, would be a disaster. Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd.” It’s pretty clear that you shouldn’t expect a Touch Bar on iOS devices any time soon. Rather, expect iPads to continue excelling down the path they already are while getting more dynamic (like Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard) support. Though Schiller’s careful choice of words does suggest that iMacs will be seeing the Touch Bar in the future. If MacBooks have it, then iMacs, Mac minis and Mac Pros will be getting them soon, right?

Gray Skies Distillery, at 700 Ottawa Ave. NW, will begin selling its Michigan Single Malt Whiskey and Apple Brandy this week. The spirits will be on sale Tuesday and can be pre-ordered on the company’s website. Both spirits are being released in packages for Cocktail Week GR. A package includes a bottle of liquor, four slate coasters and a set of tasting glasses. The spirits are the result of the distiller's 500-gallon batch process, using whole Michigan grains that are milled into flour on site, said Steve Vander Pol, co-owner, Gray Skies Distillery. Whiskey Gray Skies started the process for the Scotch-style whiskey with malted barley from Pilot Malt House, and the distillery said it is the first to use the malt house’s Peanut Butter Toast malt. The whiskey is aged six months in 15-gallon barrels to "smooth the edges but not cause the unique grain flavors to recede,” said Brandon Voorhees, co-owner, Gray Skies Distillery. The company's Cocktail Week GR package with the whiskey is $60. Brandy Normally made with a base of hard apple cider from cider yeast, Gray Skies' Apple Brandy starts with rum, yeast-fermented apples. “Many distilleries partner with a hard cider company and bring in someone else’s hard cider to distill,” Voorhees said. “We wanted to have full control over the flavors of the finished product and fermented the apple juice ourselves.”  The base cider was distilled twice, then aged in rye whiskey barrels. The company's Cocktail Week GR package with the brandy is $55. Gray Skies Gray Skies Distillery opened its distillery and tasting room this spring. The company has grown its lineup from two spirits to seven, including varieties of gin, vodka, whiskey and rum.  Pat Evans Pat Evans is a Grand Rapids Business Journal staff reporter who covers real estate, construction, architecture and design, retail, beverages, technology and county government.

Yesterday AAPL: 105.71 -2.72 RIP Videos app as Apple replaces it with more capable TV in iOS 10 beta 3 Zac Hall - 24 hours ago @apollozac TV iOS 10.2 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple appears to be retiring the built-in Videos app on iOS in favor of the new TV app coming next month. The behavior is introduced with today’s iOS 10.2 beta 3; iOS 10.2 beta 2 included both apps separately. Apple could still change this behavior in a future version of iOS 10.2, although there isn’t much need for both apps for most users. The change should only be present for iOS 10.2 users in the United States as Apple’s new TV app won’t be available outside of the US at launch. Videos does include some features like Home Sharing that do not yet appear to be available in TV. It’s also unclear how TV will handle home videos which suggest Videos could stick around in future betas. For now, Videos remains available to re-install from the App Store like Apple’s other built-in apps that can be hidden which may be the answer for users looking for these specific features. To be clear, the new behavior going forward appears to be that Videos will be hidden by default in the United States (and where TV becomes available) with users needing to manually enable it going forward. It also likely means the (rather barebones) app won’t receive any major features going forward as attention moves to the TV app. Aside from Home Sharing, the new TV app includes features like loading viewing movies and TV shows purchased from the iTunes Store, synced from iTunes, and via iCloud. TV also includes curated movies and TV shows from various services like HBO, Hulu, Starz, Showtime, and The CW. Apple’s TV app will also work with the upcoming single sign-on feature for jumping to paid video apps from channels like Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, and more. Apple’s TV app isn’t fully functional just yet, however, as iOS 10.2 is still in beta. Users in the US can find TV on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch with iOS 10.2 beta. The new TV app will also be available on the Apple TV next month. For now, Videos is no longer available on iOS in the United States with TV replacing it including in the Settings app. Guides TV View THe Guide iOS 10.2 View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Trending in Apple Poll: What is your view of the all-USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro? Yesterday AAPL: 105.71 -2.72 You can now make donations to nonprofit organizations with Apple Pay Zac Hall - 23 hours ago @apollozac Apple Pay View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple Pay is now a payment option when making online donations to several nonprofit organizations. Apple announced that its mobile payment service can be used to donate to over a dozen nonprofits starting today with at least five more groups joining the list soon. “We’re making it incredibly easy to give back with Apple Pay,” said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay. “Websites and apps tell us they see twice as many people actually completing a purchase with Apple Pay than with other payment methods. We think offering such a simple and secure way to support the incredible work nonprofits do will have a significant impact on the communities they serve.” Apple Pay lets you make payments online securely using tokenization rather than your actual credit card number. Apple Pay on the web is possible for the compatible nonprofit organizations thanks to the new feature joining iOS 10 and macOS Sierra in September. There are some limitations to using Apple Pay for donations for some nonprofits currently. For example, Apple Pay does not support the ability to make your donation reoccurring every month for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. However, the convenience of using Apple Pay is greatly superior (and more secure) than manually entering credit card information so it should encourage one-off donations. Other nonprofits including ‘charity: water’ do allow for monthly donations at checkout so it’s not specifically an Apple Pay limitation as it’s possible. Apple has also partnered with several retailers to promote Apple Pay on the web with special holiday promotions when using the mobile payment service to checkout online. The feature works on iPhone and iPad (where previously specific apps were required to be installed) and on the Mac. Apple’s new MacBook Pros with Touch ID let you use Apple Pay without a second device to authenticate. Apple says these groups currently support donations using Apple Pay: American Red Cross American Heart Association charity: water Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals COPD Foundation Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) Doctors without Borders Feeding America GlobalGiving International Rescue Committee (RED) St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital Save the Children The Nature Conservancy The Water Project UNICEF WNET World Vision WWF (World Wildlife Fund) These five are coming soon: American Cancer Society CARE DonorsChoose.org PBS and its local stations United Way Apple Pay on the web requires the latest software update and Safari. Find out how to use Apple Pay on the web here. Updated to note that monthly donations are possible for some nonprofits.

Blackbaud Nov 14, 2016, 13:00 ET Share this article CHARLESTON, S.C., Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Blackbaud, Inc. (NASDAQ: BLKB), the world's leading cloud software company powering social good, announced today it has added Apple Pay® to Blackbaud Merchant Services™ so its nonprofit customers can offer donors an easy, secure and private option for digital checkout, just in time for holiday giving.  This news comes in conjunction with Apple's announcement that Apple Pay now supports charitable donations, and now Blackbaud has made Apple Pay available as part of its integrated digital payments solution, which already services tens of millions of users for charitable giving.  Blackbaud Merchant Services is an end-to-end payment processing solution designed exclusively for nonprofits. The addition of Apple Pay as a new checkout option within Blackbaud's solution allows nonprofits to offer their donors an easy and secure way to pay -- all within the secure, simple and affordable donation processing system they have come to rely on from Blackbaud.  "At Blackbaud, we're innovating to power every moment that helps nonprofits better understand and engage supporters," said Kevin McDearis, chief products officer at Blackbaud. "This also means building solutions that create frictionless, integrated and secure experiences across devices and platforms to support the work of philanthropy—from cultivation, to fundraising, donation processing and more. Integrating Apple Pay into our digital payments solution is a great example of how we're working to help nonprofits provide their donors with a modern, agile checkout experience that mirrors the convenience and mobility they enjoy as consumers."  Many well-known charities using Blackbaud Merchant Services are already live today with Apple Pay, including American Heart Association, Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA), Feeding America, The Nature Conservancy, WNET and World Wildlife Fund (WWF).  "Donor behavior is constantly changing and we want to be able to quickly respond to those changes. Apple Pay lets Feeding America offer our donors a checkout experience that is as easy and fast as the best e-commerce experiences," said Liz Nielsen, senior vice president of Direct Marketing & Digital Engagement at Feeding America. "It is critical that we stay on the front-end of mobile technology if we want to continue to grow support for Feeding America and ultimately get more food to more people facing hunger in our country." Nonprofits have signaled that offering Apple Pay as an option for donors will increase conversion rates from mobile and website visitors, simplify the donation process and reduce the information required for donors to give; potentially even increasing donation frequency as a result.  "We are excited to be among the first nonprofit organizations to offer the ability to donate with Apple Pay," said Michael Osso, president and CEO of Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America. "CCFA has always been on the forefront of technology to ensure a smooth donor experience. Offering fast and convenient technology that enhances our ability to raise crucial funds, especially during the end-of-year giving season, will help us deliver on our mission to improve the lives of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis." David Glass, senior director of online marketing for World Wildlife Fund added, "Giving donors new and simple ways to contribute to World Wildlife Fund's mission to protect the future of nature is critical to our work." Apple Pay is available today for organizations using Blackbaud Merchant Services to process donations in Luminate Online™. In 2017, Blackbaud will expand Apple Pay functionality across the portfolio.

Perhaps more interestingly, the switch to AMD provides expanded external display support that desktop users have patiently waited for. As Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica explains, AMD's Polaris-based Radeon Pro 450, Radeon Pro 455, and built-to-order Radeon Pro 460 GPUs in the new 15-inch MacBook Pro support up to six displays, whereas Intel's integrated GPUs affixed to the logic board can drive a total of three displays. The expanded support enables the new MacBook Pro to drive two of Apple and LG's new UltraFine 5K displays at 60Hz simultaneously. Intel's GPUs can't because, due to bandwidth limitations of the DisplayPort 1.2 spec, the two 5K displays technically function as four displays. This method is known as Multi-Stream Transport (MST). When you hook one of LG's 5K monitors to one of the new MacBook Pros, what you're actually seeing on the screen is two pictures stitched together to make a single seamless image. This is because the version of the DisplayPort spec supported by Intel's GPUs and almost all monitors these days—version 1.2—doesn't have enough bandwidth to drive a 5K display at 60Hz all by itself. […] Apple is actually pushing two DisplayPort 1.2 streams to the monitor over the single Thunderbolt 3 cable. There’s nothing wrong with this method, except that it cuts down on the number of external displays your computer can support. Intel’s integrated GPUs can drive a total of three displays, but you use up two of those three streams to drive one 5K monitor and one of them to drive the laptop’s internal display. AMD’s GPUs support up to six displays, so you can use two of those connections for one 5K monitor, two of them for the other 5K monitor, one for the laptop’s internal display, and still have one left over for yet another monitor if you really wanted to use one.Apple could have used Nvidia's faster Pascal-based GPUs, which support DisplayPort 1.3, but Thunderbolt 3 and most monitors do not support the higher-bandwidth spec yet. In the meantime, Nvidia's GPUs can only drive up to three displays beyond the main MacBook Pro screen — not enough for dual 5K displays over MST. Apple will have more flexibility again when DisplayPort 1.3 becomes more common. Those future laptops will be able to drive two 5K screens plus a laptop’s internal screen using just three DisplayPort streams instead of five. For now, though, if pushing two high-end 5K screens at once was a design goal for Apple, AMD was the only way to go.In terms of performance improvements, Cunningham benchmarked the mid-range 2.7GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro with the Radeon Pro 455 graphics chip to determine just how much faster the notebook truly is compared to the 2016 12-inch MacBook and older MacBook Pros released over the past few years. He found the Radeon Pro 455 to be a "significant boost" over the built-to-order dedicated GPUs available in the 2012-2015 MacBook Pro models, namely the Nvidia GeForce GTX 650M, Nvidia GeForce GTX 750M, and AMD Radeon R9 M370X respectively, but said the new MacBook Pro remains unsuitable for high-end gaming and VR. Is it disappointing that Apple didn’t decide to push the envelope a little more? Sure. Is it too bad that performance and power efficiency were apparently sacrificed in the name of external display support? Yes. Are these midrange GPUs in any way inconsistent with any MacBook Pro released in the last decade? No.Apple officially says the 15-inch MacBook Pro offers up to 130% faster graphics performance, and up to 2.5x more computing power per watt, compared to the previous-generation 15-inch MacBook Pro, but those stats are based on the built-to-order Radeon Pro 460 chip that costs between $100 and $200 extra.

Wouldn't Iris Pro graphics be just as fast, if not faster than a Radeon Pro 450 then? Makes me wonder why they'd waste money/battery life on discrete graphics if they don't really provide anything on the base model. Rating: 13 Votes keysofanxiety 23 hours ago at 11:11 am Sorry, I didn't realize that for you a 17" 0.88" thick 4k computer weighing 7.8 pounds was only portable on wheels for you. I thought it was a pretty light and sleek machine for a 17" when I saw it. http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-systems/razer-blade-pro Yeah, that already weighs more than the 2011 17" MBP (6.6 pounds). Let alone thinness and battery life. Great argument. Let me be blunt, since a lot of people really don't understand this: historically, Apple portables have prioritised thinness, battery life, design, performance, and specs. In that order. Nothing is new. Nothing has changed. What you have quoted is the complete antithesis of what an Apple portable is. Windows laptops have always had better specs. Better CPUs, better GPUs, more RAM, bigger screens — this isn't anything new. For what the new rMBP is, which is the best spec/weight/thinness compromise, it again is unmatched in the industry. Part of the trouble with the naysayers is that they completely ignore history. It doesn't much help them if they want to sound like they know what they're talking about. Rating: 13 Votes keysofanxiety 23 hours ago at 10:55 am Just for a little perspective, the GTX 1080 does T-Rex at 1190fps (windows and DirectX). How is that perspective? It's a desktop GPU.

Rating: 12 Votes theitsage 21 hours ago at 01:17 pm "Up to 2.5x more computing power per watt" is the carefully chosen marketing bs to disguise the overall GPU performance was not a significant improvement.

Apple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now. The American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon.

Halfway through November, AirPods still aren’t in stores, and Apple still hasn’t announced a new shipping date. On October 26, around the time the AirPods were supposed to be hitting stores, an Apple rep told Tech Crunch that “we don’t believe in shipping a product before it’s ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.” As Pitchfork notes, that was the last official update from Apple, though last week MacRumors reported that a note from investment bank Barclays indicates that the Pods are set to begin production in early December. From MacRumours: Barclays said the initial production run will be “fairly small,” totaling between 10 million and 15 million AirPods to start. Depending on demand, the limited supply could result in a scenario where AirPods stock is quickly depleted upon launch, resulting in extended shipping estimates akin to a new iPhone launch. If the Barclays note is true, then the earliest the easily losable $159 cordless headphones could hit stores is just before the holidays, though early January 2017 is more likely.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | November 6, 2016 -- 22:39 GMT (14:39 PST) | Topic: PCs No Apple iPad deals in the Staples Black Friday ad this year. As Black Friday draws within three weeks, the ad leaks are starting to pick up in pace. For tech buyers, the Staples Black Friday ad leak may be the biggest so far, and it provides further evidence of an early trend: It's the latest retailer not to promote any deals on that former Black Friday stalwart -- Apple's iPad tablet. Part of that is due to Apple's stinginess on discounts in general, and part is due to the fading appetite of consumers for new tablets. Nevertheless, Staples still has the most tablet deals we've seen from a Black Friday ad this year, including matching BJ's Wholesale with a $33.33 special on the Amazon Fire 7-inch tablet. It goes one better by also having an Amazon Fire HD 8 slate on sale, but this is a case where a little research shows it's not as good a deal as advertised. Staples hypes the sale price of $79.99 as $50, but there are two oddities in the listing. First, Amazon itself lists the price of the Fire HD 8 as $89.99, not the $129.99 regular price Staples is claiming. Even more egregiously, the Fire model shown in the ad has only 8GB of storage, whereas the current base Amazon version comes with 16GB. In other words, Staples is trying to sell an older model with less storage for a mere $10 less than the current version, but touting massive savings. You've been warned. Black Friday 2016 CNET 2016 Holiday Gift Guide Hhgregg ad has 12.9-inch iPad Pro deal Office Depot/OfficeMax ad features $119 Windows 2-in-1 tablet, $169 HP laptop Best Buy ad reveals $100 Windows laptop deal, $125 iPad Air 2, Pro savings Walmart ad features $199 Apple iPad mini 2, $119 Chromebook deals Target ad has iPad Pro for $449, iPad Air 2 for $274 HP ad leaks with PC deals from $250 Staples ad leaks with laptops, tablet deals Costco ad leaks with laptop, desktop, tablet deals Ads for Dell Small Business leak BJ's Wholesale ad features $33.33 Amazon Fire tablet Sam's Club ad leaks with HP laptop, desktop deals Dell's ad leaks with $100 laptop, desktop deals Instead of iPads, the stores with Black Friday ad leaks have thus far listed Samsung Galaxy Tab discounts. Unfortunately for Staples, its specials are undercut by rivals: Its $99.99 price on the 7-inch Tab A is $10 more than in BJ's ad (and BJ's also throws in a 16GB microSD card), while its $129.99 price on the 8-inch Tab A is $10 more than in Costco's ad. Unlike its competitors, however, Staples has a sale on the budget-friendly 7-inch Galaxy Tab E Lite; at $69.99, it's actually $50 off the current price Samsung has on its site. But it's less successful with its $799 Surface Pro 4 pricing, which is $50 more for the same configuration as BJ's (though still $200 less than Microsoft's current price). As with Costco, Staples has a large number of Windows laptop deals for Black Friday, highlighted by a $229.99 HP 15-ay061 with Intel Pentium N3710 CPU, 8GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, and 15.6-inch display. That's $90 less than the current price, not $190 as the ad states. In fact, this is the case with many of the PC sales Staples list: The price currently on its website is already reduced, meaning the savings are less whopping than its ad suggests. While there is no $100 laptop like Dell has for a doorbuster, there are four additional notebook specials for under $300: The Dell Inspiron I5555-0012 (AMD A8 processor, 6GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, 15.6-inch display) for $269.99; a Dell Inspiron (Pentium CPU, 4GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, 11.6-inch display) for $299.99, the HP 15-ay065 (Core i3-5005U, 6GB of RAM, 1TB hard drive, 15.6-inch display) for $299.99, and the Lenovo IdeaPad 100 (also Core i3-5005U, 4GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, 15.6-inch display) for $299.99. In addition to those sales, there are 11 further laptop deals that Staples is advertising: $349.99 -- Dell Inspiron i5559-1350SLV (Core i3/6GB/1TB/15.6-inch) $389.99 -- HP Pavilion 14-al062 (Core i5/12GB/1TB/14-inch) $399.99 -- HP 14-al061nr (Core i3/8GB/1TB/14-inch) $399.99 -- HP 17-x061 (Core i3/8GB/1TB/17.3-inch) $449.99 -- Dell Inspiron 13 I5368-2405GRY (Core i3/8GB/500GB/13.3-inch full HD touchscreen) $449.99 -- Dell Inspiron i5559-3349SLVV (Core i5/8GB/128GB SSD/15.6-inch) $479.99 -- HP Pavilion 15-au062 (Core i5/8GB/1TB/15.6-inch-inch) $499.99 -- HP Pavilion 15-au063 (Core i7/12GB/1TB/14-inch) $499.99 -- Lenovo Flex 4 (Core i5/8GB/256GB SSD/14-inch full HD touchscreen) $599.99 -- Lenovo Ideapad 510 (Core i5/8GB/1TB/15.6-inch full HD) $629.99 -- HP Pavilion x360 15-bk010nr (Core i5/8GB/1TB/15.6-inch full HD touchscreen) There are also a half-dozen desktop deals split between towers and all-in-ones. The tower sales start at $279.99 ($70 less than current price) with the HP Slimline 260-p026, which comes with a Core i3-6100T processor, 8GB of RAM, and terabyte hard drive. Jumping up to $399.99 ($180 off) is the HP Pavilion 510-p026 with Core i5-6400T quad-core CPU, 12 gigs of RAM and 1TB hard drive, while the Dell Inspiron 3650 features a faster Core i5-6400 chip, 8GB of RAM, and 1TB of hard drive space for $449.99 -- though note you can get it for that price right now from Staples. As with the towers, the three all-in-one PC specials comprise a pair of HPs and a Dell. The HP 22-b016, with Intel Pentium processor, 4GB of RAM, terabyte hard drive, and 21.5-inch full HD display, is $299.99, or $80 off the current price, while the Pavilion 24-b016 comes a Core i3-6100T, 8 gigs of memory, 1TB hard drive, and 23.8-inch full HD screen for $449.99, or $50 less than the current price. Finally, the Dell Inspiron 5459 also includes a 23.8-inch display, but adds touchscreen capabilities, along with a Core i5-6400T processor for $699.99, or $200 off the regular price.

The third macOS Sierra 10.12.2 beta is available for download through the Apple Developer Center and through the software update mechanism in the Mac App Store, but the Mac App Store appears to be having trouble updating apps for some people at the moment. macOS Sierra 10.12.2 includes new emoji, introducing Unicode 9 characters like clown face, selfie, face palm, fox face, owl, shark, butterfly, avocado, pancakes, croissant, bacon and more, plus many profession emoji available in both male and female genders. Apple has also updated the artwork on many existing emoji, adding detail and making them look less cartoonish and more realistic. There are few other changes aside from the addition of new emoji, but the 10.12.2 update also likely includes many bug fixes and performance enhancements to address issues that have popped up since the release of macOS Sierra 10.12.1. Available since September, macOS Sierra is the latest Mac operating system. It includes Siri support, Apple Pay for the web, Universal Clipboard, Apple Watch auto unlocking, improved iCloud Drive integration, Picture-in-Picture multitasking, and dozens of smaller features that can be found in our macOS Sierra roundup. Update: macOS Sierra 10.12.2 beta 3 is also available for public beta testers.

The upcoming software update so far has included early hooks for Apple’s new single sign-on feature which lets you authenticate with your cable provider to unlock all compatible paid video apps. tvOS 10.1 is also expected to include Apple’s new TV app when it launches in December. The update follows the feature-packed tvOS 10 update in September, and the minor bug fix release of tvOS 10.0.1 last month. Everything new in tvOS 10: Smarter Siri, dark mode, HomeKit, more tvOS 10.0.1 software update for Apple TV is now available for everyone Aside from recent software updates, Apple also recently introduced a new app for Apple TV called iBooks StoryTime. While Apple introduced its TV app on iPhone and iPad with the second iOS 10.2 developer beta last week, tvOS 10.1 did not include its version of the same TV app at the time. Single sign-on, however, was made available through the Settings app under Accounts for certain service providers. Paid video apps will need to update to take advantage of this feature as Apple adds more service providers before the feature launches next month. We’ll update with any changes discovered in the latest tvOS 10.2 beta below.

Folks enrolled in Apple’s developer program can install the update via the over-the-air mechanism in the Settings app, or from the dev center. Today’s release comes just one week after beta 2, which added Apple’s new TV app. In fact, iOS 10.2 features a lot of new stuff including emoji, wallpapers, settings, and improvements related to Emergency SOS. Apple has also released third betas of macOS 10.12.2 and tvOS 10.1 to developers. These appear to be more maintenance updates, though tvOS 10.1 does add support for Single Sign-on and will likely include new TV app. We’ll update this post if any significant changes are discovered in today’s releases. If you see something new we’ve missed, let us know in the comments below! Update: here are some of the changes spotted in today’s iOS 10.2 beta thus far: SOS feature removed – it looks like Apple has removed the SOS feature in beta 3 that allowed you to call emergency services by pressing the power button. Videos app removed – we saw some instances of Apple hiding the Videos app in beta 2, but it appears much more widespread in beta 3, due to the arrival of the TV app. New features for TV app – in Settings, as with most streaming apps, you can now choose whether to use cellular data for playback or not and the video quality.

Apple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now. The American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. Apple Pay can speed transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. Apple says that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods. Separately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent. They will be redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products. Americans are just starting to warm up to mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. One of the chief hurdles is the fact that for in-store transactions, it's not that difficult to pull out a plastic card to pay. And many merchants still do not accept such mobile payments. Although usage is growing, mobile payments are still a small portion of overall sales. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Designed for the fourth-generation Apple TV, the third tvOS 10.1 beta can be obtained by connecting the Apple TV to a computer with a USB-C to USB-A cable, downloading and installing the software from a registered developer account via iTunes or Apple Configurator. Once a beta profile has been installed on the device through iTunes, new beta updates will be available over the air. Many Apple TV owners are eagerly awaiting a promised Single Sign-On feature that will allow Apple TV users to sign in once with their cable credentials to access all available live cable content, and the feature was introduced in the first tvOS 10.1 beta. The new "TV" app that was announced at Apple's October 27 event was not included in the first two tvOS 10.1 betas, but it was introduced on iOS devices in the second iOS 10.2 beta, suggesting it could come to tvOS users soon. "TV" is meant to be a TV guide-style app that provides users with recommendations on what to watch and an easy way to discover new television content. tvOS 10, for those unfamiliar with the operating system, brings features like improved search, expanded Siri capabilities, a dark mode, a Continuity option for using the iPhone for text input, automatic app downloads, quicker access to live TV, and more. Update: Some users are having difficulty downloading the update, as their systems are reporting that an update is available but are stuck waiting to connect to the update server to download.

I don't game much on it, but I use it hours a day to browse. I see no need for this. Just charge it overnight when it gets to 20%. Exactly my point. Rating: 1 Votes RadioGaGa1984 16 hours ago at 06:13 pm I wonder if the newly released USBC-Lightning cable will let people "finally" charge their Siri Remotes directly from their TV. Not something that appeals to me (I have several Lightning-equipped chargers already in the living room), but many were asking and/or complaining about this early on in the life of the ATV4. TBT the only reason people were wanting and complaining about it, was most likely just due to the fact it couldn't be done. While in reality they would never actually use that solution.

Yesterday AAPL: 105.71 -2.72 The best apps for the new MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar & Touch ID Jordan Kahn - 1 day ago @JordanKahn MacBook Pro Touch ID Touch bar View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit With the new MacBook Pros with Touch Bar arriving to the first pre-order customers and going on sale at Apple stores this week, you might be looking to try out some apps that support the new hardware. Fortunately, Apple has already confirmed many apps that will get support for Touch Bar, the new contextually sensitive touchscreen panel embedded into the MacBook Pro’s keyboard, and many others app developers are announcing updates.  Head below for the full list. There are a handful of apps that you can already use with Touch Bar, and many more that are scheduled to get support in update’s coming this month and in the months to come. Some utilize quick shortcut buttons, sliders and other functions depending on the task you’re performing, while others, like password manager 1Password, tap into the Touch ID fingerprint sensor for authentication too.  We’ve noted expected release timeframes for apps that have specified and we’ll add more as developers announce support.
