Sara Barker March 20, 2017 11AM medium text large text This is the final week of the series that asks if a Windows user can become a Mac convert in 30 days (click here for week 1, here for week 2 and here for week 3). And it’s time for the big faceoff as I put Windows and Mac head to head. First in build, then in the operating systems. MacBook Pro vs notebook build This is an unfair category because Apple products are built in the same way, whereas the various PC/notebook manufacturers vary wildly in both quality, price bracket and specs. MacBook Pro: You get exactly what you see on a demo machine in any tech store. But there is no customisation. You do have to pay extra on an already rather high price tag for the accessories, but chances are if you can afford a MacBook, you can afford to buy the accessories too. It took a lot of adjusting to the keyboard and trackpad; but luckily Apple provided an external keyboard that felt better to work with. The Touch Bar is nice for image editing in apps like Photoshop but in truth I haven’t really used it beyond basic functionalities like brightness. In fairness, I never really used the F keys that much on any keyboard anyway. Windows-based notebooks: You can take more time to do your research and drill down into the things such as RAM, keyboard style, design, specs, graphics and portability for something that works best for you, rather than factory-produced and rigid systems. I would never want to be locked into buying only a couple of devices just to run an OS so Windows-based vendors win this round. The dongle mess MacBook Pro: Fail. I can understand putting a few USB C ports on a notebook to encourage people to switch to newer technology, but putting ALL ports as USB C really stuffs it if you want to use a humble USB stick or connect an external monitor. It is an inconvenience and eyesore to have a bulky dongle plugged in just to connect a single peripheral.  This is a good lesson for PC manufacturers: If you’re gonna implement USB C, do it slowly, include traditional USB ports and try not to alienate those of us who aren’t ‘hip’ enough to catch up right now. Not all of us are early adopters or the early majority. MacOS Sierra vs Windows 10 MacOS Sierra: Despite a couple of glitches here and there, the operating system itself hasn’t given me any troubles in terms of system updates. It’s also user friendly once you know your way around. It is, however, something that doesn’t quite have the amount of user settings and customisation that I would have liked, but it’s an OS and it does what it should do. System upgrades are free so you'll never have to buy a new OS again. Windows 10: Yes, Microsoft is forcing the ‘upgrades’ on everyone, and yes there are a heap of privacy issues (some of which are easier to turn off if you know how), Windows 10 is a best that takes some getting used to. I am one of those people who loved Windows 7, and I far prefer it to Mac OS or Windows 10. The upgrades from Windows 7 and 8 were also free however those wanting to purchase Windows 10 licences for their older PCs or those buying PCs out of the box may still be shelling out the dough. Software: Pages vs Word Pages: It's free, it's effective, and it's a native Apple app. It does have annoying autocorrects, but it’s a basic word processor that does what it needs to do. A quick look at Numbers and even Keynote lead me to believe the same thing. Free doesn't necessarily have to mean basic, but in this case it's all about simple functionality. Microsoft Word: Word is my go-to. It costs, it can be expensive and it has so much more variety and back compatibility on Windows. There are heaps of functionalities like mail merge; it’s comprehensive, flexible and it looks great.  Other word processing programmes such as LibreOffice also offer a more detailed look at word processing (and other office applications). It could possibly wipe Office off the map if it tried; and ultimately it's still a step up from Pages. Finder vs Windows Explorer They’re both similar in style, but Explorer has the added advantage of showing many more folders and being able to customise most of them. Finder’s interface is kind of drab and I was kind of annoyed that the ‘delete’ button doesn’t automatically send files to the trash. App Store vs Windows Store After my spiel a while back, I did a comparison and found that they’re both pretty much similar. I like the Windows Store interface better but using Apple’s App Store to download and authorises purchases using the fingerprint sensor was far better than putting in a password all the time. Security Mac: As I’ve mentioned, Mac is less prone to cyber attacks, but it doesn’t mean they don’t happen. Don’t be fooled, because it could cost you dearly. Windows: Unfortunately for Microsoft, the security timing couldn’t be worse as it held off on a mass of security updates from February - then released them all in March a few days ago. That’s going to hurt your bandwidth. My home Windows computer gobbled up 1GB+ of updates. Windows will be the target of most cyber attacks for the immediate future, at least. So, I’m going to hand security to Macs - tentatively, I might add. It’s not a deal maker or breaker.  As someone who watches the torrent of security breaches come in over the wire every day, it’s so clear that everyone should back up their data, everyone should use antivirus/anti-malware no matter what operating system you use.  The final verdict Side by side, I have to come to the conclusion that both Windows and Mac are good at what they need to do. Mac is let down by a rigid build that lacks customisation; Windows is let down by its ongoing  Windows 10 saga and security issues.  Both have ethical murky waters (as has been highlighted in the media recently) and both are massive tech giants. So have I converted to a Mac lover? Not really. I think I can now navigate between Mac and Windows after years of one-sided exposure; but in the end they’re just operating systems that both allow me to work - and play.  Broadband Compare – compare 1000’s of broadband deals in NZ email facebook twitter google+ linkedin Related Apple devices are easier to use than rival devices, says Jamf The 30 day MacBook Pro challenge week 3: Can a Windows user become a Mac convert?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry Apple, Google and Facebook Have Backed Away From Fighting Trump’s Latest Travel Ban By Rafia Shaikh Mar 16, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Earlier in February, a number of tech companies had filed a legal brief opposing President Trump’s first executive order on immigration. Apple and Google were among the first to respond to this travel ban. However, these tech giants have now reportedly “backed away” from the legal fight against the second version of this travel ban. Apple, Facebook, Google, and others “skip” fighting the second travel ban “Apple, Google and Facebook are among more than 60 technology companies that appear to have backed away from the legal fight against U.S. President Donald Trump’s controversial travel ban, deciding not to put their weight behind a lawsuit seeking to block the second version of his executive order,” Reuters reported late last night. Related [Updated: More Join] Apple, Facebook, Google, Uber, and Others File Legal Brief to Oppose President’s Immigration Order While the first amicus brief that was filed to oppose the original executive order had received support from 127 companies, the latest brief filed in the federal court in Hawaii on Tuesday on behalf of Silicon Valley companies listed support of only 58 companies. Advertisement Microsoft, Dropbox, Netflix, Twitter, Intel, Kickstarter are some other companies that had supported the original brief but didn’t sign the latest one. However, while Reuters’ report is based on the fact that the above-mentioned companies haven’t signed the “friend-of-the-court” brief yet, they could still do so. For example, Uber was reported to be in the process of adding its name to the brief. Companies will have an opportunity to join the effort as it moves through the court system, said Robert Atkins, a New York lawyer and co-author of the brief. “We do expect the group to expand.” It should be noted that Google and Apple were among the most outspoken companies who not only signed the original brief but had also donated to the crisis funds. Google CEO Sundar Pichai had said it is “painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues”. Cofounder Sergey Brin was also spotted at a march at San Francisco International Airport. Apple CEO Tim Cook had written a letter to his staff, noting that “Apple would not exist without immigration“. Reuters added that while the lawsuit may have lost some big names, it is still likely to succeed. A Hawaiian judge last night ordered an emergency halt to the latest ban, saying that it would cause “irreparable injury” by violating First Amendment protections against religious discrimination. Another judge in Maryland also blocked the latest travel ban, which was due to begin midnight on Thursday. President Trump has called this ruling “unprecedented judicial overreach”. Related Uber CEO Quits President Trump’s Economic Council After Criticism While it is unlikely that Apple, Google or other tech companies are more favorable to the second travel ban considering how heavily they rely on immigrants, none of the companies responded to a Reuters’ query on why they have chosen not to sign the latest brief.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Security Hackers Manage to Get Root Access on macOS – Two Safari Security Flaws Reported By Rafia Shaikh Mar 16, 2017 12Shares Share Tweet Submit The annual Pwn2own conference is underway and that means we are going to be seeing some interesting – and critical – security vulnerabilities. Since Apple attracts most of the security researchers’ efforts (three of the ten attempts targeted Safari security on day one), we will be talking about the two zero-day vulnerabilities affecting Apple’s Safari browser that were showcased at the annual security conference. Two zero-day Safari security vulnerabilities reported by hackers With over $1 million in prizes, you can be sure that this conference attracts the best talent from around the world. The Zero Day Initiative has now posted the results of yesterday, confirming two Safari security vulnerabilities. Related Hackers Use Microsoft Edge to Pull Off a Full Virtual Machine Escape Day one of the conference managed to get two independent hackers $28,000 after they successfully demonstrated attacks on Safari using a use-after-free (UAF) in the browser combined with three logic bugs. Independent hackers Groß and Baumstark targeted Safari with a flaw that allowed them to scroll a message on a MacBook Pro Touch Bar. Advertisement In a partial win, Samuel Groß (@5aelo) and Niklas Baumstark (@_niklasb) earn some style points by leaving a special message on the touch bar of the Mac. They used a use-after-free (UAF) in Safari combined with three logic bugs and a null pointer dereference to exploit Safari and elevate to root in macOS. They still managed to earn $28,000 USD and 9 Master of Pwn points. Following this, Chaitin Security Research Lab also targeted Safari using a total of six bugs in their exploit chain, winning a prize of $35,000. Related Hackers Manage to Get Root Access on macOS – Two Safari Security Flaws Reported The Chaitin Security Research Lab (@ChaitinTech) successfuly exploited Apple Safari to gain root access on macOS by using a total of six bugs in their exploit chain including an info disclosure in Safari, four different type confusions bugs in the browser, and an a UAF in WindowServer. This earned the team $35,000 and 11 points towards Master of Pwn. Details of these flaws haven’t been shared since Apple will first patch up these vulnerabilities before details are made available to the public. Overall, the participating teams earned a total of $233,000 in prizes on day one. Apart from Safari, researchers found flaws in Microsoft Edge (which helped Tencent Security earn a massive $80,000), Ubuntu Desktop and Adobe Reader.

Right now on the Apple store website, you can buy an iPhone 7 in rose gold, gold, silver, black or jet black. Conspicuous from Apple's colour wheel since the 1980s is beige. No matter how much money you have to throw away on aesthetics, you cannot buy a beige iPhone. Until now. Colorware have just launched the iPhone 7 Plus Retro edition for people who don't just have more money than sense, but have such a discrepancy between the two that they wouldn't fit on the same line graph. Before I reveal exactly how much they're charging for it though, let's take a moment to marvel at its beauty: Now let's slowly turn over that price tag and… WOAH. $US1,899. Okay, putting it back now, being super-careful not to drop it. To be entirely fair to Colorware, they have gone for the second-most expensive iPhone 7 available – the 256GB iPhone 7 Plus. I say second-most, because they've hand painted the details on top of it, and presumably the finish of the Jet Black version would get in the way, but all the same the base iPhone costs $US969, which means the paint job is a whopping $US930. You may be wondering if anyone will buy one at that price, and the answer is almost certainly yes. Last year's iPhone 6S retro repaint cost only a little less, and is marked as sold out on the site. If you are interested, they're selling it in limited numbers, with the first 25 getting a handwritten number of authenticity. It dispatched in two to three weeks, meaning it'll be even more retro by the time it reaches your hands.

Watchlist | 26 Feb 2017 | Print  | Comment (7) Apple Remote Desktop 3.9 by Agen G. N. Schmitz In version 3.9 of Apple Remote Desktop — the remote management software’s first update since early 2015 — Apple now requires OS X 10.10.5 Yosemite, but provides backward compatibility for communicating with Apple Remote Desktop clients running any version of 10.8 Mountain Lion, 10.9 Mavericks, or 10.10.4 Yosemite. (The Apple Remote Desktop Client comes with the operating system, and version 3.9 will be made available via Software Update to users running 10.10.5 Yosemite or later.) The Remote Desktop admin app also adds support for the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro, enables administrators to export and restore an encrypted list of computers and user credentials, and enables admins to use an assistant cursor to call attention to items on a remote screen. Many users are experiencing a problem where client machines fail to authenticate and show the status “Needs Upgrade.” Reportedly, the solution is to go to Remote Desktop > Preferences > Security and select “Allow communication with older clients (less secure).” However, admins are reporting other problems as well, so it’s worth holding off on this update until the community gives it the all clear.

However, many 10.12.3 systems are failing to authenticate to other 10.12.3 systems for no obvious reason. Surprisingly, Screen Sharing is a workaround over ARD as that works (and more curiously on the second try.) Go figure!!! Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-27 17:30 Thanks for the info — sounds like it might be worth waiting for another update here. Reply Glen McAllister  2017-02-28 03:17 Definitely. I just had to restore both ARD Admin app & Client on my Mac to restore the ability to login in to an account different to the one currently logged in as, which is essential functionality, AFAIC. Had to disable SIP to restore the client in Time Machine. Reply Anonymous   2017-02-28 16:52 he he he ... i'm Anonymous again ... lol Reply Nunyuh  2017-03-06 20:40 LOL. Found out that as soon as this update began it slowed my MacBook down to the point it was stalling. So not interested in this latest update. Also, using the encryptions available not going to something less secure doesn't go with the purpose of encrpitng data in the first place. Apple communities seem to say there should be another update coming soon to correct the issues. Reply Anonymous   2017-03-10 00:33 The other issue floating around apparently has to do with using the short name versus the long name of the user. (see https://discussions.apple.com/message/31437644#message31437644) I just restored access by switching from the long name to to the short name as the ARD login Reply Petert   2017-03-16 20:15 We had a problem in one of our Music Labs where the teachers iMac running ARD could see all the Student units but only as Black Screens in the Observer Group View, no individual control (Screen Share) was available The 3.9.2 update release Mar 15, 2017 did not fix this. The work around fix was to: 1. On student iMac - manually switch off 'Remote Management' and enable 'Screen Sharing' in the Sharing Pref Pane 2. On Teachers iMac - Menu | Go | Connect to Server | Browse 2a. Select the Student iMac you just shared, add in the Admin User Details you would normally use in ARD in the Dialogue, asking for permission (to connect) 3. Return to the Student iMac - allow connection in the now visible dialog. 3a. Re-enable 'Remote Management' in the Sharing Pref Pane and reboot the Student unit. Repeat as required for each student mac. ARD could now see the screens in Group Observe mode and 'Screen Share' as you would normally expect. A most painful manual fix on 36 student units. pete Reply To leave a comment, click Add a Comment and then enter the text, your name, and your email address (which won't be displayed).

Apple's mysterious 'wireless device' has been revealed in FCC photos Kif Leswing Mar. 19, 2017, 5:53 PM 197,340 facebook linkedin twitter email print Last fall, Apple submitted an application to the Federal Communications Commission for an unannounced device with the model number A1844. At the time, the "wireless device," as it was described in the application, was a mystery. Speculation mounted in some Apple circles as a result. The application said it was a low-powered device with both Bluetooth and near-field communication wireless functionality. On Sunday, a user manual and photos of the mystery device were published by the FCC. The mystery device appears to be a badge reader that attaches to a door assembly, most likely for Apple corporate use: FCC Here's another look, according to an image included as part of an NFC test: FCC The user manual is not intended for general consumers and includes specific backend wiring instructions. Here's what it does, according to the user manual: Usage Instructions 1. Present the company provided credential to the reader. 2. The reader will indicate granted access by briefly changing color to green and playing a sound. Declined access is indicated by red color and a second sound. Apple has several smart-home products on the market — most notably software called HomeKit — that enable manufacturers to make smart locks and other products that work with the iPhone. Apple has never announced plans to sell its own smart lock or other Apple-designed smart-home hardware, and this electronic lock seems specifically designed for Apple corporate or retail use. Apple is putting the finishing touches on its new Apple Park campus, expected to open next month. When A1844 was revealed in the FCC application, some speculated it could be a new Apple TV or AirPort router, based on the limited information included in the filing. Apple has filed similarly cryptic applications for "wireless device" models, such as A1846, since then. Apple did not immediately return a request for comment.

Credit: REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Related iPhone 8 launch will see Apple release 3 brand-new devices iPhone 8 Rumor Rollup: The Great iPhone 8 freak-out, no worries about Galaxy... iPhone 8 will feature a curved OLED display Video Cool Yule Tools- Hot Picks Apple's rumor mill sometimes works in mysterious ways. With Apple's next-gen iPhone, for example, a sketchy report that surfaced in mid-2016 claimed that Apple's upcoming iPhone was such a huge upgrade that Apple was going to skip the iPhone 7's nomenclature and simply call its 2017 iPhone the iPhone 8. And from there, the iPhone 8 naming convention stuck. More recently, reports surfaced indicating Apple was still planning on releasing three brand-new iPhone models: an iPhone 7s, an iPhone 7s Plus, and a newly redesigned iPhone dubbed the iPhone 8. This, of course, never made much sense given that releasing an iPhone 8 alongside an iPhone 7s would not only cause widespread confusion, but it might also stifle overall iPhone sales. After all, who would want to buy an iPhone 7s when an iPhone 8 is already out on the market. Not to fear, Apple seems to know what it's doing. In case you missed it, a report from Macotakara earlier this month relayed that Apple's flagship 2017 iPhone—the one with the edgeless OLED display—won't be called the iPhone 8, but rather the iPhone Edition. If accurate, this is a smart move on Apple's part given that the "Edition" moniker is a great way to differentiate its flagship and more margin-friendly iPhone model while not making the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus models seem like yesterday's news. Also of note is the claim that the rumored iPhone Edition will launch a little bit later than the iPhone 7 and 7s, though we'll likely hear more rumblings about that from the rumor mill sooner rather than later. As a final point, some additional iPhone Edition rumors we've seen point to enhanced internals, improved Siri functionality, facial recognition software and, last but not least, a new facial recognition technology that may be a part of Apple's big push into augmented reality.

Mobile 2 0 0 March 19, 2017 iPad Pro 2 Launch: Press Release This March Or An April Event At Apple Campus? Venus Montalbo The Cupertino-based tech giant will purportedly release the new iPad Pro 2 soon. And adding to the launch anticipation for the new slate is the possibility that Apple will offer it in four major variants, including a smaller iPad Pro model. Most of the details existing online about the iPad Pro 2017 are only based on speculations, which mean nothing has been made official to the public yet by Apple, particularly when talking about its potential release date. But based on the latest grapevines, the launch of the iPad Pro 2017 models could just be around the corner. The earliest possibility for the iPad Pro 2017’s announcement could, in fact, be this week. According to MacRumors, a research firm that did not want to be named told them that Apple could reveal its new products this month and most likely, it could happen “during the week of March 20.” However, the firm did not specify the kind of Apple devices slated for release and how will they announce them. To provide a particular Apple product that might be made public in just a few days, the publication cited a prediction from a Japanese blog site Mac Otakara, which mentioned that a 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 could be announced this week. [Image by Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images] However, those who are religiously following Apple’s release traditions for its product could say that the likelihood of a proper launch event happening this week for the 2017 iPad Pro seems dubious, especially since there hasn’t been any kind of invitation sent out to media yet. So, to explain what could be a more realistic expectation from Apple this week, Mac Rumors noted the following. “Given that Apple usually invites the media to a launch event at least 10 days beforehand, and if the information we were provided about Apple announcing new products as early as next week is accurate, it is possible the so-called ‘iPad Pro 2’ could be announced via press release rather than at a launch event.” If the March announcement for the 2017 iPad Pro will not push through, the next rumored release timeframe for the updated iOS tablet is April where a keynote could be held for the first time at the Apple Campus to mark its inauguration as well. “Apple has moved ahead the production for its planned new 10.5-inch iPad to March instead of an earlier timetable set for May-June and is expected to unveil the new iPad at a product event to be held in early April,” reported DigiTimes, citing supply chain makers in Taiwan as its sources. We noted earlier in this article that four iPad Pro 2 variants could be scheduled for release this 2017. And you might already have a hint that two of these models are a 9.7-inch and a 10.5-inch versions of the iOS tablet. BGR reported that that 9.7-inch 2017 iPad will be equipped with an A9 processor while the 10.5-inch iPad Pro is getting the A10X chipset. [Image by Stephen Lam/ Getty Images] Brooke Crothers, a contributor for Forbes interviewed Rhoda Alexander, IHS Markit’s Director Tablets and PC, who said that the 2017 iPad Pro design with a 10.5-inch display will have slimmer bezels, resulting to similar physical size as that of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. “You end up with a unit that’s the same physical size as the 9.7 inch,” Alexander explained. This will make it possible for customers to also use accessories such as the Smart Keyboard with the 10.5-inch tablet. Catering to the high-end market, an updated 12.9-inch iPad Pro is reportedly in the works, too, which could be boasting of a 12MP primary camera as well as True Tone display, which the existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro uses. An upgraded 7.9-inch iPad may also be set for release this year, unofficially referred to as the iPad Mini Pro by tech news publications.

Own it Today in Digital HD. Music Drake Drops New Album ‘More Life,’ Ending Apple Music Exclusivity By Arron Hirst 19th Mar 17 8:11 pm Share Tweet Named #1 most-successful artist for 2016, based on the amount of streams (and downloads) the artist received throughout the past 12-months, Aubrey Graham -perhaps better known simply as Drake– has released a brand new LP this weekend. The new recording, which is being referred to as a “playlist” rather than an album, is entitled More Life – and features a whopping 22-tracks as it boasts a personal message from the Ontario-born rapper himself. It reads as follows: More Life. More time with family and friends. More Life. I’ve still got vibrations to send. More Life. They say that we could live forever At night I pray it’s true I’ve done so much in my short time and still there’s more to do But if someone should come collecting Sooner than we’re all expecting At least the life you lived was one for you Despite Drake‘s heavy involvement in Apple Music’s initial launch, (and the artist being a regular on Beats 1’s OVO SOUND Radio), you might be surprised to learn that Graham’s latest recording is not exclusive to the service. This is because, according to Billboard, the release of previous album –Views– last April ended a two-year running agreement between Aubrey and the Californian tech giant, which reportedly required the MC to release two albums exclusively on Apple Music – alongside providing at least one music video and TV spot to the firm. Since Drake has now come good on this original obligation with Apple, the artist is now finally free to release all future music on other streaming services. In fact, More Life is the first release from the rapper since the dropping of Views to get its simultaneous initial streaming release on Spotify, too. Apple has highlighted only a single explicit track off the new album as being potentially worthy of a listen, however. That being: KMT (feat. Giggs). Stream it on Apple Music. Get it on iTunes.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Gabor Balogh The iPhone 8 is causing problems months before it’s even announced Chris Mills @chrisfmills March 16th, 2017 at 3:29 PM Share Tweet For every year in recent memory, the iPhone has been the phone to beat. Some years Samsung pulls it off, other years their ambitions, uh, go up in flames. Things are looking even more critical than usual this year: the iPhone 8 is slated to be a bigger change and a bigger deal than usual for Apple, while Samsung is looking to rebound from a disastrous 2016. Don't Miss: Leak shows a stunning Galaxy S8 in a stolen Jet Black finish One sign that Apple is taking the iPhone 8 seriously are the supply-chain rumors surrounding OLED displays. Organic light-emitting diode screens are known for having better contrast, deeper blacks and superior energy efficiency compared to traditional LCDs, which is why Samsung and other manufacturers have used them for years. Apple has not, preferring to stick with the tech it knows and loves. But for 2017, things are changing, and Apple is throwing a wrench in everyone else’s works. There’s a limited number of OLED displays produced by manufacturers every year, and a new report suggests Apple has captured 14% of the supply. That’s enough to cause shortages for other manufacturers like Huawei, which is reportedly unable to secure a supply of OLED displays for its phones this year. Samsung is believed to be Apple’s supplier. Samsung itself produces OLED panels in-house, so the supply of OLED for Samsung’s devices is secure. According to Digitimes,”about 70% of global output of OLED panels in 2017-2018, mainly from Samsung Display, will be consumed by Samsung Electronics and Apple, therefore limiting the supply of OLED panels to other smartphone vendors, said the sources.” That’s a problem for every company not named Samsung or Apple. The report says that Oppo and Vivo have supply of OLED panels locked down already thanks to pre-existing orders, but other manufacturers are going to be out of luck. That’s actually rather bad news for consumers, as a lack of OLED panels means competing phones will be worse. That means we’re faced with another year of choosing between Samsung, Apple, and no one else. The screen is a particularly important component this year in particular, because smartphone design is moving to take away bezels and make devices entirely out of screen. We’ve already seen this no-bezel approach with the LG G6 this year, and the Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8 are both expected to have an edge-to-edge display with no bezel, and no home buttons either.

Sure, you’ll find deals from Apple occasionally, but there’s not much movement on product prices. Consumers often turn to eBay, Craiglist, and other alternative routes to find deals on Apple products, but these purchases can be unpredictable. Instead or trying your luck, it may be better to stick with authorized retailers such as Best Buy, which currently has 12 standout deals on top Apple products.

You can also go wireless by using the built-in Bluetooth, connecting speakers, headphones, and more. Other features include an LED-backlit 1440×900 pixel display that’s a mere 0.19-inches thick,  720p FaceTime HD camera, a spacious Multi-Touch trackpad, and a backlit keyboard with built-in ambient light sensor that detects changes in lighting conditions and adjusts the display and keyboard brightness automatically. The Apple MacBook Air normally retails for $1,000, but is currently discountedto $800 on Best Buy, providing a $200 (20 percent) discount for a limited time only. Best Buy is also currently offering 11 different Apple iPad Pro deals, with $100 slashed off the regular retail price of each product.

Safari Thorin Klosowski Mar 20, 2017, 7:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple browsers chrome downloads ios 10 ipad iphone safari Share Safari has long been the go-to browser on the iPhone, but after Apple finally opened up the secret speed enhancements in Safari to other browsers way back in iOS 8, it's now possible to ditch Safari entirely for another browser. Chrome is the most obvious choice for doing so. But is it worth it? The Contenders You have a number of browser options on iOS, but most of them, like the privacy-focused Brave, the gesture-based Dolphin, or the speed-centric Opera Mini, all fill a niche instead of trying to be your daily driver. For that, Chrome and Safari lead the pack. Here's a quick summary of their feature-set: Safari: Safari is the default browser we've all come to know so well over the years. It does everything a browser needs to do, including offering up a private browsing mode, bookmarks, and as of iOS 9, ad blocking. Safari is deeply integrated into iOS, which means you can search for something in Spotlight and open it in Safari, and by default most apps will open any links in Safari. Chrome: When Chrome originally arrived on iOS, it was slow, but still managed to work so well with Google's other products that people used it anyway. Now, the two are equally speedy. Alongside features you expect in any browser, Chrome on iOS has a few Google-specific quirks, like a built-in QR scanner, Google Now support, a translator, and more. Chrome also tends to hide a lot of its interface, foregoing the bottom navigation bar prevalent in Safari and instead placing everything up top. This is an aesthetic thing, but design matters enough that you might prefer how one works over the other. Which browser is best for you is partially a matter of preference, but it also matters what other apps you use. Let's dig into where Chrome makes more sense than Safari and vice versa. Chrome's Voice Search Works Extremely Well If you want to search for stuff online with your voice, you want to use Chrome. Google pushes its voice assistant hard in Chrome in iOS and it works stupidly well. With a hard-press of the Chrome icon you can search before even open the app, and once you're in Chrome, you'll find the voice search icon everywhere you look. More importantly, the voice search is accurate, pulling up most results perfectly. This sounds like a minor feature, but if you can't or aren't good at typing on a phone's small keyboard, having what's essentially a dictation function comes in handy. For its part, Safari has the regular old dictation button that's built into iOS, but it's not voice search specific and doesn't work as well. Of course, you can also search using Siri, but it's not as fluid or useful as the voice search in Chrome. Chrome Plays Nice With All of Google's Apps, Safari Plays Nice with Everything A while back, Apple introduced a "deep linking" feature that essentially lets apps communicate with each other. While it's not a replacement for "default" apps like on Android, it does make it so developers can do things like have a URL link from Gmail open up in Chrome instead of Safari. As you'd expect, Google has taken full advantage of this. Provided you're a Google user on a lot of services, from Drive to Gmail to Maps, you can make it so all those apps communicate with Chrome. For example, when you tap a link to a map in Chrome and it opens up Google Maps, or tap an email link in Chrome and it opens Gmail. If you're deeply invested in Google, this works wonderfully and makes it so you can ignore Safari altogether. If you're not a heavy Google user, things get less interesting. Safari is still the default browser, which means URLs you get in text messages, Apple Mail, or links you search in Spotlight all route thought through Safari. While some third-party apps, like Spark or Airmail, have an "Open in" option that lets you choose your browser, that's not the case in all apps, so you're bound to still use Safari now and again. Unless you're very much into Google, Safari is probably your best option so you don't have to bounce between the two all the time. Both Sync with Their Desktop Apps There is one final, big reason why you'd choose one browser over the other. Both Safari and Chrome sync with their desktop counterparts. This means your tabs, history, and bookmarks all sync from your phone to your desktop. If this matters to you, then you'll want to go with whichever browser you use on your computer. Personally, while syncing always seems like a cool idea, it's something I never, ever use, so this doesn't matter to me as much as I initially thought it would. If you're in the same boat and don't actually utilise this, don't let the idea that you could affect your decision for which browser to use. Safari's Reading List is Great, but Chrome Has One On the Way An often forgotten about feature in Safari is its Reading List. Here, you get a Instapaper-esque list of articles you've saved for reading later. It's great if you read a lot on your phone and have no interest in more advanced options like Pocket or Instapaper. Chrome does not offer this at all right now, but it's rumoured to be on the way soon. Until we know how that actually works, Safari is your better option here. Of course, for now, Chrome users can still use a third-party app like Pocket or Instapaper. Safari Can Block Ads and Trackers If you're someone who blocks ads or third-party trackers using an ad blocker, then your choice here is very clear: use Safari. The "content blockers" introduced in iOS 9 only support Safari, and Chrome doesn't have any similar type of plugin. These content blockers aren't about ads, they also block cookies, weird page elements, specific URLs, comments, and more. So, if you want to mess around with any of that stuff, you want to stick with Safari. The Verdict: Chrome Is Great If You're Deep In Google's Ecosystem, Safari Is Best for Everyone Else Which browser is best for you depends on a lot things, including a general preference for how it works. Some people like Chrome's more minimal aesthetic enough that features don't actually matter. Others like the fact that Safari integrates automatically without any tweaking. In any case, if you like the "feel" of one over the other, know that they're both equally speedy and feature-complete, so there's no reason to actively avoid either. The one clear difference comes if you're an avid Google product user. Chrome does an excellent job of linking up with the rest of Google's apps, enough so that you almost feel like you're not even on an iPhone. In that case, stick to Chrome and you'll be happy. If you seek out other apps that deep link to Chrome you'll be able to pretend like Safari doesn't exist. For everyone else, stick with Safari. It's come a long way over the years and it works perfectly well. Is it a little boring? Sure. But how exciting do you want your browser to be? Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

By: Vigneshravi Menon Published: Friday, March 10, 2017, 18:15 [IST] Apple followed the trend set by other smartphone manufacturers and brought out the iPhones with biggers displays. While bigger the better term has been around for time immemorable, gadgets have always followed a smaller but more powerful concept, in most areas. However, when it comes to smartphones bigger and more powerful is the mantra that's proven to be the key. With Apple making this transition and bringing out new bigger iPhones and being done with conveniently sized ones, it was an end of an era. And with the beginning of a new phase, many users were excited about having iPhones with bigger displays as it offered many new possibilities and better viewability. While on the other hand, some weren't so happy about it including me, this could also be the sole reason why many existing users also didn't upgrade to newer iPhones sooner. As older iPhones provided the convenience with their size.

By: Vigneshravi Menon Published: Wednesday, March 8, 2017, 14:45 [IST] Apple devices have some of the best camera features if not the best cameras. Moreover, with the launch of every new device the company is also adding more features to their camera.While most of the features are much appreciated, there are a few which are not liked by some users. While a great many users may like the Live Photo feature, there are users who may appreciate the technology but do not quite like using the feature. The Live Photo feature allows the user to capture a photo which comprises of a 1.5-second video, followed by the photo and another 1.5-second video. This feature can be quite intrusive and a pain at times, considering while clicking a photo you might twitch or move and have it captured in a Live photo. Though it may be funny at times it can be quite the nuisance apart from the fact it consumes more space.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Leak shows a stunning Galaxy S8 in a stolen Jet Black finish Image Source: Benjamin Geskin Zach Epstein @zacharye March 16th, 2017 at 9:41 AM Share Tweet In September 2016, Apple executives to the stage to unveil Apple’s next-generation iPhones, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. For the first time in nearly a decade of selling smartphones, Apple chose to reuse the same smartphone design for a third consecutive year; in the past, the company would introduce a brand new look every other year in order to keep things fresh. But since the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus would once again reuse the iPhone 6’s design from all the way back in 2014, Apple had to find other ways to make things more interesting. The company added a dual-lens camera to the Plus model, it doubled the amount of internal storage at each tier, and it added two new colors to its iPhone lineup, a stealth matte black and a stunning new “Jet Black” with a glossy, mirror-like finish. It looked incredible. So Samsung promptly stole it. Stop us if you’ve heard this one before… Don't Miss: Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7 Plus: Hands-on video with S8 mockup shows how they compare While there is precious little question that Samsung travels its own path more so now than it ever has in the past, some old habits are difficult to shake. Late last year, for example, it took the South Korean tech giant less than three months to steal the stunning Jet Black color Apple introduced in September. Samsung had made plenty of black phones before, of course, but it wasn’t until the new iPhones came along that the company added a glossy black option to its flagship smartphone lineup. It looks like the response to Samsung’s take on Jet Black was positive, because the company seemingly plans to keep it in the mix this year when it unveils its hotly anticipated new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ smartphones less than two weeks from today. We saw a leaked Galaxy S8 mockup pop up earlier this week in a glossy black color, and now an even bigger leak shows Samsung’s next-generation flagship phone in Jet Black once again. The images were posted on Weibo (via Slashleaks) and they show a handset that is once again believed to be a mockup. As a reminder, third parties use leaked schematics to build to-scale models of unreleased Apple and Samsung smartphones using real materials, and these photos are believed to show one such model. Additional photos of the Jet Black Galaxy S8 dummy follow below, and hopefully they can help tide Android fans over for another two weeks until Samsung finally unveils its new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ smartphones on March 29th.

This week we discuss iPhone storage speeds, the Moto G5 Plus camera and the Note5. Oh, and the lack of any capable compact Android smartphones. Aravind: Recently on a YouTube page I saw a video saying that Apple hides a secret from its users that lower memory variant of iPhone have much slower read/write speeds than the expensive higher memory models. Is it legal for apple to hide such an important thing from users (I am not sure if it is mentioned in t&c)? It was actually us that first made that discovery back in October - the memory used in the 32GB version is much slower than the one the 128GB iPhones get. In our test the write speeds were nearly 8 times slower. It certainly is legal as there are no laws mandating that makers should announce memory speeds of their smartphones and almost no maker actually does that, so we cant be sure Apple is the only one doing this. Its certainly not a very ethical way of doing things, but its not like Apple promised everyone storage that can achieve a certain speed. The good news is that it doesnt seem to affect the user experience that much, so besides the bad feeling that being treated like a second-rate customer inevitably gives, its not too big a deal. Anonymous: Why are mobile companies not making high-end under 5 inches except for Apple? I am interested in buying an Android phone and was wondering if the Sony Xperia XZ Compact is coming or if its just a rumor ? Ah, weve been there - we even had a petition to see if many of you, our readers were on the same page. Compact and powerful Android smartphones has been a severely underserved niche and wed love to see more action there as well. But now lets try and answer your questions why. There are two reasons - the first one is that its simply easier to make a flagship large as it gives engineers much more volume to work with and lets them squeeze a bunch of extra hardware that enables many of the features that we would expect from a flagship device. Consider this - the camera module is the same size reardless of how big your phone is, but proportionally it takes much less space on a phablet than on a 4 smartphone. Same with chipsets, DACs and most of the other internal components. There is also the matter of cooling, which is easier to solve when you have a larger area to distribute the heat to. Theres also the matter of battery life - while a larger phone requires its battery to grow bigger just to make up for the larger screen and its increased consumption it still has an advantage there. You see the standby consumption is about the same regardless of the size of the phone - so a larger battery large phone will last much longer than a smaller phone with proportionally smaller battery. The other reason is consumer demand - larger phones are so much better for browsing, gaming and multimedia consumption so understandably the demand for them is rising. In a poll on the ideal screen size we had last year - over 80% of you wanted phones larger than 5. About 30% of the voters actually wanted at least 5.4. I can bet you any amount of money that if we were to repeat that poll now the votes will have shifted even more towards the larger sizes. So combining the higher R&D costs of a smaller flagship with its lower expected market demand means most companies dont even bother developing them. All that said, Sony deserves credit for releasing a few very capable Compact flagships, most recently the X Compact. Those all did excellently in our reviews so you still have some options there. Unfortunately, nobody but Sony itself can tell if an Xperia XZ Compact is on the way, but fingers crossed well see it at some point this year. Anonymous: Why isnt GSMArena having a feature every month telling about which phone is best to buy under each category? We actually have that - its not a monthly feature but we do a shopping guide every once in a while when we see that the market has changed enough to warrant a new edition. Last one came at the end of last year and well certainly release a new one once all the MWC announcement hit the shelves and we get the full picture. The main reason we are not doing these more often is the research required to make them useful is substantial and would divert resources from the reviews. We feel giving you detailed reviews and then letting you decide which smartphone in your budget best suits you is more useful than just putting up ready-made lists. And again, once we see a big enough shift in the market like the one we are about to witness over the next month and a half you can expect a new installment in the series. Kristen: The Moto G5 Plus offers the same rear camera setup as the Samsung Galaxy S7 (excluding OIS). What are your thoughts on it? We havent had the phone at the office yet so any conclusions and final verdicts at this point might sound extremely foolish once we see how the final product does in all the tests. Still, early samples from the camera that we took at the MWC floor look promising, if not quite Galaxy S7 grade. Heres hoping Lenovo used the extra time until the market launch to optimize the processing so the final units are actually able to match its high-flying colleague from team Samsung. And the phone in general looks pretty promising too - a decently capable yet power-efficient chipset, stock Android Nougat and a battery that's plenty big for its size. What yours truly failed to mention, though, is how ugly the back side looked. Not that front is particularly pretty with its huge bezels, but to me none of the elements at the back work together. I guess looks will always be a matter of personal preference though and theres always the option to slap a case on it and save yourself the eyesore. Jesu: I want to buy a Galaxy Note phone. As the Note7 is not an option is it worth buying the Note5 or its better to wait for the next one to come out? This is a tough one - the Note7 fiasco really put the numerous Note series fans between a rock and a hard place. You could either settle for last years version or make do without the S Pen and a slightly smaller screen on the Galaxy S7 edge. The wait for the next Note wont be a short one either - at best it will take another 7 months to arrive. The good news is Samsung is likely to bring back a slightly downgraded version of the Note7 to the market - these refurbished units will come with a smaller battery, but they should still be better than the Note5. We are yet to see how much theyll cost and if they wont bring any other corner cuttign. Still, unless there are other nasty surprises those should be the best options for Note fans that dont want to wait until Fall for an upgrade. Alternatively, if you can leave without the Note exclusive goodies there are plenty of capable phablets in the market - the Huawei Mate 9 and LG V20 are both purchases you are unlikely to regret, while the Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus is there for those on a tighter budget. Anonymous: Can you explain how you calculate battery endurance rating and also can you add standby time to the endurance chart? Weve described the test in detail over here, along with most of the other tests we perform. What we do is calculate the endurance for the four tests (call, web browsing, video playback and standby) and then add them to a formula that by default would give us the endurance if you do an hour of calls, an hour of browsing and an hour of video per day with the phone being on standby for the rest of the time. However you can use the sliders over here to customize the usage pattern so its closer to your personal one and get more relevant results. The reason we dont add the standby test to the endurance chart is that it confuses more people than it helps. Those that believe its important to know can use simple math to calculate it using the numbers provided, but a modern day smartphone is not meant to spend a week on standby without being touched so we believe the number isnt really relevant. Instead we believe the endurance rating, while artificial on its own gives you a better reference point when comparing battery life between phones.

If you have suggestions for topics or specific questions you’d like to see answered, feel free to let me know. Catch up on past installments here.  One story that’s been making the rounds in the media recently has been Apple’s role in education as it faces increased competition from products like Chromebooks. Earlier this month, we reported on new data that claimed both iOS and macOS again were losing marketshare to Chromebooks. In the US, Chrome OS saw its share rise to 58 percent in 2016, up from 50% in the prior year. On the other hand, iOS dropped to 14%, down from 19% in 2015, and macOS dropped to 5% share, down from 6%. In your education environment, what technology should be implemented? What can Apple do to improve education? Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case There are a variety of things to consider in this argument, the first being price. There’s no way around it: Chromebooks are more affordable than Apple devices. You can get one for as little as $134 and partnerships between Google and school corporations are plentiful, making the price even lower than that. On the other hand, iPads have gotten significantly cheaper over the years. You can currently get an iPad Air 2 for $379 from Apple’s Education Store, while the company also works with corporations and universities to get that price down even further in some cases. That’s not to say, however, that Apple shouldn’t work to further reduce the price of the iPad for educators. Apple operates on one of the highest profit margins in technology and given how big of an emphasis Steve Jobs put on education, I personally am of the belief that Apple should work to provide iPads at cost to educators and schools. Pricing argument aside, however, there are other things to consider. And in my opinion, once you get past pricing, the advantage start to lean towards Apple. The biggest thing that the iPad has going for it in education is the ecosystem.  The iOS ecosystem is, in almost every way, the most advanced and established ecosystem there is right now. The App Store offers thousands of apps made purely with education in mind, some of which we’ve highlighted thus far in EduTech. That’s not to say the Chromebook ecosystem is lacking, though. Essentially, a Chromebook offers a full-powered browser that can get you many of the same services that iOS apps also offer. Chromebooks are also becoming more advanced with support for apps, but that feature is still in the early stages and still rolling out to devices. Another thing to consider here is security. Both Google and Apple offer tools to educators to ensure that students don’t have access to anything that could compromise their device, but the app-focused nature of iOS gives the iPad somewhat of an advantage here. Given that apps are reviewed by Apple before being made available to users, there’s less possibility of security compromises compared to the open web experience that Chromebooks offer. Another argument to consider when deciding between Chromebook and iPad is the design of each product. iPads are much sleeker and lighter than most Chromebooks, but with Chromebooks you get a full physical keyboard. That’s obviously a huge advantage for productivity, especially for note taking and content creation. Building off that argument, however, is the iPad accessory ecosystem. As we detailed last weekend, there are a multitude of accessories available for the iPad that significantly enhance its usage in education. While it’s more expensive to add a keyboard to the already more expensive iPad, it offers more flexibility than the Chromebook. Apple is also making efforts to improve iOS for education. The company offers a Classroom app that makes assigning working, sharing iPads, and much easier for teachers and administrators: Classroom turns your iPad into a powerful teaching assistant, helping a teacher guide students through a lesson, see their progress, and keep them on track. With Classroom, you can easily launch the same app on every student device at the same time or launch a different app for each group of students. Classroom helps teachers focus on teaching so students can focus on learning. The technology in education argument, however, goes much deeper than comparing Chromebooks and iPads…. Last year, Ben Lovejoy wrote a great op-ed piece highlighting 8 reasons why iPads are losing to Chromebooks in education. He argued that things like price, past failures, and software holes were some of the things Apple could improve upon in education. You can read Ben’s full piece for all of his thoughts, but I happen to agree almost entirely with him. Apple is losing in the education market. There’s no way around that fact. Educators are starting to more often choose Chromebooks over iPads, a decision that almost certainly stems from price and the ever-decreasing budgets with which school corporations have to work. Apple needs to do more in this area. Education markets a huge, nearly entirely untapped, opportunity for the company. One of the things I admired most about Steve Jobs was how much he valued the education system in the United States. And how he knew it needed to improve. Jobs also realized, however, that technology alone couldn’t fix education. He said in a 1996 interview with Wired: I used to think that technology could help education. I’ve probably spearheaded giving away more computer equipment to schools than anybody else on the planet. But I’ve had to come to the inevitable conclusion that the problem is not one that technology can hope to solve. What’s wrong with education cannot be fixed with technology. No amount of technology will make a dent. Apple can do more with education, offering iPads at cost to school corporations, building an ecosystem focused on learning, and even stepping into some of the non-technological problems. Like or not, Tim Cook has turned Apple into a voice a variety of social problems and if he’s going to keep that up, I’d really like to see him extend into education and use Apple’s power and money to improve education in any way way that it can. Jared Harrell // BuzzFeed News Cook has touched on education in the past, calling Chromebooks nothing more than “test machines,” but it seems to me like Apple hasn’t been putting as big of a focus on education as it once did. “Sure, I think there is lots of interest. Sometimes education doesn’t move as fast as any of us would like, but I think there are a lot of great teachers out there and a lot of great people out there who really want to improve the quality of education. “I’m not a fan of teaching to the test. I think creativity is so important. Training the mind how to think is so important. Teaching to the test, to me, is too much about memorization. In a word where you’ve got all the information you’ve got right here,” Cook gestured to my iPhone, “your ability to memorize what year a war was won and all this kind of stuff isn’t very relevant. The classroom of the future is problem-solving and creating and learning how to express yourself.” What Cook describes sounds great, an education system focused less on testing and more on creativity. But I continue to hope that Apple will do more in this area to help improve education around the world, rather than just talk about how it should look. Cook has put shareholder desires aside for things like environment reform, why not do the same for education?

With its stock price on the rise, the tech titan may put more emphasis on dividend growth when it updates its capital return program next month. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Mar 19, 2017 at 11:55AM Five years ago today, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced plans to start paying a dividend for the first time since 1995. Since then, Apple has raised its dividend at a steady but relatively modest pace. Meanwhile, Apple's original $10 billion share repurchase plan (announced at the same time) has morphed into a massive $175 billion share buyback program over the past few years. Apple will announce the latest update to its capital return program next month in conjunction with its Q2 earnings report. This time around, the iPhone maker may finally start to raise its dividend at a faster pace. Apple's dividend history Apple paid the first dividend under its current capital return program in August 2012. At that time, the quarterly payout was $2.65 per share. Adjusting for Apple's 2014 stock split, this translates to a dividend of about $0.38 per share. Each April since then, Apple has raised its dividend. The biggest increase came in 2013, when Apple raised its dividend by 15%. The smallest increase (8%) came the following year. The average annual increase has been about 11%. Apple restarted its dividend in 2012. It has been growing ever since. Image source: Apple. In total, Apple's payout has grown by about 50% during this period. For the past year, its quarterly dividend has been $0.57 per share. Apple can afford to pay more Common metrics of dividend safety indicate that Apple could afford to pay a lot more to its shareholders. It currently has a payout ratio of just 27% based on its earnings over the past year. A payout ratio twice as high would still be considered safe by most experts. Many investors prefer to measure dividend safety by looking at free cash flow. After all, if a company is not generating enough free cash flow to cover its dividend, then it has to issue debt or stock to plug the gap. Apple is in good shape from this perspective as well. The company generated more than $52 billion of free cash flow last year, while its current quarterly dividend of $0.57 per share works out to about $12.5 billion per year for dividend payments. The case for a hefty increase There are two main reasons why Apple should consider a bigger dividend increase than has been its recent custom. First, Apple's dividend yield has fallen significantly since the April 2016 update to its capital return program. When Apple raised its dividend last April, the new $0.57 per share quarterly payment worked out to a 2.2% annual yield. Now, thanks to Apple's surging share price, the dividend yield has fallen to just 1.6%. Second, with Apple stock recently reaching a record high of $140, share buybacks seem less attractive than they have been for most of the past five years. Apple's earnings multiple is near the high end of its recent historical range, which suggests that the stock is not a huge bargain right now. Apple P/E Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts. Dividends and share repurchases are just two alternative ways to return cash to shareholders. As a result, if buybacks are generating diminishing returns due to Apple's rising stock price, it might make sense to shift the capital return program's emphasis toward dividends. A 20%-30% dividend hike could be coming Since Apple restarted its dividend in late 2012, its dividend yield has averaged about 2%. Just to get back to a 2% yield, the quarterly payout would have to rise 23% to $0.70 per share, based on Apple's recent stock price. There's a good chance that Apple will announce a dividend increase of roughly this magnitude next month. In the past year or so, Apple's management has placed an increasing amount of emphasis on the company's services segment. One of the big strengths of the services business is that it generates reliable recurring revenue, whereas device sales fluctuate due to product cycles. If Apple's cash flow is set to become more predictable in the future, then the company should start to behave more like other cash-cow businesses. That starts with offering a significantly bigger dividend. Adam Levine-Weinberg owns shares of Apple and is long January 2018 $90 calls on Apple and short January 2018 $140 calls on Apple.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Report: LeEco downsizing plans for the US, selling Silicon Valley property 03/18/2017 at 11:00 AM by Brad Linder 6 Comments Chinese company LeEco unveiled its first smartphone, smart TVs, and other products for the US market in October. At the time, the company laid out plans to launch a comprehensive ecosystem for its products, including cloud storage, streaming video, and other services that could be used across platforms. Basically, LeEco wanted to emulate the success its had in China in the United States… a country where few companies other than Apple have really been able to build the kind of brand loyalty that makes that kind of ecosystem popular. Odds are if you have an Apple laptop, you also have an Apple phone… and maybe an Apple media streaming box. So how’s it going for LeEco? According to recent news reports, not well. Shortly after LeEco’s first products went on sale in the US, the company’s CEO sent a letter to employees noting that the company didn’t have the funds to support the pace of growth it was on track for. In December the company reduced its workforce in India and scaled back operations in that country. And now Reuters reports that LeEco is in talks to sell the 49-acre property in Silicon Valley that the company acquired from Yahoo in 2016. LeEco is also said to have already cut its US workforce by as much as half, so that it’s now at “more than 500,” which is a far cry from the 12,000 people LeEco had originally planned to house at the property it may now be looking to sell. LeEco’s vision for the US market included plans for everything from existing products such as phones, TVs, headphones, and software services to upcoming products including self driving cars. LeEco has even developed smart bicycles. But it takes a lot of money to win big in a market like the US, and it looks like LeEco may be running out of that. I also have to wonder if the company overestimated the demand for a new product ecosystem… I think many folks looked on with interest when LeEco promised high-quality smartphones with reasonably low prices, for instance… but were disappointed when they learned how much LeEco customized the Android software on those phones. LeEco hasn’t confirmed the Reuters report about the possible property sale, but it does seem clear that the company is scaling back its ambitions for the US market. But that doesn’t mean LeEco is getting out of the consumer electronics space in the US altogether. The company also spent $2 billion to acquire TV maker Vizio last summer, and I doubt Vizio TVs are going anywhere anytime soon.

Prices tied up in special weird promotion. A software ecosystem which was vague. Some seemed to be Android TV – which I’d like – but then they wouldn’t actually say that out loud it seemed.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. Skinned OS was the best option, because even the phenomenal ICS 4.0.3 had its omissions in its time. But ever since Android 5.1 (which fixed all the frustrating bugs from 5.0)… Stock OS Android has been a charm. In fact, it made Skinned OS look all childish, non-professional, and not well optimised. And the best part about it was, supporting a Stock OS is much easier for companies. To the extent where it is actually possible for them to roll out updates within 2 months of AOSP release, and actually support the software updates for 24 months after release. Unfortunately, very little OEMs care about timely updates or long-term support. So people should now either flock to iPhones, build their own OS, or just get Pixel/OnePlus/etc etc devices. No point in having the best hardware out there if the software experience is crap. (with that said, one of my favourite Skinned OS is actually FlymeOS) Vote Up0Vote Down  Reply 20 hours 55 minutes ago Guest ExLeEco Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | March 14, 2017 -- 17:15 GMT (10:15 PDT) | Topic: iOS It's likely that Apple will release iOS 10.3 before the end of the month, which means you have some time to get your hardware ready for the upgrade. more iphone news iPhone 8 may not have the killer feature we've been hoping for The next iPhone won't switch to USB-C, but the cable might iPhones are much more unreliable than Android devices, claims report The iPhone decade: Apple's transition from Steve Jobs to Tim Cook The Cloud? Apple's iOS can't handle the Cloud Here's what you need to do to make sure things go smoothly for you. See also: Learn to become a Google Chrome power user Will you get iOS 10.3? First things first, will you get iOS 10.3? Here is a complete list of the devices that are supported by this release (basically, if you have iOS 10, you can get this upgrade): iPad 4th gen iPad Air iPad Air 2 iPad Pro (12.9- and 9.7-inch) iPad mini 2 iPad mini 3 iPad mini 4 iPod touch 6th iPhone 5 iPhone 5c iPhone 5s iPhone SE iPhone 6/6 Plus iPhone 6s/6s Plus iPhone 7/7 Plus To know what device you have, use this page to decipher the model number, which you can find on the back of the device or under Settings > General > About > Model. Is your device not in the list? Then you're out of luck. Back up your data Before you do anything major, such as upgrading your device, you need to make sure that you have a backup just in case things don't go smoothly. This is doubly so for iOS 10.3 because for the first time Apple is changing the iOS file system from the 30+ year old HFS+ for Apple File System. Apple File System is a huge improvement over HFS+, bringing with it features such as optimization for solid state storage, strong encryption, better file time stamping (down to the nanosecond), and many storage saving improvements. Apple plans to move macOS, iOS, tvOS, and even watchOS to Apple File System. But the two file systems are not compatible with each other, and once you upgrade to Apple File System, there's no way to convert back to HFS+ without blowing away all your data and reformatting the storage. What this means is that when iOS 10.3 is installed, every file stored on the device will be converted from the old format to the new format. And while we can expect that Apple will put a lot of effort into making this conversion process as smooth and painless as possible, upgrading a file system always opens up the possibility that something can go wrong. And if something does go wrong, data loss is a real possibility if the upgrade process has started converting files. Which is why you need a backup. You can either back up your data to iCloud (go to Settings > iCloud > Backup, then turn on iCloud Backup), or if you don't have enough space, you can take the old-school road and connect your iPhone or iPad to a PC to do the backup through iTunes.

SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 6 NEXT PREV Spring clean your device Chances are good that your iPhone or iPad has accumulated a lot of detritus over the months and years, so what better time to get rid of it than now. While iOS 10.3 doesn't need as much free space to install as earlier releases, getting rid of apps that you no longer use -- or perhaps have never used -- makes good sense. This is also a good time to find replacements for those aging apps that you've been using for years but that haven't seen an update in ages (usually because they've been abandoned by the developer). If you've been seeing some apps generate a message saying that it may slow down the device until the developer updates it to improve its compatibility then in iOS 10.3 that warning will be upgraded to suggest that the app "will not work with future versions of iOS," which means the end is nigh. Best iPhone or iPad apps (March 2017) SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 25 NEXT PREV Do I need to delete apps to make space for the upgrade? Not if you are on iOS 9 or above, because the operating system will clear space for you (even if that means deleting and redownloading apps). If you are on an earlier version, and you're cramped on space, then you might need to clear space by deleting apps (be careful -- because you will lose any associated data), deleting audio or video content (music, downloaded videos, audio books, etc), or moving data such as photos to the cloud (keep reading for more information). Update your apps If you've not updated your apps in a while, then this is a good time to do so, because a lot of the apps will have been updated to make them compatible with iOS 10 (although apps designed for iOS 9 seem to run well based on my testing). While it's likely that your device automatically updates apps in the background, it's not a bad idea to check just to make sure. Find the App Store app, then tap on it, and click Update (bottom-right of the screen). Once in there, you can kick off the update process. Put your photos in the cloud Another thing you can do is to upload your photos to the cloud. ZDNet's sister site CNET has an excellent rundown of some of the free services you can use for this. Know your passwords Following the upgrade, you'll need to enter your iCloud password in order to be able to reconnect to all your data and photos. If you don't have this close to hand -- remember, having it on the device you're upgrading isn't all that convenient -- then this might be a good time to do that. Also, if your iTunes backup is encrypted, then remember you'll need that password if something goes wrong! Pocket tools and gadgets "Every Day Carry"... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 13 NEXT PREV Is it better to upgrade or wipe a device and start from scratch? It's a lot less hassle to just upgrade a device because you get to keep all your apps and settings. However, devices that I have wiped and reloaded a new iOS onto, and then installed and re-setup all my apps and such, feel faster and seem to suffer from fewer problems (such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi issues). However, wiping and reloading the apps and data is pretty big hassle, and it's probably more work than most want to undertake. Should I wait a while before doing the upgrade? There will likely be an update or two to iOS 10.3 in the weeks following its release, so you might want to wait for the dust to settle and for any last-minute bugs to be squashed before making the leap, especially if you rely on your device. Also, if you use your device in a BYOD setting, make sure you get the OK from the IT department before upgrading, in case you're unable to access the network or data you need.

STRATEGY How This Company Went from a 95-Cent Book to a $2 Billion Business Learn storytelling techniques from the publicist for Polycom, Johnny Cash, and Steve Jobs. By Adele Cehrs Adele Cehrs, founder and CEO of Epic PR Group and author of Spike Your Brand ROI, has more than 20 years' experience in the PR and marketing industry. @EpicBVA Founder and CEO, Epic PR Group@EpicBVA WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement What people have "heard about you" influences how they interact with you and your company. Storytelling is a powerful way to position your brand and influence potential customers. One of the most enduring brand stories is the plight of the underdog. Remember the tale of the scrappy technology company founded out of a garage in Silicon Valley? Apple's story persuades us to root for "the little business that could," even before we buy a product. Decades later, Apple is hardly an underdog, yet that story continues to resonate with entrepreneurs, investors and employees alike. Public relations expert Cameron Craig, who spearheaded Johnny Cash's two Australian tours and helped craft the Apple brand story in the late 90's early 2000's, has an interesting take on what works and what doesn't. "As part of the PR team at Apple, I learned that simplicity is really the key to telling smart stories that resonate," Craig explains. "Jobs was a master storyteller and he oversaw every aspect of how the company was positioned -- including reviewing every press release." Craig also used the underdog story to great effect for Polycom. "It must have been my second week on the job and we had a Bring-Your-Kids-to-Work Day," Craig recalls. "I was in the cafeteria and I noticed [Polycom] co-founder Jeffrey Rodman talking to a bunch of 10 year-old kids, they're all in a circle and they're all captivated by what he was saying to them. He was talking about how he bought a $0.95 book from RadioShack on building speakers and how that book led to this company that we now know as Polycom." In the decades since the 1972 book Building Speaker Enclosures was published, Polycom has grown into an international technology powerhouse with more than 400,000 customers. The company recently sold for an estimated $2 billion. "Not a bad return for a $0.95 book," says Craig. "Great stories are everywhere -- it is up to internal teams to listen for them."Craig's approach isn't just spin from a 10-year Apple veteran. It's rooted in social science. In his recent book Pre-Suasion, social psychologist Robert Cialdini describes how people can be 'primed' and 'anchored' to think about certain things right before they make decisions. It's one of the reasons we feel good about supporting large corporate brands with underdog stories. The best brand stories, Craig believes, have a hero and a villain. The villain doesn't have to be human: It can be can be a concept, a problem, or a pain point. "In the tech world especially, the villain is complexity and the hero is simplicity," Craig points out. "And as humans, we love simplicity." You can do this, too -- even without Apple or Polycom's public relations budget. Craig recommends asking five people -- colleagues, friends, family -- the following questions: What is interesting about you and/or your company? What is your defining characteristic? What is that one thing that sets you apart from the rest? "You'll probably get five different answers, each of them different than what you think they might say," says Craig. "At the end of the day, it's about the people. Your story has to make them care, not just about what they do and who they do it for, but about how what you do impacts others' lives."

The company is likely to restate its commitment to the tablet device as early as next week, with the rumored announcement of the 9.7-Inch "iPad Pro 2."   From an enterprise sales perspective–a priority for the iPhone maker in the wake of recent partnerships with Cisco and IBM–large hospitals and health systems that shift to iOS tend to buy devices in bulk. 'We now have hundreds of iPads for patients to use,' says L.A.'s Cedars Sinai's Shaun Miller,, who uses a compliant iPhone app called Voalte to text with other providers. 'As we expand to more wards, it'll be thousands.'   Cedars Sinai has also come a long way with its use of HealthKit and other iOS offerings. As of this week, patients can log in to their medical chart, click a download button, access a copy of their medical record, and port it to their Apple health app on a smartphone. That way, they can show it to any doctor they opt to see, even if they leave Cedars Sinai. This application might seem simple enough, but in health care it's 'cutting-edge,' says Darren Dworkin, chief information officer at Cedars Sinai, since until recently patients were burdened with the task of requesting and physically transporting their data on a USB Drive or CD-Rom if they wanted to share data between health providers at different institutions. That's in large part because electronic medical systems historically were developed for billing, not data transfer.   'Leading hospitals and health systems are using Apple products to transform all aspects of health care inside the hospital and beyond,' says an Apple spokesperson, emphasizing the 'privacy and security of iOS'" as a key factor for its growing popularity among hospitals for remote patient monitoring and in-patient care.   The report further noted that "Developers like Lanier and Patient Safe Solutions' Si Luo made an early bet that iOS would take off in health care. For them, Apple's public announcement about its first steps in health care with HealthKit couldn't have come quickly enough. 'We had been trying to sell iOS into hospitals for seven years, only to see tremendous uptick in recent months,' says Luo.   One of the earliest customers to come on board was Pueblo, Colorado-based Parkview Medical Center, which uses the Patient Safe Solutions app to help nurses manage patients' medications at their bedside. To help minimize errors, nurses can scan a patient's wristband to pull up a system on an iPhone that determines if the staff is administering the right medication at the right dose at the right time. The hospital also uses the app to ensure patients get the right blood for their type, as well as for voice and texting communications between nurses, doctors, and the pharmacy.   Luo recalls being invited to a meeting last winter with folks from Apple's growing health unit, alongside several chief information officers at hospitals and fellow iOS health developers. At that meeting, he says, the group discussed how various apps like Tonic Health and Patient Safe Solutions could integrate together, as well as three major issues with iOS that were causing some concern among the largest hospitals. According to Lanier and Luo, who both attended, those issues were: order fulfillment in device life-cycle management (meaning reassuring these enterprise customers they wouldn't need to order new devices in less than three years), security, and wireless connectivity.   Since this conversation 18 months ago, Luo says sales have jumped from 30 hospitals using the technology to 85 hospitals. He attributes the success to Apple making available an enterprise solutions architect by phone to reassure IT buyers about security and privacy, and a growing awareness of existing features like encryption of health data. 'Apple now feels like the safest choice,' he says and security analysts tend to agree with this assessment.

Ugonna Nwaeze: Dear Entrepreneur, Can Your Business Survive Your Absence? 24.02.2017 at 1:00 am By Ugonna Nwaeze 11 Comments I never thought about this question while I was present at my online grocery store Nkataa.com, but since my absence I have realised its importance. Had I not been lucky enough to tailor my business to run without me, I would have some serious problems right now. No one ever plans to be absent when there’s a lot of money to be made and a lot of business to be done, but sometimes life has a way of forcing us to be absent at some critical points in the lifespan of our businesses. I have seen that we are just as addicted to Apple products after the passing of Steve Jobs as we have ever been. Despite the high foreign currency exchange rate in our country, many of us already have the iPhone 7 and are eagerly anticipating the next Apple product to hit the market. Nigeria remains among the highest purchasers of luxury goods and electronics regardless of the incessant ranting on social media about the Federal Government, the recession and the rising cost of FOREX. This has caused me to think a bit deeply. Are there ways that businesses can be set up to outlive and outperform their founders? I am interested in this subject because I believe that even when I am present, a successful business is one that allows me to spend more time doing leisurely activities and spending time with loved ones. As a CEO, regardless of my presence at work, my business occupies my mind 24/7. I always think about salaries, staff welfare, how to break even, profitability, etc. In fact there’s always something business-related on my mind. I believe that these issues would be better attended to if they were the only issues on my mind. Sometimes, one needs to be absent from the running of business in order to focus on these issues. I would also like some time off to play, after work and on weekends. Furthermore, I need to reflect on what I’ve done so far and how I can keep improving. This is better achieved when I can step back from the day-to-day operations of my business. I certainly would not like to continue this cycle of overworking myself, until I am unavoidably absent again; something needs to change. The basic requirement for business survival for start-ups is having a team. I have come to see a lot of start-ups with brilliant ideas impeding growth because they have refused to set up a team. They run their businesses so intelligently when they are available, but whenever they are away it is a different story. The business and customers wait impatiently while they flood their customers’ social media timelines with fun pictures of their holidays or family functions. Followed by an apology post when they return saying “Sorry I wasn’t able to respond to you guys, Nigeria was driving me crazy and I had to run away, but I’m back now. Yaay!” Let me quickly make it clear that there is absolutely nothing wrong with running your business like this. Maybe sometimes it is better to enjoy your holiday without getting calls from customers that their food has still not come. However, if you want your business to out-live/out-perform you as a founder, and operate in your absence, then you need to get a team. There are a million ways things can be done and there are also a million excuses why things cannot be done. I would normally encourage young CEOs like myself to invest in a team. A lot of people would always say to me, “I love your team, give me Bose, she’s pretty and intelligent. It is not easy to find smart people in Nigeria. There is a serious gap in Nigeria for “good hands.” It is not easy to find people who understand your vision. “Nigerians? They will just run down your business…” I can keep going on but I think you get my point. Bose was always a pretty girl but she has not always been an intelligent girl. In fact we used to call her an olodo. I worried that I had made a mistake in hiring her and we decided to just ‘dump her in customer care to talk to customers jarey.’ That was a BIG MISTAKE! We had customers and friends calling me and saying, “Get that girl off the phone.” However, today Bose is known as valuable and intelligent and people are wondering, “where did you find her?” What happened to Bose? How has she in a short space of time been able to transform from being an ‘olodo’ to being an asset? I have seen this ‘Bose-like transformation’ happen to quite a few members of my team. It has been a roller coaster with different personalities out there. It has taken a great deal of investment. How did it happen? It took patience, capacity building, team-building exercises, and a lot more. In fact, I have lost some members of my team that I love so dearly because they refused my investments. Like I said earlier there are a million ways things can be done and there are also a million excuses why things cannot be done. One thing you must get done is to “get good hands.” You must build the capacity you need. This does not come through firing everyone who doesn’t meet your standards; it comes through building up the individuals you have to become the team you want. Which leads us to the next point: The second requirement for your business to survive your absence is having a team that you have invested in. My team is my brand and I will deploy the same level of effort and finances I use to build my brand, to build my team. I will conclude this article with saying that usually the ones who we feel are the good hands are often beyond the reach of start-ups in terms of being able to afford them – unless your dad gave you a “small loan” of a million dollars like President elect Donald Trump. However, this is not a problem because the people you have invested in will manage your start-up better than ready-made people you have employed. I am looking forward to the next article because I will focus on writing about setting up the right team and how you can invest in them. In the coming weeks, I will also cover other impediments start-ups face with setting up a team. Until next time, happy building!

It would run independent of me and 2. that it would outlive me and be a generational business so help me God. When planning it, I said to myself, after 5 years, I would step back and see if the business can continue without my physical presence for 2 months but God had other plans. After 2.5 years, “due to circumstance beyond my control” I have had to be away for almost 6 months now and mehn, MY SERVICE BASED BUSINESS IS STILL GOING ON! One thing that has worked for me was communicating the vision with my staff, understanding their individual motivations and showing them how the success of the business invariably achieves their own goals. I am grateful to God that for the inspiration to set it up that way at the outset. Grateful to him for sending staff who despite our differences, have the same same vision and thankful for the small effort of mine that is yielding fruit. I hope one day there would be many generational business in Nigeria which would tell their own success stories too. God bless the SME’s in Nigeria. We shall not just survive but thrive! Love this! 24 Reply wellness February 24, 2017 at 5:59 pm Thanks for posting. Setting up a team/ partnership is one of my greatest fears /stresses about starting up a business. This has been helpful. Love this! 10 Reply olanna&odenigbo February 25, 2017 at 12:14 am I am eagerly waiting for the next article…. struggled with this for long, gone through many people, but hopefully now making progress….I pray we keep growing. The few times I had to travel, even with a not-so-stable team, I have always organised for work and monitoring to continue in my absence, and it does…I must confess it’s a bit stressful to follow up on work and multiple explanations when my brain is on vacation. After a hectic year last year, I pretty much let go of my entire former team (each one at a different time and for different reasons) and reassembling another started again this year, with clearer intentions of what I required from the people I hire, and I noticed my more recent trip was better than my previous ones, my new assistant was more efficient handling things and communicating between other staff and myself… I on my part, was also more patient with communication cos I realised I couldn’t expect them to just know everything at once… So I am learning patience and hoping to keep building a better structure as we progress. I have learned I also don’t need to die with -the devil I know’ ….Let them go if they no longer serve the mission and/or refuse to be aligned. I offered a staff free training that I usually charge upwards of 200k for, and she was a no-show…not even phone call to cancel or reschedule. this is someone who was already slowing us all down and refusing to do something about a fixable problem…and she had the nerve to roll into work on Monday by 11am… how do we deal with such people biko… I’m learning o…different days with different lessons.

Titled More Life, the 22 tracks were premiered on Drake’s Beats 1 show, OVO Sound Radio, on Saturday without warning. The really great news for fans though is that More Life is available now to stream on just about every major music service, and not exclusive to Apple Music. This is the first music from Drake since his 2015 album Views that isn’t exclusively tied to Apple Music, a result of the musician’s partnership with the company. That doesn’t mean Drake and Apple’s relationship is ending however, as it was apparently those at Apple Music who helped decide to call More Life a “playlist” rather than an album or mixtape. Those wanting to listen to More Life can stream it on Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal, Google Play Music, and other services, plus there’s the option to buy and download it from the iTunes store. Already one of the standout tracks for fans is “Glow,” which features vocals from none other than Kanye West. With this surprise release, it’s expected that Drake is about to easily beat the weekly streaming record he set in 2015, which saw Views streamed over 250 million times on Apple Music in its first seven days. With More Life available on a range of services, topping that number in the first week shouldn’t be too difficult.

McIntyre March 19, 2017 7:54 am EDT Print Email Tweet Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) market cap sits at $734 billion, as its shares have passed an all-time high of $141. A number of analysts believe that figure will go to $160, or higher. Apple is likely to be worth three-quarters of $1 trillion within the next several weeks, if not days. Apple has posted a better share price growth this year than any other component of the Dow, up 20.9%. The Dow is higher by 5.3% to 20,915. Apple’s shares have been driven recently more by rumor than hard numbers. Although the company’s number for the last quarter were impressive, that information is nearly two months old. Apple set a record for iPhone sales, along with record numbers for most of its other hardware. Its forecast for the current quarter was good but not spectacular. It was certainly not enough to drive the stock up to present levels. The primary drive of Apple’s advance has been speculation about its new iPhone 8, which is expected to be released in September. Recent versions of the iPhone have not been considered game-changing improvements over past ones. Also, they have not been considered strong competitors with the flagship products of rival Samsung. Website MacRumors is among the best providers of information about Apple products. It recently published comments on the next generation iPhone: Apple has a major iPhone redesign planned for 2017, with a glass body and edge-to-edge OLED display that includes an integrated Touch ID fingerprint sensor and front-facing camera. The new iPhone may be sold alongside upgraded (but standard) 4.7 and 5.5-inch iPhones. 5.8″ OLED display Faster A11 processor Glass body Edge-to-edge display Camera and Touch ID integrated in display No Home button Wireless charging Three models – One OLED, two standard It is not overly simplistic to say that if the iPhone 8 features do not live up to this and similar descriptions, Apple’s stock may take a hit. However, if it appears the iPhone 8 has at least this set of features the stock has an excellent chance to gain more. And, of course, there is the issue of iPhone 8 sales.

However, the Cupertino-based corporation seems to be in no mood to answer their prayers. New York, United States - March 19, 2017 /MarketersMedia/ -- Apple patrons force see the rumored iPad Pro 2 or iPad Mini 5 in the upcoming event. According to Apple World Today, an Apple contest is slated to take place on April 4, 2017. The Cupertino-based tech monster always builds its spring event in March for the past several years and the blog authenticates that the iPad event is following spring event for the company. Read more news: http://howtorestoreiphone.com However, this does not correspond with the March statements of previous years. With Apple Park programmed to inaugurate in April this year, same Apple blog recommends that the tech firm will launch its new iPad lineup in the 1,000-seat Steve Jobs Theatre which is situated on the unique Apple Park campus known as 'Spaceship.' Apple iPad Mini 5 Video: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5f4pzf Remarkable iPad deals that are currently up for grabs via local vehicles offer up to $150 off and the maximum models are scheduled to end on April 1, 2017. Distinctly just three days ahead of when they claim the launch function will take place for both iPad Pro 2 and iPad Mini 5. As per 9 to 5 Mac, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro model is in short supply on Apple's website, with the page of the tablet pointing to April 4 as an availability date, this could also mean that Apple could opt for same day availability. Some newly surfaced reports claim that Apple's rumored iPad Pro 2 may come along with a magnetic Apple Pencil, CNET published. Although not much is known about iPad Pro 2 and iPad Mini 5, but gadget freaks are ecstatic to get a glimpse of the new developments. The upcoming Apple device is said to be powered by the A9 and M9 motion co-processor. In the meantime, the iPad mini 5 or iPad Pro mini or iPad Pro 3 is expected to arrive with new appearances such as IP68 protection and Apple's 3D Touch technology. The iPad Pro 2 is said to roll out alongside the latest major point update for iOS 10, the IOS 10.3.

Sometimes a frozen iPhone will not let you do any type of activity, and often you are stuck on-screen in an app or on a home screen. This can also help if your iPhone is stuck off and won’t turn on, but mainly you will use this when the iPhone is stuck on with an app or something on-screen. This is a hard-reboot, but some people will call it a hard-reset. Don’t worry about the reset part of this name. You are not resetting the iPhone like you would with a factory reset that wipes all the data clean. Fix your frozen iPhone in seconds. This may not solve all of your problems. If the iPhone freezes regularly you may need to remove an app or perform an actual factory reset on your iPhone and start from scratch. It’s normal for an iPhone to freeze once or twice in a year after you install a bad app or run into a problem. If things continue to freeze or go bad, there may be a hardware problem that requires a trip to an Apple Store. Fix a Frozen iPhone in 10 Seconds You can fix a frozen iPhone in about ten seconds by pressing and holding the power and home button at the same time until the iPhone restarts. If you have the iPhone 7, you need to press the volume down and the power button at the same time. Once the iPhone screen changes from the frozen state to showing an Apple logo or just a blank screen you can let go. This is a hard reboot. By pressing and holding the home button and power button you force the iPhone to restart. This is similar to holding the power button on a Macbook or laptop or just unplugging a device from power. You’ll see this screen when you fix a frozen iPhone. You don’t need to hold the power buttons after the phone restarts. You should not lose any data doing this, but if you were typing a message, document or working on something inside of an app you may lose that small bit of work depending on when it saved. You don’t need to be plugged in to power or connected to a computer to use this method of fixing a frozen iPhone. If the battery is low, it may help to plug-in to power, but otherwise you are good to do this anytime the iPhone is frozen. This works on any iPhone, iPad or iPod touch on any version of Apple’s software including iOS 5, iOS 6, iOS 7, iOS 8, iOS 9 and the upcoming iOS 10. Read: iOS 10 Tips and Tricks For users who consistently have this problem, it may be good to uninstall a problem app or make sure it is up to date. If you never restart your iPhone or iPad and you have this happen once or twice a year you can often avoid it by restarting you iPhone once every other week. If this is a continual problem you should consider backing up the iPhone to iCloud or your computer and then performing a factory reset. This takes longer to complete, but it can resolve problems. If you choose to to restore from an iPhone backup and the problem continues you may need to hard reset the iPhone and then set it up as a new device.

Gao Yuan Apple said it plans to build new research facilities in the eastern Chinese cities of Shanghai and Suzhou, on top of centers already slated for Beijing and the southern city of Shenzhen. Photo: AFP Beijing: Apple Inc. has revealed plans to set up two more research hubs and boost investment in China, a pivotal market in which the iPhone has been rapidly elbowed aside by local rivals. The announcement comes as chief executive officer Tim Cook undertakes his latest trip to a country that ranks as Apple’s single biggest overseas market. Apple said it plans to build new research facilities in the eastern Chinese cities of Shanghai and Suzhou, on top of centers already slated for Beijing and the southern city of Shenzhen. It also pledged to spend at least ¥3.5 billion ($507 million) on research institutions. All four centers will open later this year, the company said in a statement on its Chinese website. They will help Apple cooperate with local partners and attract talent from its local suppliers as well as from top educational institutes, according to its press release. The announcement came a day before Cook is scheduled to address a high-profile economic forum in Beijing, where senior government officials will confer with the heads of some of the world’s biggest corporations, including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Saudi Arabian Oil Co. Foreign companies have a long-established tradition of building research bases in China to both signal their commitment to the country and curry favour with the government. Apple’s announcement comes after iPhone shipments fell for the first time in China on an annual basis, in 2016. China had for years driven Apple’s spectacular growth, even as smartphone demand elsewhere faltered. But local vendors like Huawei Technologies Co., Oppo and Vivo are now eroding its market share with increasingly high-end devices. The US company is counting on the release of the 10th anniversary iPhone later this year to supercharge growth.

John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Mar 19, 2017 at 7:38AM Looking for a little income and growth for your portfolio? Consider buying shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA might seem like an odd choice for an investor seeking income, but what gets overlooked with this hot tech stock is the willingness of management to reward shareholders with dividends and share repurchases. NVIDIA Gaming has been good to the graphics specialist. In 2016, NVIDIA raked in $4.06 billion in revenue, an increase of 44% over 2015 as the upgrade cycle to the latest high-end graphics processors got under way. Continued advances in gaming technology, higher-resolution displays, and the emergence of eSports provide nice tailwinds for demand over time. Volvo XC90 SUV powered by NVIDIA DRIVE technology. IMAGE SOURCE: NVIDIA INC.  In addition, NVIDIA has other promising growth opportunities emerging with the growing adoption of its high-end GPU technology by other industries for deep learning, artificial intelligence, and self-driving vehicle applications. The combined revenue from its Datacenter and Automotive segment could be the company's biggest business in the not-too-distant future. In 2016, NVIDIA generated $830 million in revenue from its Datacenter segment, an increase of 145% over 2015, while the Automotive segment grew 52% to $487 million in revenue. CEO Jen-Hsun Huang expects the next phase of growth in datacenter to come from several industries, including healthcare, retail, transportation, and life sciences, among others. Here's what he said on a recent earnings conference call: The first adopters were hyperscale companies like Microsoft, Facebook and Google, which use deep learning to provide billions to customers with AI services that utilizes image recognition and voice processing. The next area of growth will occur as enterprise in such fields as healthcare, retail, transportation and finance embrace deep learning on GPUs. NVIDIA's technology is essentially affecting every area of the economy, so how do you value a company like that? The best way to evaluate the investment merits of a high-PE, high-growth business is to consider the market opportunity relative to the company's market capitalization. Intel believes the self-driving car market will be worth $70 billion by 2030 and could reach $100 billion. Compare that amount to the less than $500 million NVIDIA generated last year within its Automotive segment, and it's easy to understand the huge opportunity here -- and why NVIDIA's stock has rocketed to the stratosphere. NVDA data by YCharts. While NVIDIA's multibillion-dollar growth opportunities get all of the headlines, the vision and business skills of its management team, led by CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, get overlooked. Jen-Hsun Huang is the founder of the company and the reason the company is where it is today. He's also been a very shareholder-friendly leader willing to reward shareholders with the company's excess cash flow, something you don't see very often with relatively small companies in technology. The company has consistently paid out a growing dividend since it was initiated in 2012. Over the last three fiscal years, NVIDIA has distributed 83% of its free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. It's a good signal from management that they expect the company to continue growing in the future. NVIDIA currently offers a dividend yield of 0.5%; however, the quarterly dividend has nearly doubled over the last four years. As the business continues to grow and generate more cash from operations, the dividend could double again in the next five years, which would put the dividend yield then at 1% on today's share price. Apple Apple has built a sticky ecosystem with its lineup of iPhone, iPad, and Mac. IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.  The Apple logo is as recognizable as The Coca-Cola Co logo, Nike's swoosh, or the golden arches. Once you own at least two Apple devices, it's very likely you are hooked for life. Over the last four quarters, Apple generated $218 billion in total revenue and $45 billion in profits. The key driver of Apple's growth is iPhone sales, which made up 69% of total revenue in the first fiscal quarter of 2017. The most important thing for investors to know about is Apple's huge financial advantage over its competitors. Apple earned every penny of the smartphone industry's profits in 2016 while commanding less than 20% market share of unit sales. Absorbing all of the profits among smartphone makers gives Apple an enormous competitive advantage to reinvest in more advanced features, digital content, and other services, making the Apple ecosystem even stronger over time.  As Apple sells more devices, it should boost services revenue from iTunes, Apps, Apple Music subscriptions, and other digital content over time. Services revenue has been Apple's fastest-growing segment recently. In the holiday quarter, Services grew 18% year over year to $7.1 billion, bringing the trailing-12-month amount to over $25 billion. Apple generates robust cash flows, and the cash has been piling up on the balance sheet in recent years. At the end of December 2016, Apple had about $46 per share in cash and marketable securities. This is 33% of the current stock price. The cash-rich balance sheet gives management a lot of flexibility not only in running the business, but in how it chooses to reward shareholders. Apple has paid a steadily increasing dividend for about five years, as well as regular share repurchases to reduce the share count and boost earnings-per-share growth. The share buybacks have also been very timely thanks to the conservative valuation on the stock in recent years. Analysts expect earnings to grow about 9% annually over the next five years, and investors are not paying much for future growth, with the stock currently sitting at 17 times earnings. The stock's dividend yield is currently 1.6%. Even after the stock's recent 30% to 40% increase, it still looks attractive. Investors may not hit a home run with Apple given its nearly $1 trillion market value, but the business has a brand customers love, and it generates a lot of cash, and this should leave shareholders with a decent return over time.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 March 2017 by Military News Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Buys Apple Stock — Should You? CEO Warren Buffett recently disclosed that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) owned 133 million shares, or about $18.5 billion, worth of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock. Apple joins other sizable holdings — Wells Fargo & Co  and The Coca-Cola Co  — as one of Berkshire Hathaway’s top equity investments. Throughout his career, Warren Buffett has made successful investments in several different industries, but some of his most famous and rewarding investments have been in consumer product companies. His 1988 investment in Coca-Cola is probably Buffett’s most famous investment. Similar to Apple, Coca-Cola had a product with universal appeal and was demonstrating growing revenue and profits at the time when Warren Buffett invested 25% of Berkshire Hathaway’s book value in Coke shares. Apple’s competitive advantage Apple’s Opera retail store in Paris. IMAGE SOURCE: APPLE INC. Although the Apple investment is notable because of Buffett’s historical tendency to shun tech stocks, it actually fits the qualities the Omaha-based investor has looked for in other investments. If you use an iPhone, iPad, and/or a Mac computer, you probably have some experience with the stickiness of Apple’s products and services. It’s not likely that someone who has taken lots of photos of treasured moments and purchased lots of content from iTunes is suddenly going to abandon Apple for a Samsung Electronics Co  or a Microsoft  product. Millions of customers have a strong attachment with Apple’s devices, and this is what attracted Warren Buffett’s attention: Apple strikes me as having quite a sticky product and enormously useful product that people would use … The continuity of the product is huge, and the degree to which their lives center around it is huge. And it’s a pretty nice … franchise to have with a consumer product. Apple creates beautifully designed products and has successfully tied it all together with Apple’s iCloud storage service, which automatically keeps all of your content synced between devices. The unique, spartan-esque product design and sticky services have led Apple to become one of the most iconic brands in the world. Apple consistently earns high customer satisfaction ratings, which continues to help sell tens of millions of iPhones every quarter. This success has been a good marketing tool for other product lines like Mac computers, which continues to show strength while the PC industry is in decline . These qualities have led to impressive growth in Apple’s business over the last 10 years: Fiscal Year Revenue Net Income 2016 $215.6 $45.7 2011 $108.2 $25.9 2007 $24.0 $3.5 Amounts in billions. DATA SOURCE: Apple Inc. annual reports. While Samsung controls the No. 1 spot in smartphone market share in terms of unit sales, Apple generated every dollar of profit in the industry in 2016, according to one analyst . Apple achieves this by commanding a premium price to competing products, reinforcing the brand’s strength in the marketplace. Should you follow Warren Buffett and buy Apple? Let’s not kid ourselves: Warren Buffett is one of the world’s greatest investors. You could do a lot worse than just sit back and buy every stock Berkshire Hathaway owns, and never sell. But keep in mind that Warren Buffett’s investments don’t always perform well right off the bat. In 2011, he disclosed on CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway’s $10.7 billion investment in International Business Machines , which has dramatically underperformed the market ever since. SPY data by YCharts . Don’t expect to hit a homerun with Apple Nonetheless, the strong financial position of the company and a great brand should deliver decent returns for shareholders in the future, but don’t expect to earn anything close to the stock’s nearly 1,000% rise in the last 10 years. SPY data by YCharts . The stock trades for a very reasonable 16 times earnings , and analysts expect the company to grow about 9% annually over the next five years. Apple also offers an annual dividend yield of 1.6%, and management has been using cash flow to buy back shares, helping earnings per share grow 16% annually over the last five years compared to 14.8% annual growth in revenue. Plenty more dividends and share buybacks will come since the business generates over $60 billion in annual cash flow and currently has a whopping $246 billion in cash assets on the balance sheet and only $73.5 billion in debt. Investors can achieve success using their own insights My takeaway from Warren Buffett’s investment in Apple is the advantage individual investors have over the big financial institutions in managing their own money. Anyone who has been an Apple customer in the last 10 years would have figured out long ago the same qualities one legendary investor observed only recently. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Problem Solving | 13 Mar 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (11) How to Identify High-Performance GPU Apps on the MacBook Pro by Jeff Carlson Shortly after the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar began shipping, battery life became a hot topic. Although Apple boasts up to 10 hours of performance per charge, I wasn’t seeing anything near that on my machine. I’d get maybe 4 hours. For a while, Consumer Reports refused to recommend the MacBook Pro because of battery life, although their testing methodology was questionable (see “Why We Should Care about the Consumer Reports MacBook Pro Rating,” 12 January 2017). The upside of the tempest was that Apple was able to fix some graphics and battery life issues in the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 and 10.12.3 updates. One of those problems centered around the way macOS switched between the built-in Intel graphics processor and the discrete AMD Radeon Pro graphics card available in the 15-inch models. (Although I’m writing specifically about the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the following discussion applies equally to any MacBook Pro with a discrete graphics card.) When you launch a graphically demanding app, such as Adobe Photoshop, macOS switches to the Radeon processor, which consumes more power. When you quit the power-hungry app, the machine is supposed to turn off the discrete card and switch back to the integrated graphics processor, which offers less graphical power but doesn’t chew as much battery life. Before 10.12.3, macOS wouldn’t accurately sense that the changeover had happened and would continue to drive the display using the discrete GPU. Since applying that update, my battery life has dramatically improved. Even still, though, there are times when it seems as if my battery level is slipping away faster than I would expect given the work I’m doing. If you’re experiencing something similar, here’s how you can determine which apps are using which graphics processor and potentially track down the culprit. You have a couple of options: First, click the Battery menu bar item, which will tell you which applications are “Using Significant Energy.” That’s a fuzzy indicator, however. You can be running an application that’s using significant energy and still be using the integrated graphics processor. So, a quick trip into Activity Monitor is more helpful. Launch Activity Monitor (located in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder; you can get there quickly in the Finder by choosing Go > Utilities) and click the Energy tab. At the bottom of the window, see which graphics card is currently in use: Integrated (the Intel GPU) or “High Perf” (the high-performance Radeon GPU). If it’s the latter, you may be burning energy faster than you want. To determine which application is causing the discrete GPU to run, click the Requires High Perf GPU column to sort the list of running processes based on that attribute. You may have to click the heading twice to sort it correctly; the caret to the right of the column title should be facing down to indicate that you’re sorting in descending order. At the top of the list, the apps that say Yes are your culprits. Quit those apps. Even if you’re not actively using them, their presence can keep the discrete GPU active. The Graphics Card indicator at the bottom of the screen should switch back to Integrated. You’ll notice that Activity Monitor also includes a Time Remaining estimate. When Apple released 10.12.2, it took the unusual step of removing this information from the Battery menu bar item (see “macOS 10.12.2 Sierra Focuses on New MacBook Pros,” 13 December 2016). Happily, you can still get that information in Activity Monitor. The estimate is still just an estimate, though, and shouldn’t be taken as gospel because macOS adjusts its energy management features frequently. Nevertheless, the Time Remaining estimate can be a helpful guideline if you’re getting close to the wire. Of course, if you have to use even a single app that requires the discrete GPU, your battery life will suffer, and there’s nothing you can do about it. Similarly, even if no apps are using the discrete GPU or reporting as using significant energy, the battery may drain faster than you expect due to other factors. Especially on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I’ve found that turning off keyboard illumination (expand the Control Strip on the Touch Bar to reveal the keyboard brightness buttons) and reducing screen brightness can make a big difference.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Is your MacBook Pro with Touch Bar getting less battery life per charge than you think it should? The culprit could be applications that are forcing it to use the high-performance graphics processor. Here’s how to tell which GPU is in use and which applications to close to switch to the integrated processor. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Richard  2017-03-13 15:31 This is brilliant and incredibly useful. I'm using a 2014 MacBook Pro but I've always wanted to see which of my application uses the discreet GPU. It looks like my only application that uses it is Lightroom. Safari has memory issues but they're not related to the GPU. Reply Greg  2017-03-13 21:16 Why would pgAdmin need the graphics card? It's the only app that was using it. pgAdmin can view Postgres databases. That doesn't seem too demanding. Is there any downside when the MBP is not running off the battery? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:08 I just downloaded the latest version (4.13) and also found it requires the "high perf. GPU." My guess it's because its GUI is made using the Qt framework and there's something about the framework that makes the Mac think it should use the discrete video card; every application made with Qt likely will do the same. I would report it to Postgres in case there's some setting they can use in the Mac build process to make the application *not* trigger use of the discrete video card. When you're not running off battery, the consequences of using the discrete video card are much less significant; you're using more electricity than necessary and may be adding wear to the cooling fans. Reply Tony Voss   2017-03-14 01:55 I use a 15" MacBook Pro as the navigational system on a yacht and power consumption is critical, especially when there is little sun or wind for power generation. For years I have used gfxCardStatus (http://gfx.io). This useful app places an extra item in the menu bar which indicates by displaying the letter i or n whether the integrated or Nvidia discrete processor is active. Pull down on the icon and it shows a list of apps requiring the external card processor. You can also switch between using Integrated only, discrete or dynamic switching. You cannot switch to 'Integrated only' if an app is already using the discrete processor. Some apps and an external display force discrete mode anyway. I have gfxCardStatus set to display a notification whenever the mode is switched. This is a useful warning when you happen to launch an app that turns on the discrete processor and comforting confirmation when you quite a culprit. I have successfully got app developers to remove unnecessary use of the discrete card and to fix an app that left it on when quitting. But if the app is no longer being maintained you may be out of luck - Bento for example. Thoroughly recommended. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:17 I wanted to mention gfxCardStatus, but it's no longer actively maintained, and doesn't work reliably under Sierra (and maybe a version or two back). I used it for years, and wrote about it for TidBITS in 2011: Reply Troy T  2017-03-19 22:55 I've used this utility for years and continue to be happy with it. As it isn't maintained, it's less helpful in shifting sources of video drivers, but it continues to flawlessly show when the system is using discrete graphics and which apps are forcing its use. As long as gfxCardStatus still reports what's going on with the video circuitry, I'll strongly recommend it for anyone who is interested in stretching their battery capacity. Reply DelfM  2017-03-14 08:35 It's probably rare that you would be concerned about power consumption when you connect an external monitor, but my 2012 MacBook Pro Retina switches to the high performance graphics card when I connect an external monitor, even if none of my open applications need it. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:14 Yes, I think all MacBook Pros with discrete cards switch to the GPU to power an external monitor. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:18 I don't understand why it automatically uses the discrete card when an external monitor is attached, Macs without such cards are able to use the same monitors. It also happens regardless of whether the external monitor is extending the desktop or mirroring the built-in display. At work, we always advise faculty to use the AC adapter when presenting from a laptop but it would be nice if they didn't have to. I don't have the ability to check at the moment but I wonder if screen mirroring over AirPlay or using 3rd party mirroring software triggers use of the discrete card. It would be a little ironic if they don't, given that mirroring by software almost certainly is more intensive than mirroring on a physically connected display. Reply David Redfearn   2017-03-14 13:57 I started looking at this data when I got my new MBP 15. One oddity I have noticed is that Apple Photos does not seem to use the AMD GPU. I have two Photos extensions (RAWPower and DxO) that do trigger the GPU when they are used, but when I am finished with them, the GPU is turned off. David Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 16:15 I would bet Apple tuned Photos especially so it doesn't need the GPU.

The company’s Tissot brand will introduce a model around the end of 2018 that uses the Swiss-made system, which will also be able to connect small objects and wearables, Swatch Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek said in an interview on Thursday. The technology will need less battery power and it will protect data better, he said later at a press conference. Switzerland’s four-century-old watch industry has been adjusting to new competition since Apple Inc. entered its territory with the Apple Watch in 2015. Hayek faces the uphill challenge of trying to outsmart Google and Apple, which have fended off would-be rivals to their operation systems in smartphones and watches. Hayek’s strategy contrasts with that of LVMH watch chief Jean-Claude Biver, who earlier this week unveiled an upgraded TAG Heuer smartwatch the brand developed with Google and Intel. Hours after Swatch’s announcement, Richemont said it plans its first smartwatch, the Montblanc Summit, which will sell for $890 and up starting in May, using Android 2.0 technology. Competition from smartwatches has hurt low-end timepieces the most, and Hayek has been adding electronic functions into Swatch’s own less expensive brands such as Tissot and its namesake timepieces. This month, Swatch said it developed the world’s smallest Bluetooth chip for use in watches and household objects. Swatch’s approach will work better because it’s trying to “think small” as one of the biggest problem for wearable devices is battery drainage, Hayek said, speaking at the Biel, Switzerland headquarters of Omega, another of 18 brands that Swatch produces. “There’s a possibility for wearables to develop as a consumer product, but you have to miniaturize and have an independent operating system,” the CEO said. “I’m not convinced,” said Luca Solca, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas who follows the luxury industry. “People use smartwatches expecting to use the same apps they have on their mobiles. A proprietary operating system defeats the object.” Swatch is willing to supply third parties with the operating system, which has been developed with the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology, a university specialized in miniaturization, Hayek said. The company has received about 100 requests for more information, with half coming from smaller Silicon Valley companies that don’t want to be dependent on Android and iOS, he added. Separately, Tissot has yet to start selling its Smart Touch smartwatch, according to Francois Thiebaud, head of that brand. He said last year the solar-powered watch would be available during 2016, and that it would be connectable to Android and Apple smartphones. It also would have functions such as showing the weather and helping the wearer find lost keys. Swatch also forecast a rebound in US and European markets as it published its annual report on Thursday. Hayek said revenue may increase about 7 per cent to 9 per cent this year. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Yet sales of smartwatches so far have underwhelmed, even for giant Apple Inc., and the new tech-driven timepieces generally command lower prices than the Swiss industry’s traditional output, creating risks for brands that have jumped in. “The smartwatch market hasn’t necessarily been as big an engagement as some thought it would be,” said John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst Bank. “Swiss watchmakers aren’t doing this to fend off the Apple Watch.” $15,000 watches Instead, they’re dabbling in smartwatches as a way to lure younger shoppers — who often don’t wear anything on their wrist, smart or otherwise. Prices of Montblanc’s traditional watches run as high as $10,000, more than 10 times the price of its new gadget, while TAG Heuer’s most expensive models extend to about $15,000. The original version of the Apple Watch starts at $269. “It’s a way to be on top of people’s minds, and hopefully getting people in their stores,” said Alessandro Migliorini, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities LLP. So far, Swiss watch makers have insulated their high-end brands from the trend, seeking to preserve the exclusivity of more traditional timepieces. The top five brands by sales, as ranked by analyst Rene Weber at Bank Vontobel — Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Patek Philippe and Longines — have stayed out of the smartwatch market entirely. The latest releases represents a change of heart for Richemont, which owns Montblanc, and Swatch, which produces Omega. Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert previously said his brands only planned to make “intelligent watch-straps” and that putting electronic functions into the watch case creates a danger of obsolescence for time-honored watchmaking practices. Swatch CEO Nick Hayek has said he doesn’t expect smartwatches to be a “revolution.” TAG Heuer wants smartwatch buyers to upgrade. With its first device, customers could pay extra to replace it with a traditional timepiece if they ever decided it was obsolete. For the new version introduced this week, which is Swiss-made, TAG Heuer is offering a module for an extra $1,650 that can swap the smartwatch with a mechanical time face. Google, Apple Google’s Android operating system is behind a number of smartwatches, including Montblanc’s new gadget, which is made in China. The US tech firm has partnered with LG, and in February Huawei launched the company’s Watch 2. Models from Motorola, Sony and Fossil also run Google’s operating system. High-profile failures, such as the death of a $17,000 luxury version of the Apple Watch and the end of smartwatch pioneer Pebble, are easier to count than successes. Market researcher IDC declared in a report this month that “wearables aren’t dead,” but growth in the category is erratic. IWC had an intelligent watch-strap plan that never saw the light of day, while Tissot is behind schedule on its Smart Touch watch, which would work with iOS and Android. IDC estimates that 19.8 million smartwatches were shipped last year, missing a previous forecast of 28.3 million. Of the top five wearable makers, Apple’s volume dropped 7.9 per cent in 2016 while shipments at Samsung rose 39 per cent, according to the firm. Switzerland exported 25.4 million wristwatches in 2016, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. The mixed results for tech giants have eased some fears in the Swiss industry, which has reported signs of sales bottoming after 19 months of declining exports. Swatch this week forecast a rebound in US and European markets after previously reporting improvement in Asia and the Mideast. Guy estimates that TAG Heuer got slightly less than than 10 per cent of its sales from its first-generation smartwatch in 2016. If the technology remains a niche product for the Swiss makers, that might be a good thing, he said. Otherwise, they risk a slippery slope in which lower-priced timepieces undercut their sales. “Watchmakers have to be careful not to start to dilute their own brand equity by launching too many smartwatches,” Guy said. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Instead, it’s like a whole new App Store … just for indie-developed games. Across the section’s dedicated featured carousel (for example) you’ll find the likes of Beglitched – which Apple describes as an amazing game about “hacking, ducks and insecurity,” alongside Nimblebit’s addictive new city builder: Bit City. More info iPhone + iPad Beglitched $3.99 More info iPhone + iPad Bit City FREE There’s also mystery abound in otherworldly adventure: Pavilion … and if you fancy delving into some puzzle action to start the week, then you will likely want to check out Mushroom 11, which Apple is calling an instant classic. More info iPhone + iPad Pavilion: Touch Edition $3.99 More info iPhone + iPad Mushroom 11 $4.99 Alongside featuring individual titles through the section, Apple is in addition splitting its new indie discovery section up into different sub-sections. These include: Our 25 Favourite Indie Games – a selection of the best in indie games according to the App Store Editors, Indie Games Celebrate Innovation … – a hand-picked list of the indie games that ooze truly-innovative gameplay … and a list of indie games that feature what Apple calls Outstanding Gameplay. There’s even a section dedicated to games that boast incredible sound design, and, of course, a place for titles that offer those unforgettable moments … UPDATE Apple has added a number of other sub-sections to its recently added Celebrating Indie Games feature section on iOS. These include: – Breakthrough gaming moments – The best games you’ve never played – Games to spend the day with On Mac Apple’s recent efforts to highlight available indie titles on the Mac App Store are less impressive – but still nonetheless notable, given that the usual state of the Top Charts rarely gives indie developers a chance on the platform. In a number of regions, (including the U.S), the digital store’s usual ‘What’s Hot’ top feature section has been replaced with one entitled: ‘Celebrating Indie Games.’ The newly-added section aims to highlight gaming titles of varying price range and user complexity, and includes the likes of: Super Hexagon, Door Kickers, Dino Run DX, Super Stickman Golf 3 (FREE), Karma. Incarnation 1. and SOMA 2015 ($29.99). … although, currently, there doesn’t appear to be a link in order to access this section directly.

Other indie Mac titles featured by the (likely temporary) spotlight section, that you may wish to check out for yourself, include: Kingdom Rush Frontier, Almost Impossible!, Shadow Blade: Reload, and Yuri.

They’re the inspiration for their new collection of fuss-free recipes including sweet potato wraps and blueberry and yogurt cake Green pea, broccoli and mint soup with puy lentil topping. Photograph: David Frenkiel Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close David Frenkiel Luise Vindahl Interview by Killian Fox Sunday 19 March 2017 05.00 EDT Last modified on Sunday 19 March 2017 05.32 EDT Two things have happened in David Frenkiel’s life recently that have prompted him to think about the meaning of home – the most obvious being that he has just written a book about it. Frenkiel is the Swede behind food blog Green Kitchen Stories, which he launched with his Danish wife Luise Vindahl in 2009. Back then, she was a health-conscious meat eater, he a carb-loving vegetarian. When they moved in together in Stockholm, she agreed to go veggie while he resolved to cut down on the pasta and pizza. The blog documented their adventures around a healthy vegetarian diet. Green Kitchen at Home, their fourth cookbook, is aimed at people who don’t have vast reserves of time on their hands. “We got requests from readers who want to eat proper vegetarian food on a day-to-day basis when they’re stressed, or working late, or have a family,” says Frenkiel. “So we tried to break down how we eat at home and build the book around that.” It helped that, just as the book went to print last October, Vindahl gave birth to Gabriel, their third child. So Green Kitchen at Home, with its shortcuts and fuss-free recipes, is also responding to their own domestic situation. The second thing that made Frenkiel reflect on home happened shortly before Gabriel was born. Last September, he flew to Istanbul, then headed south to Antakya, not far across the border from Aleppo. He had been invited to the Turkish city by the UN World Food Programme to help draw attention to the growing refugee crisis. The plan was to visit Syrian families and cook with them, then post about his encounters on Instagram. On the first day, visiting a woman called Suad who had fled Aleppo with her young family and was now living in a tiny rundown apartment in Antakya’s old town, Frenkiel found it hard to break the ice. “I’m an almost-2m-tall white man and she’s a short, pregnant, quite religious Syrian woman. It was difficult to really connect. But once we started cooking – she showed me how to make a Syrian tabbouleh – we both immediately started relaxing.” The experience has clearly had a big effect on Frenkiel and he’s hoping to work with the World Food Programme again – there’s talk of running workshops with Syrian kids in Jordan. “Even though we might use quinoa at home and they might use bulgur, we can cook together, eat together and become closer,” he says. KF Full vegetarian breakfast Facebook Twitter Pinterest Full vegetarian breakfast. Photograph: David Frenkiel We make this modernised, vegetarian interpretation of a full English whenever we crave something savoury in the morning. It’s warm, filling and generous without being too heavy. Apple and kale keep the flavours interesting, while browned onions, mushrooms, sweet potatoes and sprouts make it rich and hearty. We love to add some sriracha or gochujang sauce for a sweet and spicy flavour punch, but regular chilli sauce or even a good-quality ketchup can be used instead. The servings are quite generous here, so if you are a small family, it should still be enough for all of you with the addition of one or two extra eggs. Serves 2 extra-virgin olive oil 2 tbsp onion 1, peeled sweet potato ½, peeled brussels sprouts 10, trimmed mushrooms 10 of your choice, cleaned cherry tomatoes 10 red apple 1, cored cavolo nero or curly kale 2 handfuls, stems removed ground cayenne pepper a pinch free-range eggs 2 Heat the oil in a medium-sized frying pan on a medium heat. Finely slice the onion, add it to the pan and sauté for about 5 minutes or until it begins to soften. Thinly slice the sweet potato, cut the sprouts in half and roughly chop the mushrooms. Add them to the pan and sauté for 5 more minutes. Cut 5 of the tomatoes in half (leaving the others whole), thinly slice the apple and roughly chop the cavolo nero or kale. Add them to the pan along with the cayenne pepper, season to taste with salt and pepper and sauté for a further 5 minutes or until all of the vegetables are tender. Create two small wells in the vegetable mixture and crack an egg into each one. Cook the eggs to your liking. Serve straight from the pan, topped with a drizzle of spicy sauce or ketchup. Black rice, lentil and aubergine pilaf Facebook Twitter Pinterest Black rice, lentil and aubergine pilaf. Photograph: David Frenkiel I would put this recipe somewhere in between a pilaf and a salad, as it has both the qualities of flavoured rice and a generous, hearty salad. Serves 6 black or brown rice 200g, rinsed green lentils 200g, rinsed cardamom seeds 1 tsp sea salt 1 tsp extra-virgin olive oil 8 tbsp lemons juice of 1½ ground cumin ½ tsp ground turmeric ½ tsp chilli powder ½ tsp sea salt flakes a pinch aubergine 1, stem removed cucumber ½, topped and tailed, halved and seeds removed red onion ½, peeled avocado 1 ripe, stone removed and flesh scooped out spinach 100g fresh mint 1 handful (25g), leaves picked dried apricot halves 20 sea salt and freshly ground black pepper To serve full-fat plain unsweetened yogurt pistachio nuts roughly chopped Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6 and line a baking tray with parchment. Place the rice, lentils, cardamom, salt and 1 litre water in a medium-sized saucepan, cover and bring to the boil, then simmer for about 30 minutes or until tender and the water has been absorbed. Drain any excess water and set aside to cool. Meanwhile, place half the oil, juice of 1 lemon, spices and salt in a medium-sized mixing bowl and whisk until combined. Cut the aubergine into bite-sized pieces, add to the bowl, toss until well coated and transfer to the baking tray. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until tender and golden. Set aside to cool. In the meantime, slice the cucumber, finely slice the onion, cut the avocado into bite-sized pieces and roughly chop the spinach, mint and apricots. Put the rice and lentils in a serving bowl, add the remaining oil and juice of ½ lemon and toss to coat. Add the aubergine and the rest of the ingredients, season to taste and gently toss to combine. Serve topped yogurt and pistachio nuts. Tip Rice can differ in cooking time. Choose a variety with the same cooking time as your lentils. Green pea, broccoli and mint soup with puy lentil topping Serves 4 coconut oil or olive oil 1 tbsp onion 1, peeled garlic 2 cloves, peeled fresh ginger 2 tbsp, peeled and grated frozen green peas 250g fresh broccoli 250g, stalks included, roughly chopped (or frozen broccoli florets) vegetable stock 500ml sea salt and freshly ground black pepper coconut milk 1 × 400g tin fresh mint leaves 20 For the puy lentil topping cooked puy lentils 200g extra-virgin olive oil 1 tbsp unwaxed lemon zest of ½ sea salt and freshly ground black pepper To serve toasted pumpkin seeds fresh mint or purple shiso leaves sea salt and freshly ground black pepper extra-virgin olive oil toasted sourdough garlic bread To prepare the lentil topping, add the cooked lentils to a small bowl, stir through the oil and zest and seasoning to taste. Set aside. For the soup, heat the oil in a large saucepan on a medium-low heat. Roughly chop the onion and garlic, add them to the pan along with the ginger and sauté for about 10 minutes or until the onion begins to soften. Add the peas and broccoli and sauté for a further 5 minutes. Add the stock and season to taste. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer until the vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally so the soup doesn’t burn. Remove from the heat and stir through the coconut milk and mint. Using an immersion (hand) blender or food processor, blend until smooth. Top with a sprinkling of lentils, pumpkin seeds, mint and some seasoning and a drizzle of oil, along with toast on the side. Fifty shades of greens Facebook Twitter Pinterest Fifty shades of greens. Photograph: David Frenkiel This was one of the first dishes I cooked for Luise and I like to think that it was then and there that she fell for me (and not watching my drunk feet trying to seduce her on the dance floor a week earlier). The original version didn’t include quite as many green vegetables – it was made with double (heavy) cream and served with pasta – but the essence was the same: green, creamy and delicious. You can use frozen broccoli and spinach instead of fresh, swap peas for beans and use olives instead of capers. If you don’t fancy coconut milk or cream, use ordinary cream, Greek yogurt (added right at the end) or a vegan alternative. This can be served with cooked quinoa, millet, rice or any pasta of choice. Serves 4 coconut oil or extra virgin olive oil 3 tbsp onion 1, peeled garlic 2 cloves, peeled fresh thyme 8 sprigs, leaves picked, or 1 tsp dried thyme broccoli 1 head and stalk courgette 1 capers 3 tbsp, plus brine white wine 120ml frozen green peas 190g spinach 100g full-fat coconut cream or milk 1 × 400g tin vegetable stock 250ml sea salt and freshly ground black pepper unwaxed lemon zest and juice of ½ To serve quinoa or cooked grain or pasta of choice roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley Heat the oil in a large saucepan on a medium-low heat. Finely chop the onion, garlic and thyme, transfer to the pan and sauté for about 10 minutes or until the onion begins to soften. Cut the broccoli into small florets, trim and slice the stalk and cut the courgette into half circles. Add the vegetables to the pan along with the capers and brine and sauté for a further 5 minutes, then add the wine. Once the alcohol has evaporated, add the peas, spinach, coconut cream and stock and season. Bring to the boil then reduce the heat and simmer until the vegetables are tender and the sauce has thickened, stirring from time to time so the sauce doesn’t burn. Remove from the heat and stir through the lemon zest and juice. Serve with quinoa, topped with a sprinkling of parsley. Middle Eastern sweet potato wraps Facebook Twitter Pinterest Middle Eastern sweet potato wraps. Photograph: David Frenkiel Roasted sweet potato slices are on weekly rotation in our home, tucking them into salads, mixing them with cooked lentils as a hearty dinner, placing them inside mayo sandwiches, or in wraps like this one here. The boiled eggs make it a more substantial meal; dates, pomegranate and feta add a burst of flavours, and lettuce and cucumber keep it light and fresh. Serves 2 sweet potato 1 small ground cumin ½ tsp ground turmeric ¼ tsp sea salt ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper ¼ tsp extra-virgin olive oil 2 tbsp wholegrain or buckwheat tortillas or flatbreads 2 mixed lettuce 2 small handfuls (50g) cucumber slices 10 hard-boiled eggs 2 free-range, peeled and quartered soft dates 2, pitted and thinly sliced feta 40g, crumbled pomegranate ¼, seeded tahini 2 tbsp sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6 and line a baking tray with parchment paper. Wash and dry the sweet potato then slice it into 5mm thick rounds (with the skin on). Put the rounds in a bowl along with the spices, salt, pepper and oil and toss until well coated. Spread the sweet potato out in a single layer on the baking tray and bake for 20-30 minutes or until soft and golden with crispy edges. Turn the slices over halfway through the cooking time to ensure that they bake evenly. Remove from the oven and set aside while you start assembling the tortillas. Heat the tortillas in the oven for a couple of minutes then lay them flat on a board. Fill the centre of each tortilla with a line of the lettuce, then top with the baked sweet potato, followed by the cucumber, eggs, dates and feta and, finally, a sprinkling of the pomegranate seeds, a drizzle of the tahini and a pinch of the salt and pepper. Gently fold the bottom of each tortilla up to cover part of the filling, before folding one side in towards the centre, followed by the other. Enjoy! Tip If you can’t find soft dates, soak dried dates in hot water for 20 minutes. Shattered blueberry and yogurt cake Facebook Twitter Pinterest Shattered blueberry and yogurt cake. Photograph: David Frenkiel We got the idea from a deconstructed chocolate cake we had at a Copenhagen rooftop restaurant a couple of years ago. By shattering the cake and layering the pieces with yogurt and whipped cream it looks even more decadent and it also turns the serving process into a lottery, as the pieces come in all shapes and sizes. As spectacular as it might look, the great flavour and texture are actually our favourite things about this cake. Light, moist and sweet, with pieces of blueberries breaking through. Serves 8 Dry ingredients rolled oats 100g almond flour 100g rice flour 80g baking powder 1 tsp sea salt ½ tsp vanilla extract ½ tsp Wet ingredients butter 100g, at room temperature pure maple syrup or runny honey 160ml unwaxed lemon zest of 1 full-fat plain unsweetened yogurt 250ml eggs 3 free-range, separated blueberries or berries of choice 300g, fresh or frozen (thawed) To serve full-fat plain unsweetened yogurt whipped cream fresh berries of choice Preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4, grease a 20cm springform cake tin and line it with parchment paper. Place the oats in a food processor and blend until the texture resembles coarse flour. Transfer to a large mixing bowl, add the rest of the dry ingredients and stir until combined. Make a well in the centre and set aside while you prepare the wet ingredients. Cut the butter into cubes and add it to the bowl of a stand mixer along with the maple syrup and lemon zest and mix until well combined and creamy. Add the yogurt and egg yolks, mix until just combined and set aside. Place the egg whites in a clean, dry bowl of the stand mixer or in a medium sized mixing bowl and beat until soft peaks form. Using a spatula, gently fold the wet ingredients, followed by the egg whites and half the blueberries, into the dry ingredients until just combined, making sure not to over-mix as the cake will be compact otherwise. Pour the cake batter into the tin, scatter the remaining blueberries on top and bake for about 1 hour or until golden and a skewer inserted in the centre of the cake comes out clean. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool slightly in the tin before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Store the cake at room temperature in an airtight container and it will keep for 3-5 days. When ready to serve, carefully break the cake up into different-sized pieces and separate them slightly, while still maintaining the overall circular shape of the cake. Serve topped with dollops of yogurt, cream and a scattering of berries. • Green Kitchen at Home by David Frenkiel and Luise Vindahl is published by Hardie Grant (£25).

Hot Topics: SUNSHINE FIRE Arapahoe Road crash Boulder Canyon cyclist crash Boulder Falls still closed Missing climber News tips Print   Email   Font Resize Ask Dave Taylor: What's an 'unlocked' phone? By Dave Taylor For the Camera Posted:   03/18/2017 01:56:01 PM MDT Updated:   03/18/2017 01:56:21 PM MDT Dave Taylor For the Camera Q: I was looking on Craigslist for a replacement iPhone 6 after I shattered my screen and don't understand what "unlocked" phones are and why I would want to buy one. Can you explain? A: First off, before you replace your Apple iPhone 6, check out both the Apple repair program and third-party iPhone screen replacement options. I went to a local place in Boulder when my phone screen cracked and for about $75 they replaced it with a brand new pristine screen. Better yet, they were done and it was ready to pick up in under 90 minutes. If your phone is more damaged, then you'll want to try and get one last backup then wipe all the data off it before you proceed. Go into your cellphone carrier store and ask them for help on that process. They might be able to salvage your simcard, too — that's the "brains" of your phone and identifies it on the cellular network. Move that to a new phone and the new phone rings when you get a call. Purchasing a used third-party smartphone is a reasonable approach, too, and do some research (I suggest eBay) to find out the going price of a particular device. That varies by cellular carrier, too, believe it or not. A brand new 16GB iPhone 6 for the AT&T network should run you about $300. If it's a lot cheaper, it's quite possibly stolen, so be extra leery of that. Advertisement Tip: You can check if a smartphone is stolen by asking the seller for the 15-digit IMEI number and then checking in with your carrier. If they don't want to share that info, walk away. Some cellular carriers "lock" their phones to their network, so if you buy an iPhone from a Verizon customer and want to use it on the AT&T network, for example, that probably won't work. Most of the time you can sidestep this by simply buying a used phone from someone using the same carrier. There are also ways that hackers can remove the carrier lock feature. Those freed phones are known as "unlocked" phones. Easy enough. Since we have so much critical and personal data on our smartphones now, I recommend a non-hacked replacement that's from the same carrier network. Check the IMEI to ensure it's not stolen — before you exchange payment — and then wipe the phone with a full factory reset before you start configuring it for your own use. Don't forget that your old phone still has lots of personal data on it, so you'll want to wipe that one, too, or completely destroy it if you're going to recycle it.

Reuters/Eric Gaillard Samsung has tried targeting working professionals with its newly unveiled Galaxy Book. The Apple iPad Pro is more like a high-powered tablet that some may feel is slightly over-priced. The Galaxy device is a tablet that can be a direct replacement for a laptop. The Samsung device has Windows 10 operating system, stylus and keyboard as a bundle. It provides a desktop feel to the tablet, more than the Apple device. The Super AMOLED screen is also a unique selling point for the tablet. However, it will be interesting to see whether the Samsung Galaxy Book can convert Apple loyalists and make them switch. New Atlas has compared the two devices with screen sizes 12-inch for the Book and 12.9-inch for the iPad Pro. Various other sizes are available along with slightly different configuration. Both devices are tablets first and have optional keyboard accessories that convert them into viable laptop replacements. The Samsung device is a bit thicker and is a smaller device. In the landscape orientation, it is however five percent shorter and 11 percent narrower. The Book is heavier than the iPad though both have aluminium build. While the Galaxy device is available in Silver and Black colour options, the Apple tablet comes in Silver, Gold and Gray. The iPad has a 4:3 display compared to the 3:2 display of Galaxy tab. The Samsung Galaxy Book has a display resolution of 2,160 x 1,440 pixels and 216ppi, making it a bit less sharper than Apple tablet’s 2,732 x 2,048 pixels and 264ppi. While both the tablets have their own advanced styluses, the 12-inch Galaxy Book has the battery-free S Pen included in the box. Apple fans have to shell out $99 for the stylus. The Apple Pencil charges via the Lightning Port. Even the keyboard accessories have to be bought separately for Apple, though Samsung includes them. While the Apple iPad Pro only has the 4GB RAM option, the Galaxy Book comes with a 4 or 8GB RAM option. The latter uses a seventh generation Intel core i5 chip, whereas the Apple device has the A9X processor. 128 and 256GB storage options are available for the Galaxy device. The iPad Pro is available in three storage variants, though the 32GB model is available only in the Wi-Fi model. Apple has no microSD option but Samsung has. Even though the Samsung model packs more megapixels in its camera, the iPad Pro is equally efficient in taking amazing photos. Both are available in standard Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi + LTE variants and have similar battery capacities. The USB Type-C ports are included in the Samsung Galaxy Book, while the Apple iPad Pro only has the Lightning port for charging and data transfer. Biometric login is only present in the Apple tab. One runs on Windows 10 while the other on iOS 10.

Home Tools Solano News US / World Opinion Features Entertainment Sports Business Real Estate Obituaries Gallery Classifieds 7,878 123 FAIRFIELD-SUISUN, CALIFORNIA Business Soldier-turned-robotics-CEO has a special understanding of his product’s need By The Washington Post From page B9 | March 19, 2017 Shahar Abuhazira knows about dark places. He had the dicey assignment of crawling into tunnels to find terrorists as an infantry officer with the Israeli Defense Forces. “These are small and narrow places, a very dangerous environment,” the businessman said. Those missions prepared Abuhazira, 36, for his work as the chief executive of a Gaithersburg, Maryland, company called Roboteam. It sells high-tech robots capable of carrying out at least some of the dangerous tasks he once performed, whether for a National Guardsman patrolling tunnels on the border of Mexico or a soldier in Gaza, Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq. “I knew after being in combat situations that I wanted to do things that will help protect and train soldiers and make it safer for them,” said Abuhazira, an accountant by training. He also knew he wanted to create a successful defense business. He has ventured into a crowded field against experienced rivals such as defense giant Northrop Grumman and QinetiQ North America, a publicly held company based in Britain. Roboteam’s mechanical troops keep the soldier/operators far from the unknown. The machines can snoop around corners, climb up and down stairways, case an empty building, listen for a conversation, cut a wire and even disarm a bomb. Roboteam was started in 2009 and has grown to more than 100 employees, three-quarters of whom are U.S. military veterans. That makes sense: 95 percent of its $50 million in annual revenue is generated in the United States. “The smartest thing I did is to hire only U.S. military veterans,” he said. “It helped us to get to the customer by better understanding the needs and developing the solutions that the warfighter will love.” Abuhazira said that Roboteam is profitable. He would not say how profitable. The company has sold nearly 1,000 remote-controlled gadgets to governments in 20 countries, including Australia, Poland, France, Italy, Israel, the United States, Britain and Canada. The machines are designed in Tel Aviv and Maryland, and are built in factories in Pennsylvania and Baltimore. Roboteam’s big sell is making a tool so simple that anyone can use it. There is no need to have a computer specialist helicoptered in or have an officer assigned to the unit as “the robot guy.” The business model is taken from a page of the Apple playbook. “Apple took a phone that is more sophisticated than any other phone, but made it with only one button,” Abuhazira said. “They made the phone very simple and intuitive. This is what we wanted to do with robots.” Another piece is the ability to adapt the gadget to the customer’s needs. Roboteam releases new versions of its machines once a year, similar to the frequent revisions Apple makes to its iPhones. As Abuhazira sees it: “We brought the Silicon Valley approach to the defense market.” The gizmos are so light that you can hoist one onto your back. The IRIS (Individual Robotic Intelligence System) robot reminds me of the toy Tonka trunks I used to play with. (My mother took them away a decade ago.) The IRIS sells for $15,000 and is designed to strap to a soldier’s thigh. Soldiers toss it through a window or around a corner so the little robot, which is built to always land upright, can sniff out danger on the other side of the wall. The sales pitch is that the tablets used to operate the robots are so simple that a soldier needs zero training with them. “You throw it and just work with it,” he said. “You don’t need your commander or someone. You don’t need a manual. You have one button, and it’s simple to operate.” Roboteam’s timing could make it a fortune. The U.S. military is in the midst of replacing 7,000 robots that it has purchased since the beginning of the Iraq War in 2003, according to National Defense, a publication that covers military business and technology. Abuhazira said that the company six months ago received $50 million from Israeli and Singapore investors that will help it ramp up production to meet the demand and perhaps even get into the consumer market. In addition to the IRIS, Roboteam manufactures two other models. The big seller is the MTGR – for Micro Tactical Ground Robot – which is about 28 pounds and sells for $70,000 per unit. The MTGR accounts for around a third of the company’s revenue. The battery-operated robot runs for up to four hours and has up to eight day-and-night cameras spanning 360 degrees. There is even a microphone for telling the bad guys to surrender. The soldier can run the MTGR from a tablet the size of a iPad from up to 1,600 feet away. The MTGR is used mostly for tunnels and culvert inspection to find or spy on the enemy. The third big gizmo in Roboteam’s arsenal is the Probot, which is essentially a mini-trailer the size of a riding lawn mower. The Probot is designed to carry – quietly – nearly a ton of equipment, ammunition or even injured soldiers to places a Humvee cannot reach. The Probot comes with a “follow me” kit that allows the robot to see its squad and follow a few yards behind for 72 hours. Roboteam was founded in late 2009, by Yosi Wolf and Elad Levy. Both Wolf and Levy once served in the Israeli Air Force and came from robotics backgrounds. Levy is the chief executive of the Israeli operation; Wolf no longer works on the defense side of the business. They had an idea to bring unmanned, ground vehicles to land forces. Up until then, land robots were the exclusive domain of specialists who worked with highly explosive devices. They are known as EOD technicians, for their work on explosive ordinance devices. Several of Roboteam’s staffers are former EOD technicians with U.S. military backgrounds. Wolf and Levy contacted Abuhazira through a mutual friend, and he joined the Roboteam in January 2012. Abuhazira grew up in a small city south of Tel Aviv and studied accounting and business at a campus in Beer-Sheeva after military service. “I left the military and thought, ‘It will be nice to learn business and accounting,’ ” he said. “I knew I was not going to work as an accountant, but it helps me even today. I have strong financial capabilities.” Abuhazira had experience in the military industry. After college, he had worked more than seven years at Bagira Systems, an Israeli company that develops training and simulation technology for the military. Roboteam entered the market with a splash. The first big contract came a few months after Abuhazira joined the company. It was a $9.8 million job to build and deliver 100 MTGRs to U.S. military counterterrorism units. Other contracts filtered in, including a $25 million U.S. Air Force contract for a man-carried MTGR that beat out QinetiQ and iRobot, essentially establishing Roboteam as a player, Abuhazira said. Roboteam released five products in rapid succession and won robotic competitions in the United States, Britain, Australia, Israel, Poland and Switzerland. “The thing I like the most is to support the soldiers,” he said. “That’s more my thing and not sitting behind a computer and running big Excel files.” It also beats climbing into a dark, dangerous tunnel.

NEWS REVIEWS FEATURES WIN NEWSLETTER PHOTO AWARDS NEWS REVIEWS FEATURES WIN NEWSLETTER PHOTO AWARDS Search for: Apple iPhone 8: Everything we know so far Seriously expensive? All the stories and speculation about Apple’s next flagship 19 March 2017 by Stuff Staff Sure, the iPhone 7 only launched in September – but things move quickly in the world of Apple. In fact, judging by prior form and industry sources, production and development of the next Cupertino flagship is well underway. There’s no better time than the present, then, to pore over the raft of rumours, leaks and speculation flying around about the next-gen iPhone. What’s in store? Well, as ever, it’s tough to make concrete predictions about what the iPhone 8 – or, perhaps, the iPhone 7s – will offer Apple fans until we see more solid evidence, leaked or otherwise. That said, with 2017 being the 10-year anniversary of the iPhone, if you believe the hype, something big could well be on the cards. Read on to find out more. WHAT WE KNOW >>> It’ll (probably) be all-glass It’s very early days, but there are already several shreds of evidence to suggest that 2017’s iPhone will be an all-glass affair. Okay, so it’ll probably still have a metal frame around its midriff but, whether to differentiate itself from the ever-growing pack of smartphone slabs or to do something special for the iPhone’s 10th birthday, several sources are pointing to a glass front-and-back design. If you’re wondering whether that’ll be really rather risky, well, it’ll probably be properly tough glass, too. It’s long been suggested that Apple might stick the sapphire crystal of its Watch on an iPhone – but that might be prohibitively expensive. A more reasonable option could well be to sheath it in Phire, a new, scratch resistant material being developed by Gorilla Glass makers Corning. >>> It might have a curved AMOLED display Every time a new iPhone comes up for discussion, it’s inevitable that speculation about its screen will be near the top of the list. What size, what shape, what spec: all hot topics amongst industry sources and rumour-mongers – and that’s as much the case with the next iPhone. There’s growing evidence that the 2017 iPhone will feature a display that’s curved in some way – whether at the edges or entirely. Yes, we’ve heard it before and, yes, we’re reluctant to put ourselves out there without more than a patent to go on – but, that said, given the success of Samsung’s Edge hardware, now could well be the time for Apple to go bendy. On the other hand, some have suggested, based on early evidence and the presence of the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro, that secondary displays on the device’s edge are as likely as a curved screen. We’re now expecting one single display, which is split into two “parts” through software – a 5.15in main screen, and a smaller secondary “function area” beneath it. The screen itself will be around 5.8in, but have much slimmer bezels than the ones we’re used to seeing on an iPhone. What’s more, more than one source has suggested we’ll see Apple move from its current LCD tech to some form of OLED for its display – whether to facilitate something flexible, or to counteract the added weight of the all-glass body. >>> It’ll be seriously expensive As if Apple’s steadily rising prices haven’t already added up so that every new iPhone makes a bigger dent on your bank balance, the iPhone 8 could be the most expensive one yet. Reports suggesting the AMOLED screens Apple will be using cost more to produce than the iPhone 7’s LCD display probably mean Apple will be passing that increase on to its customers. It’s all down to Apple wanting to use 3D Touch with AMOLED, which is proving trickier to do than with LCD. That could bump the cost well over US$1000 when the phone eventually arrives. >>> It’ll charge wirelessly More than one source has pointed towards the long-awaited wireless charging smarts finally arriving with next year’s iPhone. In fact, there’s evidence that Apple has been puzzling over how to achieve wireless charging at greater distances than the current haul of docks and mats permits. With limited NFC – largely for Apple Pay – introduced on the iPhone 6, many believe it’s high time for Apple to ship its flagship with wire-free charging. We’d have to agree. >>> It might ditch the home button If several key sources are to be believed, the next iPhone will do to the home button what the iPhone 7 did to the headphone jack. Apple went halfway with the 7, ditching the actual button aspect of its home button in favour of a sapphire glass circle with taptic feedback. Now, there’s mounting evidence to suggest Apple will be scrapping it altogether. How would that work? Well, a patent has surfaced – yes, one of those again – for a fingerprint scanner built-in to the actual glass, something that’s already been partially demonstrated by Chinese mobile manufacturer Xiaomi, which would do away with the need for a home button. This would fit with the all-glass rumours, as well as suggestions that the bezels on the new iPhone will be far smaller – though it would also require an iOS re-design to add a digital home button. The latest reports suggest a “function area” in place of the Touch ID home button, which would hold virtual buttons and interactive icons – a lot like the Touch Bar on the latest MacBook Pro. This wouldn’t be a separate display, like it is on the MacBook or on HTC’s U Ultra, but a part of the main screen. >>> It’ll be picky about its camera lenses There’s no word yet on the actual tech that’ll go into the next iPhone’s camera, but it has been suggested by more than one industry expert – most notably Ming-Chi Kuo – that the next iPhone edition will keep its dual-camera tech for the premium Plus model, rather than sharing its smarts across the range. Boo. >>> It’ll come in new colours Perhaps less revelatory than some of the other rumours circulating, there’s a suggestion that the new iPhone will come in at least two new colours – red and blue. OK, it’s hardly ground-breaking, but it is a departure from the muted tones usually associated with Apple’s flagships – and it’s something that was signalled, perhaps, by the Jet Black iPhone 7. Will we see a 5c rivalling colour line-up? Probably not, but it would be nice to see Apple affording its customers the luxury of a little more choice. >>> It might come in three models A 4.7in device, a 5in device and a 5.5in device, according to some. That line-up would fit well with an upgrade to the iPhone SE, alongside either an iPhone 8 and an iPhone 8 Plus. Or not. The latest theory suggests Apple will go big on the display, but slim down the bezels, effectively making a phone with the same screen space as an iPhone 7 Plus, but the same physical size as the iPhone 7. There would be no need for a larger phone to launch alongside it, so the next iPhone could arrive as a single, one-size-fits-all handset. >>> It might be the iPhone 7s You might have noticed that we’re being a little coy about what to call the next iPhone. That’s because no-one’s sure whether it will be the 7s or the 8. Apple has in recent years followed a fairly linear strategy of releasing a full upgrade one year, followed by an ‘S’ upgrade the next. Why would it break that cycle? Well, because of that 10-year anniversary. Would the Cupertino company really ship a marginally upgraded iPhone 7s on this grand occasion? Our heads say maybe – our hearts hope otherwise. ALL THE LATEST NEWS Wondering what our sources are? Well, you can put down the ketchup: here’s every story, rumour, leak and speculation we’ve spotted in the wild over the last few months. > 15 March 2017 Parts supplier TPK Holding has revealed (via 9to5Mac) the cost of each AMOLED screen being used for the upcoming anniversary edition phone – and it’s more than Apple currently pays for its LCD displays. Rather than paying £6 per screen for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the iPhone 8’s screen will cost twice the price. That will almost definitely mean a price bump for customers once the phone arrives. Expect the next iPhone to be seriously expensive. > 17 February 2017 9to5Mac reports that KGI research analyst (and source of accurate leaks in the past) Ming-Chi Kuo has the latest info on the next iPhone’s screen. Apparently it’ll use a 5.8in OLED display, but with significantly slimmer bezels than previous phones. That means it can squeeze a much bigger display into a phone the same size as the current iPhone 7. The actual display area will be around 5.15in, because the bottom part of the screen will be dedicated to a “function area”, that replaces the physical home button with an interactive control panel – a lot like the current MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. > 8 December 2016 TechRadar picks up a report by Japanese blog Mac Otakara that the iPhone 8 – or, possibly, the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus – might well come in a red colour option as well as, possibly, a new Deep Blue. > 8 December 2016 SlashGear reports that the 2017 iPhones may, in fact, be the 7s and 7s Plus, according to Apple’s Taiwanese suppliers. It suggests that the only significant detail to change on next year’s models will be the processor, whilst the raft of major upgrades for the iPhone 8 will be delayed until 2018. > 7 December 2016 Bloomberg reports that Foxconn – long-time assembler of Apple products – has confirmed plans for investment and expansion in the US. > 28 November 2016 The Wall Street Journal publishes a story claiming that Apple is working on as many as 10 prototypes for its next handset. The biggest revelation? That at least one of the pre-production models carries a curved screen. The story also claims that Apple’s suppliers have been tasked with producing more OLED displays and screens with higher resolutions than those of arch rival Samsung. > 23 November 2016 The New York Times publishes a transcript of a phone conversation with Donald Trump, in which he suggests he might persuade Apple to move production of future products – apparently including the iPhone 8 – to factories in the United States. > 26 October 2016 Nikkei Asian Review publishes another article, this time suggesting that three iPhone models will be launched in 2017: a 4.7in device, a 5in device and 5.5in device. What’s more, the story builds on rumours that the new iPhones wil carry backs made of glass, manufactured by a Chinese company, in a move away from the present metal shells. > 11 October 2016 A second United States Patent surfaces detailing an Apple patent for a “display-integrated light sensor” that “can be implemented as an ambient light sensor or a proximity sensor”. > 4 October 2016 United States Patent is granted to Apple for “a capacitive fingerprint sensor” that’s “formed within the dielectric structure.” > 28 September 2016 Trusted Reviews publishes a story exploring the possibility that Apple will implement an in-screen fingerprint scanner on the all-glass iPhone 8. The suggestion is based on tech already in use by Chinese mobile maker Xiaomi, with the implication that Apple might utilise an ultrasonic scanner, without a home button or indent. > 12 September 2016 9to5Mac quotes statements by industry insider Ming-Chi Kuo that iPhone 7 Plus’ dual-camera tech will remain exclusive to Apple’s premium iPhone models, citing a need to keep costs down and retain an incentive for buyers to opt for the more expensive Plus. > 09 August 2016 Patently Apple reports that Apple has been granted a patent for a curved display, with plans suggesting the presence of displays of some sort on the phone’s edge. > 20 May 2016 Nikkei Asian Review shares a story detailing claims by Allen Horng, chairman and chief exec of Catcher Technology (a supplier to Apple), that one iPhone model next year will adopt a glass casing – though it will reportedly still have a metal frame surround. > 23 April 2016 Storm.mg suggests the iPhone 7 might scrap the home button altogether, in favour of an inductive design. > 17 April 2016 MacRumours picks up a report by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggesting that Apple’s 2017 devices will ditch their present aluminium casings in favour of something new – most likely glass. Why? Kuo suggests it’s in order to “enhance the competitiveness” of the iPhone in a market dominated by metal-skinned smartphones. Kuo further suggests that lightweight AMOLED displays may be implemented on the next generation Apple mobiles, in part to compensate for the heavier glass components. > 28 January 2016 Bloomberg reports that Apple is developing wireless charging for its iPhones and that the cable-free tech could be seen on its smartphones as soon as 2017. According to the story, Apple is researching technologies to allow phones to charge at further distances than those offered by charging mats at the moment.

While not the first to do this, Apple’s model caught consumer attention for ease of use. But due to a lack of marketing attention, it has languished. Not so with the D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion. D-Link has taken the router portability concept and beefed it up to the point where it’s a valid buy for the home network user as well as the “road warrior.” At its heart, the D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion is a portable router. But it’s in how easily and sensibly that it performs this task that its value can be found. Quick note: You might want to check out the included Quick Install guide — as it provides codes for a mobile app to use with iOS/Android devices. You’d find out about this later, but worth noting now, I think. The D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion can be used in three configurations — all of which affects the wireless network; in the router mode, it’s connected directly to a modem and so functions as a wireless network; in Repeater mode it amplifiers and extends an existing wireless network; in Wi-Fi hotspot mode it becomes the focal point for multiple wireless devices seeking connection through a private network of your choosing. The setup is as simple for each mode as expected from D-Link. The D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion plugs directly into an AC outlet — wait for the front-mounted LED to stop blinking and go solid green first. Set up is simple and I waited to try and use it in a hotel room during a recent trip. I adjusted the top-mounted tab to “Router” and then plugged it into the AC socket. Then I plugged the included Ethernet cable into it and the Ethernet socket in the wall. To set up a wireless network, I just went into the Network settings of the device I wanted to use (could have been a laptop but was an iPad), and entered the necessary information and security codes provided — it’s on a business-side card you can put away in your wallet. Once done, I had a wireless connection. If I had been at home, or was doing this in a larger space than a hotel room, I could have chosen the “Repeater” mode instead — dissimilar steps to set it up but in general pretty much the same, although you use a web browser as part of the process (http://dlinkrouter.local for Mac or if you’re a Windows person —  http://dlinkrouter). I had no need for a private network, but can see where this could be useful with a group that’s on location. Stepping back a moment, let me note that besides that information card, D-Link includes a flat, rubberized Ethernet cable that takes up much less room that a standard model. A nice addition, thanks. Because of the simplicity of the D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion Review, I neglected to give the guided tour. Not that there’s a lot to see — besides the already-noted LED and the toggle tab on top, the bottom finds the Ethernet socket, a reset button next to it and a USB socket at the other end. More on this now. Accessing stored information — be that data content or multimedia content (i.e., video, music) can be done locally by attaching a USB device (thumb drive, etc.) to that USB socket directly. This obviates the need for accessing from the “Cloud,” and so provides both a greater security for the contents as well as eliminating transmission issues, since it will be streamed locally. D-Link makes an app available to access the storage. It’s called “SharePort” and is designed specifically to access stored multimedia content from a D-Link compatible router such as the D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion Review. I used it with a variety of content — none of which used exotic file formats — and it all worked fine as a viewing application. I wouldn’t just count on it for all possible uses with the storage, however, so don’t get lazy. I haven’t gone into discussions of how stable and dependable the 802.11 N wireless transmission from the D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion is. That should tell you there’s nothing to complain about. In general the signal strength was never too weak to adequately perform in a high-definition environment. Of course there’s little problems space-wise in a hotel room, but in greater spaces I would expect its use would require some accommodation on the part of the user. I should probably note that there’s a WPS button on the side to initiate an auto protected/security between the D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion and another device. Those who like such things will find it usable — me, I just go the manual route so I know everything is set up like it should be. For more info on this you should go to the D-Link website and download the digital manual. You can also check into any firmware upgrades here as well — you’d download them on a computer connected to the D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion and then transfer them over, much in the same manner as you would when using one of D-Link’s other routers. Editor’s Rating: [rating:4/5] Great Bottom line: The D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion is a device that has dual purposes: those at home can use it to initiate or extend their existing wireless network, while travelers can use it to provide easier networking/local storage access while on-the-go. Regardless of which, you can’t fault the straightforward manner in which the $99 retail D-Link DIR-505 All-in-One Mobile Companion provides networking capabilities. Pros SharePort Mobile app works with all D-Link DIR-series routers Compact form factor USB socket can charge devices Cons No extension capabilities for AC plug No mention of online manual Tweet It Like It Google + Linkedin Pin it Stumble Marshal Rosenthal Marshal Rosenthal is a Los Angeles-based freelance writer and journalist specializing in technology, consumer electronics and pop culture.

I wonder if it could enable access to a large external HDD, not just a USB stick. Reply Ian Williams on Hi, any idea of the range of this gadget when being used as a repeater? Reply Geeknizer on can I use this device in hostpost / repeater mode to extend LAN ethernet? i.e. suppose i want to connect my TV (which is ethernet only) to existing wifi network, can this device share network to Ethernet porT? Reply Marshal on If I understand you correctly, you can not connect the Ethernet port on your TV to the unit since that is reserved for the incoming Internet connection. You’d have to use a WiFi enabled TV or an adapter connected to the TV as is the case with some models of TVs as well as Blu-ray players) to be able to gain a signal. Now if what you are saying is can this be used as a repeater specifically, I would say that’s a good question as it’s not designed for that use. Granted you could plug it into an existing router to gain a WiFi signal but then it’s being at the router obviates it being used elsewhere. So I would say no. Reply Geeknizer on Thats sad that it wont bridge ethernet. Why in the world do they call this port Internet/LAN if latter is not supported Reply csi123 on “Now if what you are saying is can this be used as a repeater specifically… it’s not designed for that use.” No sure what you meant here. One specific function of the device is to act as a repeater. It is however not a bridge so you can’t use it to bridge the TV to an existing wifi network. If you need a travel router that can act as a bridge, take a look at the one from Asus (WL-330N3G) instead. Reply Gerry on Yes, you can. While using the dir-505 in repeater mode I hooked up the ethernet cable to the dir-505 and found it was spitting out internet through the ethernet port as well. Reply vikas on Ethernet port of dir 505 can be used to share internet , its tested. Reply Fernando...from Spain. on No way to connect to my WI-FI in order to REPEAT IT to the garden as I had it set so as not to transmit its SSID. So for now as far as the device has no way to select manually the name of the NET within the configuration wizard, it turns out to be useless… Software needs improving so as to include “MANUALLY ENTER NAME OF NETWORK” next to “SCAN FOR NETWORKS”. Reply satish on Can this device can convert an USB modem(with 3G chip) signal to wi-fi, so that I can use my Wi-fi only devices which dont have an USB ports? Reply Geeknizer on No, it doesnt Reply GD on I just tried one of these devices and found the setup to be clunky and confusing (when compared to an Airport Express). The product’s name is also misleading. To me, “mobile companion” = plug my Smartphone into the USB port, and the DIR-505 shares my mobile broadband connection over wifi (while charging my smartphone). Strange that DLink missed that one… Reply Android on GD: Your (non-apple) smartphone should be able to do what you are complaining about easily all by itself. Reply Apple on Even iPhones can do that.

Apple CEO Tim Cook (R) talked with Qian Yingyi, head of the School of Economics and Management in Tsinghua University at the summit. China should continue its reforms and encourage foreign enterprises to invest, Apple CEO Tim Cook said on Saturday at a forum in Beijing where he also defended globalization.  "It's important that China continues to open itself and widen the door," Cook said during the annual China Development Forum hosted by the Development Research Center of the State Council, a top government think tank. He will meet with Chinese leaders in the next few days.  Cook made the remarks a day after the Cupertino-based firm announced two new research and development hubs in China to be set up in Shanghai and Suzhou. Last year, Apple announced its plans to open research centers in Beijing and Shenzhen. At the forum, the helmsman of the US tech giant with operations across the world also made his case for globalization. "Most people would conclude that the problem is that globalization hasn't helped everyone, and it's hurt some people. But it doesn't follow that globalization is bad. It follows that we haven't done a good job of lifting up everyone and we think we have to put an intense amount of effort in doing that, because the world is so much better off."  Unlike his predecessor Steve Jobs, Cook has in recent years paid frequent visits to the Chinese mainland where the iPhone maker has profited but nevertheless has been losing market share to local brands in recent years. From November to January, Apple held 16.6 percent of the Chinese smartphone market, down from 25 percent from the previous year, while Chinese rivals such as Huawei were seen advancing at Apple's expense, according to the latest data from market consultancy Kantar Worldpanel. When asked his opinion on Chinese phone manufacturers such as Huawei and Xiaomi, Cook said they "do really good work and I think the competition is more fierce in China not only in this industry, but in many industries than it is in anywhere in the world. And I think that's a credit to a number of local companies that put their energies into making really good products." As for Apple's dominance in the smartphone arena in terms of profits, he commented that "There's a lot there I've seen, Apple's market share of smartphones I think in that way could be classified monopoly, [but] I don't see that at all."  He went on to say "What we tried to do is just we focus on making the best products ...and we'll have a pretty good business. But we don't try to make the most. Our objective has never been to make the most. So we do not have a market share objective or a unit objective." It's not only the cut-throat competition that has impressed Cook, but also the prevalence of mobile payment in China. "China is way ahead here," he said. "I rarely go somewhere in China that doesn’t accept mobile payment ... If I go out in the heartland of the US, too often mobile payment is not in the vernacular at all.” The reasons behind the stark contrast, as the Apple CEO put it, are partly due to the prevailing use of credit cards in the US and slow adoption of mobile payment terminals among merchants. In China, however, "there's just a high willingness to change and to move to what's new and what's obviously better." | PRINT | RSS Add Comment SINA English is the English-language destination for news and information about China.

Some of those much-anticipated devices are iPad Pro 2 and iPad Mini 5. However, the Cupertino-based company has remained quiet about any information regarding the matter. But on a good note, it seems like details finally be released next week. iPad Pro 2 Release Date According to MacRumors, a source told them that Apple might probably announce a new set of products next week. The launch might arrive in between March 20th and 24th. But, the publication did not mention as to what products consumers should expect to be unveiled. It was also not clear whether or not there will be an event for that launch. Now, another speculation surfaced online from Mac Otakara. Based on their report, a second-generation 9.7-inch iPad Pro will be announced in the upcoming week. Since there is no Apple event next week, however, consumers should expect the release to be via press release. That would somehow make sense if the device would be just an iterative upgrade. iPad Mini 5 Release Date Another device consumers are expecting Apple to unveil soon is the iPad Mini 5. However, based on a recent statement of IHS Market Director for Tablets and PCs Rhoda Alexander, the device “may not get an update this year.” That is also the same prediction analyst Ming-Chi Kuo stated as reported by Christian Post. On a good note, the possibility of the tablet’s arrival is still open. Rumor has it that more information will be revealed in the first week of April. This news came after few consumers noticed that Apple’s online store indicated some of their tablet products to be available on April 4th. Should that be the case, then mark that date already for we could get some important information from there. As of writing, all of these information are pure speculations. None of those actually came from Apple since they are not confirming anything yet. But, stay tuned here on The Bitbag for updates in the coming weeks. For now, it is safe to say that all reports online regarding Apple’s next generation of tablets are all rumors. How about you? When do you think iPad Pro 2 will be unveiled? Do you think iPad Mini 5 will be upgraded this year? Share your thoughts in the comment section below.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Wearables Image Source: Gabriel O’Flaherty-Chan Someone ported ‘Pokemon Yellow’ to the Apple Watch Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal March 18th, 2017 at 1:13 PM Share Tweet Because the emulation community won’t rest until the original Pokemon games have been ported to every electronic device on the planet, Pokemon Yellow is now playable on the Apple Watch. On Friday, iOS software developer Gabriel O’Flaherty-Chan released a Game Boy Color emulator for Apple’s wearable device. O’Flaherty-Chan was initially underwhelmed with the amount of content available for the Apple Watch, so after making his own 3D game a few months ago, he began work on an emulator. Don't Miss: The iPhone 8 might ditch Touch ID altogether “The result is a surprisingly usable emulator which I’m calling Giovanni after the super-villain from my favourite Game Boy game, Pokemon Yellow,” O’Flaherty-Chan explains in a blog post. “Ironically, I’ve only ever played the game on an emulator, as growing up I didn’t have access to the real deal. In a way, I feel this is my way of giving back to the community.” He goes on to discuss some of the challenges he ran into while designing the emulator, including the balance he had to strike between framerate and performance. After all, he wanted the game to look good running on the watch, but he didn’t want it to sacrifice playability just to make it look better. Image Source: Gabriel O’Flaherty-Chan While this is certainly a fun proof of concept, you might be wondering how you can actually play a game like Pokemon Yellow on a watch. This was another one of the major hurdles that O’Flaherty-Chan had to overcome, using virtually every square inch of the display — as well as the crown — for the controls. “I’m anticipating revisiting the project once watchOS4/next generation Apple Watches are out, just to see if there are any opportunities to get a higher framerate,” O’Flaherty-Chan says at the end of the post.

News New Music Culture Features Lists The Archives Share < br />this article: News \ Watch Lana Del Rey Debut “Love” Live at Intimate SXSW Show Anna Gaca // March 18, 2017 Share < br />this article: CREDIT: Anna Gaca In theory, Apple doesn’t have to pay Lana Del Rey for endorsements at all–her presence alone can prompt everyone in a 30-yard radius to pull out their iPhone. But no ticket was hotter than Del Rey’s set at Apple Music’s branded South by Southwest venue Friday night. The show, announced just the day before, was her first concert since she wrapped up last year’s festival circuit, and the first since the release of her new single “Love” in February. Anyone hoping to hear a second new song, or a tidbit about an album, will have to wait longer: Lana played it close to the vest, and held the live debut of “Love” for last. As lead-up, she performed music from 2014’s Ultraviolence, and highlights from 2012’s Born to Die and Paradise EP. “Ride” received a slight makeover as a keyboard ballad; “Born to Die” became even more torchy live. Lana herself picked up a guitar for a shaky solo rendition of what she called “an old song,” “Yayo.” (She last released an album in 2015, Honeymoon, but you wouldn’t know it from Friday’s setlist.) SXSW crowds can tend toward the professionally subdued, but this was not true of people who circled the block trying to get into a Lana Del Rey show. They came wearing her 2014 tour t-shirt and screamed “you’re beautiful!” They cheered when she hit the notes, but also just when she appeared to be trying her earnest best. When sound problems affecting Del Rey’s in-ear monitors brought the show to a halt three songs in, the fans in the front row begged for selfies and were quickly obliged. About that live debut of “Love”: On record, it’s a dream of plodding bass, softly buzzing keys, and the clicking noise of someone cocking a gun. Last night, the drop hit with an unexpectedly powerful ripple of guitar before climbing to a finale drenched in echoing background vocals. Lana wiped her brow with a theatrical “whew” once she made it all the way through the song. There was no encore.

Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Apple has a choice to make. Will it make its Apple Pencil stylus compatible with devices other than its high-end iPad Pro tablets? I think it should. In 2015, when Apple first unveiled the Pencil, people wondered why the stylus wouldn’t work with non-Pro iPads, let alone iPhones. Then, in 2016, when Apple announced the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, people wondered why Apple didn’t make the phone capable of supporting the Pencil. Now Apple is said to be planning its third iPad Pro. It’s reasonable to expect Pencil support on the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro. But will Apple make an oh-by-the-way announcement about expanded support for Pencil after revealing the new slab? Unlikely. If anything, Apple could finally bring the Pencil outside iPad Pro land in September at its next iPhone event. Will it? I guess so. There will likely be new OLED displays on Apple’s 10th-anniversary iPhone. At the same time as it refreshes the displays, Apple could also introduce technology that can handle the Apple Pencil’s sensors for detecting pressure, angle, and location. Apple’s closest competitor in the smartphone market is Samsung, whose Galaxy Note phones have for years shipped with a stylus and a nifty, narrow on-board pocket to hold it. Earlier this year, Samsung introduced convertible Android-friendly Chromebooks with that feature, too. Must Apple follow Samsung in bringing stylus smarts to its flagship phone? No. Should it? Well, look at iPad sales. In the holiday quarter, the most important quarter in Cupertino, iPad revenue was down 22 percent year over year, and iPad unit sales were down 19 percent. Revenue growth for the iPad has been erased — the single biggest quarter for the iPad, revenue-wise, was back in 2013. The iPhone, meanwhile, is back to growth, with record revenue and unit sales. In 2012, Apple did bring its Siri virtual assistant to the iPad — the company’s newest device at the time — after debuting it on the iPhone in 2011. Now, after Apple has granted the iPad Pro more than a year of Pencil exclusivity, it would be wise for Apple to start letting consumers decide if they’d like to buy a Pencil for their iPhones — while the Pencil is still interesting.

Sunday, Mar 19, 2017 Search Archive Chinese Chinese Japanese French Spanish Russian Arabic Korea German Portuguese HomeOpinionsBusinessMilitaryWorldSocietyCultureTravelScienceSportsSpecial CoveragePhotoVideo English>> Apple CEO Tim Cook defends globalization during latest Beijing visit (Global Times)    09:53, March 19, 2017 Apple CEO Tim Cook (right) talks to Professor Qian Yingyi, dean of School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University at the 18th China Development Forum (CDF) in Beijing on March 18, 2017. [Photo/VCG] China should continue its reforms and encourage foreign enterprises to invest, Apple CEO Tim Cook said on Saturday at a forum in Beijing where he also defended globalization. "It's important that China continues to open itself and widen the door," Cook said during the annual China Development Forum hosted by the Development Research Center of the State Council, a top government think tank. He will meet with Chinese leaders in the next few days. Cook made the remarks a day after the Cupertino-based firm announced two new research and development hubs in China to be set up in Shanghai and Suzhou. Last year, Apple announced its plans to open research centers in Beijing and Shenzhen. At the forum, the helmsman of the US tech giant with operations across the world also made his case for globalization. "Most people would conclude that the problem is that globalization hasn't helped everyone, and it's hurt some people. But it doesn't follow that globalization is bad. It follows that we haven't done a good job of lifting up everyone and we think we have to put an intense amount of effort in doing that, because the world is so much better off." Unlike his predecessor Steve Jobs, Cook has in recent years paid frequent visits to the Chinese mainland where the iPhone maker has profited but nevertheless has been losing market share to local brands in recent years. From November to January, Apple held 16.6 percent of the Chinese smartphone market, down from 25 percent from the previous year, while Chinese rivals such as Huawei were seen advancing at Apple's expense, according to the latest data from market consultancy Kantar Worldpanel. When asked his opinion on Chinese phone manufacturers such as Huawei and Xiaomi, Cook said they "do really good work and I think the competition is more fierce in China not only in this industry, but in many industries than it is in anywhere in the world. And I think that's a credit to a number of local companies that put their energies into making really good products." As for Apple's dominance in the smartphone arena in terms of profits, he commented that "There's a lot there I've seen, Apple's market share of smartphones I think in that way could be classified monopoly, [but] I don't see that at all." He went on to say "What we tried to do is just we focus on making the best products ...and we'll have a pretty good business. But we don't try to make the most. Our objective has never been to make the most. So we do not have a market share objective or a unit objective." It's not only the cut-throat competition that has impressed Cook, but also the prevalence of mobile payment in China. "China is way ahead here," he said. "I rarely go somewhere in China that doesn’t accept mobile payment ... If I go out in the heartland of the US, too often mobile payment is not in the vernacular at all.” The reasons behind the stark contrast, as the Apple CEO put it, are partly due to the prevailing use of credit cards in the US and slow adoption of mobile payment terminals among merchants. In China, however, "there's just a high willingness to change and to move to what's new and what's obviously better."

Engst Tim Cook called them a “cultural phenomenon.” They’re backordered for six weeks on the Apple online store right now, and some independent Apple resellers tell me they can’t get any to sell. Apple’s new AirPods wireless earbuds are unquestionably an engineering feat, and while reviewers such as our own Julio Ojeda-Zapata and Josh Centers have identified a few weak points, the AirPods are generally well-received (see “Apple’s Wireless AirPods Were Worth the Wait,” 20 December 2016). The main negative is the $159 price, which makes the likelihood of losing or damaging one of the AirPods all the more worrying. While that price may seem high, most of the full-fledged competitors to the AirPods are at least as expensive, if not more so (see “CES 2017: Gadget Finds on the CES Show Floor, Days 3 and 4,” 11 January 2017). So what if I told you that you could buy a competing product for less than a tenth the price? Seriously. Don’t expect it to be as good as the AirPods, not by a long shot, but for somewhere between $5 and $20, you can buy a single Bluetooth earbud that does basically what the AirPods do — put a speaker and microphone in your ear without awkward wires. I first heard about this product category from a Cornell running buddy, Rob Kurcoba, who bought his first earbud from a Chinese reseller on eBay. At only $6.99, it was incredibly cheap, but he had to wait six weeks for it to arrive via slow boat. He paired it with an Android Wear smartwatch that could play music, the Sony Smartwatch 3 SWR50, and started wearing it on his solo runs. Soon, he was evangelizing it to the rest of us when we ran with the High Noon Athletic Club. Amused by his excitement, I looked on Amazon and was amazed to discover that the single-ear Bluetooth earbud had become almost a generic item, with numerous companies selling products that look nearly identical. I chose a $15 Nocobot model that had slightly better reviews than the others and got it a few days later — no need to wait for the slow boat with Amazon. It paired with my iPhone and my Apple Watch, and worked fine for listening to podcasts while doing yard work and a few times while running. This was all before the AirPods came out, and I lost track of it once yard work stopped for the year. But after the AirPods were announced and finally started to trickle out to users, I was a guest on MacBreak Weekly and mentioned the earbud while we were talking about the AirPods. That comment hit a nerve with listeners, generating lots of requests for more details. So here we are! Nocobot Bluetooth Earbud -- The earbud I bought and recommended on MacBreak Weekly was manufactured by a company called Nocobot and sold by another firm called Duto. It cost $14.99 and came with a custom four-inch USB charging cable with a needle-like tip that plugs into a tiny hole in the earbud. In my testing, battery life is about 3.5 hours of audio; I’m not entirely sure how quickly it recharges because there’s no way to check how fully charged it is. The earbud itself is black, and shaped like an old-style hearing aid, in the sense that it’s designed to fit snugly into your right ear. That’s either a plus or a minus, depending on your ear. It fits tightly in my ear — so well, in fact, that I have to pop it out by pulling up on the top of my ear and pushing gently from the back. It feels a little odd initially, but after a few minutes, I stop noticing it. I could easily see it not fitting in someone else’s ear. It fits only in your right ear, and in case my use of the singular hasn’t made this clear, it’s only a single earbud — your left ear remains uncovered. I consider that a plus for running or biking, where covering both ears is dangerous, but it’s a liability for when you want to block the outside world. The earbud has a single button that you use for pairing, toggling power, and starting and stopping audio: Press and hold the button for 5–10 seconds to put it into pairing mode. Press and hold the button for 3–4 seconds to turn it on or off. Press and hold the button for 1–2 seconds to switch its audio feedback between Chinese and English. Press the button quickly to start or stop the audio, or to answer and hang up calls. Press the button twice quickly to redial the last number called. The annoying part of the button is that it’s somewhat stiff, and pressing it means pushing in on your ear, which can be a bit uncomfortable. On the plus side, it’s unlikely to be pushed accidentally in your pocket or bag. Its only other interface is a recorded voice that tells you that it’s powering on or off, that the device is connected, if it’s ready to pair, and when you end a call. It also tells you when the battery is getting low, and I once heard it say “Battery high.” The quality of the audio is good, but not great. I mostly use it for podcasts while working outside, where it’s totally fine. When I first used it to listen to music while running, I experienced some skips and dropouts. I was able to resolve those by moving the Apple Watch to my right wrist or, when I’ve had the iPhone in a waist belt, sliding it around to the right side or front. The volume is loud enough for most environments, but some additional power would have been nice at times. Put bluntly, this is not an audiophile solution. I hadn’t used the Nocobot earbud’s microphone for calls of any sort until writing this article since I very seldom talk on the iPhone. When I called Josh, he reported that I sounded OK, but not great. For me, his audio was nice and clear, though not quite as loud as I would have liked. Using the iPhone’s built-in speaker and mic worked noticeably better for both of us. Our Skype test was less successful, likely due to the slow hotel Wi-Fi network I was using. The earbud can’t invoke or be used with Siri, unfortunately. You’ve probably noticed that I haven’t linked to this earbud yet. That’s because the particular one I bought isn’t available on Amazon anymore. Nor can I find any indication that Nocobot and Duto are even in business. We’re talking about sketchy Chinese companies here — that’s why it’s so cheap. However, the $14.99 G-Cord Ultra Lightweight Wireless Bluetooth Hands-Free Earbud looks identical, down to the logo on the button, so if you’re looking for one of these, give the G-Cord a try. QCY Q26 Bluetooth Earbud -- After I mentioned the Nocobot earbud on MacBreak Weekly, a listener recommended a competing product from QCY, which is a higher profile brand, to judge from a Google search. At its heart, the QCY Q26 is extremely similar to the Nocobot, being a single-ear Bluetooth earbud controlled by presses on a single button and responding via audio feedback. It costs $13.59 from Amazon and comes in a variety of colors. The QCY Q26 uses a stalk-like industrial design that has pros and cons. On the plus side, it should fit in anyone’s ear, and it comes with three sizes of rubber ear tips so you can choose the one that best matches your ear. That design also enables it to block sound better than the Nocobot earbud. Although it’s designed to go in your right ear, with the button on the top, you can flip it over and put it in your left ear, with the button facing down. It might not work well for calls in that orientation. Either way, the button is easier to press than the Nocobot’s button because you can pinch the QCY Q26 between your fingers while pressing. It’s not all good, though. The stalk design means that it doesn’t fit into your ear nearly as snugly as the Nocobot, and I’d be more concerned about it falling out accidentally. Plus, I find that the rubber ear tip blocks so much external noise that it almost feels like my ear has water in it — it’s somewhere between disconcerting and uncomfortable. (The Nocobot doesn’t block the ear canal as much, avoiding that situation.) The QCY Q26’s button is easily pressed in your pocket or bag, which can turn it on and run the battery down inadvertently or even pocket dial if it’s pressed twice in quick succession. Battery life isn’t quite as good as the Nocobot, at about 3 hours in my testing. The QCY Q26 comes with a micro USB cable for charging, and it plugs into a port on the other side of the earbud from the button. The port has a cover that’s devilishly hard to open; I can get it open only with the sharp point of a safety pin. Controlling the QCY Q26 is almost identical to the Nocobot, with a long press to put it into pairing mode, shorter presses to turn it on and off, quick presses to control audio or answer/hang up calls, and double presses to redial the last number. The audio feedback is similar too, though it doesn’t seem to talk in Chinese. Audio quality in comparison with the Nocobot is both better and worse. The QCY Q26 has a bit more oomph, and when Josh and I tested the microphone quality, he reported that it was a little better, but still reminiscent of AM radio. The rubber ear tip does block more ambient noise too. However, music sounded a bit muddier, and at least in my test unit, there’s a quiet background hiss. You don’t hear it when audio is playing at any significant volume, but it’s noticeable when the volume is very low or off. Plus, when I tried to use it while running with my iPhone in a waist belt, audio cut in and out enough that I stopped and swapped it for the Nocobot. It was fine when I used it to listen to music while standing at my desk, however. Making a Choice -- I won’t pretend that either of these earbuds is anywhere near as good as Apple’s AirPods. Their Bluetooth pairing can be annoying, audio quality isn’t as good, battery life is shorter, it’s more difficult to plug in their charging cables, their microphone quality is weak, and neither supports Siri or voice commands. And heck, you only get one, something that AirPods allow but don’t require. But these earbuds are so cheap that you may not care. I wrote this while at the ASMC Summit, a conference for independent Apple resellers, and when I showed these two little earbuds to one attendee, he said that he didn’t even bring his AirPods to the conference for fear of losing them. Just as the best digital camera is the one in your pocket, the best earbud is the one you have with you. Also, I’m talking about a category that contains much more than these two entrants. When you search for “Bluetooth earbud” on Amazon, you’ll see a variety of comparable products with slightly different industrial designs that you might find more compelling. Some are as cheap as $5, and there’s no reason I can see to spend more than $20 given how similar they look. I wouldn’t expect any of them to last for all that long, and they’d be easy to lose, but a super low price makes up for a lot of sins. My friend Rob, who got me started with these earbuds a year ago, tells me that he has since bought eight more, four of which he’s given away to family and friends. Of those he kept, he lost two and one broke, but at $7 each, he doesn’t feel bad about it. So hey, if you’re looking for a cheap wireless audio solution for one ear, give one of these earbuds a try. It’s not a big investment if it doesn’t work, and you might be pleasantly surprised.   Make your next move with a beautiful website and customized domain name.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment David Gustavson  2017-03-09 13:57 I like this stereo pair, connected by a wire that also provides a handy way to keep track of them hanging around your neck when not using one or both. (Run the wire behind your head.) I had no problem pairing. They work similarly to the ones reported on above. Maybe a bit too loud by default, but phone controls handle that easily. About $22. https://smile.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01LWZ6XZA/ref=yo_ii_img?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Reply David Meyers  2017-03-10 17:11 If you don't mind a wire between the buds, there are several terrific options for around $30 or so on Amazon. I really like the SoundPEATS Q12 (in the ear) and Q9A (loop over the ear - very very secure) a lot. They've got a true wireless pair - which look identical to the Q9A but without the wire between the two - for about $50. Audio quality is quite good. Unfortunately, they both stink for phone calls. It's the phone call quality which is really making me consider AirPods. For calls, I use a Plantronics Voyager Edge (and when you think about pricing -- that Edge is about half the price of a pair of AirPods, which makes the AirPods not seem quite so outrageous.) Reply Floyd Bloom  2017-03-13 20:28 While you are considering SoundPEATS take a look at the QY7 version-- excellent audio, great stay in the ear fit, and inexpensive as well at Amazon-- SoundPEATS QY7 Bluetooth 4.1 Wireless 6 Hours Play-time Noise Cancelling Sport In-Ear Stereo Earphones with Mic (Black) Reply Josh Centers   2017-03-14 10:37 I covered the QY7 previously, actually based on Floyd's recommendation. https://tidbits.com/article/16774 Reply Scott  2017-03-14 07:33 Hmmm... sticking a rechargeable battery from a fly-by-night company in my ear? Great place for a battery fire. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:58 Brings new meaning to "My ears are burning!" :-) I can't find any indication that anyone has ever had such a problem, and the batteries are awfully small, so I'd be surprised if could happen. Reply Scott  2017-03-15 18:52 It's like I was predicting the future! http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/15/520269673/womans-headphones-caught-fire-midflight-australian-authorities-say Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-16 09:14 Hah—I saw that yesterday too! Given that your email address starts with "heimdall," I suppose extraordinary senses would be among your super powers. Reply Jim Schmidt  2017-03-15 14:11 I have one of the millions of knock-offs of that single ear bud. I got it off of Amazon for maybe $8. It's a perfectly acceptable speaker for my intended uses - out running or driving in the car. I've had it with me on numerous 5k runs, and never once worried about losing it. The quality is decent - I'm no audiophile, so I'm not one to ask about specifics. But I have it to keep my pace and check my stats (and listen to my phone when I'm in our Bluetoothless, AUX-less car), and it functions in that regard perfectly. I will note that it does play both channels of audio in that one speaker, so you don't lose half of your music to a missing earbud, which is nice.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 March 2017 by Military News Poynt POS Point of Sale Terminal Cash Register What is the Poynt Smart Terminal? The Poynt Smart Terminal brings the unlimited versatility of a mobile device to a future-proof payment terminal at a price that any merchant can afford. The terminal was built to meet the highest PCI and EMV security requirements as well as connect to any merchant bank. The Poynt Smart Terminal runs PoyntOS which allows developers to bring to merchants the tools and technology to manage every facet of their business without having to purchase additional hardware. What are the connectivity options in the Poynt Smart Terminal? The device connects to Wifi and has optional 3G capability. It also comes with a dock that allows for USB connectivity as well as an Ethernet port. What are the exact dimensions of the printer paper roll and where can I get it? A printer paper roll of 2 1/4″ x 16′ fits our terminal well. Here is an example of the roll we typically use for our terminal: http://www.pospaper.com/portableprinter-01.html You can buy it online and have it delivered to your store. How mobile is the device? The terminal is mobile and can move around your store. If you want to take orders while customers are waiting in line, take payments from curbside pickup or take it to the storeroom to do inventory you can do that. You can even take it on deliveries or to the farmer’s market thanks to its 3G/4G modem. How do I charge the device? The battery is charged by plugging it in through the micro USB connection on the side of the device or resting it on the dock. What kind of warranty do you provide? Warranty will depend upon the channel through which you buy your device. What applications are available on the Poynt Smart Terminal? There are several Poynt applications that come pre-installed on the device: Terminal, Register, Manual Entry, Settlement, and Help. We have also partnered with a number of developers to offer their applications to merchants. The number of applications will grow significantly, and with it the power of the terminal will exponentially grow. Remember when you had a phone with no apps? And what about all the value you get out of your apps today? That difference is exactly what we are aiming for with the 3rd-party applications running on PoyntOS. You will wonder how you lived without it! Are you a Point-of-Sale (POS) system? The Poynt Smart Terminal is a payment terminal with basic register functionality built-in. 3rd-party applications like eHopper, eThor, and Lightning Register can provide richer POS functionality. Over time more POS applications will get added to the Poynt platform. I saw in your video that you have a mobile app for iOS that allows me to monitor my business when I’m away from my terminal. Is there one for Android? What about a website? Yes and yes. We have built analytics and monitoring tools that work on the terminal, our website, iPhones, and Android phones. Does Poynt charge a per transaction fee? No, Poynt does not charge any per transaction fee. Your fees are dependent on what your acquirer bank / processor charges you. PAYMENT METHODS Why do I need to accept all of these different payment methods? Payment types are constantly changing. EMV cards are now the standard, in the US thanks to the EMV mandate. NFC payments are seeing increased usage thanks to Apple Pay. Some customers want to pay with cash. Our goal is to ensure merchants never have to turn down a customer based on how the customer wants to pay. Both the Poynt Smart Terminal and Poynt 5 package all the payment capabilities into single devices at an affordable price. MAGNETIC STRIPE Does the Smart Terminal accept good ol’ fashioned credit card swiping? Of course! And the Smart Terminal can accept PIN for pin-debit as well as Signature. What about other cards that store information on a magnetic stripe like loyalty cards, drivers’ licenses, gift cards, etc? Yes, the Smart Terminal can read those cards. However the information being read from the magnetic stripe needs to be interpreted by our software or a 3rd-party application. Another advantage of our open platform PoyntOS is that apps like these can be built by anyone with the skills. NFC What is an “NFC” payment? “Near Field Communication” is a standard enabling secure two-way wireless communication. NFC has been used for payments for years now, but has become popular recently as Apple Pay and Android Pay are based on it. Does the Smart Terminal accept payments by Apple Pay? Yes, the Smart Terminal accepts all NFC payments including both Apple Pay and Android Pay. EMV What is EMV? EMV refers to cards with small microchips in them that keep cardholder information more secure than a magnetic stripe. Each transaction has a dynamic authentication which is much, much harder to steal compared to skimming data from a magnetic stripe. EMV cards have been common in much of Europe and came to the US in October of 2015. What is EMV “chip-and-signature”? Rather than your card number being read from the magnetic stripe, it instead is read from the microchip. Customers sign receipts just as they have when using magnetic stripe cards. What is EMV “chip-and-pin”? EMV chip-and-pin involves card information being securely read from the chip, and the customer entering a PIN as a customer verification method (CVM). It’s kind of like entering a PIN when pulling cash from the ATM. Payments processed with chip-and-PIN technology are more secure and result in less fraud. QR What is a QR code? QR codes are like 2-dimensional UPC barcodes, enabling the storage of information. They can be used for a variety of things including coupons, payments and item identifiers. QR codes can be scanned using the Poynt Smart Terminal just like any other barcodes. When would someone pay with QR code? It’s another technology for enabling mobile payments that doesn’t require a second physical payment card. There are several payment methods in market using QR codes, and when they become popular, similar to any other payment method, consumers might want to pay with one of those. Why do I need to support QR code payments? As a merchant, you want to accept forms of payments that your consumers would demand. As an open platform, our goal is to allow merchant to accept the payments without being forced to change their terminals. BLUETOOTH What is a Bluetooth payment? Bluetooth payments enable a phone to securely and wirelessly communicate with the payment terminal. One big difference between Bluetooth and NFC is that the phone does not need to be very close to the terminal. In fact, customers can pay with their phone while sitting at a table or standing in line. CREDIT CARD IMPRINTS Nope, we don’t do that! Maybe a developer will build an app that will teleport you back to the 80s and you can do it there. If that happens, take us with you! Jokes apart, credit card imprints are used when a payment cannot be processed due to lack of network connectivity. Poynt Smart Terminal is built with offline capabilities to collect and process offline transactions. Your acquiring bank might require additional qualifications, please check with them for more information. CONNECTING TO YOUR PROCESSOR Which payment acquiring processors does the Poynt Smart Terminal support? Poynt has a close partnership with Elavon, EVO Payments, TSYS, and Vantiv. Other banks are also supported through our partnership with the CreditCall payment gateway. CONNECTING TO PERIPHERALS Does the Poynt Smart Terminal work with the cash register that I already own? What about cash drawers, scales, scanners, check processors, printers, etc? We have built the Smart Terminal to be able to integrate with cash registers, cash drawers, scales, ticket printers, scanners, and other peripherals. Clearly we haven’t tested everything that is out there, but we’ve built PoyntOS on the open Android platform and this enables us to take advantage of interfaces and tools that are standardized by the community. There is a growing list of accessories that have been certified to work with the Poynt Smart Terminal. SECURITY What does “state-of-the-art” security mean? The Poynt Smart Terminal has two processors, one of which is completely dedicated to the security of payment information. No payment card information leaves the secure processor unencrypted. All sensitive payment information is transmitted using end-to-end encryption powered by PCI-approved strong cryptographic algorithms. The device uses security technologies such as TLS, DUKPT, 3DES, PKI and AES, all of which meet the highest PCI and EMV requirements. POYNTOS SDK & DEV KIT What do you mean by “open” SDK? Our SDK is available to anyone, for free, to download and use. If you’re a developer and want to build applications to sell to the millions of small merchants in the United States, this is a great opportunity. What does the Dev Kit contain? The main item in the Dev Kit is the Poynt Smart Terminal (limited developer edition). “Developer edition” just means that it doesn’t have the same security controls as the merchant terminals, in order to allow for ease of application development and testing. Do I also need to order a merchant terminal in addition to the Dev Kit? No, the Dev Kit already contains a Poynt Smart Terminal (limited developer edition). You’ll be able to process test card transactions (MSR, NFC, EMV) against a test merchant store, just like you were using a live merchant terminal (but without your cards being charged). Can anyone build an app on your platform? Yes. All you have to do is register (for free) and download our SDK. Can I build a clone of Flappy Bird for PoyntOS? No. Applications on PoyntOS help merchants run their business more efficiently. Just like other application platforms we have an approval process to which developers will submit their apps. We need to approve all applications that run on PoyntOS to ensure merchant security. Are there any restrictions on what apps can be built? Yes. More detailed information is in our SDK documentation. Some key points to keep in mind: 1) Applications have no access to sensitive payment card information, and additionally are prohibited from asking for any payment card information; 2) there are restrictions on what can be displayed on the consumer facing screen; 3) sideloading of apps and services is not allowed; 4) access to custom USB devices from your apps must be approved by Poynt; and 5) all apps must be reviewed, approved, and distributed by Poynt through secure channel. Can an iOS consumer app interface with the Poynt RESTful cloud APIs? All requests to the Poynt RESTful cloud APIs need to be signed using application key (which can’t be loaded onto iOS app). You could have your iOS app talk to your own server (which has the application key) which talks to Poynt RESTful cloud APIs.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 March 2017 by Military News Apple announces environmental progress in China Lens Technology has committed to power all of its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by the end of 2018, as part of Apple’s industry-leading supply chain clean energy program announced last year. Lens is the first supplier to make a clean energy commitment for all of its Apple production, and will meet its goal through an unprecedented power purchase agreement with local wind projects. Apple is working with suppliers to help transform the environmental landscape in China, and is proud to announce all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The UL standard certifies all of their manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or, when necessary, converted into energy. Since the program began in January 2015, the sites have diverted more than 140,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. “We want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we’re working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. “We congratulate Lens for their bold step, and hope by sharing the lessons we’ve learned in our transition to renewable energy, our suppliers will continue to access clean power projects, moving China closer to its green manufacturing goals.” “Our power purchase agreement is the first of its kind in southern China and we hope it will serve as an example for other companies looking to transition to cleaner, more economical sources of power,” said Lens CEO Zhou Qunfei. “We’re pleased to be the first supplier to commit to covering all of our Apple production with renewable energy, and proud to source from local Hunan wind farms to power our facilities in Changsha.” Lens’ manufacturing with Apple currently includes two facilities in Changsha, Hunan province. Wind energy will cover 100 percent of the energy consumed producing Apple products at Lens facilities by 2018, avoiding nearly 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, equivalent to the energy use in 380,000 Chinese homes.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software With the Release of iOS 11 Apple Might Kill as Many as 200,000 Apps – Here’s Why By Uzair Ghani Mar 15, 2017 10Shares Share Tweet Submit iOS 11 is on the horizon, and with its release the App Store might lose as many as 200,000 apps in one fell swoop. 32-Bit Apps Won’t be Compliant with iOS 11, Forcing Apple to Get Rid of Them for Good With the release of iOS 10.3 Beta, Apple started to warn users that the app they are using might not be compatible with future versions of iOS. In fact, to emphasize on this even more, Apple baked in a new App Compatibility section in iOS 10.3. This new section highlights all the installed apps on your device that haven’t been updated to support the 64-bi architecture that was introduced with the iPhone 5s. Related Apple’s Online Store Will Be Unavailable Tomorrow Due To ‘Maintenance’ So, with that in mind and data highlighted by app analytics company called Sensor Tower, Apple can kill as many as 187,000 (to be more precise) app with the release of iOS 11. To give you a new perspective how big that number is – that 187,000 figure accounts for 8% of the total apps available in the App Store as of March 2017. Advertisement Interestingly, the iPhone 5s came out in 2013 and it wasn’t until two years later Apple started to warn developers that they should update their apps to support 64-bit. That’s very alarming since 8% accounts for a huge chunk of the App Store. The major purge, in case you are wondering, has already started, with Apple making strides to remove as many as 47,000 apps from the App Store that does not fit its criteria last fall. And Apple appears to be constantly removing apps since then. But the big move will come with the announcement and subsequent release of iOS 11. Related The App Store Now Has A Permanent Indie Games Section iOS 11 is all set for announcement at WWDC 2017 on the 5th of June. But apart from Apple’s mobile operating system, the Cupertino company will take wraps off the future versions of macOS, tvOS and watchOS as well. And at the end of the entire keynote, developers will be able to take the new software for a spin on their devices as long as they are registered with Apple.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile The iPhone Calibration Machine Can Prevent You From Fixing Your Own Phone’s Screen By Omar Sohail Mar 15, 2017 46Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple is strictly against the prospect of allowing its products from being repaired. So with the use of heavy software integration with the hardware, it becomes a very difficult process for third-party repair shops to perform their own repairs. Even though the company has allowed third-party repairs and states that it will not void the customer’s warranty, there is a machine that might help Apple’s monopolization of the repair business as well. The iPhone Calibration Machine Could Become a Huge Revenue Generator for Apple as far as Repairs Go – 3rd-Party Repair Shops Would Be Left High and Dry A former employee from the Apple Genius Bar describes the machine as follows, according to Motherboard. Related Apple’s ‘Teardrop’ Design For The iPhone 8 Will Resemble The iPhone 2G Claim Korean Sources “It was a big clunky machine that honestly looked like someone built it in their backyard. There were different ‘moulds’ that different iPhone models would go into before going in the machine, and it would take around 30 minutes … there was some weird liquid that needed to be placed in the machine that we would have to wear gloves with to fix it. Lots of gas type valves and whatnot. It literally looked like some backyard home job. Not very Apple-like at all.” Justin Carroll, CEO of Fruit Fixed states that it would make things a lot easier for repair shops if they had one of these contraptions. Advertisement “It would be great if a machine like that were available to independent repair shops. If we’re testing a battery or swapping a screen it would make our lives a lot easier. At the very least, it’d help if Apple open-sourced its diagnostic modes to other people.” Related TSMC Will Decide To Build U.S. Fab Next Year, According To Spokesman; Plant Estimated At $16 Billion According to people close to this information, Apple started using these machines soon after the release of the iPhone 5s. However, there is one capability of the machine that no repair shop has even been able to accomplish; allow a new Touch ID button to be paired with an old device. The sensor can be recalibrated with the old phone meaning that if Apple starts to incorporate fingerprint readers that are embedded in the display, it would give the tech giant unprecedented powers when it comes to repairs. Though third-party manufacturers can still find other ways to repair and replace different components of the iPhone, screen repairs are often the most common ones and such repairs will not be able to get carried out by them in the future.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7 Plus: Hands-on video with S8 mockup shows how they compare Zach Epstein @zacharye March 15th, 2017 at 10:56 AM Share Tweet Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus features a screen that measures 5.5 inches diagonally. While nothing is set in stone at this point, multiple reports from reliable sources suggest that the Galaxy S8 — the smaller of the two flagship phones set to be unveiled by Samsung two weeks from today — sports a display that measures 5.8 inches diagonally. On paper, it seems like these two smartphones should be relatively similar in size, no? Well, as we can see in a new hands-on comparison video, Samsung’s bold new Galaxy S8 design is even more impressive than we thought when you line it up next to Apple’s flagship phablet. Don't Miss: Leaks reveal the 10 most exciting new features coming to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 With the Galaxy S8, Samsung has managed to stuff a 5.8-inch Super AMOLED display into a smartphone that is barely bigger than Apple’s 4.7-inch iPhone 7. It’s one thing to read those words, but it’s another thing entirely to see the smaller of Samsung’s two new Galaxy S8 phones lined up next to its stiffest competition. Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ flagship phones feature a bold new design that does away with the oblong home button beneath the displays and narrows the bezels above and below the screens substantially. As a result, the company is able to fit a very large screen into a phone with an overall footprint that isn’t much bigger than the screen itself. How does that play out in the real world? The video below comes courtesy of YouTuber KK Sneak Leaks, and it shows what is believed to be a perfectly sized mockup of the Galaxy S8 created using accurate schematics leaked by the factories building Samsung’s new flagship phone. In the video, the narrator shows the phone next to Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus, which features a display that measures 5.5 inches compared to the 5.8-inch screen on the Galaxy S8. At around the 4:14 mark, you can see how the two phones compare in overall size. Again, the Galaxy S8 shown in the video is not a genuine handset. Instead, it is a mockup that is believed to have been built exactly to scale. With that in mind, it’s pretty incredible to see just how much smaller Samsung’s Galaxy S8 is, with it’s 5.8-inch display, than the iPhone 7 Plus and its smaller 5.5-inch screen. And of course, if you want to see a real Galaxy S8 in action for comparison, you can always check out the exclusive Galaxy S8 photos we published earlier this month. Meanwhile, the larger Galaxy S8+ Plus is expected to cram a massive 6.2-inch display into a phone that is roughly the same size as the iPhone 7 Plus. You can see size comparisons of those two phones in this post.

The 23-year-old rapper - who has not signed a record deal and releases his music through streaming sites such as SoundCloud - revealed he made the deal with Apple for his latest record ‘Coloring Book’ because it was too good to turn down. He tweeted: ‘’I never felt the need to correct folks on my relationship with @apple but now that more people have tried to discredit my independence, I wanna clear things up. ‘’@apple gave me half a mil and a commercial to post Coloring Book exclusively on applemusic for 2 weeks. That was the extent of my deal, after 2 weeks it was on SoundCloud for free. I needed the money and they’re all good people over there. I feel like if I didn’t clear it up people would keep trying to discredit all the work we did to make Coloring Book what it became. I think artist can gain a lot from the streaming wars as long as they remain in control of their own product. ‘’I just wanna remain transparent. Folks out there without a deal need to know they’re doing everything right just keep at it. If you come across opportunities to work with good people, pick up cash and keep your integrity I say Do It.’’ And Chance recently revealed that he would consider selling a follow-up to ‘Coloring Book’.  This news was published in The Nation newspaper.

Last week, Tag Heuer unveiled the new generation of a $1,650 smartwatch it makes with partners Google and Intel, Montblanc released the $890 Summit, and Swatch Group CEO Nick Hayek announced plans for a Tissot connected watch using a proprietary operating system. With the flurry of new gadgets, watchmakers are trying to attract Millennial shoppers during the longest downturn on record for the Swiss industry. Yet sales of smartwatches so far have underwhelmed, even for Apple, and the new tech-driven timepieces generally command lower prices than the Swiss industry’s traditional output, creating risks for brands that have jumped in. “The smartwatch market hasn’t necessarily been as big an engagement as some thought it would be,” said John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst Bank. “Swiss watchmakers aren’t doing this to fend off the Apple Watch.” Instead, they’re dabbling in smartwatches as a way to lure younger shoppers — who often don’t wear anything on their wrist, smart or otherwise. Prices of Montblanc’s traditional watches run as high as $10,000, more than 10 times the price of its new gadget, while Tag Heuer’s most expensive models extend to about $15,000. The original version of the Apple Watch starts at $269. “It’s a way to be on top of people’s minds, and hopefully getting people in their stores,” said Alessandro Migliorini, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities. So far, Swiss watchmakers have insulated their high-end brands from the trend, seeking to preserve the exclusivity of more traditional timepieces. The top five brands by sales, as ranked by analyst Rene Weber at Bank Vontobel — Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Patek Philippe and Longines — have stayed out of the smartwatch market entirely. The latest releases represent a change of heart for Richemont, which owns Montblanc, and Swatch, which produces Omega. Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert previously said his brands planned to make “intelligent watch-straps” and that that putting electronic functions into the watch case creates a danger of obsolescence for time-honored watchmaking practices. Swatch CEO Nick Hayek has said he doesn’t expect smartwatches to be a “revolution.” Tag Heuer wants smartwatch buyers to upgrade. With its first device, customers could pay extra to replace it with a traditional timepiece if they ever decided it was obsolete. For the new version, which is Swiss-made, Tag Heuer is offering a module for an extra $1,650 that can swap the smartwatch with a mechanical time face. Google’s Android operating system is behind a number of smartwatches, including Montblanc’s new gadget, which is made in China. High-profile failures, such as the death of a $17,000 luxury version of the Apple Watch and the end of smartwatch pioneer Pebble, are easier to count than successes. Market researcher IDC declared in a report this month that “wearables aren’t dead,” but growth in the category is erratic. IWC had an intelligent watch-strap plan that never saw the light of day, while Tissot is behind schedule on its Smart Touch watch, which would work with iOS and Android. IDC estimates that 19.8 million smartwatches were sold last year, missing the forecast of 28.3 million. Of the top five wearable makers, Apple’s volume dropped 7.9 percent in 2016 while shipments at Samsung rose 39 percent, IDC said. Switzerland exported 25.4 million wristwatches in 2016, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. The mixed results for tech giants have eased some fears in the Swiss industry, which has reported signs of sales bottoming after 19 months of declining exports. Swatch forecast a rebound in U.S. and European markets. Guy estimates that Tag Heuer got slightly less than than 10 percent of its sales from its first-generation smartwatch in 2016. If the technology remains a niche product, that might be a good thing, he said. Otherwise, they risk a slippery slope in which lower-priced timepieces undercut their sales. “Watchmakers have to be careful not to start to dilute their own brand equity (with) too many smartwatches,” Guy said.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Hardware Pictures emerge of Apple’s secret iPhone calibration machine Chris Mills @chrisfmills March 14th, 2017 at 6:42 PM Share Tweet Apple is weirdly protective over the repair system that goes on at the Apple Store. You’d think that there aren’t many secrets to do with replacing glass screens and fixing iPhones that have gone for a swim in the toilet, but in Apple’s secret walled garden, everything is a trade secret. Motherboard‘s Jason Koebler has been reporting on the Apple Store’s repair system for a while now, and he finally got his hands on the holy grail: pictures of Apple’s secret repair machine, which allows Apple to replace the Touch ID sensor on repaired phones. That’s a big deal, because it’s the one component that third-party repair stores have been unable to crack so far. The calibration machine that all Apple Stores have holds the secrets to why. Don't Miss: Do you live in Boston or New Jersey? Pornhub will plow you for free As Koebler explained in an earlier post, the iPhone Calibration Machine is a general testbed that allows repaired iPhones to be calibrated to factory standards before being returned to customers. From the sounds of things, they go through a series of tests to calibrate the display, touchscreen, camera, and internal sensors: “It was a big clunky machine that honestly looked like someone built it in their backyard,” a former Apple Genius told me. “There were different ‘moulds’ that different iPhone models would go into before going in the machine, and it would take around 30 minutes … there was some weird liquid that needed to be placed in the machine that we would have to wear gloves with to fix it. Lots of gas type valves and whatnot. It literally looked like some backyard home job. Not very Apple-like at all.” But the important part, at least for third-party repair stores, is how the calibration machine allows a new Touch ID sensor to be installed. Koebler goes into detail about the pairing of the Touch ID sensor and Secure Enclave here, but the short version is that without the calibration machine, a new Touch ID sensor can’t be installed on an iPhone. That obviously makes it impossible to fix the home button on newer iPhones outside of an Apple store, but it also makes working on a broken screen incredibly fiddly. Head over to the Motherboard article to see the pictures of Apple’s hacked-together machine in action, and make sure to check out the previous coverage while you’re at it.

Being a cord cutter (actually, I've never had cable, so I haven't technically cut any cords), I'm always on the hunt for new ways to keep myself entertained. On Apple TV, I use a handful of apps that, either I subscribe to a streaming service for (like Hulu and Netflix), or offer a free streaming TV feature that doesn't require a cable subscription (like PBS and The CW). There is also this thing called broadcast television, which anyone can watch as long as they have a TV that supports digital television (or a digital conversion box) and an over-the-air (OTA) HDTV antenna. The thing about broadcast television is that I can't watch it on Apple TV. I have to switch my TV input over, and then I can flip through the channels until I find something to watch. I rarely watch broadcast television because I tend to stick with Apple TV for my TV and movie watching activities. That is until I got HDHomeRun. With HDHomeRun, not only can I watch live broadcast television on my Apple TV, I can also watch it on my iPhone or iPad. Plus, with the right app, I'm able to record live TV and watch it the way a person with cable and a DVR would watch TV. Skip those commercials! I'm going to explain a little bit more about what HDHomeRun is and how to set it up. What is HDHomeRun? It's a box, about the size of an Apple TV, maybe a little smaller, that acts as a transmitter. When connecting it to your internet router and your OTA antenna, it makes it possible for you to watch live TV on any other device that is also using the same internet connection. Here's how it works: You connect an ethernet cable to your home's internet modem. Then, you connect your OTA antenna to it (the antenna does not need to be connected to your TV set). Then, you plug it into a power source. Then, using a computer, you scan for local channels, just like you do when setting up broadcast television on your TV set. Then, you watch TV. HDHomeRun doesn't have an official app for iOS or tvOS, but you can start watching TV on your computer right away when you download the official HDHomeRun app on your Mac. If you want to get broadcast television on your iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV, you'll have to download a third-party app. I highly recommend Channels. With the app installed on your other devices, all you have to do is open the app, scan for your HDHomeRun, and start watching live TV. Why would I want HDHomeRun First off, you're probably only going to be interested in using HDHomeRun if you are a cord cutter (if you don't have a cable subscription). There is an HDHomeRun box specifically for people that have a cable subscription, but, other than not having to rent multiple cable boxes, I'm not sure this setup would benefit a subscriber, since there are plenty of apps that make watching broadcast television easy, as long as you have cable. You might be asking, "How is this any different from simply watching CBS, NBC, or ABC on my TV?" Because that's what I asked, at first. Actually, there are two main benefits to using HDHomeRun as a broadcast television channel transmitter. The obvious benefit is that you can watch broadcast television on any supported device in your house, including computers, smartphones, tablets, Xbox One, set-top boxes (like Amazon Fire TV and Apple TV), and other media centers that support such apps as Plex, Emby, and Kodi. You don't just have to watch TV on your TV. You can watch it anywhere. A second benefit is that, with the right app, you can record live TV and watch it when you want, even when you don't have an internet connection. Even app channels for Apple TV don't offer that — cable subscription or not. If you're the type of person that would only watch broadcast television on your TV set and don't care about being able to record shows to watch later, HDHomeRun is not the set up for you. If, however, you like the idea of watching your local news on your iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV, or you want to be able to record live TV and watch it at your leisure without needing a cable subscription to do so, you should think about investing in HDHomeRun. What do I need in order to watch free live TV on my Apple TV, iPhone, or iPad? Most importantly, you'll need to be living in a country that supports digital TV that receives either ATSC, DVB-T and DVB-T2, DVB-C or QAM. You'll also need the HDHomerun box. HDHomeRun Connect - $109 - Probably the box you want. It works with 802.11ac (for HD playback) or 802.11n (for SD playback) wireless internet connectivity and lets you stream live TV to two devices at the same time. HDHomeRun Extend - $179 - The same as the Connect, but with video transcoding. If you have a poor internet connection in your area, this is the model you should get. The Extend compresses videos in real time so you aren't maxing out your bandwidth. HDHomeRun Prime - $115 - This is the box that is only for cable subscribers. It requires a digital cable subscription and a CableCard, which you can rent from your provider. If you don't already have one, you'll need an over-the-air HDTV antenna with a coax connector that is able to work as a receiver in your area. Depending on how far away you are from your local channel broadcast center, you might only need an indoor antenna, which you can get for about $15 - $30, or you might need an attic or outdoor mounted antenna, which could cost as much as $150. You can figure out which type of antenna you'll need by using TV Fool's signal locator. If you're on the Apple ecosystem, you'll also need a third-party app that works with HDHomeRun. There are a variety of software options that range in price from a few dollars up front, to a monthly subscription. It all depends on what you want or need. The best app for watching live TV on Apple TV is Channels for Apple TV, which costs $24.99. The iPhone and iPad version costs $14.99 (and you do have to buy them separately). It has a few extra features — it records up to 30 minutes of a channel you're watching so you can pause it and come back later (great for skipping commercials). You can also use Plex with your Plex Pass subscription, Emby with your Emby Premier subscription, or Kodi if you side load it to Apple TV. These apps are great for DVR recording, but require a little bit of set up and a subscription for the former two. If you don't already use Plex, Emby, or Kodi, you may want to stick with Channels. If you do plan on recording full episodes of shows or movies, you'll also need a hard drive with 6-8 GB of disk space per hour of recording. So, you might need to invest in a 1, 2, or 3 TB external hard drive to store your shows, which range in price from $25 - $130, depending on how much live TV you want to record and watch later. How do I set up HDHomRun? It's easier than you think, but SiliconDust, the company that makes HDHomeRun didn't do a very good job of explaining how to set it up. The simple instructions are actually a tad bit too simple. Here's a little more detail on what you'll need to do. The first thing you should do is suss out where you're going to set up the HDHomeRun. The box needs to be connected to your modem, the antenna, and a power source at all times, though none of it needs to be connected to your television set or computer. Be sure you've got a good location to set everything up. The next thing you should do is disconnect your OTA HDTV antenna from your TV set if you haven't already. It doesn't need to be connected to it anymore It doesn't even have to be in the same room as your TV set. Instead, connect your antenna to the HDHomeRun box using the coax cable. Next, connect the HDHomeRun box to your home modem or router using the included ethernet cable. Just plug one end of the ethernet cable into the box, and the other end into the ethernet port on the modem or router. The HDHomeRun will always need to stay connected to the modem or router, so make sure you've got room nearby to set up the box and antenna. You could also invest in a longer ethernet cable if you need to. Then, plug the box into a power source. Any old wall plug will do. After you see a solid green light on the HDHomeRun box (just below the ethernet port), go to myhdhomerun.com to scan for channels in order to prepare to watch live TV. Last, download the necessary software. You can download a compatible app for your Mac right from myhdhomerun.com. You can also download the Channels app for iPhone and iPad (my personal recommendation) or InstaTV Pro. On Apple TV, you can use Plex with your Plex Pass subscription or Emby with an Emby Premier subscription, or you could also side load Kodi and use the HDHomeRun add-on. If you don't already use Plex, Emby, or Kodi on your Apple TV, you should probably get Channels for Apple TV (my recommendation) or InstaTV Pro. Once you open one of the apps, the channels should automatically populate for your viewing pleasure. If you don't see your channels, you can rescan from within the app and you should see them after that. Any questions? Do you have any questions about what HDHomeRun is, how it works, or how to set it up? Put them in the comments and we'll help you out. Reader comments How to watch live TV on your Apple TV without cable 20 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating Pontavignon Lory Nice article. I have been using the setup you describe (Apple TV/HDHomeRun/Connect software) for about a year and it is a cord-abstainer's delight. Some advantages you don't mention: 1. You no longer need multiple remotes. The one that comes with the Apple 4 TV does everything. 2. If your house has Apple TVs 2 and 3 that you are not replacing right yet, Airplay can stream live TV to them from any of your iDevices. 3. I have one ceiling-mounted TV that rotates to serve the dining or living rooms. With the OTA TV going through the Apple TV, I can send the sound to either of the separate sound systems that serve each room. I have found the system so useful that I got a second HDHomeRun so the OTA Channels (17 on a good day) can serve four devices at a time. Can't recommend the setup enough. Sent from the iMore App 0 4 days ago Reply Lory Gil Thanks for your insight. It's great to see the many ways you've used HDHomeRun! 0 4 days ago Reply jfergus11 Question for you: I'm considering getting another HDHomeRun (Extend) myself, because I need a 2nd antenna to pick up a station in another direction. Does the Channels app require you to pick a tuner to run from, or does it automatically determine the best / most available one to use? 0 4 days ago Reply Pontavignon I can't help because I use a single antenna split to the 2 HDHomeRuns, so they are providing four undifferentiated streams. Maybe Lory can be more helpful, or perhaps the manufacturers are the best source. 0 4 days ago Reply Lory Gil The Channels app will scan for channels that the HDHomeRun is transmitting. There doesn't appear to be an option to use multiple transmitters for the purpose of scanning for different channels. Are you sure you need two separate antennas? It might make your life a lot easier to just get one new antenna that has multi-directional support. It may be more expensive, but would probably save you time and heartache trying to deal with two separate antennas. 0 3 days ago Reply Bbenb I too have two antennas and two HDHomeruns. With Channels you can select which channel from each tuner. In my case the backside of one antennas is stronger than the antenna pointing at the tower. If you want to record you need something to record to, I use my MacMin you could have more storage by using a NAS. I use the app "SignalGH to check signal strength and quality. 0 3 days ago Reply FercKast You'd be better off going with Sling than with HDHomeRun since you wouldn't need an extraneous device laying around, gathering dust, just to access their app. 0 4 days ago Reply Lory Gil Sling TV costs at least $20 per month. HDHomeRun doesn't charge a subscription price for watching free broadcast television. They are different products. I think Sling provides a great service, but HDHomeRun is geared more toward people that don't want to pay a monthly subscription price to watch television. 0 4 days ago Reply Bbenb Channels charges $8/month if you want their DVR version. I'm in between two major markets, it's nice to pick which market to watch. I don't think Slng or any other service will give you that option. 0 3 days ago Reply jfergus11 Hi Lori, Just for clarification: the transcoding of the more expensive "HDHomeRun Extend" model simply means you can get away with streaming HD on a home 802.11n WiFi network, instead of the 802.11ac WiFi required by the cheaper HDHomeRun. It doesn't really have anything to do with one's Internet connection, since all the traffic is within one's home WiFi network. 0 4 days ago Reply Lory Gil This information is from Silicon Dust: "If you are using legacy wifi, or have multiple televisions spread out over a large house, we recommend the EXTEND to reduce the bandwidth required between your media devices and your HDHomeRun." "If you are using a wired network or a latest-generation wireless network over a short distance, we recommend the cheaper CONNECT." 0 3 days ago Reply pereiragd I would also add the revised HDHomeRun Extend has a mostly metal black case that looks better and is better at dissipating heat. In addition, the transcoding of the video makes more efficient use of your network and will be less affected by WiFi network congestion. For example, if you live in a city or can see many other WiFi networks in your home, the Extend will perform better on your computer, tablet, smartphone, etc. 0 1 day ago Reply taylorh How does Homerun compare to Tabo? I guess Tablo doesn't supoort aappleTV? Otherwise it sounds like a similar product. I use Roku 95% of the time anyway. Thanks 0 4 days ago Reply Lory Gil Actually, Tablo does support Apple TV now. I haven't tried it yet, but it looks like it's very similar, but about twice the price. Tablo's most noticeable difference is that there is a four-tuner model available, which means you can watch OTA TV on four different devices at the same time. 0 3 days ago Reply steviet02 The bigger thing with the multiple tuners is that you will be able to record on all 4 channels. Depending on your setup this may be a bigger feature than 4 separate viewers at the same time. If you have 4 watching at the same time, you will need multiple devices to be able to record and view at the same time, otherwise I could see that being an annoying ongoing issue. 0 1 day ago Reply OgOgilby Lori, but you limit your readers to this device. There is a similar device that I have been using for years now called "Simple TV". It has worked flawlessly and I can view and record all OTA channels on all my devices. Even your buddy on TWIT TV never mentions it, is there some reason for that. 0 3 days ago Reply taylorh I hadn't even heard of Simple TV. I'd heard of Tablo and Home Run, but not Simple TV. I'm leaning toward Tablo as it has a 4-tuner model that sounds appealing. Otherwise I have to take into account subscription (guide data) fees and other limitations. 0 3 days ago Reply Lory Gil Simple TV looks like it's close to the same as HDHomeRun, but costs quite a bit more ($200 for the base model). It does, however, look like it has an official Apple app with DVR recording included, which is something HDHomeRun doesn't have. 0 3 days ago Reply steviet02 You can't even buy the tuners/streamers anymore. Maybe thats why no one is mentioning it? 0 20 hours ago Reply BongBongOnTwitter Would be great if someone made a standalone tuner and streamer that could capture HDTV signals and send them over wifi to ones iPad. Theoretically, such a concept should be able to work without any internet provider and no subscriptions involved whatsoever. 0 3 days ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Login here or sign up here Tech Smartphones have an unexpected new rival New generation of feature phones looking like a threat to Apple and its rivals. Adam Minter, Bloomberg View  /  18 March 2017&nbsp12:42 Last week, an Indian government official announced that iPhones will start rolling off an assembly line in Bangalore by the end of April, targeted at local customers. It’s a big moment for Apple, which is counting on India’s emerging middle class to make up for slowing sales in other markets. But don’t bet on the iPhone conquering India, or any other emerging market, just yet. That’s because smartphones of all kinds are facing stiff competition from an unlikely new challenger: feature phones. With simple handsets and small screens intended mostly for calls and text messages — similar to the Nokia or Motorola you probably owned years ago — a new generation of feature phones is suddenly looking like a threat to Apple and its rivals. For a technology long ago left for dead, feature phones have lately made some impressive gains. After years of almost continuous decline, global shipments have grown for two consecutive quarters. Growth in emerging markets has been especially impressive: In Africa, feature-phone shipments surged 32 percent year-over-year in the second quarter of 2016, compared to a decline of 5.2 percent for smartphones. Expect that trend to continue, for a few reasons. One obvious advantage is price. At the end of 2016, the average global price of a smartphone was $256, compared to $19.30 for a feature phone. In emerging markets, where even educated urbanites typically earn less than $10,000 a year (in India, they average $5,385), that doesn’t leave much in the way of consumer choice. But even if a buyer has $256 to spare, the booming secondhand market offers far better options than a smartphone. In Ghana, where I recently spent a few weeks, $256 will buy a used Pentium III desktop computer, a flat-screen monitor, a satellite dish and a decoder box to pirate satellite television broadcasts. Another factor is battery life. In many emerging markets, where electricity service can be intermittent, smartphones that have to be recharged each day can’t compete against feature phones that can now go for weeks on a single charge. In West Africa, it’s the rare smartphone owner who doesn’t also carry a feature phone as a hedge against missing calls and messages due to battery depletion. Equally important, most emerging-market customers prepay for voice and data, making smartphones that passively eat up bandwidth a major inconvenience.  Feature-phone makers are also coming up with innovative hardware and services. Chinese-owned iTel has introduced a speech-to-text system that might appeal to hundreds of millions of illiterate or visually impaired buyers with low incomes. India’s Zync just introduced six new feature phones with multiple SIM card slots, so customers can take advantage of lower rates when calling phones on the same carrier, or use separate lines for personal and business matters. Reliance Jio Infocomm is said to have a feature phone in the works that enables free calls over LTE networks, much as Skype does, for less than $20. The most important innovation, though, has been the development of mobile-payment systems that require nothing more than text-messaging. A user simply buys credit at a bank or service center, then transfers the money via text to friends or merchants. For the roughly 2 billion people around the world who lack access to basic financial services, that can be a life-changing service. Kenya’s M-Pesa, which enables money transfers via SMS, has about 19 million users who exchange more than $140 million daily. In India, the government is fast-tracking such services as a remedy to its demonetization crisis. For smartphone makers, all this spells trouble. Some analysts in India are predicting a slump in smartphone sales and upgrades this year. Leading feature-phone brands have even started introducing cheap smartphones of their own, hoping to convert their considerable market share and brand recognition into upgrades. It’s likely that the next major advance in mobile technology won’t be dictated by designers in Silicon Valley or Seoul — but rather by the needs of emerging-market consumers. In that sense, at least, old-school feature phones are starting to look very much like the future.

The biggest rivalry in the smartphone world used to be the one between Samsung and Apple, but now Google has joined in the race. We think it’s safe to say that Apple’s iPhone 7 is in a league of its own because it runs on iOS, but Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and Google’s Pixel are competing against each other on a daily basis. Customers never know which one deserves their money the most, but today we’re going to try and clear that up by pining Galaxy S7 and Pixel against each other in order to see how well the fare. This brief comparison will be focused on the hardware power these two flagships are offering. Samsung Galaxy S7 vs Google Pixel: Hardware Performance The South Korean tech manufacturer knows that hardware power is very important and that’s why it decided to equip the smartphone with its own octa-core Exynos 8890 chipset. The processor features four cores that clock at 2.3GHz Mongoose and other four ones that have been clocked at 1.6GHz Cortex-A53. Even better, Samsung has coupled the processor with a Mali-T880 MP 12 graphics processing unit and 4GB of RAM. On the other hand we have Pixel, the smartphone is believed to represent Google’s vision of a perfect Android powered smartphone. Now let’s pop up its hood and see what’s fueling Pixel. Unlike Samsung, Google decided to go with one of Qualcomm’s quad-core Snapdragon 821 chipsets. The processor is actually faster than Galaxy S7’s chipset because it has two cores that clock at 2.15GHz Kyro and other two ones that feature a base clock speed of 1.6GHz Kyro. Google decided to spice things up and paired Pixel’s processor with an Adreno 530 graphics processing unit and 4GB of RAM. Samsung Galaxy S7 vs Google Pixel: Verdict After closely inspecting their hardware performance, we can see why these two smartphones fit into the same category. Although many consider them as equals, Pixel has the upper hand. Google has made a wise decision when it chose to collaborate with Qualcomm since its Snapdragon 821 processor is slightly faster than Galaxy S7’s Exynos 8890 chipset.

The world's greatest investor placed a big bet on the future of the iPhone maker. Here's why Warren Buffett likes Apple. John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Mar 18, 2017 at 5:02PM CEO Warren Buffett recently disclosed that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) owned 133 million shares, or about $18.5 billion, worth of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. Apple joins other sizable holdings -- Wells Fargo & Co and The Coca-Cola Co -- as one of Berkshire Hathaway's top equity investments. Throughout his career, Warren Buffett has made successful investments in several different industries, but some of his most famous and rewarding investments have been in consumer product companies. His 1988 investment in Coca-Cola is probably Buffett's most famous investment. Similar to Apple, Coca-Cola had a product with universal appeal and was demonstrating growing revenue and profits at the time when Warren Buffett invested 25% of Berkshire Hathaway's book value in Coke shares. Apple's competitive advantage Apple's Opera retail store in Paris. IMAGE SOURCE: APPLE INC.  Although the Apple investment is notable because of Buffett's historical tendency to shun tech stocks, it actually fits the qualities the Omaha-based investor has looked for in other investments. If you use an iPhone, iPad, and/or a Mac computer, you probably have some experience with the stickiness of Apple's products and services. It's not likely that someone who has taken lots of photos of treasured moments and purchased lots of content from iTunes is suddenly going to abandon Apple for a Samsung Electronics Co or a Microsoft product. Millions of customers have a strong attachment with Apple's devices, and this is what attracted Warren Buffett's attention: Apple strikes me as having quite a sticky product and enormously useful product that people would use ... The continuity of the product is huge, and the degree to which their lives center around it is huge. And it's a pretty nice ... franchise to have with a consumer product. Apple creates beautifully designed products and has successfully tied it all together with Apple's iCloud storage service, which automatically keeps all of your content synced between devices. The unique, spartan-esque product design and sticky services have led Apple to become one of the most iconic brands in the world. Apple consistently earns high customer satisfaction ratings, which continues to help sell tens of millions of iPhones every quarter. This success has been a good marketing tool for other product lines like Mac computers, which continues to show strength while the PC industry is in decline. These qualities have led to impressive growth in Apple's business over the last 10 years: Fiscal Year Revenue Net Income 2016 $215.6  $45.7 2011 $108.2 $25.9 2007 $24.0 $3.5 Amounts in billions. DATA SOURCE: Apple Inc. annual reports.   While Samsung controls the No. 1 spot in smartphone market share in terms of unit sales, Apple generated every dollar of profit in the industry in 2016, according to one analyst. Apple achieves this by commanding a premium price to competing products, reinforcing the brand's strength in the marketplace. Should you follow Warren Buffett and buy Apple? Let's not kid ourselves: Warren Buffett is one of the world's greatest investors. You could do a lot worse than just sit back and buy every stock Berkshire Hathaway owns, and never sell. But keep in mind that Warren Buffett's investments don't always perform well right off the bat. In 2011, he disclosed on CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway's $10.7 billion investment in International Business Machines, which has dramatically underperformed the market ever since. SPY data by YCharts. Don't expect to hit a homerun with Apple Nonetheless, the strong financial position of the company and a great brand should deliver decent returns for shareholders in the future, but don't expect to earn anything close to the stock's nearly 1,000% rise in the last 10 years. SPY data by YCharts. The stock trades for a very reasonable 16 times earnings, and analysts expect the company to grow about 9% annually over the next five years.  Apple also offers an annual dividend yield of 1.6%, and management has been using cash flow to buy back shares, helping earnings per share grow 16% annually over the last five years compared to 14.8% annual growth in revenue. Plenty more dividends and share buybacks will come since the business generates over $60 billion in annual cash flow and currently has a whopping $246 billion in cash assets on the balance sheet and only $73.5 billion in debt.  Investors can achieve success using their own insights My takeaway from Warren Buffett's investment in Apple is the advantage individual investors have over the big financial institutions in managing their own money. Anyone who has been an Apple customer in the last 10 years would have figured out long ago the same qualities one legendary investor observed only recently.

Digital Trends Home > Gaming > Indie Showcase: Apple to prominently feature indie… Indie Showcase: Apple to prominently feature indie games for the long haul By Steven Petite — March 16, 2017 3:09 PM Subscribe Share Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Apple's dedication to promoting indie games could lead to the release of unique games that previously wouldn't have stood a chance on the App Store Apple is making it easier for independent games to get noticed by App Store users with its newly launched Indie Showcase. The curated section will receive consistent updates, and act as both a beacon for new and unique indie games, as well as best-of lists similar to Apple’s Editor’s Choice lists. All of the highlighted games will be hand-picked by the team that has spotlighted worthwhile games, both free and paid, since the App Store launched in 2008. Leading up to the official unveiling and launch of Indie Showcase, Apple spent the last two weeks promoting an eclectic batch of indie titles at discounted rates on both the home and games pages. Prominently featured titles included the critically acclaimed Device 6, Super Hexagon, and Mushroom 11, a well-received PC indie that came to iOS recently. More: ‘Mass Effect: Andromeda’ mobile app lets you manage your gear while on the go Speaking with Polygon, Mushroom 11 creator Itay Keren said, “By setting up this showcase and reserving this desired spot on their store, Apple is essentially taking a stand to insure the creativity, sustainability and diversity.” Placement on the App Store often has a direct correlation with the success of a game. The Indie Showcase initiative ensures that games from small studios are given a chance to thrive in a saturated market filled with free-to-play juggernauts like Clash Royale and titles from large developers like Nintendo’s Super Mario Run. As of publication, Surgeon Simulator, Botanicula, The Escapists, and Prune — four indie games — occupy spots in the top-10 paid chart across the entire App Store. It’s unclear at this time how often Apple will rotate games in and out of the showcase, but we know that it’s set to be a permanent and noticeable fixture with a myriad of categories to shine a light on a wide variety of titles. As of now, there’s categories for new indies, great sound design, gameplay, narrative, innovation, a deals section, and a top-25 list. Apple doesn’t let developers pay for preferential statement on the App Store, so the playing field has never necessarily been unfair, but the Indie Showcase is still a step in the right direction for everyone that’s interested in widening their game selections.

The latest items added and dropped from the basket of goods the Office for National Statistics uses to calculate inflation suggests changing tastes in both alcohol consumption and how we choose to stay fit and healthy. The “shopping baskets” of items used in compiling the various measures of consumer price inflation are reviewed each year. Some items are taken out of the baskets and some are brought in to make sure the measures are up to date and representative of consumer spending patterns. In 2017, 16 items have been added to the CPIH basket, 11 items have been removed and 8 have been modified. Read More Do you know how many calories are in your favourite gin? Gin replaces the more generic spirit based drink in the basket, as the ONS says expenditure on gin has risen and there has been an increase in the number of small distilleries over recent years. Among the items added this year is non-dairy milk, such as soya or almond, to represent the growing “Free From” market. Apple cider and flavoured ciders have also been added, reflecting growing popularity and diversity, with apple cider sold in pubs replaced with a broader cider to reflect wider availability of pear and other varieties. Gin and Tonic As more people take up cycling and sports such as triathlon, cycle helmets and men’s base layer tops have been added to the basket. For children, swings are out but scooters are in, while cough liquid, jigsaws for adults and half chocolate-coated biscuits are the other new items in the basket. Council tax and rates bills in Northern Ireland have been added to the basket for the first time. While they have previously been included in RPI, they are now also in the CPIH measure.

Mentholated cigarettes are out, in part because the EU Tobacco Products Directive 2014 will see distinguishable flavours including menthol banned from 2020. Brake parts and single drainer sinks go as these types of items are already well covered in the basket. Additions New Item Notes Half chocolate-coated biscuits New item. Introduced to expand the coverage of biscuits and cakes. Non-dairy milk drink New item. This has been introduced to represent the “Free From” food sector which is a distinct and growing market. The item covers milk-type drinks based on, for example, soya or almond. Flavoured water New item. Introduced as expenditure is rising and to widen the coverage in the Mineral waters, soft drinks and juices category. Gin, bottle Expenditure has risen and there has been an increase in the number of small distilleries over recent years. Gin replaces the spirit based drink item in the baskets. Apple cider, 4 can pack Together with the flavoured cider, canned apple cider replaces bottled cider reflecting the availability of the products in outlets. Flavoured cider, bottle This has been introduced due to an increase in expenditure and shelf space devoted to flavoured cider. The item could be apple or pear based but must be flavoured. Men’s base layer top New item. A type of clothing not currently covered but widely purchased. More broadly, garments is an under-covered area of the baskets. Cycle helmet New item. This has been introduced principally to improve and diversify the coverage in an underrepresented area of the baskets. It also reflects the growing popularity of cycling. Average council tax bills in Great Britain Already included in the RPI and now added to CPIH as it is a cost associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. Its inclusion follows an open consultation of users. Average rates bills in Northern Ireland Already included in the RPI and now added to CPIH as it is a cost associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. Its inclusion follows an open consultation of users. Cough liquid New item added to diversify the range of pharmacy products in the baskets and represent a specific product not previously covered. Child’s scooter Replaces the child’s swing for which the number of price quotes collected each month has been falling reflecting its availability in shops particularly in the winter months. Scooters will represent children’s outdoor play equipment throughout the year. Jigsaw New item. The jigsaw has been introduced to represent an adult- type hobby. This is an under-covered area of the baskets. Cider Replaces apple cider in order to additionally capture price movements for pear and flavoured ciders which have increased in popularity over recent years. Items removed Dropped Item Notes Spirit based drink Replaced by gin which has been attracting increased expenditure. On sales of spirit based drinks are still in the baskets. Apple cider, bottle Replaced by a combination of canned apple cider and bottled flavoured cider reflecting the availability of the various products in outlets. Mentholated cigarettes Removed. This item currently has low coverage and the EU Tobacco Products Directive 2014 will see distinguishable flavours including menthol banned from 2020. Single drainer sink Removed. This class is well-covered and the product’s removal enables items to be added elsewhere. Brake pads Removed as a separate item from the price collection across the UK but will continue to be covered as part of a spare parts item for which prices are collected centrally over the internet. Spare parts and accessories is an over-covered part of the baskets. Mobile phone handset Removed. The number of models available and expenditure are falling as people increasingly switch to smartphones.

Red meat lover SARA MALM shows it can be done even on a tight budget By Sara Malm For The Mail On Sunday Published: 17:59 EDT, 18 March 2017 | Updated: 21:44 EDT, 18 March 2017 e-mail 92 shares 158 View comments Impossible, ridiculous, unachievable. That seemed to be the general consensus at the suggestion last month by scientists that eating five portions a day of fruit and veg wasn’t enough and if we wanted to live longer, healthier, cancer-free lives, we needed TEN a day. Doing so lowered the risk of stroke by 33 per cent, cancer by 13 per cent and premature death by 31 per cent, said a team of experts at Imperial College London. But, given that the average Briton manages fewer than three a day as it is, it was also perhaps wishful thinking. Just one in five of us manage the five a day currently recommended by the NHS. Ten a day is easy according to Sara Malm who stocked up on fruit and vegetables online and then portioned them up to make it simple during the week Others warned that upping fruit-and-veg intake would be a financial struggle for many. But how hard can it be? I set out to see just how do-able ten a day is, both in practical terms and cost-wise. As a diehard meat-eater, I worried it would be an unrealistic (and unpleasant) gear shift. My friends laughed when I told them my plan. And it did take planning.

Share this article Share 92 shares My usual method of deciding what to have for dinner while whizzing round the food store after work went out of the window, replaced by an extensive shopping list for the week – variety, say nutrition experts, is key to benefiting from the widest range of vitamins and minerals. And I found that the preparing and eating of ten a day was pretty easy. It also didn’t cost much: I calculated that over five days, I ate just £5.13 worth of fruit and veg. That’s a pound a day, give or take. To eat five – let alone ten – portions of something in one day sparks visions of plates piled high with broccoli and blueberries; but when you look at it all laid out, it’s not a lot. Here’s how I managed… MY TEN-A-DAY SHOPPING LIST  I shopped on tesco.com because I’m familiar with the website. To work out how much I got for my money, I divided the weight of each item by 80g – NHS-recommended portion size for fresh fruit and veg. For dried fruit, like sultanas, it’s 30g; for juice, one portion is 150ml. For peeling fruit, I looked up the weight without peel; for tinned veg, I used the drained weight. Then I divided the price by the number of portions to give the cost per portion. *All items Tesco own brand unless stated Everyday Value Baked Beans In Tomato Sauce 420g, 24p 5.25 portions; 9.6p/portion Everyday Value Sweetcorn 325g, 35p (drained weight 260g) 3.25 portions; 10.7p/portion Butter Beans 400g, 50p (drained weight 235g) 2.9 portions; 17p/portion Everyday Value Chopped Tomatoes 400g, 31p 5 portions; 6.2p/portion Green Beans 850g, 85p 10.6 portions; 8p/portion Iceberg Lettuce 400g, 70p 5 portions; 14p/per portion Everyday Value Mixed Vegetables 1.16kg, 89p 14.5portions; 6.1p/portion Mixed Fruits 500g, £2 6.25 portions; 32p/portion Root Vegetable Medley 1kg, 89p 12.5 portions; 7.1p/portion Courgettes Pre Packed 500g, 89p 6.25 portions; 14.2p/portion Broccoli 390g, 43p 4.9 portions; 9p/portion Pure Orange Juice 2 litres, £1.34 13 portions; 10.5p/portion Everyday Value Sultanas 500g, 89p 16.7 portions; 5.3p/portion Braeburn Apple Minimum 5 Pack 670g, 79p 8.4 portions; 9.4p/portion Suntrail Farms Ripen At Home Plum 400g, 68p 5 portions; 13.6p/portion Six Bananas, 78p 9 portions; 8.6p/portion TOTAL COST OF SHOPPING: £12.53  (all costs relate to fruit and veg)  DAY ONE  Breakfast: Pre-gym banana, post-workout oats with apple and sultanas, orange juice.  Portions: 4.5  Cost: 27.7p Lunch: None Afternoon snack: Plum.  Portions: 1  Cost: 13.6p Dinner Salmon with 240g butterbean and root vegetable (parsnip, carrot, swede) mash, a banana for dessert. Portions: 4.5  Cost: 54.7p TOTAL PORTIONS: 10 TOTAL COST: 96p The first thing that surprised me as I sat down to work out exactly what I would eat each day was that I was already getting my five a day pretty much without thinking about it. One vegetable or fruit portion is 80g, according to NHS guidelines. That’s fresh, raw weight, so it can be less when cooked and containing less water. For instance, a portion of dried fruit is just 30g. ‘Of course, you don’t want to eat too much dried fruit,’ says Mail on Sunday nutritional therapist Jackie Lynch.  ‘It is high in sugar, but a handful like this a day gives you about 17g of sugar, which isn’t really that much of a concern if you’re not eating lots of added sugar and junk.’ Jackie points out that a banana, peeled, weighs 120g – that’s one-and-a-half portions. She adds: ‘You can have more than one portion of a fruit or veg simply by eating the whole thing.’ A typical day for me starts with a banana if I’m heading to the gym. For breakfast I’ll have oats with fruit – an apple and some sultanas – or scrambled or boiled eggs with peanut butter. Lunch will be yogurt, fruit or a protein bar. Dinner is always meat or fish, with veg, either broccoli or my favourite, cauliflower mash. To make my very unscientific experiment as accurate as possible, I invested in a set of electronic food scales. At home, I dutifully weighed out 80g of butter beans and 160g of root veg – parsnip, swede and a bit of carrot – and mashed it all up with some cream and a little bit of rosemary to have with my pan-fried salmon. Another banana for pud and I’d hit my target. DAY TWO  Breakfast: Banana pancakes with bacon, peanut butter and an apple. Portions: 2.5  Cost: 22.4p Lunch: Left-over salmon and bean and root veg mash, orange juice. Portions: 3 Cost: 24.7p Cocktail: Frozen mixed-berry daiquiris (120g mixed berries). Portions: 1.5 Cost: 48p Dinner: Chicken thighs with mixed vegetables (160g) and green beans (80g). Portions: 3 Cost: 20.2p TOTAL: 10 TOTAL COST: £1.16 The best thing about this challenge is that it does not in any way affect any of the other things I eat. No one said I couldn’t serve every single meal on this menu with a side of bacon – after all, this is about eating veg, not what I eat with it. So for breakfast, I have banana pancakes (one-and-a-half portions) with an apple and a side of bacon. After lunch, I begin weighing and portioning for the remaining 17 meals of the challenge. Not surprisingly, it ends up taking up a large chunk of my valuable non-work hours, which I resent hugely. Exasperated, I text a friend who happens to work in a bar. I ask: ‘If I bring my own berries, can you put them in a daiquiri?’ When I arrive, she raises an eyebrow as I hold up a plastic bag containing two handfuls of sad and soggy half-frozen assorted berries. ‘Don’t ask,’ I say. ‘Just chuck it in a blender and get me a straw.’ Frankly, I was glad I’d had a drink before ‘enjoying’ my frozen vegetables. Back home, I put them all in a pot, cover and cook while trying not to let them go mushy. Two recent studies found that frozen fruit and veg can be healthier than fresh, with higher levels of vitamins and cancer-fighting antioxidants. However, I have to say that in terms of taste, I’m not a fan. They remind me of aircraft food. DAY THREE  Breakfast: Almost full English: Bacon, eggs, baked beans (80g) and tomatoes (80g), orange juice. Portions: 3  Cost: 26.3p Snack: An apple and handful of sultanas. Portions: 2  Cost: 14.7p Lunch: Toast with peanut butter, banana. Portions: 1.5  Cost: 13p Dinner: Roast beef with roasted root vegetables (160g carrots and parsnip), broccoli (80g); ice cream with frozen berries (80g) for dessert. Portions: 4  Cost: 55p TOTAL: 10.5 TOTAL COST: £1.09 Baked beans in chunky tomato sauce is two of my ten a day. And I can have it with bacon! This suits me perfectly. In preparation for what I know is set to be an epic Sunday roast, I keep the lunch light, and have banana and peanut butter on toast. I serve myself a lovely plate of beef, duck-fat potatoes, Yorkshire pudding and gravy served with parsnips, carrots and broccoli. It is no bigger than my normal plate of roast, and I’m putting away at least three portions of veg. And I can have dessert afterwards, so really, what’s not to like? DAY FOUR Breakfast: Yogurt, banana, sultanas.  Portions: 2.5  Cost: 18.3p Lunch: Salmon salad with double lettuce.  Portions: 2  Cost: 28p Snacks: Plum, carrot.  Portions: 2  Cost: 20.7p Dinner Pork belly, double broccoli (160g) sweetcorn (80g), green beans (80g).  Portions: 4  Cost: 36.7p TOTAL: 10.5 TOTAL COST: £1.03 My ability to ignore food-related decision-making – thanks to Saturday’s prep – is welcome as Monday work stress begins. Because I was really trying to keep costs down, I’ve ended up avoiding (slightly) pricier leafy green veg, but Jackie Lynch feels this is a negative thing in terms of nutrition. She says: ‘Greens are an important source of magnesium, B vitamins and iron as well as protective antioxidants.’ One option, if you’re watching the budget, would be frozen spinach. You can get a 900g (11-portion) bag for £1.40, which works out at about 12p per portion. But, sadly, it suffers from the mush effect when you cook it. A 500g (six-portion) bag of fresh spinach costs £2, making it 33p per portion, while a 300g (three-and-three-quarter-portion) bag of mixed greens costs £1, or 26p per portion. So, again, even if you decide to widen your variety of vegetables, it need not be cost-prohibitive. DAY FIVE  Breakfast: Oats with an apple and sultanas, orange juice.  Portions: 3  Cost: 25.2p Snack: A carrot.  Portions: 1  Cost: 7.1p Lunch: Pork belly left-overs with broccoli (160g) and salad (80g).  Portions: 3  Cost: 18p Snack: Banana.  Portions: 1.5  Cost: 13p Dinner: Spaghetti with chunky tomato (160g) and courgette (80g) sauce. Portions: 3  Cost: 26.6p TOTAL: 11.5 TOTAL COST: 89.9p TOTAL COST FOR FIVE DAYS (AND 52.5 PORTIONS): £5.14 I’m interested to see what these past few days has done to my weight. The scales tell me I’ve gained about 2.5 lb, which is likely to be down to water retention. Jackie is impressed: ‘You’ve done well to skew the ratio in favour of vegetables, so intake of sugary fruit is moderate.’ I wasn’t perfect, though. Jackie says: ‘I’d prefer to see more fresh fruit, because over five days the sultanas and fruit juice contain more sugar than two Mars bars. Fruit with an edible skin, such as apples or pears, is much lower in sugar and provides more fibre, which is vital for a healthy digestion. ‘I think your protein intake may have suffered at times – on Friday you’re running all day on just fruit and veg, which might mean energy levels flag. ‘Adding a good dose of protein-rich nuts or seeds to Friday’s breakfast would help neutralise the sugary dried fruit and boost energy throughout the morning.’ Did can you do ten-a-day on a budget? Yes. However, planning and budgeting and weighing – and eating soggy frozen veg – was a bit of a nightmare. For anyone who is time-pressed, trying to stick to the target might be difficult.

Chance The Rapper Earns $500K From Apple For His Album Coloring Book Home News Madison Silvers March 18th, 2017 - 2:04 PM Buy music on this topic at | Amazon Photo Credit: Mauricio Alvarado While adult “coloring books” seem to be all of the rage these days, Chance The Rapper‘s 2016 album Coloring Book seems to leave more controversy in it’s wake than the stress-free ease now associated with the former. Although last year’s hip-hop album, by the artist also known as Chancelor Johnathan Bennett, celebrated critical acclaim,  recent ponderings question the legitimacy of Chance’s self-proclaimed title as an “independent artist”. According to Spin Magazine, Fans seem to be suspicious of all of this marketed independence— especially since news of the rapper’s $500,000 contract with Apple Music came to head. The recording artist, previous to his last record, shared his mix-tapes on Soundcloud for free. However, 2016’s Coloring Book entered into public consumption via an exclusive two-week stint on Apple’s music-streaming service. But, then it went back onto Chance The Rapper’s Soundcloud page, following, subsequently, in suit of all of his previous works. The hip-hop artist’s signature on Apple’s dotted line, and the resulting appearance on an Apple commercial leaves listeners and advocates of independent artists with a sour taste in their mouth. Apparently, snuggling up with one of the largest companies in the world isn’t as kosher as Chance The Rapper might have thought. Questions of transparency have come up, and in lieu of this “grey area” currently hovering over the artist’s album and his career, past deals with Kit Kat, a Nestlé-owned company, and his wide-eyed desire for a Grammy, further this cloudy debacle. The Rapper has recently taken to his twitter account, after keeping quiet on the issue, to explain himself and his contract with Apple. Chance maintains his beliefs that he is still an indie rapper, and that he is transparent as ever. Tags apple music Chance the Rapper Tweet Comments Madison Silvers Hi. My name is Madi. Meow.

All the while, other tech companies never seem to grapple with similar demands from analysts and pundits. Whereas Apple needs to outdo the iPhone, we never hear calls for Facebook to come up with a social network killer or for Google to come up with a product that will obsolete the search engine. Don't Miss: Leak shows a stunning Galaxy S8 in a stolen Jet Black finish The iPhone’s 10th anniversary earlier this year sparked a number of opinion pieces proclaiming that the iPhone has peaked and that it’s time for Apple to deliver an iPhone killer, a futuristic device that will obsolete the iPhone in the same way that Apple’s iconic smartphone quickly rendered the iPod outdated. Writing for Wired, Davey Alba opined that the iPhone — of all things — is actually slowing Apple down and that the company must figure out what’s next. Now Apple is facing a turning point, and once again the iPhone is the reason—but not in a good way this time around. The smartphone market is saturated. Rivals, especially Google, are building hardware that truly rivals the iPhone. After 10 years, the iPhone can no longer serve as Apple’s growth engine. The company now faces the same challenge it did a decade ago: figuring out what’s next. It’s not an unfair point, but it conveniently overlooks the fact that Apple has become rather adept at extracting more dollars from existing iPhone owners via its burgeoning suite of services. Whether it’s the App Store — which recorded its most profitable day in company history not too long ago — or the growing popularity of Apple Music, Apple has figured out a few ways to pad its bottom line even as iPhone sales growth did an about-face this past year. Meanwhile, a piece in Forbes from earlier this year took an even bolder position, arguing that Apple must build an iPhone killer. Which means it’s time for Apple to kill the iPhone…not in one fell swoop, of course, and not as the intended goal… No matter how innovative your product or service once was, sticking to incrementalism in order to most efficiency milk the maximum amount of revenue out of it is a losing proposition. As your incremental change curve flattens out, the development that will [obsolete you] will be disappearing in your windshield before… you ever noticed it approaching in your rear-view mirror. It’s time for Apple to build the iPhone killer. The only problem is that doing so is impossible. The original iPhone was a revolutionary device that quickly transformed the smartphone into an indispensable part of the way we live. And because its functionality is wildly expansive and limited only by the imagination of third-party developers, it’s utility isn’t artificially stunted in the way that the iPod’s was. The smartphone in general, and the iPhone in particular, isn’t going anywhere because it functions as a portal of sorts; its utility is always expanding as its hardware improves and new software is developed. Looking ahead, for example, the upcoming iPhone 8 is said to feature advanced augmented reality functionality that may very well transform the way we use our smartphones. The fact of the matter is that some products become so entrenched in our everyday lives that the notion of killing them off simply isn’t realistic. Notice how we never hear calls for anyone to develop a TV killer or for Google to develop search engine killer. Truly revolutionary products and technologies have extremely long shelf lives that can’t be obsoleted on an arbitrary time frame. The iPod’s demise at the hands of the iPhone was an exception, not the rule. Put simply, the iPhone isn’t going anywhere no matter what type of product area Apple opts to enter. Curiously, some people have even argued that a more advanced version of the Apple Watch might eventually replace the iPhone. These claims, I believe, completely overlook the fact that a big and easily accessible smartphone display can never be replaced by even the most intuitive software on a watch or a pair of AR glasses. Point being, there’s never going to be an iPhone killer, only new and advanced iPhones that render previous models obsolete. Read More Having said that, Apple still doesn’t seem to get the credit it deserves for continually rolling out, with absolutely no aberration, impressive advances in iPhone technology year after year. From huge leaps in hardware performance to incredible improvements in camera technology, Apple has managed to steadily and substantially improve the iPhone user experience every single year for 9 years running. And with the iPhone 8 looming on the horizon, the next leap in performance and design may be the biggest one yet. Just last quarter, Apple posted a new quarterly record for iPhone sales. And yet, for reasons that defy explanation, some pundits would have you believe that Apple is in dire straits and desperately in need of rolling out an iPhone killer.

The announcement comes as Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook undertakes his latest trip to a country that ranks as Apple’s single biggest overseas market. Apple said it plans to build new research facilities in the eastern Chinese cities of Shanghai and Suzhou, on top of centres already slated for Beijing and the southern city of Shenzhen. It also pledged to spend at least 3.5 billion yuan ($507 million) on research institutions. All four centres will open later this year, the company said in a statement on its Chinese website. They will help Apple cooperate with local partners and attract talent from its local suppliers as well as from top educational institutes, according to its press release. The announcement came a day before Cook is scheduled to address a high-profile economic forum in Beijing, where senior government officials will confer with the heads of some of the world’s biggest corporations, including Royal Dutch Shell and Saudi Arabian Oil. Foreign companies have a long-established tradition of building research bases in China to both signal their commitment to the country and curry favour with the government. Apple’s announcement comes after iPhone shipments fell for the first time in China on an annual basis, in 2016.  China had for years driven Apple’s spectacular growth, even as smartphone demand elsewhere faltered. But local vendors like Huawei Technologies Co., Oppo and Vivo are now eroding its market share with increasingly high-end devices. The U.S. company is counting on the release of the 10th anniversary iPhone later this year to supercharge growth.

Online auction house, Breker is including one in its forthcoming sale of "Office Antiques, Science & Technology, Fine Toys & Automata" to be held on May, 20, 2017. So why so much interest in 40-year old technology?   Auction Team Breker's recent newsletter reports: Our May auction features the best-preserved example of an Apple-1 computer to have appeared on the market. Not only does this Apple-1 (serial-no. 01-0073) come direct from its original owner, a computer engineer from Berkeley, California, it is accompanied by an archive of original documents, including the preliminary operation manual, circuit diagrams and even notes of telephone calls with Steve Wozniak in 1977. This computer is logged as No. 14 in Willegal’s Apple I Registry. In view of its condition and pedigree the estimate of € 180,000 – 300,000 equivalent to US$ 190,000 – 320,000 seems low until you notice that there is no mention of it being in "working condition" or "functioning", which would make it very rare as there are reckoned to be only around eight such models extant, which is an increase on the six that we previously quoted.  The Breker home page still includes one of them, billed as "Original Apple 1 Computer, 1976" as the centrepiece of its examples of recent sales. This is for a model it sold on May 25th 2013 setting a world record price, see our report Apple 1 Sold For Record Price of $668K. Not only was this in fully working condition, its motherboard also has "Woz" written on it, presumably by Steve Wozniak himself.  The previous top price for an Apple 1 was also in a Breker auction and was $640,000 in November 2014, again for a working model. Currently the record is held by Bonhams that sold another functioning version for $905,000 in New York. Even if the Apple 1 in the forthcoming sale isn't in a functioning condition it is still rare and collectible. In total 66 Apple 1s are listed on the Apple 1 Registry maintained by Mike Willegal but this isn't a definitive figure as this quote from the site shows: How Many Apple 1s Exist? Besides those listed here, I have heard through the grapevine of several more.  It is also probable that the first 4 units on the list (and possibly more) have been lost.  There are undoubtedly a number that are still not known to me or or my friends.  It is very possible that some of the poorer documented units on this list could be duplicates.  It would be rather surprising if as many as 66 are still around. There were only two production runs of Apple 1s which resulted in only 200 being built. Of these 175 were sold before Apple dropped the model from price list in October 1997 in order to sell the Apple II. The number of models in circulation could have been further limited as Apple 1 owners were offered trade-in deals to upgrade. It had been thought that Apple destroyed the returned Apple 1s, but this comment on Andrew Cunningham's news item on Ars Technica  about the upcoming auction suggests this may not have been deliberate: The Apple I systems that were traded in for Apple IIs were all stored in a room at Apple's HQ in Cupertino (in the Mariani I building as I recall) and largely forgotten. Some years later, Apple decided to start a small museum of company products, and staff went to that room to get one for display. But the room was now used for something completely different and there were no sign of the Apple I systems. Nobody knew where they had gone, and nobody owned up to having removed them or to ordering the room to be cleaned out. That's why Apple I systems are so scarce. The company actually had to purchase an Apple I for the museum. With the Apple 1 reaching its 40th anniversary next month, we are now keen to preserve its history. An early prototype, the "Celebration" Apple1 was expected to raise $1 million at an  online auction organised by Charitybuzz was expected to raise $1 million, but the winning bid was only $815,000 and new owners, co-founders of the cosmetics company Glamglow Glenn and Shannon Dellimore see the board that they purchased as a museum peice or work of art and were quoted in our report, Unique Apple I Sold At Auction, as saying: "Talking to historians and museums and auction houses, this particular Apple-1 in 10 to 15 years, could be worth as much as a Monet or Picasso."    More Information Auction Team Breker Related Articles Apple 1 Sold For Record Price of $668K Apple 1 Breaks Records In Online Auction Rare Apple I Available at Auction Milestones in the history of Apple Unique Apple I Sold At Auction Steve Jobs and Apple Steve Wozniak   To be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.   Python cx_Oracle Adds Direct Binding 15/03/2017 Oracle has released a new version of the Python interface for Oracle Database.

Apple native email supports auto-download of images and supports CSS3 coding, video, and GIF playback out-of-the-box. Hence, email marketers can experiment with different elements that increase the overall user interactivity. By increasing the user interactivity within the emails, your subscriber tends to spend more time with your emails, and this in turn helps in conversion.  Effects that were only achieved on webpages using Javascript are now possible with keyframe animations. Animations such as flutter, flip, dissolve or zoom out when clicked or tapped raise user’s curiosity and this leverages into improved UX.  Animations made possible using Keyframe animation Rotating Banner & Slider in Email Accordion in Email Interactive Menu in Email Integrated Forms in Email Video Playback in Email Animated GIF in Email And many more… Is all love lost for other email clients?! Just because Apple devices support different interactive elements doesn’t make it exclusive. GIF playback is supported in most of the widely used email clients. Android Native client and Thunderbird are second to Apple in terms of compatibility in mobile and desktop respectively. Moreover, for the non-supporting email clients, appropriate fallback options ensure that user experience is not broken.  Our latest infographic, titled ‘Email advancements for Apple Subscribers’, lists all of the possible interactive elements, along with sample emails for consideration.

Arts & Entertainment Music Chance the Rapper's Apple deal — still independent, in control Chance the Rapper Zbigniew Bzdak / Chicago Tribune Chance the Rapper announced a $1 million donation to Chicago Public Schools after meeting with Gov. Bruce Rauner. Chance the Rapper announced a $1 million donation to Chicago Public Schools after meeting with Gov. Bruce Rauner. (Zbigniew Bzdak / Chicago Tribune) Greg KotContact Reporter Privacy Policy In recent days, Chance the Rapper has come under scrutiny from his massive fan base for how he conducts business. Though his music has drawn acclaim, his notion of how to release that music — free, direct to fans — has earned him praise as a revolutionary. The 23-year-old artist, who grew up on the South Side and began releasing mixtapes while still roaming the halls of Jones College Prep High School, found himself a triple Grammy Award winner in February, even though he hadn't yet sold a single piece of recorded music. MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR On Friday, Chance took to Twitter because he felt compelled to explain a deal he negotiated last spring with Apple Music. The digital music platform paid Chance $500,000 and financed a TV commercial for exclusive rights to the "Coloring Book" album. After two weeks on the Apple site, the album became available for free at multiple online outlets. "I never felt the need to correct folks on my relationship with @apple but now that more people have tried to discredit my independence, I wanna clear things up," he wrote. "I needed the money and they're all good people over there. I feel like if I didn't clear it up people would keep trying to discredit all the work we did to make Coloring Book what it became. I think (an) artist can gain a lot from the streaming wars as long as they remain in control of their own product." Later, he advised artists that "If you come across opportunities to work with good people, pick up cash and keep your integrity I say Do It." The message behind the series of tweets: Don't put me in a box. And, by extension, don't allow yourself to be put in a box. The late, great Prince would be proud. The Minneapolis funk master, who died last April, was both praised and pilloried for his unconventional business practices. In many ways he created a blueprint for what Chance is doing now. After chafing under the major-label restrictions imposed on his music for nearly two decades, Prince went independent in the mid-'90s and became one of the first major artists to embrace the internet to communicate with and market music directly to his fans. He later began licensing his albums one at a time to major labels to benefit from their distribution while retaining ownership of his music. In the same way, Chance is experimenting with using corporate clout and cash to expand the reach of his music. In recent interviews, he has discussed the importance of artists finding a way to use the system to serve their music, rather than becoming servants of the industry — as Prince once felt he had become before breaking free. Though some of his fans would surely love Chance to remain that kid who handed them a copy of his mixtape on the streetcorner, this is an artist who thinks big, and the Apple deal was just part of the larger canvas on which he's painting. He staged a major multiracial music festival in U.S. Cellular Field last year, led a rally in Millennium Park on Election Day in November, recently met with Gov. Bruce Rauner and donated $1 million to Chicago Public Schools. His albums and videos aren't just solo efforts but incorporate a community of artists — musicians, singers, producers, video directors, dancers. It's telling that the first major project he focused on after the 2013 "Acid Rap" mixtape made him a national figure was "Surf," an album helmed by his trumpet player, Nico Segal. By framing his music as the work of a community, Chance is on to something much bigger than a deal with a corporate power. Just as Prince did before him, Chance is demonstrating that it's time to put artists in charge of their futures — led by a generation of creatives who Chance believes can fundamentally change the way art is made, distributed and consumed. greg@gregkot.com Twitter @gregkot RELATED STORIES: Judge: Financial information in Chance the Rapper case stays confidential Chance the Rapper writes $1 million check to CPS as a 'call to action' Stephen Colbert, Chance the Rapper team up to reimagine 'Arthur' theme Who had a better year: Chance the Rapper or Kanye West?

When wanderlust took over, he digitized his entire library into about 50,000 portable MP3s that he could take wherever he traveled. The music industry has become increasingly populated by streaming services that offer a similar ability to listen to music anywhere, but the lack of ownership concerns Fragomeni. In the age of Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, and Tidal, the self-professed music collector saw an opportunity to cater to listeners like himself who want to own their music. Alongside co-founder Aprile Elcich, he created Voltra, a digital music player and store that promises artists who sign up directly with Voltra will receive 100 percent of the revenue from the streams and purchases of their songs. Voltra is a response to the growing dominance of streaming services in the contemporary music landscape. Spotify currently boasts more than 50 million subscribers, while Apple Music reached 20 million subscribers at the end of last year. Yet Fragomeni, whose previous startup venture Nodejitsu was acquired by GoDaddy in 2015, believes there will always be dedicated connoisseurs who are interested in actually owning music. “There’s a pretty significant population of people who collect and own music, and I think that product space was a little bit neglected,” he says. “As music lovers, we really wanted to have a product that was totally focused on music ownership.” Voltra’s desktop and mobile players — currently in beta testing — are free to download. Any users with a Voltra account can choose to either buy songs immediately or try out a new song with Voltra’s “stream-to-own” feature. It allows users to listen to an entire song once for free and then pay a small fee for each consecutive listen. After the 10th play, the track is fully paid for and officially owned by the user. Though artists and labels are able to opt out of the stream-to-own option, Fragomeni says the majority of Voltra’s catalog will be available with this feature. For Fragomeni, this model offers listeners a low-cost way to figure out if they enjoy a particular song while also ensuring that artists earn money off the songs that get played the most. Eliminating the 30-second free preview is a particular point of pride for Fragomeni: “Thirty-second previews actually suck, because you might totally miss this really awesome guitar solo at 1:10, but that got cut off from the preview, so you never decide that you’re going to buy that song.” Image: Voltra Voltra users can also purchase a premium membership upgrade for $10 a month. Premium members still pay for individual tracks, but they also receive access to the Voltra Audio Archive, which automatically backs up the listener’s music files to Amazon Glacier storage. Fragomeni views the premium option as targeted toward “users who are invested in owning music and want a secure and long-term music archiving solution.” This emphasis on lasting storage contrasts with subscription-based streaming services, where canceling your account comes with the risk of losing personally curated playlists and listening history. Fragomeni views Voltra as having an “ethical mission” in which “it’s really important for us to create a relationship between artists and listeners.” To accomplish this, Voltra encourages the discovery of new music for its users to own. Fragomeni describes Voltra’s music player and store as “symbiotic,” since the app generates song recommendations for users based on the music they already own. Voltra aims to strengthen two facets of this artist-listener relationship: If music ownership is Voltra’s priority for listeners, sufficient compensation is the company’s goal for artists. Both Fragomeni and Elcich have spent time playing in bands, and they continue to surround themselves with musicians. With the peer-to-peer opportunities of the internet age, Fragomeni recalls that the pair began to question why there were “so many middlemen taking a cut from artists who are trying to sell their music.” So the co-founders decided that artists who sign up directly through Voltra would receive 100 percent of their earnings, since the company doesn’t deduct a commission from their song profits. This applies to artists who sell their music directly on Voltra; with labels and distributors, Voltra takes a cut of ten percent. It’s also free for artists to upload their music to Voltra’s store. Voltra — which is not ad-supported — earns additional revenue from its sale of Pro Features to artists, labels, and distributors for five to ten dollars a month, offering musicians additional perks like customizable sales reports or a public artist page on the Voltra site. “The ultimate ethical objective is to try to have the artists be paid.” Fragomeni cites his view that artists — particularly independent artists — are not earning enough revenue from popular streaming services as one of the inspirations for his company’s business model. As Voltra prepares to launch publicly, songwriters and their representatives are currently appearing before the Copyright Royalty Board to argue for an increase in their per-stream earning rate from companies like Alphabet, Apple, Pandora, and Spotify. The Voltra team points to data from the artists’ rights blog The Trichordist, which claims that a musician can earn 99 cents after only 10 streams on Voltra, compared to 226 streams on Spotify, 134 on Apple Music, and 146 on Google Play. Spotify’s average payout per stream reportedly ranges from $0.006 to $0.0084, which is split among the the music's various "rights holders,” meaning that 226 streams would yield about $1.50, of which the artist would receive some portion. Resonate, a “streaming music cooperative” that began development last year, offers a stream-to-own system that is similar to Voltra’s — Resonate listeners fully pay for a track after nine plays — though Resonate deducts the standard streaming service commission of 30 percent of revenue, according to Forbes. “I feel like it’s weird that [Voltra’s business model] is novel,” Fragomeni says, “but I really believe that it’s possible to have a sustainable business with really cool premium services where the ultimate ethical objective is to try to have the artists be paid.” According to Fragomeni, about 5,000 participants have already registered in Voltra’s beta test, and the store offers nearly 3 million tracks. (For comparison, Spotify currently features more than 30 million songs.) Voltra aims to go live after reaching 10 million tracks, with Fragomeni tentatively projecting a launch date in late May.

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has awarded Apple three patents that add fitness and biometric features to earbuds quite like the recently released AirPods. The patents, called "Earbuds with Biometric Sensing," are capable of collecting a person's biometric information by pressing up against a part of the ear called the tragus. MORE: Best Wireless Headphones According to the patents, which were earlier discovered by Patently Apple, once the earbuds have been inserted into the ears, they'll shine a light on the tragus and measure the reflective properties off the feature. That information can be used to ensure the person wearing the earbuds is the authorized owner. Credit: USPTOMore Credit: USPTOAdditionally, the earbud patents suggest ways for Apple's technology to deliver noise-canceling features. According to the patents, Apple would allow audio that was registered within a 10- to 20-degree window in and would ban all other audio from reaching your ears. The noise-canceling feature could also be used to screen all audio, including voices. When Tom's Guide reviewed the AirPods, we liked their design, battery life and the ability to seamless connect to iOS devices. But there's always room for improvement, and adding features like biometrics and noise-canceling could go a long way in helping the AirPods compete against other wireless options. It's not clear at this point how biometrics might fit into Apple's plans. While it appears to be a way to authenticate you to use the earbuds, could it also be used down the road as a Touch ID-like function? The possibilities are endless. But like anything Apple-related, take all of these patents with the proverbial grain of salt. Like other tech companies, Apple constantly files for patents on technologies that might never come to its devices. These biometric earbuds could fall into that category.

You have until July to add an additional 2 years of Apple Care for $249, which would cover you until July 2019. I bought it in July 2016 and have used it roughly a few times per week since buying. Specs: 8-core 3.0ghz, 64gb RAM, 1tb SSD, Dual D700 GPUs. Super fast, super quiet machine. Will be very sad to see it go but I need the money to buy a portable editing rig. Comes with original packaging, power cable, Magic Mouse and Magic Keyboard. I bought the G-Speed Studio XL 48TB Thunderbolt 2 in late September 2016, and used it a few times per week along with the Mac Pro. It comes with a 3-year factory warranty, so you will be covered until late September 2019. I left the plastic shrink-wrap on most the exterior (not covering the fan obviously), so the housing looks 100% brand new. This unit has 8 slots. Right now 6 of the 8 slots contain 8TB drives, the other 2 slots are “EV” bays. You can add 1 or 2 additional 8TB drives and expand the capacity of the unit, or you can add other modules like the G-Tech EV RED Minimag Reader (included), which pops right into the slot. If you shoot RED or Arri, this is an awesome data management system (they also make a Cfast EV Reader for this unit). The EV modules easily pop in and out of the EV bay, so you can take it with you on shoots and use the USB3 or eSATA ports for connectivity. Comes with original packaging, power cable and thunderbolt 2 cable. Original packaging for all items included. Total retail value of these items = $13,276.90 Mac Pro: $8,077 before tax (apple.com) G-Speed Studio XL: $4,999.95 before tax (g-technology.com) G-Tech EV Minimag Reader: $199.95 before tax (g-technology.com) Asking $9,750 for everything. Price includes FedEx Ground shipping. Paypal fees extra. I'd love to sell everything together but feel free to send offers on the individual items. Thanks!

The rivalry between Apple and Samsung is the most talked about subject in the smartphone industry. The two companies are always looking for new features that can be added to their flagship smartphones so that they one-up each other. What’s interesting is that sometimes, both of them mimic what the other is doing. Rumor has it that Samsung is looking to make use of Apple’s 3D Touch display technology. Samsung Galaxy S8 to Feature Pressure-Sensitive Home Key Apple has already used this technology starting with iPhone 6S and now, Samsung is looking to implement this pressure-sensitive technology on the highly anticipated Galaxy Note 8. In fact, rumor has it that Samsung has already managed to make this technology fit with its OLED panels. Even better, during the Mobile World Congress event Samsung has showcased the said technology to different partner companies. Leaked pictures of Samsung’s Galaxy S8 flagship smartphone have showed that the South Korean tech giant has implemented a new edge-to-edge display. The same display is expected to be used on Galaxy Note 8 as well. The reason why this matters is because Galaxy S8’s bezels have been shrunk and the physical Home Key button has been removed. Galaxy Note 8 is expected to receive the same treatment, the difference being that Note 8 will feature a “virtual home button” that’s going to be equipped with this pressure-sensitive technology. Additionally, the virtual Home button will also feature a fingerprint sensor. The new Home button opens the door for many possibilities, for example Galaxy Note 8 owners are going to be able to open up different types of menus by hard-pressing on virtual button. We should mention that Samsung has already meddled with 3D Touch OLED panels before. The South Korean tech giant has manufactured the special 3D Touch displays that have been installed on smartphones such as Huawei 9. At the moment, everything we know is based on rumors therefore Samsung might decide to not equip Galaxy Note 8 with this technology. Nonetheless, once Galaxy Note 8 comes out it will definitely make waves in the tech industry. We can be sure that Galaxy Note 8 will be near-flawless considering the fiasco caused by Galaxy Note 7.

Name: Subject: Message: New colors and headphone ports: the new smartphone “features” Features Newsby Kris Carlon3 days ago 42 1114 16 I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: smartphones are so good these days that they’re almost all basically “good enough”. Camera performance stepped up across the board a few years ago and battery life in 2017 is pretty much guaranteed to get you through a busy day. Fast charging is widespread, build quality is exceptional and water-resistant ratings are becoming the norm. But are companies that desperate for differentiation now that the simple presence of a headphone port or a new color suddenly becomes a unique selling point? See also: Will ‘bezel-less’ be the big smartphone design trend of 2017? January 20, 2017 When Apple dropped the 3.5 mm headphone port on the iPhone 7 it claimed it was being courageous, but we all know it was really just about encouraging the sale of wireless AirPods. The included lightning connector EarPods and lightning to 3.5 mm adapter showed just how timid Apple’s courage truly was, but ever since then, smug OEMs that haven’t done anything differently since before the iPhone 7 announcement suddenly felt the need to make a big deal out of the fact their new phone still had a headphone port. Let me put this clearly: a headphone port is not a feature. Neither is a charging port or volume buttons or an IR blaster. They are just things that are there (or not). If some company down the road decides to remove the charging port entirely in favor of wireless charging, are other OEMs going to spontaneously start crowing about how their phones still feature a charging port? Let me put this clearly: a headphone port is not a feature. The change from microUSB to USB Type-C is equally uninteresting to me. It just is. If a company removes the headphone port but provides me with cabled headphones that work and an adapter for my other headphones, I don’t see the big deal. Likewise, if a company includes a charging brick that supplies my new phone with power, what do I care what the end of it looks like? USB Type-C is a new standard, not a feature. I’ve written before about nitpicking, in the sense that if the things we tend to focus on these days are all we have to complain about then we’re in a very fortunate stage of the smartphone evolution. It wasn’t that long ago that the vast majority of smartphones produced potato camera results, that a mid-afternoon recharge was essential for making it to dinner time, or that getting caught in the rain would mean the end for anything but an Xperia device. See also: Best Android phones 3 weeks ago But with phones being so good across the board now, companies seem to think that increasingly banal “features” are suddenly newsworthy items of interest. For example, OnePlus did its typical hypebeasting this week, all in the name of introducing a limited edition new color for the OnePlus 3T. Black. A black smartphone. Wow, whoever woulda thunk it? Again: color choices are table stakes options, not something special. The Collette edition OP3T is exactly the same as a regular 3T, except it’s black and it has Collette’s logo branded on the back. Forgive me if I’m unlikely to line up in the streets of Paris to try my luck at buying a black smartphone. Forgive me if I'm unlikely to line up in the streets of Paris to try my luck at buying a black smartphone. Now, I don’t blame OnePlus for advertising a new limited edition phone, even if it isn’t exactly exciting. But where most companies would have simply announced the new color on their Facebook page, OnePlus went through the effort of teasing an announcement and then counting down the days to the big reveal: of a very standard color in extremely limited edition that’s only available at one store in one city in Europe for one day. Suffice it to say, OnePlus’ fans were not very impressed. And nor should they be. Of course, OnePlus never claimed they were doing anything revolutionary, and if the limited edition color was anything other than black then perhaps the backlash wouldn’t be quite so palpable. The issue I have is that OnePlus tried to hype something as bland as a black color option as something of importance. It’s the same problem I have with OEMs making a big deal of the headphone port. These things are not a big deal, people, so stop acting as if they are. I'm sure we're going to see more of the status quo being sold as something significant in the years to come. Unfortunately, I’m sure we’re going to see more of the status quo being sold as something significant in the years to come. As the IR blaster disappears, as physical buttons become virtual and so on. You don’t get to hype the past. No car manufacturer makes a big deal of the fact their new vehicle has four wheels and a combustion engine. These things are a given. What we want to see hyped is what’s new, what’s fresh and what hasn’t been done for years before. But as consumers demonstrate they’re not into goofy gimmicks like LG’s modularity and that a solid, capable smartphone is what they truly want, it’s going to be increasingly hard for companies to hype new features. We as consumers seem to be willing to become beta testers for updates and quality assurance testers for new products that creep ever closer to the $1000 mark, so can we really blame OEMs for trying to hype yesterday’s facts as features? Probably not, but we should really learn not to fall for it. Features News Kris Carlon Kris Carlon is a Senior Editor at Android Authority.

(This was after she’d written the company an open letter admonishing it to pay musicians better royalties, something that led to an Apple policy change.) But now it looks like Swift might want to have an even bigger impact on the whole streaming-service landscape. It looks like she’s trying to launch a streaming service of her own. TMZ reports that Swift has filed documents to form a website “featuring non-downloadable multi-media content in the nature of audio recordings.” She apparently wants to call it Swifties, which is a really terrible name. She’s also planning to launch a line of musical equipment — including guitars, guitar straps, guitar picks, and drumsticks — as well as a series of retreats, educational camps, and online courses. The last time a country-pop superstar tried to develop his own streaming service, it was Garth Brooks with GhostTunes. Brooks launched GhostTunes in 2014, and it has already failed. Just saying. UPDATE: Well, whatever Swift has in mind for Swifties, it’s not gonna be a streaming service. As Billboard’s Dan Rys reports: [A] source confirmed to Billboard that she would not be launching a streaming service, and a closer look at the trademarks reveals a different, more probable, angle for the singer. What’s that angle, you ask? [Swifites] looks like a personalized fan club app complete with exclusive merchandise, audio/video/live performances and the possibility of a mobile game of some sort is on the horizon for Swift’s fans, rather than any kind of large-scale streaming service. Huh. So … OK. That seems a whole lot more viable (if waaaay less interesting) than a Taylor Swift-branded streaming service. Rys goes into pretty extensive detail in his analysis of the trademarks in question, and you can (and should) read the whole thing over at Billboard.

By David Snelling PUBLISHED: 07:38, Sun, Mar 19, 2017 | UPDATED: 07:39, Sun, Mar 19, 2017 If previous years are anything to go by, Apple will release its all-new iPhone 8 in September. This latest device could see some major changes with Apple expected to produce something special to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs, unveiled the company’s first ever smartphone in January 2007 and the US technology giant has since gone on to sell over one billion iPhones across the world. We’re expecting to see all the usual upgrades on the new iPhone 8 including faster processor, improved camera and better battery life. However, a new report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and Chinese research firm TrendForce suggest that the iPhone 8 will almost certainly have a feature that’s never been seen on an Apple smartphone before - a curved display. GETTYApple iPhone 8 could get this new feature Apple iPhone 8 - Leaked photos, concept images, and renders Sun, January 1, 2017 iPhone 8 is shaping up to be one of the most impressive Apple smartphones to date, with glass panels on the front and rear of the device, a curved borderless OLED display and no Home Button Play slideshow VENIAMIN GESKIN • TWITTER • CONCEPT IMAGES 1 of 21 Apple iPhone 8 will debut a brand-new all-glass look, with a curved OLED display and no physical Home Button There’s already been plenty of reports that Apple is planning to introduce an AMOLED screen on its new iPhone but this latest rumour now suggests it will curve subtly around the edge of the device. Arch-rival Samsung has been bending their screens for a number of years and the Galaxy S8, which launches on March 29th, is expected to take this technology to new level with a screen that will cover almost the entire front of the phone. It’s thought Apple won’t copy Samsung’s full curve but instead gently push the display around the edges of the case. Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive is reportedly designing the phone so that it resembles "a single sheet of glass". Apple is hotly-tipped to ditch the physical Home Button from the front of the smartphone, so that it can reduce the bezels around the display. But the dramatic changes planned for the next iPhone will not just be surface-deep. According to a new research note from UBS, Apple has put together a team of more than 1,000 engineers working on Augmented Reality (AR) technology ready for the iPhone. REDDIT • FLOCKMANN • CONCEPTSiPHONEThe iPhone 8 could feature a curved display Alongside the iPhone 8, Apple is also thought to be planning to launch an iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. These devices could include small updates over Apple’s current lineup and are likely to be cheaper than flagship iPhone 8. If September seems a long time to wait for a new iPhone there could be some good news coming sooner. Rumours are suggesting Apple is planning a Spring event which could see the company refresh the iPhone SE and introduce some new iPads. Apple has debuted new products in March four times in the last six years. Some sources have said that Apple will remove the Home Button from its new iPad range. This will allow the Cupertino company to dramatically reduce the size of the bezels around the display, except for the bezel along the top of the device, which contains the FaceTime camera and is said to remain.

The illustration of Apple's lengthy legal agreement is done by R. Sikoryak, an animator, illustrator, and cartoonist living in New York. The visuals are inspired by 59 different comics. For his newest project, R. Sikoryak tackles the monstrously and infamously dense legal document, iTunes Terms and Conditions, the contract everyone agrees to but no one reads. In a word for word 94-page adaptation, Sikoryak hilariously turns the agreement on its head―each page features an avatar of Apple cofounder and legendary visionary Steve Jobs juxtaposed with a different classic strip such as Mort Walker’s Beatle Bailey, or a contemporary graphic novel such as Craig Thompson’s Blankets or Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis. Adapting the legalese of the iTunes Terms and Conditions into another medium seems like an unfathomable undertaking, yet Sikoryak creates a surprisingly readable document, far different from its original, purely textual incarnation and thus proving the accessibility and flexibility of comics. When Sikoryak parodies Kate Beaton’s Hark A Vagrant peasant comics with Steve Jobs discussing objectionable material or Homer Simpson as Steve Jobs warning of the penalties of copyright infringement, Terms and Conditions serves as a surreal record of our modern digital age where technology competes with enduringly ironclad mediums. You can purchase 'Terms and Conditions' from the link below for $10.36. Read More Follow iClarified Comments (1) Add Comment D4xM4Nx - March 19, 2017 at 5:57am Oh man...

One of the devices will be branded the iPhone 8, with the other two possibly attracting the iPhone 7S moniker. Thus, we will likely see an iPhone 8 released alongside iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus devices. Sales positive TrendForce also suggested that iPhone sales will pick up significantly in 2017, and that the calendar year could be something of a landmark one for the Californian corporation. Apple hasn’t exactly struggled over the last 18 months, but its sales have slowed down slightly as the smartphone niche begins to recede somewhat. It has been suggested by numerous publications that we may already have reached ‘peak smartphone’, and the big players in this niche must now demonstrate that they can reinvigorate the public imagination. FunkyFocus / Pixabay But the opinion of TrendForce has been backed up by a major investment bank Morgan Stanley. Kate Huberty, an analyst at the corporation, suggests that demand for the iPhone 8 has been grossly underestimated, predicting an upsurge in sales of approximately 20 per cent for 2018. This would be a massive improvement for the Cupertino-based company, and one which would undoubtedly see the iPhone get back on track. “We do not think the super cycle is fully appreciated,” Huberty told CNBC PRO. “What we expect in September is a phone that has significant advancements in technology: OLED screens, 3-D sensors, wireless charging [and] likely some more advanced software in the area of artificial intelligence.” 100 million units In order to meet this demand, TrendForce suggests that Apple will produce 100 million iPhone 8 units; a massive figure even by the prolific standards of Apple. However, this initial production run will account for less than 50 per cent of total iPhone sales during the fiscal year, with the analyst expecting Apple to shift in the region of 230 million iPhones throughout the fiscal period. This would represent a 6 per cent increase on 2016, and would almost certainly have a positive impact on the Apple stock price. OLED expected TrendForce also suggests that Apple will indeed embrace OLED technology with the iPhone 8, something that has become almost a cliché in tech circles. Clearly preparations have been made for the move from LCD to OLED at Apple, and the analyst report suggests that Apple will indeed include OLED in the iPhone 8 generation. It is also suggested that the iPhone 8 display will be increased somewhat over previous releases, with a 5.8-inch screen linked with the device according to TrendForce. However, this screen will not result in a larger handset, as the slimming down of bezels and removal of the Home button on the iPhone 8 will allow a similar sized chassis to previous releases. TrendForce also suggests that the display of the iPhone 8 will be based on 2K resolution, with a display ratio that is likely to exceed 2:1. The panel will also feature a slight curve, although TrendForce believes that this will not be as pronounced as in some of the Samsung handsets. Samsung has practically made its reputation on curved screen displays in recent years, but analysts believe that Apple will not entirely follow suit with the iPhone 8, but will still go its own way while also introducing some form of curved technology for the first time. “The curve will be gentler than screens in Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge handsets. This is partly due to the challenges of making curved glass covers to match screens, according to the source,” Nikkei’s Debby Wu suggested. “While the curved screen will allow a viewable area of about 5.2 inches and make the iPhone even sleeker, it will not offer significant new functions”. $1,000 smartphone However, the inclusion of an OLED panel could have an impact on the price tag of the iPhone 8, as the technology costs significantly more than the LCD that the iPhone has been based on previously. Reports this week have suggested that the OLED panel will cost Apple significantly more than the display included in the iPhone 7, and that this expense will have to be passed on to the consumer. And with other components also expected to increase the price tag of the device, the consensus of opinion among analysts is that consumers can expect to pay in excess of $1,000 for this next generation Apple handset. Camera tech KGI Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo, probably the most renowned analyst anywhere within the mobile sphere, has also opened up on the camera technology that he believes will form part of the iPhone 8 armory. Central to this will be a revolutionary front camera setup, which will incorporate a 3D sensor intended to deliver several new features. The sensor will reportedly work in tandem with 2D images produced by the camera to create what are described as unique 3D selfies. What this precisely represents is not entirely clear, but there will obviously be a strong sharing aspect to this technology. Reports have previously suggested that Apple will particularly embrace augmented technology in the forthcoming Apple generation, but it seems to also have an eye on some unique 3D features. Facial recognition It is believed that the technology will also play a major role in the facial recognition features included in the iPhone 8, which will only strengthen the rumors that Apple will replace and / or supplement the TouchID functionality included in the iPhone series. Facial recognition could be used in order to unlock the smartphone, deliver remote payments and make purchases via Apple Pay. Apple already owns Israeli tech firm RealFace, meaning that the mega-corporation is well placed to deliver this technology in the iPhone 8 generation. Sensors utilized by the new camera will be able to perform depth of field calculations using a dedicated infrared transmitter and receiver, according to reports. Sony and Foxconn are both expected to get involved with this technology, and its inclusion could enable Apple to significantly update the dual-camera system included in the iPhone 7 Plus. UPDATE: 03-10-2017: There is some stark new news about the iPhone 8…it might not even exist! Recent reports suggest that the next generation smartphone from Apple, likely to launch in September, may not feature the iPhone 8 moniker that has been widely anticipated. iPhone Edition A new report from the highly regarded Japanese blog Mac Otakara suggests that Apple will instead brand the tenth generation of the iPhone as the iPhone Edition. This name would seemingly signify that the new smartphone is a top-of-the-range device, in accordance with the approach taken previously with the Apple Watch Edition. Image: Sheeraz Raza, ValueWalk The prestigious smartwatch cost in excess of $10,000, and while the Apple Watch Edition would obviously not be so highly priced, it has already been suggested that it could retail at a price point in excess of $1,000. Apple may also produce accompanying versions of the smartphone, which would then be branded differently.

With the Apple Watch, it's available right from your wrist. Updated March 2017: Added Siri updates for watchOS 3.2. Siri uses your voice to activate and answer queries. As such, it doesn't require a keyboard or a ton of screen space. And because it's contextually aware, it can handle complex questions and commands. That makes it ideal for something like the Apple Watch, where it can often work faster and more conveniently than any other input method. How to set up Siri on Apple Watch How to use Siri on Apple Watch How to quickly and reliably trigger Siri Everything Siri can do on your Apple Watch How to use Handoff to switch from Siri on your Apple Watch to your iPhone How to set up Siri on Apple Watch Siri on Apple Watch is intrinsically tied to your iPhone: If you've ever turned Siri on for your iPhone, it'll automatically be activated on your Apple Watch. If you need to enable Siri, however, here's how to do it. Open the Settings app on your iPhone. Go to the Siri setting. Tap the On/Off slider to enable Siri for iPhone and Apple Watch. How to use Siri on Apple Watch There are two ways to use Siri: via the automatic "Hey Siri" command, or manually by pressing the Digital Crown. Whatever way you use to activate Siri, keep in mind that everything is processed via your iPhone: If you don't have a strong cellular or Wi-Fi connection, your Apple Watch will be unable to process your command. If you're on cellular, Siri may also take a few moments to process properly; after speaking, Siri may prompt you with a quick "Hang on..." before getting your query. During this time, you can let your arm drop back to its normal position — your watch will tap you on the wrist when Siri has finished processing. Unlike Siri on your iPhone, your Apple Watch is always silent when talking with you — you'll only see text in response to a query. How to use "Hey Siri" on your Apple Watch Raise your Apple Watch to your face (or, if you have wrist raise disabled, tap on the screen to wake your watch). Say Hey, Siri followed by your query. Note: Hey Siri will only activate in the first few seconds that your Apple Watch screen is on — if you're not getting it to work, keep this in mind! How to manually activate Siri on your Apple Watch Press and hold the Digital Crown. State your question or command to Siri. How to quickly and reliably trigger Siri Thanks to room noise and other external factors, Siri doesn't always trigger reliably on the watch. Here are a few tips I've found for getting Siri to work more reliably—and not cut you off mid-sentence. 1. Force Siri to listen by keeping the Digital Crown pressed down This trick completely changed my Siri usage for the better: While not required, I recommend continuing to hold the Digital Crown in while speaking your query, to make sure Siri understands your full statement. (This is especially helpful in noisy environments, where Siri doesn't always know when you're finished speaking.) 2. Make "Hey Siri" work more reliably with screen taps To save battery, the Apple Watch only listens for the "Hey Siri" on screen wake. Unfortunately, that can make "Hey Siri" a little frustrating if you have your screen configured to wake on wrist raise and don't get the phrase out quickly enough. Instead, you can reset the process by briefly putting your palm over the screen to turn it off, then re-raising your wrist (or pressing on the display) to wake it, followed by "Hey Siri." 3. Wear your Watch with the microphone facing out Having trouble getting Siri to understand you? You may want to try Craig Hockenberry's "Reverse Crown" orientation with your Apple Watch. This keeps the watch on your left wrist, but flips the digital crown to the lower left side. It also moves the microphone and speaker to the right side, getting them closer to your voice when you raise your wrist. (In colder climates, this also frees the speaker from being buried under layers of clothing.) Everything Siri can do on your Apple Watch Watch Siri may not be quite as full-featured as iPhone Siri, but your digital assistant can still do a bunch of tasks — and chat with its iPhone buddy when otherwise at a loss. Here's a quick overview of what Siri can (and can't) do on the Apple Watch. Everything Siri can do on your Apple Watch How to use Handoff to switch from Siri on your Apple Watch to your iPhone Handoff lets you start an action on one device and finish it on another. It is compatible with the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and... Apple Watch! There are some things that Apple Watch just can't do, given its small screen. But if you ask Siri, it won't give up. Instead, it will redirect you to your iPhone and "automagically" transfer your request. You can quickly enable Handoff for your Apple Watch from the Watch app on your iPhone, if it's not already set up. On your iPhone, open the Watch app. Select the My Watch tab. Tap General. Scroll down to the Enable Handoff section and tap the switch to enable the feature. Once this is enabled, you'll be able to use Siri on your Apple Watch to ask for just about anything. If it's not a task the Apple Watch can handle, Siri will automatically offer to switch you over to your iPhone. Questions? Let us know in the comments.

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. If Dell can make the Dell Precision 5520, why can't Apple make a MacBook that's really Pro? That's the hed and lede that flashed through my mind after I read Daniel Rubino's review of the Dell Precision 5520 for Windows Central: Dell's powerful 15-inch Precision 5520 now has the latest Intel Xeon processor and NVIDIA Quadro graphics. This bulldozer of a PC with a 4K display may be your best bet if you're a graphics professional. Now, current Rene loves the 2016 MacBook Pro. I've been using the 13-inch Touchbar model since October and it's the best MacBook I've ever owned. I used to go back and forth between the 13-inch MacBook Air and old 13-inch MacBook Pro every couple of years, never able to find the right trade-off between portability and performance. Now I truly have the best of both. But that's just me. Past Rene worked in video and webdev and graphic design and wouldn't have been such a fan. He bought 17-inch, later 15-inch, and maxed them out. Current Rene spends most of his time in browsers, with some light Photoshop and Final Cut Pro thrown in for events and special projects. And all of that is fine on the new MacBook Pro. More than fine, considering I've been using the 8 GB Core i5 model and keep forgetting that's what it is. (I'm used to maxing out every Mac — this is new and weird for me.) I represent the growing, more mainstream "pro" market Apple's been targeting lately, rather than the traditional, higher-end market that historically supported the Mac. Some label it "pro-sumer" but it's more a reflection that value has come to derive not from speeds and feeds but from multiple vectors, including social. It's a market of millions, not thousands. That's hurt the traditional, higher-end pro, though. At least those who prefer Macs. They currently feel abandoned, like they stuck with Apple when Apple was doomed and, now that Apple is successful, they're being dumped for a younger, hotter new market. It's a sentiment that's been building each and every year the Mac Pro hasn't been updated. It surged late last year, though, when Apple introduced a bare-bones new MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar at the low-end for people who wanted a Retina MacBook Air, but didn't introduce an equal and opposite souped-up model on the high-end for people who wanted a workstation, only mobile. Now, tech graveyards are littered with the shattered relevance of analysts who claimed Apple simply had to ship netbooks or servers or mini-towers or licensed OS. Ignoring just exactly those kinds of myopic ravings has led to Apple being phenomenally successful. Far more than companies that netbooked their margins and themselves almost out of business. So, I'm not going to stand here and say Apple has to ship a higher-end MacBook Pro. Clearly, they don't, not any more than they have to ship Xserve or Aperture. For Apple, I imagine most of the "pro" market is more like me now. Perhaps even closer to the MacBook Pro "escape" and further from the Dell Precision 5520. If you listen to Twitter, the hardcore Apple community wants desktop-class Kaby Lake and Nvidia 1080 in their MacBooks, with 64 GB of RAM, hold the floppy. If you look at how Apple's customers vote with their wallets, though, the answer is profoundly different. Likewise, influencers. If I had to guess, people who buy Mac Pro have far less impact on growing the market these days than people who sit in coffee shops working on MacBooks. Apple is chasing that puck where it's going to be as well. It's why I think Apple's just isn't as worried about the horn effect as some others might be, including me. Apple can get it wrong and misread the market, of course. They walked back the buttonless iPod shuffle, fatty nano, and even G4 Cube. Mac Pro also taught Apple not to innovate what they can't rapidly iterate. That's what happens when you're audacious, though. Change comes with risk. So, while every instinct in my lower writer's brain wanted to pound away on the hed and lede above, wanted to say Apple should "screw the ROI" and make a higher-end MacBook Pro anyway, the more I wrote the less likely that possibility started to seem. Current Rene is fine with that because it doesn't really impact him. Everyone thinks Apple should do less and focus more — as long as it's someone else's favorite products and product lines that pay the price. That's why past Rene wants to tell current Rene to stuff it, and is still hoping to see a great MacBook Pro workstation... at least one more time.

One that appeals to their core VOCAL users. They may not line up in the coffee shops but they get online and post all day long. The other important group is developers/creatives. Without these guys, gone are the days of unique mac programs, compelling mac programs, ones that make you want to switch and even more importantly, iOS apps. Of course, a separate issue is if anyone outside a very few can make a viable living selling software. I guarantee you Rene, if Apple put together the very best 17" MBP they could think of and even if the price made your nose bleed, you'd be interested. I would. Be honest now..lol This is all interesting stuff of course. I do feel like Macs are the heart of Apple. Certainly not the bread winner but they're what make bringing in the bread possible. For me, MacOS (previously windows) is what drives everything, while mobile is an extension or compliment of it. Without that Mac, I wouldn't find iOS as compelling. Along that line, I wouldn't mind seeing Apple make more hardware. Airpods made me smile as I do each time i use them. But do more of this. They made USB-C standard, so make stuff for it. I gave Sony thousands for their mirrorless camera system. It's UI kinda sucks though. I got a logitech harmony (this is input 1 i have argued) I paid nearly 300 for. Too bad it's not based on iOS. Someone make me a printer without a crappy UI. How is Apple not selling wireless speakers with W1 chip? You got to sell monitors Apple. Just some examples but all of which enrich an ecosystem. PS..cheers for the article. These are the kind I like on iMore. 2 3 days ago Reply emjayess "Someone make me a printer without a crappy UI." God, yes! Couldn't agree more! I bought a laser printer rated #1 by Consumer Reports. It prints fast and efficiently, but the UI absolutely sucks--like something you'd see on a computer in the 90s. 0 3 days ago Reply Steve Doherty Just a thought.. Given Apple are obviously not going to give the segment of users who are clamouring for super high end hardware what they want, wouldn't it make sense to allow macOS to be licensed and capable of running on non Apple sanctioned hardware? This gives users the best of both worlds (stability of staying with 'official' hardware, as well as the flexibilty of hardware that power users want) and stops the grumbling from the 'Pro' users who feel disenfranchised. I know this was tried in the dark days of the 90s and was an epic fail, but the landscape is different now. I'll be looking at upgrading when they ship a 2017 iMac, but if it ships with a mid-range GPU as a top end option, I'm going back to Windows. 0 3 days ago Reply DannyJJK I can't see Apple doing this though, one of Apple's main selling points for their computers is the fact that it runs macOS 0 3 days ago Reply C6TX6 Most consumer equipment that is labeled "pro" or "professional" isn't. ;) I have a Dell XPS 9550 fully maxed out as well as a 2016 MBP fully maxed out as well. They're both similar. I do like the display on the Dell better. The keyboard and trackpad on the MBP (of course) are far superior. The Dell was still cheaper even when upgraded to 32GB DDR4-2400 and a Samsung 960 Pro 2TB PCI-E SSD. Battery life on both is similar. The 9560 with Kaby Lake was released in Jan. I really hope it doesn't have the issues that plagued the 9500 in its early stages. I think it's hilarious how many people are making a big deal about pro or non pro users. I deal with professional musicians, engineers, CEOs, scientists, professionals in politics and law (yes I said it!) and there are quite a few of those folks running sub par hardware and just refuse to spend serious money on a computer. I'm the type if I have to wait for my computer to do anything (aside from rendering or other projects that take time) I'm huffing and wanting to throw it out the window. Regardless of what you have, the SSD is truly the best thing since sliced bread. 1 3 days ago Reply mavsguy842 I see Apple making monitors and really high-end laptops and desktops as halo products more than products they want to make money with. It's a common tactic to get people interested with your super high end product, and almost all of them end up purchasing one of your high end or mid-range products instead because they really don't NEED (and probably can't afford) the super high end. Without those halo products the brand starts to lose its luster. 0 3 days ago Reply returnmyjedi "Screw the ROI" Not a very nice thing to say to the Republic of Ireland, and on St Patrick's day as well! 3 3 days ago Reply VAVA Mk2 +1 Posted via the iMore App for Android 1 3 days ago Reply PoisonMaps I agree with Rene. There is a subset of users who cannot do what they need on Apple’s current laptop range purely because the available hardware is not powerful enough (mainly due to RAM or graphics considerations). Even if there aren’t enough such users for Apple to bother with a high-spec laptop for purely financial reasons, there are plenty of other reasons why it is worth their while. When people are reluctantly leaving Apple’s ecosystem because their products aren’t powerful enough then that sort of bad PR must affect sales on the rest of the range. 1 3 days ago Reply Moodyz The prices of their current 'mainstream' pro (weasel term for pseudo-pro, me thinks) models like the 15" TouchBar MBP are already insane enough. Can't imagine how much a real pro machine from them would cost, and that's before adding a couple of hundred quid for the bloody dongles. 0 3 days ago Reply moooooooo totally agree. The new MBP with touchbar same spec as my 2014 RMBP is $NZ4600 (plus all the dongles i'll need) - thats a ton of money given i paid $NZ3200 for the same spec'd model in January 2015 sans touchbar.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Apple patent filing suggests AirPods could one day… Apple patent filing suggests AirPods could one day help track your fitness By Christian de Looper — March 16, 2017 11:35 AM Subscribe Share Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you want to keep better tabs on your health and fitness, you're set to get more and more devices that can help you do so. Apple is putting more and more of a focus on fitness tracking, and that’s unlikely to change anytime soon. While the Apple Watch will continue to get better at tracking your health and fitness, it looks like Apple could soon use another device for tracking — AirPods. A new patent application has been discovered by the folks over at AppleInsider, and it shows that Apple may be working on a pair of AirPods packed with sensors that will allow them to track your health and fitness — on top of obviously functioning like a pair of headphones. More: Apple’s Find My AirPods feature makes it nearly impossible to lose your ‘buds Sensors that are listed in the filing include a PPG sensor, which is already used in the Apple Watch and is a common way to track heart rate by shining a light onto the skin and measuring the variations in reflections. That tech can also be used to characterize the blood. The patent application also mentions the use of a VO2 sensor, which detects the maximum amount of oxygen someone can use during exercise. Not only that, but it also notes an EKG sensor and ICG sensor could be used to detect the electrical activity of the heart. The news highlights a trend that sees tech companies taking more and more of an interest in health and fitness tracking. Wearable devices are increasingly fitness focused, and whether Apple uses AirPods for fitness tracking or not, that trend is likely to continue. AirPods themselves were first launched at the end of 2016, and have met with quite a bit of success, to the point where the availability of AirPods has been limited since the launch. It will be interesting to see if Apple intends to integrate biometric sensors into AirPods. If the company does, it could help make them even more popular than they already are.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: Signs of fifth-gen Apple TV noted in developer logs, new unit thought to feature faster processor, 4K streaming support Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, March 17th, 2017, 05:31 Category: Apple TV, Hardware, Rumor The first network traffic from what seems to be a fifth-generation Apple TV capable of streaming 4K video has been captured in developer logs. The device is said to be codenamed “J105” and could launch as soon as this year. Firi Games, the developers behind arcade games Phoenix HD and Phoenix II, stated they have seen a single device identified as “AppleTV6,2” and running “tvOS 11.0” connect to Phoenix HD for Apple TV from the United States in its logs. The IP address falls within a range linked to Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino. The current Apple TV has a model identifier of AppleTV5,3, and Apple TV6,2 does not correspond with any released model. While this should be taken with a grain of salt, as details can be faked, similar evidence of an iPhone 5s running iOS 7 showed up in January 2013, around nine months before the device was announced. If Apple is following its past history, this could indicate a new Apple TV, as the current generation unit launched in October 2015. No other details about a fifth-generation Apple TV device have been confirmed. In December 2015, it was rumored that the next-generation Apple TV would feature a new CPU with dramatically improved performance. Last quarter, Apple financial chief Luca Maestri stated that the Apple TV remains something of a hobby for Apple, which reportedly shelved its rumored streaming TV service and only has its “toe in the water” with original content. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Microsoft Loves iPhones: OneDrive App Updated with iMessage Support GO New OneDrive version released this morning Mar 18, 2017 12:51 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Say what you want about Microsoft’s mobile efforts, but you can’t blame the company for not being committed to smartphones. The only problem here is that Microsoft is committed to a mobile platform that it doesn’t own, leaving its own Windows phones well behind competition. Today, the software giant has released another important update for iPhone users that provides them with quicker access to files stored in the cloud. The latest version of OneDrive for iOS, which has reached 8.11.5, comes with support for Apple’s iMessage, the messaging solution that’s exclusively available for users in Cupertino’s ecosystem. With this update, OneDrive becomes available for iMessage users straight in the ongoing conversation, making it possible to connect to their Microsoft cloud accounts, select files, and share them on the go. It all takes just a few seconds and sharing files and folders stored in OneDrive doesn’t require anything else than a few taps within iMessage. Apple’s iMessage Apple is betting big on iMessage, as the latest version of iOS brought some big updates for the app which expand its messaging capabilities with new emoji and support for add-ons, such as GIF apps that make it possible to include animated pics in conversations. iMessage, however, remains an iOS-exclusive solution, and even though there were rumors that Apple wanted to bring it on Android, it’s hard to believe that such a thing would happen. Microsoft has apparently noticed the iMessage opportunity, so the company is trying to make its solutions available at one-tap distance right in the messaging app. Most likely, OneDrive is just the beginning, with other apps likely to get iMessage integration in the coming weeks and months. For what it’s worth, OneDrive requires iOS 9 or later and can be installed on iPhones, iPads, and iPod touch, obviously without paying a single cent. The app does come with in-app purchases and makes it possible to get subscriptions for other Microsoft products, including Office 365. #Microsoft#OneDrive#iPhone#iMessage subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Windows XP Installed on an iPhone 7 Because Why Not - Video Give Up on an iPhone 7 or Samsung Galaxy S7 for This Windows Phone and Get $600 Microsoft’s Surface Phone Could Launch in 2019 as iPhone 9 Rival - Rumors Microsoft vs. Apple, Round 2: New iPad Pro in the Works As Surface Keeps Growing Windows 10 Cumulative Update KB4015438 Also Taking Ages to Install Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Build 15063 for PC and Mobile YouTube on Restricted Mode Blocking LGBTQ+ Content: Our System Is Flawed 7 Tips to Stay Safe from Attacks like the Fappening New Instagram Update Allows Users to Save Live Videos Dutch Police Buys Unnecessary Microsoft Office Licenses by Mistake… Twice Google Releases Android 7.1.2 Nougat Beta 2 for Nexus and Pixel Windows 10 Cumulative Update KB4015438 Also Taking Ages to Install    OneDrive integrated in iMessage New Apps WMS Log Analyzer Professional Edition: A WMS Log Analyzer that provides you with multithreaded processing and allows you to export he generated reports to HTML, CSV and TXT formats Aiseesoft Video Converter Ultimate: An application that provides users with the possibility to easily convert video to and from various formats, as well as convert home-made DVDs Mozilla Lightning Project: A simple extension that helps you manage your daily schedule directly within Thunderbird or SeaMonkey, so you'll never miss an important event K-Lite Codec Pack Basic: A lightweight edition of DirectShow filters and codecs for playing video files with extensions such as MKV, AVI, MP4, OGM and FLV Web Log Suite Enterprise Edition: Generate reports from the raw log files from your website that you can analyze in depth to determine the number of visitors using this app Irida: Compose messages on your PC and send them to various contacts using an Android phone connected to the same network, with this nifty application Windows Repair Toolbox: Conveniently diagnose and repair broken processes on your operating system to improve its overall responsiveness and performance Reader comments Microsoft Launches Visual Studio 2017 more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Samsung has done the impossible with the Galaxy S8 Image Source: Benjamin Geskin Zach Epstein @zacharye March 17th, 2017 at 9:41 AM Share Tweet In the smartphone market, Samsung found success not by differentiating and carving its own path, but by taking a page out of Apple’s playbook. Or should we say, 132 pages. Apple turned the cell phone industry on its head in 2007 when it released the original iPhone. There was certainly no better company to model its devices and strategy after, and Samsung’s sales skyrocketed once it began retooling its devices to look and function more like Apple’s smartphones and tablets. Samsung still takes pages out of the Apple playbook from time to time — case in point — but it has truly elevated its game in recent years, with several recent generations of flagship phones that contend with the iPhone on every level. There is one are where Samsung flagships have never managed to compete with iPhones, but it looks like that will change with the upcoming new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Don't Miss: There’s a mysterious new Google phone in the works and it isn’t the Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL In just a week and a half, Samsung will unveil its next-generation flagship smartphones at a press conference in New York City. The wait has felt like an eternity considering how long Galaxy S8 details have been leaking. We know almost everything there is to know about the S8 and S8+, including exactly what they look like and when they’ll be released. And now, we know how remarkably powerful these hot new handsets are going to be. Each year when Samsung launches new Galaxy S phones, they’re instantly become the most powerful widely available Android phones in the world. Note the inclusion of the word “Android,” however. Samsung’s phones are never the most powerful phones, period, because they simply can’t measure up to iPhones in terms of power. Apple’s in-house chips and its silky smooth iOS software reign supreme each and every year until the next new iPhones are released. This year, however, it looks like things will be different. Two separate Geekbench 4 benchmark test results for the unreleased Galaxy S8 smartphone appeared on the Primate Labs website on Thursday night. Long story short, they’re very impressive. The S8 managed single-core scores of 1913 and 1978 in the two tests, and the multi-core scores came in at 6119 and 6375. Both sets of test results come from the international version of the Galaxy S8, which is powered by Samsung’s own Exynos 8895 processor, though earlier test results showed similar performance from the US version of the Galaxy S8+, which is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset. In terms of single-core performance, the Galaxy S8 doesn’t even come close to touching Apple’s latest iPhones — the iPhone 7 Plus racks up a score of nearly 3500. But in multi-core Geekbench 4 tests, the S8 handily beats the latest iPhones, which always score under 5800. This is a big victory for Samsung on paper, but it remains to be seen how it will translate as far as real-world performance. As we’re sure you’ll recall, earlier Samsung phones have come close to matching Apple’s iPhones on paper, but iPhones absolutely obliterate Galaxy phones in performance tests that gauge real-world power and speed.

This is a hefty update to the previous 60 day timeframe limit, and should put users’ minds at ease with regards to damaged screens. While the new timeframe policy hasn’t been detailed on the AppleCare+ website, it has been confirmed by support employees. Also, Apple has an eligibility tool on the site that now reflects the changes. After inputting an iPhone’s serial number, the site will show coverage is still available for purchase if the device was bought less than 12 months prior. This means AppleCare+ for the iPhone is now on par with the AppleCare programs for Mac and AppleTV with regard to when coverage can be applied. There are no changes to the AppleCare+ programs for iPad, Apple Watch, or iPod Touch, which still must be purchased within 60 days of the device. AppleCare+ coverage sells for $129 for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and is $99 for the iPhone SE. With this service, screen replacements will only cost users $29, while other repairs will be $99 under the plan. Take note, however, that purchasing coverage requires an iPhone to be physically inspected in-store or undergo a diagnostic test online prior to activation. So don’t plan on purchasing the insurance immediately after having an accident with your device.

Cook’s comments come amid rising tensions between the US and China, with protectionist rhetoric from US President Donald Trump sparking concern of increased trade friction between the two countries. “The reality is countries that are closed, that isolate themselves, it’s not good for their people,” said Cook, in a rare public speech. Apple said yesterday it will set up two new research and development centres in Shanghai and Suzhou in China. It has pledged to invest more than 3.5 billion yuan (RM2.2 billion) in research and development in China. Apple has been singled out in Chinese media as a potential target for retaliation in the event of a trade war. The Global Times warned last November if Trump triggered a trade war with China, Beijing would then target firms from Boeing to Apple in a “tit-for-tat” approach. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week China capital controls leave buyers of foreign property in bind (VIDEO) Forbes: Singapore’s richest move up four spots in world billionaire ranking Report: Three Chinese firms seeking stake in FGV Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Jack Ma to launch Alibaba’s regional distribution hub in Malaysia, sources say Bursa likely to be on upside next week Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Tiger Woods signs copies of his new book ‘The 1997 Masters: My Story’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles China overtakes Japan in S.Koreans’ worst countries list All the president’s lies ― David Leonhardt Trump meets Bill Gates after president seeks cuts in foreign aid FBI’s Comey says no information to support Trump wiretap claims Bill Gates tops Forbes rich list as Trump slips Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

By Agamoni Ghosh March 18, 2017 12:23 GMT iMessage screenshot alert rumour for iOS 11 may just be a farceApple User on social media have been freaking out ever since tweets and retweets are claiming that Apple with the iOS 11 plans to notify you when someone screenshots your chat messages. Something similar exists on instagram but only for its stories posts that disappear after a stipulated period. The said feature claims that users will get notified when any user tries to take a screenshot of iMessages. Business Insider however, traced the unverified claim to a vlogger back in December named Jay Way who claimed to have told Apple about his idea for screenshot alerts. There is absolutely no evidence that Apple is actually going to implement Way's idea or that any trustworthy source has made this claim. Apple itself has not commented on the matter so far. Although it's not surprising for old claims, especially related to upcoming devices and software to resurface on Twitter, many on the social media site expressed grave concern if such a thing were ever to happen. Check out some of the tweets below to see how people reacted: iOS 11 is slated to be unveiled towards the end of the year most likely on board the iPhone 8 series, but before that the company is likely to release several beta versions some time soon to give users an idea what the new version will be like.

Business Apps | 13 Mar 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (16) How to Set Up and Use Airline Boarding Passes in Wallet by Adam C. Engst When Tonya and I first started taking airline flights back in the early 1990s, I found it almost overwhelmingly stressful. It stemmed from the fact that flying was so expensive for us, but I also dreaded the byzantine process of buying tickets, checking in repeatedly, and dealing with security. So much seemed to hinge on not losing tickets, boarding passes, or identification cards. We never made any mistakes, though, and in retrospect, misplacing a ticket or boarding pass likely wouldn’t have been a big deal. (The first time I flew to Canada, pre 9/11, I forgot my passport but was still allowed through customs with a stern talking-to. Who knows what would happen today!) I still don’t enjoy airline travel, but I’ve done it enough that it no longer stresses me out to the same extent, even as dealing with invasive and unpleasant security requirements has gotten far worse. Plus, thanks to the Internet and the iPhone, the logistics have become vastly simpler. Being able to buy tickets, check in, and print boarding passes online was the first step, and the next major improvement came when Apple released the Passbook app, since renamed Wallet. I’ve been using Passbook/Wallet as long as has been possible — it took smaller airports like Ithaca a while to get the necessary scanners — but as much as I liked eliminating the need for paper, there were many problems early on. Getting passes into Passbook was difficult, due to horrible airline apps, and bringing up the passes quickly and reliably was also hard. Even during our trip to MacTech Conference in Los Angeles in November 2016, when I was using an iPhone 7 running iOS 10, I had problems. I eventually realized the Raise to Wake option kept swapping the boarding pass for the lock screen every time I lowered my iPhone while waiting in line to board. But on my most recent trip, to Austin for the ASMC Summit for independent Apple resellers, everything just worked. The United app knew about my itinerary once I was logged in, and the Delta app figured it out once I entered the ticket number. Both notified me when I could check in, and made it easy to do that and add my boarding passes to Wallet. iOS 10 and Wallet were smart enough to display a constant notification on the lock screen during the time I needed it, a single swipe brought up the boarding pass, and it stayed on screen while I waited in line, regardless of Raise to Wake. I’m sure many of you are nodding your heads in agreement, or wondering why I’m telling you all this. I’m no frequent flyer, so I’m sure that these improvements have been obvious to road warriors for a while. But I wanted to document how to do all this because I saw a lot of people still relying on paper boarding passes on that last trip. The experience of relying on an iPhone is so good, and so much better than dealing with paper, that if you’ve avoided it so far, I urge you to give it a try next time. But feel free to print a paper boarding pass as a backup until you’re comfortable with using your iPhone instead! Get the Airline App -- The first step is perhaps the hardest. It’s not that finding or downloading airline apps is difficult or expensive — they’re all free, and you can download them from the App Store like any other app. Here are links for the main U.S. airlines: Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and Virgin America. In my experience, the tricky part, particularly for those of us who have been traveling for many years, is logging in. I strongly recommend taking some time well before your next flight to set up the airline apps you might use. Do them all at once, since it can be a fussy, annoying process if you have old accounts, or if airline mergers have confused matters. It’s far easier to figure out your login information — usually some combination of frequent flyer number, email address, or username, plus a password or PIN — via the airline Web sites while working calmly on a Mac at home. You may need to ask for new passwords in some cases, and regardless, I’d encourage you to change your password to a 20-character random password and store it in a password manager like 1Password or LastPass. You have to assume that airline Web sites are under attack all the time, given the value of the information they store, and I imagine that identity theft surrounding airline travel could cause a world of hurt. So set strong passwords and make sure to use a password manager that you can access on your iPhone too. Check In and Add Boarding Passes -- Once you’re logged in to the airline app, it should be relatively obvious how you can check in for your flight, which you can usually do 24 hours beforehand. If you booked the flight through the same airline, the app might even know about your itinerary already. If not, you may have to enter a confirmation number or ticket number — I had to do that when using the Delta app to check in for the return leg of my last trip, which had originated on United. At the end of the check-in process, the apps I’ve used have provided a relatively clear Add to Wallet link or button. Tap it, and when it hands you off to Wallet, make sure everything looks correct in the boarding pass and then tap the Add link in the upper-right corner. You may or may not need to do this for each boarding pass; check to see what’s in Wallet after the first one. Now you’re ready for when you go to the airport. Call Up a Boarding Pass -- As you’re waiting in the security line, you’ll want to get your iPhone ready to display the boarding pass to the first security checker. Since Wallet knows your flight times, it starts displaying a notification on the iPhone’s lock screen some hours before. That notification appears every time you wake the iPhone, and you can swipe it to the right to display the boarding pass. Those with an iPhone 6, 6s, or 7 can also 3D Touch it and then tap a Show Pass button, but that’s a bit clumsier than the swipe. The boarding pass will stay on screen even beyond the time set in Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock, but as you approach the head of the line, check to make sure you haven’t inadvertently pressed the Sleep/Wake button on your iPhone. If you have an Apple Watch, you can instead bring up the Wallet app there — you might want to tap the Keep in Dock button to make it easier to get to for your return flight. The watch’s Wallet app shows the same passes that are in Wallet on the iPhone, and tapping the boarding pass shows you the same information, although you have to scroll down (or rotate the digital crown) to get to the QR code required for the scanner. While the Wallet app is up on the Apple Watch, the screen doesn’t turn off, so you don’t have to struggle with it when you get to the desk. Although I can’t imagine a scenario where this makes sense, you can prevent a boarding pass from appearing on your lock screen. Swipe right on its notification, tap the i button in the lower-right corner, and in the next screen, disable Suggest on Lock Screen. You can turn off automatic updates here too, but again, I can’t think of when it would be useful to have a boarding pass not update automatically. One final note. Since many flights have multiple legs, each with a separate boarding pass, note that Wallet seems to try to keep them together. If you see multiple dots at the bottom of a screen showing a boarding pass, try swiping left and right to move between them. The same applies if you’re traveling with a family and you have boarding passes for multiple people in your iPhone. Speaking of which, if you and your traveling companions all have iPhones and airline accounts, it’s usually possible for each person to manage their own boarding passes. But if not, you can check in for multiple travelers and add all their boarding passes to your iPhone, though that will require some swiping back and forth whenever you need to present them. Delete Passes -- Back in the day, you sometimes wanted to hold on to boarding passes to prove that you’d flown the miles for a frequent flyer program. In today’s world, unless you’re a tech writer who wants to keep a few boarding passes around to document how Wallet works, there’s little reason to retain them. To delete an expired boarding pass, open Wallet, tap the boarding pass, tap the i button in the lower-right corner, and then tap the Remove Pass option. Anything Else? -- It was difficult to document how all this works since I had to do it live, while juggling luggage and making sure I ended up on the right flight and in the right seat. There’s no way to simulate different scenarios or test something again. So, if I’ve missed something in this description of using boarding passes in Wallet, please let me know in the comments. Finally, what if you lose or break your iPhone, with all your travel documents on it, during your trip? If that happened to me while en route, I’d go to the nearest airline desk to see if they could print me a new boarding pass. And if it happened in the middle of my trip, which seems more likely, I’d try to get to the airport early for my departure, so there would be extra time to check in for the flight and get a printed boarding pass. If you have ever experienced such an iPhone disaster, leaving you without a boarding pass or information about your itinerary, tell us in the comments how you worked around the problem.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment David Lutchko  2017-03-13 16:34 I was a road warrior and agree that using Apple wallet can be great. That said, ALWAYS carry a paper copy of your itinerary with you. You never when your phone starts misbehaving, or runs out of power (evening flights), etc. Sometimes, though, I found it hard lugging a carry-on with one hand, toting a small computer backpack, and then juggling the phone with my non-dominant hand to show the flight attendant my seat assignment--it almost fell between the jetway and the plane (would have landed on the tarmac!). That would not have been good. Another consideration, if traveling internationally I may be tempted to backup my phone using iTunes and restore it to factory settings just to prevent a possible Customs and Immigration privacy invasion, not so much because I'm paranoid but more out of principle. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-03-13 23:17 Good point. In fact the NBC Nightly News had a story tonight (13 Mar 17) on the CBP demanding the phones and passwords of US Citizens at both land and air entry points. Reply Paul Albert  2017-03-13 20:56 I mean really all that trouble. Just print it out, fold it up and put in your wallet. Sometimes all this tech stuff just gets in the way of life. Flying is already stressful-why deal with this. Another headache. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:35 I always found the paper boarding passes much more stressful. You have to remember to print them out, put them in a location where you won't forget (and my wallet isn't nearly big enough to hold an 8.5x11 sheet of paper), and then constantly be sorting through them to get the right one for the right leg of the trip. Plus, you have to take them out and put them back repeatedly as you go through security and (sometimes) check in, and if you have any other papers with you, it's easy for them to get mixed up together. And of course, paper boarding passes don't update with new gate or time information. The iPhone is always in my right front pocket or in my hand, and the Apple Watch is always on my wrist. Now that Wallet works well, I find it a much better solution. But hey, if you like the paper, there's nothing stopping you from using it. Reply tonyblunt  2017-03-13 23:11 I used the iPhone for a few years and the process has got much simpler. Now I use the watch, less juggling things but some airlines have code readers that you cannot get your wrist under, hopefully they will upgrade soon. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:37 Yes, the scanners do have to be the right orientation for the watch. I didn't have trouble with that on this trip, but on some previous one, it was clear that I wouldn't be able to use the watch and I had to revert back to the iPhone. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-03-13 23:21 Adam, since the CBP is now demanding access to the phones of returning US Citizens, you might as well get the app "Mobile Passport" so you can just give them your phone immediately before 3 of their goons tackle you. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:40 Oh, don't get me started... The EFF has a page on privacy at the boarder, and I need to write more about it. http://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017 Reply Tonya not the TidBits Tonya  2017-03-14 01:29 When my husband and I travel together, we always put both of our boarding passes on both phones to provide a backup in case one phone goes on the fritz during the boarding process. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:37 That's smart! Reply Tonya Engst   2017-03-14 14:14 That is a very cute username! :-) Reply Tonya not the TidBits Tonya  2017-03-16 18:16 I kinda thought so, too ;-) Reply zaccone  2017-03-14 09:25 I often book flights on Southwest for my wife, son, and me. When I do that, I get one itinerary number and Southwest won't let me put the boarding passes on my phone. To fix this, I need to call Southwest and ask them to give each family member a separate itinerary number. They are willing to do this and it fixes the problem. I could probably accomplish the same thing by booking each of the flights separately, but I'm always afraid I won't get the same fare for each flight if I do that. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:39 Interesting! I know I've put boarding passes for multiple people on my iPhone with the United app, but since I've lived in the Northwest and the Northeast, I've never flown Southwest. :-) Reply Bob Bryant  2017-03-20 09:17 If I put my boarding pass in Wallet, am I prohibited from also printing a back up paper pass? I've resisted using Wallet because I didn't want to depend exclusively on an unfamiliar system. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-20 10:01 You can always print a boarding pass separately, just as you always have. If you're concerned, print the boarding pass first, and then add it to Wallet.

Which means, if you're an Apple fan but not into the whole 'leak everything about the phone before it arrives' scene, you'll need something to tide you over until the iPhone 8 arrives. Luckily, there's some impressive iPhone-related stuff to feast your eyes upon thanks to US firm Colorware, which has just produced a new retro edition of the iPhone 7 Plus. Related: iPhone 8 The iPhone 7 Plus Retro Edition is designed to mimic the look of a vintage 1980s-era Macintosh, and while it does just that very well, it doesn't come cheap. At $1,899 (about £1,530) it's certainly going to cost any rabid Apple fan who dares to shell out for this retro beauty, but there's no doubting the work that's gone into making the phone look authentically vintage. With a multicolored Apple rainbow logo made to look exactly like the original, and stripes adorning the edges, the originally-black iPhone 7 Plus manages to pull off the vintage look effortlessly. Here's Colorware on the new phone: "Colorware is pleased to announce the iPhone 7 Plus Retro Edition. If you love the vintage look of the original 1980’s Mac then why not have it on your phone! "Great attention to detail is given to this fully painted iPhone. With the multicolored Apple rainbow logo and the dark beige edge stripes your iPhone will be a work of art!" If you have the money to spend and want to pick up the phone, you'll have to be quick as the company says the Retro Edition will only be available for a limited time, with the first 25 featuring a number of authenticity. If you're wondering about specs, the iPhone 7 Plus being used for these painted models is a SIM-Free version with 256GB of storage. It also comes with EarPods, a Lightning to USB Cable, a USB Power Adapter, and documentation in the box, and orders are currently estimated to ship in 2-3 weeks.

In a rare public disclosure of closed-door music industry dealings with one of the biggest companies in the world, Chance the Rapper said Friday that he was paid half a million dollars by Apple to host his digital mixtape, “Coloring Book,” exclusively on its streaming service for two weeks last year. The rapper, who has long flaunted his independence from the record label system and his decision to not charge for music, said his burst of financial transparency was because of some critics’ questioning the veracity of his do-it-yourself ethos. “I feel like if I didn’t clear it up people would keep trying to discredit all the work we did to make Coloring Book what it became,” Chance, who won three Grammy Awards for the project in February, wrote on Twitter on Friday. “I think artist can gain a lot from the streaming wars as long as they remain in control of their own product.” He added that in addition to the $500,000, the deal included a 30-second commercial. “I needed the money and they’re all good people over there,” he said. Since its debut in the summer of 2015, Apple Music has partnered closely with artists, including Drake, Frank Ocean and Future, sponsoring tours, music videos and more as part of arrangements that often included exclusivity windows on new releases, which Apple hoped would boost its subscriber numbers as it competes with the streaming leader Spotify. (Tidal, the streaming service spearheaded by Jay Z, has also used the strategy.) “Do we see spikes when we do exclusives? Yes,” the Apple music executive Jimmy Iovine said in an interview with The New York Times last year. Larry Jackson, another Apple Music executive, called the tactic “a very powerful messaging tool, just marketing for the concept of streaming.” But until Chance’s revelation, the specifics of the deals with artists have largely remained opaque. Apple did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the rapper’s assertion. “Chance the Rapper didn’t take us to decide not to sign with a record label — he decided that a long time ago,” Iovine said in the interview last year. “We’re just a distribution platform and he chose us, thankfully, instead of all the others.” He added, “I think that Chance feels we delivered for him and we’ll do even better next time.” Apple Music is planning another big debut this weekend. “More Life,” a new release from Drake, is to premiere Saturday on the rapper’s OVO Sound online radio show on the company’s Beats 1 station. Drake, who has collaborated with Apple on his last three releases, in addition to his recent tour and videos, has proved to be the company’s most visible and consistent artist ambassador. But unlike his blockbuster “Views” album, which was exclusive to Apple for a time, “More Life” is expected to be widely available for streaming immediately upon release.

Home Industry Apple CEO Tim Cook calls for more global trade with China Apple CEO Tim Cook calls for more global trade with China Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook expressed support for globalisation and said China should continue to open its economy to foreign firms, while speaking at a forum in Beijing on Saturday. By: Reuters | Beijing | Published: March 18, 2017 5:17 PM Cook’s comments come amid rising tensions between the U.S. and China, with protectionist rhetoric from U.S. President Donald Trump sparking concern of increased trade friction between the two countries. (Reuters) Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook expressed support for globalisation and said China should continue to open its economy to foreign firms, while speaking at a forum in Beijing on Saturday. “I think it’s important that China continues to open itself and widens the door if you will,” said Cook, speaking at the government-sponsored China Development Forum. Cook’s comments come amid rising tensions between the U.S. and China, with protectionist rhetoric from U.S. President Donald Trump sparking concern of increased trade friction between the two countries. “The reality is countries that are closed, that isolate themselves, it’s not good for their people,” said Cook, in a rare public speech. Apple said on Friday it will set up two new research and development centres in Shanghai and Suzhou in China. It has pledged to invest more than 3.5 billion yuan ($508 million) in research and development in China. Apple has been singled out in Chinese media as a potential target for retaliation in the event of a trade war. The Global Times warned last November if Trump triggered a trade war with China, Beijing would then target firms from Boeing to Apple in a “tit-for-tat” approach. Also Watch: Apple CEO Tim Cook had also called for a crackdown on the epidemic of fake news and asked the governments to launch a public information campaign, media reports said. According to a report in Telegraph, Cook said that fake news was ‘killing people’s minds’ and necessitates a crackdown by the authorities and technology firms that would help providers of quality journalism and help drive out clickbait. “The outcome of that is that truthful, reliable, non-sensational, deep news outlets will win,” Cook was quoted as saying. To educate the people about the threat posed by fabricated online stories, Cook pitched for a campaign akin to those that changed public attitude towards environment. “We are going through this period of time right here where unfortunately some of the people that are winning are the people that spend their time trying to get the most clicks, not tell the most truth. It’s killing people’s minds in a way,” Cook said. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile New iPhone 8 concept imagines the magic behind that big, beautiful screen Image Source: Gabor Balogh Chris Smith @chris_writes March 14th, 2017 at 2:31 PM Share Tweet We think we know plenty of details about the upcoming iPhone 8 Apple has planned for 2017, and that might be true. We’ve seen plenty of leaks that all tell the same general story. But it’s only a story about the phone’s design, which means the iPhone’s most important feature remains a mystery. Sure, the handset will have a large edge-to-edge OLED screen complete with an embedded fingerprint sensor. It’ll sport an advanced 3D camera, and it’ll offer wireless charging. But what about the software? How will iOS 11 put all the changes that we keep hearing about to good use? One graphic designer has given this subject a lot of thought and came up with an amazing iPhone 8 concept that highlights the core software features that may be headed to the upcoming new Apple flagship phone. Don't Miss: Leaks reveal the 10 most exciting new features coming to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 Discovered by Apple Insider, Gabor Balogh’s iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) concept is a lot better than other similar creations, as the designer also explains his line of thinking. Image Source: Gabor Balogh In a detailed detailed post, Balogh explains his choices for the concept iPhone 8 he created. The designer believes that Siri will play a major role in the upcoming iPhone. Other major technologies that Apple is betting big on — including face recognition, augmented reality, big data, and machine learning would — also be at the core of the operating system that powers Apple’s edge-to-edge iPhone. In Balogh’s view, lifting the iPhone would automatically turn on the rear camera, with the screen becoming translucent. Siri would be able to both hear the user and view the phone’s surroundings in order to provide smart, context-aware responses. The virtual Siri/home button would be found in the same place where the physical button currently resides, but the entire action area flanking it would be occupied by apps that Siri thinks you’d want to use next, depending on what you’re currently doing. Image Source: Gabor Balogh AR would also play a major role in navigation apps, as it would superimpose directions right on top of the real world, making the chore of finding one’s way even easier. Similarly, AR features would also be built into other apps. Balogh also believes health will be a major focus in iOS 11, as the iPhone could be used to monitor real-time health data from friends and loved ones. While this feature could be cool, it would only work if those people would actually wear smart devices that monitor such data. Image Source: Gabor Balogh At the end of the day, this is just a great iPhone concept that doesn’t have anything to do with Apple’s actual iPhone 8 plans. However, Balogh is right in one regard: The size of the screen alone is just a small piece of the puzzle. Image Source: Gabor Balogh “This design concept proved [to] me that edge-to-edge screens won’t happen just because of aesthetic purposes,” he explains. “[The design] can only come along with a revolutionary new feature from Apple, which fills up the whole screen with appropriate content. In this case, not the bigger display, but the new killer feature would sell the iPhone X.” We’ll just have to wait and see what killer features Apple packs inside iOS 11. Balogh’s full article is available at this link.

The iPhone H8: Gonna be so boring Mythperceptions: No, Apple is actually pretty good at design Video Watch SwapBots spring to life thanks to augmented reality Hey, who likes topical references? Because it’s March Madness time and in the Apple world that means a lot of loose speculation about what a bracket of fail this year’s iPhones will be, even though they’re not coming for months. Writing for the Forbes contributor network and the world’s most renowned slap fight dojo, Ewan Spence describes the coming apocalypse. “New iPhone 8 Leaks Reveal The Four Horsemen Of Apple’s Apocalypse.” (Tip o’ the antlers to Alex.) The Macalope knows that traditionally there are only supposed to be four horsemen of the apocalypse (hey, he reads X-Men comics), but it seems like in Apple’s case if you can’t come up with 16, 18, or 124 horsemen then you’re just not applying yourself. An almost perfect storm is coming for Tim Cook and his team at Apple. C’mon down to Earnest Ewan’s Cliché Outlet, just off the turnpike near the old grist mill. It is not going to kill the iPhone line stone dead… Oh. Good to know. First up is cost. There is little to suggest that the presumptively priced iPhone 8 will not start at $1000. …when your baseline model passes a grand on the sticker, people will pay attention. …anyone looking at the total cost of ownership is going to see an eye-watering amount. First of all, we don’t even know that the “iPhone 8” is the iPhone 8. It could be called the iPhone Pro. Whether it is or not, that’s effectively what it is. If you buy that the “iPhone 8” is coming then you must also believe that Apple will also be introducing other iPhones, presumably an iPhone 7s line. So it’s not like Tim Cook’s hitting the stage in September and saying “Surprise, suckers! Your iPhones are all a thousand bucks now!” Horse number two… can Apple justify the higher price? So… horse number two is horse number one. OK. The iPhone 8 of January 1st had fast cabled charging, wireless charging over a distance of one metre, a curved screen, a bright and vivid OLED display, touchID embedded into the screen... all of these are now being downgraded like tears in the digital rain. Horsemen, storms, replicants… this fan fic has everything. The underlying message of these two issues leads to the third horse… profit. ALL THESE HORSES ARE THE SAME HORSE. This stable is getting less full every minute. We’ll get to the end of this article and find there never were any horses at all. The horses were inside us all along. Or maybe they were the friends we made along the way. They just weren’t, you know, real horses. All of this leaves our fourth horse of reputation. Yes, the last horse is the effect on Apple’s reputation of releasing a very expensive phone. [The Count voice] There iz… ONE horse! Ah-ah-ahhh! Worst apocalypse ever.

When it does, it could be worth more than twice as much as Apple. Even more staggering: It would be more valuable than 13 of the biggest public oil companies combined. Jason Hall (TMFVelvetHammer) Mar 18, 2017 at 6:21AM Nearly three-quarters of a trillion dollars. That's how much Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the world's current most-valuable, and most-profitable company is worth at recent stock prices. Over the past nearly 20 years, Apple has disrupted and come to dominate multiple industries, changing the way people listen to -- and buy -- music, use computers, and interact with technology in their everyday lives. It's not a stretch to say that Apple, if not invented, then perfected, the mobile computing era.  And with its stock trading around 17 times last year's earnings -- a substantial discount to the average P/E of the S&P 500 -- there's a case to be made that the iStuff company is actually undervalued.  Image source: Getty Images. But a state-owned behemoth, Saudi Arabian Oil Company, better-known as Saudi Aramco, is set to blow past Apple for the title of world's most valuable public company when it IPOs in 2018. Expectations are that the market will value Saudi Aramco at $2 trillion or more.  Here's a closer look at how massive this megacompany, which controls an enormous percentage of the world's oil, really is, as well as why Saudi Arabia is considering taking it public.  Saudi Aramco's value is in the oil it controls At that $2 trillion valuation, Saudi Aramco would be the biggest public company on the planet by a very wide margin. But the most telling measure of its size is how it compares to the biggest public companies in oil and gas: In billions. Chart by author. The 13 public companies listed on the chart above are some of the biggest in the oil and gas industry. Some, like ExxonMobil(NYSE:XOM) BP (NYSE:BP) Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-A)(NYSE:RDS-B), are fully integrated majors with assets across the oil and gas value chain, while others, like Enterprise Products and Phillips 66, are dominant participants in specific parts of the industry, such as transportation, refining, or petrochemical manufacturing. The list also includes Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) and PetroChina (NYSE:PTR), the Brazilian and Chinese state-controlled integrated oil companies.  Combined (red bar in the table above) these 13 public entities are worth $1.5 billion at current share prices. That means Saudi Aramco is expected to be worth $500 billion more when it goes public next year than the next 13 biggest oil companies put together. That's a baker's-dozen of the world's biggest oil companies, plus Microsoft just for good measure.  There are two factors that drive this value: How much oil it produces, and how much it holds the rights to produce. Here's how Saudi Aramco's daily oil and gas production compares to the other biggest public producers: In millions of barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d). Chart by author. Data source: Company reports and filings. At more than 12 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day, Saudi Aramco produces more oil and natural gas than the next three biggest, ExxonMobil, Shell, and BP, combined.  Here's how Saudi Aramco's massive oil and natural gas reserves compare: In billions of barrels of oil equivalent. Chart by author. Data source: Company filings and websites. It would be difficult to overstate just how large Saudi Aramco's oil and natural gas reserves are as compared to any other oil company's. Anchored by the massive Ghawar oilfield, the company controls several of the biggest oilfields on the planet, with some of the lowest cash production costs. To be clear, Aramco doesn't own Saudi Arabia's oilfields. Those are Saudi government property. But it does have exclusive production rights, much in the same way other oil companies pay property owners for the rights to access and produce oil and gas.  Using the biggest-ever IPO to fuel a post-oil Saudi Arabia When Aramco goes public, it is expected to raise more than $100 billion, selling 5% of the company to investors. This would make its IPO easily the largest ever: In billions. Chart by author. Aramco's IPO is expected to raise almost as much capital as the next five biggest, combined.  This is a step toward a "post-oil" Saudi Arabia. Led by Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the Saudi Aramco IPO is part of a bigger initiative -- transferring a number of kingdom-owned companies to the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund as part of its strategy to shift more of the country's economy away from the oil and gas industry which overwhelmingly dominates it today. The sovereign wealth fund has already been given stakes in two major Saudi companies: Saudi Basic Industries, one of the world's largest chemicals manufacturers, and National Commercial Bank, Saudi Arabia's biggest lender. The plan is for this fund to control $2 trillion in assets, and then use the profits they generate to plant the seeds of economic expansion outside the oil patch.  Saudi Aramco isn't targeting individual investors, either. Its ideal investors would be institutional owners such as pension funds and other sovereign wealth funds. According to recent news, China's $800 billion sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corp, is in talks to be a major investor in the IPO. Looking forward When Saudi Aramco does go public, it's almost certainly going to become the biggest public company on earth, and will raise the most capital ever from an IPO. Should individual investors put its stock on their watch lists? There's a chance that it could make for a solid income investment, with what are generally considered the world's lowest cash production costs making its oil production profitable in any environment.  But for a litany reasons, it's far too early to make that call. Frankly, there's a lot investors need to know about Aramco before putting their capital at risk, and it's far from clear how much of  information this ultra-secretive company is going to make available to outsiders. This very well could prevent it from going public on American or European exchanges, where stringent disclosure regulations may require the company to reveal more than the Saudi government is willing to let be made public about its reserves and costs of production.  If that proves to be the case, individual investors should probably take it as a cue to avoid Aramco, no matter how big its oil reserves are, or how cheaply they can be extracted.  Jason Hall owns shares of Apple and Royal Dutch Shell (B Shares).

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Smart Homes With Apple’s HomeKit Integration For Sale In San Jose, California By Ali Salman Mar 15, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple’s HomeKit platform is responsible for a handful of operations that provides assistance in our daily lives. The company is known to be connected with various builders in order to  integrate its platform in the new houses. The latest on the subject – a journalist was invited to San Jose, California to check out the new HomeKit-enabled smart home. Let’s dive in to see some more details on the matter. Apple’s HomeKit Equipped Smart Homes For Sale In San Jose, California Tech reporter, Gabe Slate of KRON4 demonstrated the integration of Apple’s HomeKit in new smart homes. HomeKit costs $2500 per house that includes the devices with HomeKit support. These devices would act as a medium by which you can control quite a handful of operations at your home. Related Instagram Now Lets You Save Your Own Live Videos For starters, the owner of the house would simply make use of his or her iPhone or iPad and control the Kwikset lock on the main door. Moreover, users also have the ability to control room temperature through the Ecobee thermostat along with adjusting the lights via the Philips Hue and much more. Advertisement Apart from this, the owner of the smart home can also make use of Apple’s Siri Remote of the Apple TV and operate the fans in the rooms upstairs. Homeowners can also switch to a movie watching mode in which lights would dim and the blinds would automatically come down. This is not the first time that KB Home has offered home automation to house owners, instead it has been doing it for 10 years. However, one advantage that Apple’s HomeKit has is that users now do not have to open different apps to control different operations. The company’s HomeKit platform acts as a hub that controls all the supported devices. Related Apple’s Online Store Will Be Unavailable Tomorrow Due To ‘Maintenance’ However, since Apple is new in the home automation industry, there are quite a handful of challenges that it has to cover. Jonathon Gaw speaking to The Mercury News stated that its not clear what products are users willing to use. Moreover, he also stated that its not even clear if the smart home product companies will be here in the long run. Nonetheless, there are new companies adopting support for Apple’s HomeKit platform and probably in the near future, we will see more details on the matter. This is it for now, folks. What are your thoughts on Apple’s HomeKit platform? Do you think it’s a neat idea for building companies to adopt home automation systems in new homes? Share your thoughts in the comments.

Wang Obsession The Identity Economy March 18, 2017 Sneakin'. (Reuters/Mario Anzuoni) Share Written by Amy X. Wang Obsession The Identity Economy March 18, 2017 In 2016, Drake’s celebrated rap album Views became one of the first music projects to debut solely on Apple Music—and unleashed a flurry of agitation over exclusive deals in the music business. While exclusives make tons of money for hit artists, they’re also regularly slammed for encouraging piracy and turning off fans. Fitting, then, that the controversy is now coming full circle with Drake. The rapper will release his newest project today (March 18), a “playlist” called More Life—but it won’t be an Apple Music exclusive this time, unlike Views and the slew of other deals he’s struck with the service in the past year. Spotify and Amazon both have confirmed to several music publications that they’ll have More Life available for streaming to their listeners, too. New @Drake.#MoreLife coming soon. pic.twitter.com/TwGlwfB3zE — Spotify (@Spotify) March 16, 2017 Several things could explain Drake’s sudden ditching of exclusives. More Life isn’t a full album, so Apple might not have cared all that much about sharing it with other platforms; the deal between the rapper and the streaming service might’ve simply expired, too. But there’s also the possibility that the music industry is finally putting its collective foot down against exclusives, and looking to new avenues of innovation. Drake’s label OVO is owned by Universal Music Group; Universal CEO Lucian Grainge announced last year—shortly after rapper Frank Ocean pulled off a stunning coup of independence from his label—that Universal is “done with streaming exclusives on one platform,” or so sources told Billboard. As beneficial as exclusive content may be to streaming services like Apple Music or Tidal, restricting the size of one’s audience isn’t always a winning strategy for those on the production side (i.e., artists and labels). While albums like Drake’s Views or Beyoncé’s Lemonade may have found wild success as exclusives, the majority of music projects aren’t big enough to convince fans to come to one platform over another. More Life won’t share the exclusivity-generated hype of Views, but it also stands a much bigger chance of being heard.

Search Reviews iPhone Android How To Reviews iPhone How To Auto About Best Best Weight Loss Apps Best iPhone 7 Cases Best Budget Apps Things Apple Watch Can Do Best Alexa Skills Android Galaxy S7 Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Cases Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Deals Best Galaxy S7 Battery Cases Best Galaxy S7 Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Cases Deals Best Android Smartphones Under $200 [2017] Best Cheap Android Smartphones [2017] 7 Things to Know About the iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 Update Adam Mills11/21/2016 iOS 10 won’t be coming to the iPhone 4s which means iOS 9.3.5 will be the last update for Apple’s aging former flagship. With that in mind, we want to take a look at the most important things to know about the iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update. In March, Apple rolled out its highly anticipated iOS 9.3 update. It went through an extensive beta but the update immediately caused problems for iPhone and iPad users. To address these bugs and other lingering issues, Apple pushed out several new versions of iOS 9.3. iOS 9.3.1 arrived with some important bug fixes and patches. After that, Apple pushed out an iOS 9.3.2 update to the iPhone 4s and other iOS 9-powered devices. A few days after that, it released iOS 9.3.3 update. Soon after that, the company pushed out iOS 9.3.4 update. Shortly after the release of iOS 9.3.4, Apple released an iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update. It will be the last update the iPhone 4s receives from Apple. The iPhone 4s will never get iOS 10. If you’re coming from the iOS 9.3.4 update, iOS 9.3.5 features three three patches and nothing else. If you’re coming from something older than iOS 9.3.4, your iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update is going to be a much larger update. Apple’s previous iOS updates are baked in. With that in mind we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone 4s users need to know about the iOS 9.3.5 update’s performance, its problems, the iOS downgrade process, and more. iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 Reviews   1 / 7 We've been able to spend some quality hands-on time with many of Apple's other iOS updates but we haven't spent enough time to provide quality feedback about the iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update. So, we must turn to the opinions of others. As we push further and further away from Apple's iOS 9.3.5 release date we've seen iPhone 4s users from all over the world relay feedback about the update's performance. If you haven't installed yet you should make it a point to dig into these mini reviews. iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update reviews are still mixed months after the update's release. While some users are seeing solid performance in key areas like battery life and connectivity, others are complaining about lag, freezes, and occasional stuttering.  Some users have said that they are sticking with the iOS 8 update, others are saying that the iOS 9.3.4 and iOS 9.3.5 updates solved some of the lag issues they had with earlier versions of iOS 9. As of right now there is no clear cut answer which means those of you with an iPhone 4s need to be extremely careful with this upgrade. Dig into this feedback and decide if it's worth it to you and your device. For most of you, it will be thanks to the nature of the security patches on board.    1 / 7 23 Responses 04/20/2016 Enajrowe Reply Hurrah..!!!Ｉ ᴊᴜｓᴛ ɢᴏᴛ ᴘᴀɪᴅ 6784ＵＳＤ ᴡᴏʀᴋɪɴɢ ᴏғғ ᴍʏ ʟᴀᴘᴛᴏᴘ ᴛʜɪｓ ᴍᴏɴᴛʜ.

How can I return my Iphone 4S from 9.3.4 to 9.3.3 ( Which version is better 9.3.3 or 9.3.2) ?

Still an amazing phone and still updating and supported. Get a new phone or accept things on a 5 year old phone takes time. 09/05/2016 Robert Jackson Reply I had my iPhone 4s since the beginning. And yes with 9.3.5 she is still kicking strong and doing well. I cannot say much for others, but if they have any problems with any updates. Just re-set the whole thing (make sure you on iCloud ) like a brand new phone, or to the last day like two days ago. And when all is boosted. You’ll have more storage for some reason , and everything you had since. And I have a 16 gigger (n####r) joke…. Smile….it won’t broke yo face! Jamaican Man. Make sure you have an iPad or MacBook. They all feed off one another like clockwork. Adios Gringgos 09/19/2016 premn Reply Anyone know if there is a further update coming. My 4S has become almost useless. And I’m pretty sure it was after the 9.3.5 update. I’m hoping they might fix it? Thanks. 09/30/2016 prem Reply Update: After one month of sound and other issues, my 4s suddenly started working fine with 9.3.5. Amost as if it needed a month to get used to the update. Thought I should share this here. 09/30/2016 Chris Reply 4s stopped working when I tried to update to 9.3.5. Never was able to upgrade, only shows the “plug into iTunes” and is basically bricked until I figure out how to fix it. 10/13/2016 Abramski Reply Can u put the device in DFU mode? You do it this way, make sure the phone is off AND connected to your mac or pc and leave iTunes open, press and hold down the power button and count 3 seconds, after you count those 3 seconds, you push down the home button but don’t release the power button, hold the power button and home button pressed simultaneously for about 10 seconds, in mean time the screen should turn black as you reach 6 or 7, after 10 second, release the power button but keep holding down the home button until you see a prompt in iTunes that will tell you to restore you’re iPhone. Good luck! 11/01/2016 Mike Morley Reply Since updating to ios 9.3.5 my iPhone 4s shuts down at 35% battery level. I have heard that Apple do not plan to release any further updates to iphone 4s so I either put up with this or upgrade the phone. Of course apple would love me to upgrade the phone. I also upgraded my ipad2 to ios 9.3.5 and found it would then not let me past password sign in, it to a great deal of time to sort this out including complete reset and restore of the machine. I don’t have time to fix apples mistakes so I’m switching to android, at least you are not badgered continuously to upgrade it’s operating system APPLE NEVER AGAIN ! 12/17/2016 Satheesh Reply When i update to 9.3.5 My 4s asking to connect itunes. I dont know why? Anyone can explain? 02/08/2017 NIROSH Reply what’s the Next date of 4s update 03/17/2017 Sue Reply 9.3.5 was the last update for 4S! 03/19/2017 user Reply battery problem and overheating..

The 10.5 inch iPad is expected to have an edge-to-edge display, a new virtual Home Button and other upgrades. Digitimes says updates to the 9.7 inch iPad and 12.9 inch iPad Pro are also in the pipeline … The best, strongest, Lightning cables ... buy braided cables here The supply chain analyst had previously predicted that the 10.5 inch iPad will not be ready for launch until May/June, but this latest report says that Apple has pushed the production schedule forward. The 10.5 inch iPad is expected to be almost the same physical size as the current 9.7 inch iPad Pro, but will gain an extra 0.8 inches in diagonal screen space by losing the left and right bezels, as the product has been described as having an edge-to-edge display. The bezel-less iPad would somewhat presage one of the big rumors for the new iPhone 8 in the fall, which is also expected to feature a bezel-less design. The report says an upgraded 9.7 inch iPad and refreshed 12.9 inch iPad Pro are also imminent. As the new 9.7 inch tablet is likely meant as a cheaper offering in the lineup, Digitimes says Apple will pitch the 10.5 inch and 12.9 inch iPad as the mid-tier to high-end competitors in the tablet market. Apple is only expected to make about 1 million 10.5 inch iPads per month, whilst the upgraded 9.7 inch model will see more a healthy ~3 million/month run rate. Digitimes is a supply chain centric site. Their claims about Apple hosting a product event to announce the new iPads in early April ‘to mark the inauguration of Apple’s new headquarters in California’ should be taken with heavy skepticism. Apple’s plans about an event can change on a whim and are not connected to the supply chain at all. However, it is reasonable to expect the new 10.5 inch iPad sooner rather than later off the back of this report. Digitimes says mass production of the 12.9 inch iPad may not start until May or June, but this does not preclude Apple announcing it alongside the 10.5 inch iPad in April. It makes sense for the ‘budget’ 9.7 inch model to also launch at the same time. Benjamin Mayo @bzamayo Benjamin develops iOS apps professionally and covers Apple news and rumors for 9to5Mac.

You might have noticed the company’s pay-at-table Presto touchscreen terminals at some restaurants already— its two big customers are Outback Steakhouse and Applebee’s— but its new Presto Prime terminal announced today offers a number of enhancements with Apple Pay among them: The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac The PrestoPrime EMV Terminal’s core benefits include: • Only pay-at-table system with dual processors using a securely partitioned payment module, which enables best-in-class end-to-end EMV security to safely support third party apps, premium content, and integration with complementary devices • Contactless mobile payment capability including Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay, as well as a QR code reader and camera In addition to support for Apple Pay and other mobile payment services, the new terminal also includes an integrated keypad for secure PIN entry, full international Chip-and-PIN support, and enhanced security and storage. E la Carte says it currently has around 90,000 of its previous generation terminals at use in over 1800 restaurants across the US, so there is quite a large number of restaurants that could likely upgrade to the new system and start offering Apple Pay. There’s no word on when Outback Steakhouse, Applebee’s or other Presto terminal customers might be implementing the new system, but the company notes that the new Presto Prime product is software-compatible with the old system, so you’ll likely see restaurants upgrading and moving to the newer terminals in the near future. While support for Apple Pay through systems like Presto Prime will bring table side payments to more restaurants, we recently suggested that expanded support for bar tabs and restaurant bills is something that Apple should build directly into its platform. We asked if you’d want and use such a feature, and over 73% of you said yes. Having it built into Apple Pay as a native feature, opposed to going through third-party systems or having to download apps, would certainly greatly increase adoption among restaurants, live events, and other retailers.

Sony A6500 Specifically, tvOS 10.2 beta includes these changes: Accelerated Scrolling support for UIKit and TVMLKit apps Device Enrollment Program support Expanded Mobile Device Management support Support for the VideoToolbox framework While tvOS 10.2 doesn’t include any flashy new features, Apple has been steadily improving the platform with new video features including the new TV app and Single Sign-on. Here’s how Apple describes the TV app that was introduced in December: Watching TV has quickly become all about apps. And now, with the new TV app, you have one place to access shows and movies from multiple video apps — in one unified experience. The TV app lets you see all the movies and shows you’re watching. Find upcoming episodes. Get recommendations for new things to watch. See your entire iTunes video collection. You can even start watching a movie or show directly from the TV app. All without switching between individual apps. Single Sign-on is a separate feature introduced in December that lets users easily authenticate with a supported TV provider once, then access paid video apps that support the feature. tvOS 10.2 beta is only available for registered developers. Public beta versions of iOS and macOS are available, but tvOS and watchOS betas are only available through Apple’s developer program.

Sony A6500 Apple is also introducing SiriKit to Apple Watch with watchOS 3.2 beta. SiriKit lets developers integrate their apps with Siri for select uses. Prior to watchOS 3.2 beta, SiriKit was limited to iOS apps. As for Theater Mode, this is how Apple describes the new feature: Theater Mode lets users quickly mute the sound on their Apple Watch and avoid waking the screen on wrist raise. Users still receive notifications (including haptics) while in Theater Mode, which they can view by tapping the screen or pressing the Digital Crown. And here’s how Theater Mode looks on Apple Watch: Check out our hands-on video with Theater Mode below: watchOS 3.2 beta 2 included a subtle change: Control Center toggles reorganized (Series 2 from top left to bottom right: Battery, Airplane Mode, Mute, Do Not Disturb, Find My iPhone, Water Lock, Theater Mode, AirPlay) We’ll update with any changes discovered in watchOS 3.2 beta 6.

The Ugreen Power Bank with Magnetic Charger not only features the portability that some Apple Watch owners are seeking, but it also features a built-in battery for wireless charging while away from a wall outlet. And here’s something that you don’t always see when it comes to third-party offerings — a built-in magnetic charging puck, meaning there’s no need to provide your own charger. Not only will such a setup save you money, but it also keeps you from having to finagle with inserting or mounting Apple’s own charger. Watch our brief hands-on video walkthrough inside for a rundown of the device’s features. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? The Ugreen Power Bank comes with the a micro USB cable for recharging the unit’s built-in battery. The charger itself is covered in a black rubber material and features a metal power button along with four LEDs to indicating charging and discharging status. Pressing the power button will turn the unit on, and pressing the button a single time while the unit is powered-on will cause the LEDs to light up to display how much battery life remains. Specifications Lithium Battery Capacity 2200mAh Charge cutoff voltage 4.2V Micro USB input DC 5V/1500mA USB Output DC 5V/1000mA Magnetic charger DC 5V/1000mA Dimensions: 139mm-by-39.5mm-by-16mm Made for Apple Watch (MFi certified) Video walkthrough Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more hands-on videos A long press on the Power Bank’s power button will turn the device off. If the charger is not connected to charging equipment, it’s smart enough to go into standby mode after a period of inactivity. I found the Ugreen Power Bank to be very convenient, as not only did it allow me to charge my Apple Watch while away from home, but I could also leverage the 5W USB port to recharge my iPhone if needed. Granted, a 2200mAh battery isn’t capable of fully recharging my iPhone 7 Plus, but it’s a nice option to have for topping off the battery if nothing else. The feature that makes this Apple Watch accessory so attractive is its portability. I can easily stick it in my pocket or backpack and keep my Apple Watch charged with minimal effort. It’s unfortunate that the unit still uses micro USB, but I understand that it’s taking some time for manufacturers to fully move over to USB-C. Yep, it works with Nightstand mode At just shy of $60, the Ugreen Power Bank isn’t cheap, but the fact that it comes with a built-in magnetic charger, an item that normally costs around $30, eases the sting of the price. If you can live with the micro USB charging and you often find yourself devoid of Apple Watch battery life while on the go, then I recommend this product.

At the time, Apple denied any involvement and said that “retailers set their own prices” for the products. Now, Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service, however, has found Apple guilty of price-fixing in the country… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case As noted by The Financial Times, Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service found that Apple had illegally ordered retailers to fix prices of the iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 models. Specifically, Apple apparently instructed 16 retailers in Russia to set the prices at a certain amount and if a retailer was found to be selling the iPhone at an “unsuitable” price, Apple would contact them and order them to change the price or risk having the sales agreement terminated. In a statement, the FAS had the following to say, translated: The investigation revealed that since the start of official sales in Russia of the Apple iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, most resellers installed the same prices on them as recommended by Apple Rus and supported them for about 3 months. At the same time, Apple Rus monitored retail prices for Apple iPhone smartphones installed by resellers in online stores and retail outlets, and, in caseof setting “unsuitable” prices, the Russian subsidiary Apple sent emails to resellers with a request to change them. Also, compliance with recommended retail prices by resellers could be due to the provisions of contracts between Apple Rus and resellers. Apple has yet to comment on the ruling, but FAS head Andrey Tsarikovsky explained that Apple has “actively cooperated” with the agency to resolve wrongdoings: “In the course of the proceedings the Russian subsidiary of Apple actively co-operated with the FAS,” said the agency’s deputy head, Andrey Tsarikovsky. “The company has adopted the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law and is pursuing a policy to prevent similar violations in the future.” It’s unclear at this point what sort of punishment Apple could face for its price-fixing in Russia. The company has three months to file a challenge, but it’s unclear if it plans to do so at this point. The worst case scenario for Apple is that it will be fined 15 percent of its sales in Russia, but that won’t be decided for another few months.

The Chicago rapper claimed that Apple paid him for two weeks of exclusivity for his mixtape Coloring Book on their music streaming platform Apple Music. "That was the extent of my deal, after 2 weeks it was on SoundCloud for free," he wrote. "I needed the money and they're all good people over there." "I just wanna remain transparent. Folks out there without a deal need to know they're doing everything right just keep at it," Chance wrote. Read all of his tweets below.

Last year, Anohni said she regretted selling her "Drone Bomb Video" to Apple Music. "My being bought as a politically outspoken artist is a more potent advertising tool for Apple than a 100 more explicit ads," she said. "It creates the false aura for Apple of being cutting edge, of being artist advocates, of being innovative mavericks, of being environmentally friendly, of caring about people and communities, instead of being the McDonalds of consumer high tech whose wealth was largely pilfered from what was once a biodiverse music industry."

Tech Apple Science Cars Geneva Motor Show Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Apple Sets Up Two New R&D Centers In China Posted: Mar 18 2017, 1:58am CDT | by IANS, in News | Apple   Photo Credit: Getty Images   To boost local talent, tech giant Apple has announced it would invest $508 million in China to build two additional Research and Development (R&D) centres in Shanghai and Suzhou. Don't Miss: Win a Free Nintendo NES Classic in our Giveaway According to a report in MacRumors on Friday, Apple's attempt to boost its presence in China began last September with the opening of its first R&D centre in Beijing's Zhongguancun Science Park, often referred to as "China's Silicon Valley". "We are looking forward to working with more local partners and academic institutions through the expansion of R&D centres in China," Dan Riccio, Senior Vice President (Hardware Engineering) at Apple, was quoted as saying. "We are honoured to have access to excellent talent and a positive entrepreneurial spirit in the region, where our developers and suppliers will be working together," Riccio added. With the investment of $508 million, Apple will have four centres in China in total. Apple's gets most of its products manufactured in China and also sources its best electronics engineers from the there. "So it seems logical that Apple would go beyond partnering with local firms in China by creating its own research centres. This way, Apple has a foot on the ground and gets the best of both worlds," the report noted.

Image: Kirill Nastasin/Shutterstock Huawei’s P10 smartphone series is about to hit the market. Can it really give the Apple iPhone 7 a run for its money? The P10 and P10 Plus, the successors to the Huawei P9 line that brought the ‘bokeh effect’ to the smartphone world, are the Chinese tech and telecoms giant’s flagship phones for 2017. And, straight away, it is obvious that they are designed to compete with the Apple iPhone 7. Mustering all the showmanship in its powers, Huawei has created two new colours for the handsets with the Pantone Colour Institute – greenery and dazzling blue – and, in an enduring partnership with Leica, revealed a device that once again is pretty much more camera than phone. Huawei has set a benchmark for affordable but high-end smartphones, and it wants to prove that you don’t need to spend almost €1,000 to get a decent smartphone. Specs Image: John Kennedy The 5.1in P10 comes with 4GB of memory and 64GB of storage, with expandable memory of up to 256GB, while the larger 5.5in P10 Plus has 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage and 256GB of expandable memory, with MicroSD slots and dual SIM slots. The battery capability is almost double that of the iPhone 7, with a 3,200mAh battery on the P10 and 3,750mAh for the P10 Plus. As well as greenery and dazzling blue, the new P10 comes in a number of nice finishes, including ceramic white, graphite black, prestige gold, mystic silver and rose gold. The devices are just 6.98mm thick and have Gorilla Glass 5 panelling, with almost no bezel to the sides. The device runs on Android 7.0 and has a Huawei Kirin 960 quad-core processor inside. The key feature of the phone is its camera, which sports SLR-like settings and modes for night-time and daytime photography. Both phones have a Leica-branded dual camera system, which consists of a 20-megapixel monochrome sensor, as well as a 12-megapixel sensor for colours. It is capable of shooting in 4K video and, thanks to a H.265 codec, videos can be compressed by 50pc. Huawei has also beefed up the capabilities of the 8-megapixel front camera, which includes a new F/1.9 aperture and a sensor that captures more light. Performance Image: John Kennedy The first impression of the 5.1-inch P10 I reviewed is just how light and bright it feels. It boasts a nice clean design and smooth finish. The fingerprint sensor kicks in instantly and the Kirin processor does its work in a swift, snappy way as you flit around the screen. Everything just feels smooth and fast and elegant. The model I reviewed was the mystic silver version, which out of the whole gamut of colours is probably the most ordinary looking of the range. Don’t get me wrong, it is still a very attractive phone, but the problem these days is that smartphones all look the same and, in its zest to take on the iPhone 7, the Huawei P10 doesn’t look too dissimilar from Apple’s flagship handset. Apart from coming up with some dazzling hues of green, blue, gold, rose gold and even a kind of black that unashamedly takes on the iPhone 7’s jet black, Huawei knows it needs to knock it out of the park to compete. That’s where the camera technology really kicks in. The winner here is the portrait mode. This uses 3D face detection and a cocktail of bokeh and beauty effects to really bring photos out of themselves. It’s a kind of magic. The reality is that people want good photos and selfies, but they don’t really understand all the wizardry that involves figuring out the SLR settings. Under the hood, if you want that kind of complexity, it is all there in spades. Another notable detail is the radio technology. At Mobile World Congress, Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei’s consumer business group, described the P10 as the world’s first 4.5G smartphone, with four LTE radios in a quad-antenna/MIMO array providing stronger connectivity. This, he said, promises not only faster speeds but a 60pc less chance of dropped calls in areas of weak signal. Verdict: 4.5/5 Image: John Kennedy There is literally very little to fault with the P10. You get the feeling that Huawei has upped the number of apps that come with the device, so it feels less Spartan than the P9 and comes with useful tools like a torch and notepad. My only niggle with the bolted on apps was unnecessary limitations. Take, for example, the sound recorder app – you can record perfect audio but there is no way to share it, either by social media or basic email; it stays on the device. Instead, you need to get around this by downloading your own recorder of choice from the Play Store. First world problems, eh? Minor frustrations aside, Huawei is swiftly becoming an affordable alternative to the established order of Apple and Samsung smartphones and, if it keeps going at the present pace, it will be the established order. That is as soon as people learn how to pronounce ‘Huawei’ properly. It’s ‘Hoo-wa-way’. Alright? The critical thing is that, in just five years, the Chinese company has come from nowhere in the mobile space to really challenge the top players. It will be interesting to see where Huawei goes next in terms of devices like tablets, VR and wearables. The company also launched Watch 2, which comes with 4G connectivity, at Mobile World Congress. If you want a smartphone with a high-end camera, a blisteringly fast processor and pretty much everything that the iPhone or Samsung Galaxy can offer – at a reasonable price – then the P10 is the one for you. It looks the part, it feels the part and Huawei knows it can play the part. Pricing and availability Image: John Kennedy The new flagship phones will retail at €649 for the P10, which has a 5.1in display, and €699 for the P10 Plus, which will have a 5.5in display. The Huawei P10 will be available in Ireland in graphite black and mystic silver from mid-March via online pre-registration, with an exclusive Huawei Accessory Gift Box worth €149.99 – which includes selfie stick and tripod – from all major providers. You can pre-order the phone from 23 March and it will be available in retail stores from 4 April. The Huawei P10 Plus will be available in graphite black exclusively from Three for a limited time from mid-April, and all other major providers from May. There are plans to make the Huawei P10 and P10 Plus available in greenery and dazzling blue later in the year. Huawei P10 smartphone.

The previous window of opportunity that Apple offered was within 60 days of the date of purchase. Even though it doesnt reflect on Apples information site just yet, go ahead and give it a try. Head on over to the AppleCare support page and enter the serial number of your iOS device. If youve purchased it within the year, you should be able to see an Eligible for AppleCare+ notification whose link will lead you to another page where you can purchase the extended protection. The change only applies to iPhones at this time, so no extra protection for your Apple watch or iPad if you bought it more than 60 days ago. AppleCare+ starts at $99 for the iPhone SE, or $129 for the iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus. It covers damage up to two times during the protection period. Youll have priority access to Apples 24/7 support line, mail-in or carry-in repairs, as well as 'Express Replacement Service'. Screen damage repair is just a $29 service fee, while any other damage is also covered for a higher $99 service fee.

According to a report in MacRumors on Friday, Apple’s attempt to boost its presence in China began last September with the opening of its first R&amp;D centre in Beijing’s Zhongguancun Science Park, often referred to as “China’s Silicon Valley”. “We are looking forward to working with more local partners and academic institutions through the expansion of R&amp;D centres in China,” Dan Riccio, Senior Vice President (Hardware Engineering) at Apple, was quoted as saying. “We are honoured to have access to excellent talent and a positive entrepreneurial spirit in the region, where our developers and suppliers will be working together,” Riccio added. With the investment of $508 million, Apple will have four centres in China in total. Apple’s gets most of its products manufactured in China and also sources its best electronics engineers from the there. “So it seems logical that Apple would go beyond partnering with local firms in China by creating its own research centres. This way, Apple has a foot on the ground and gets the best of both worlds,” the report noted. –IANS qd/vm Tags China firms local report CanIndia New Wire Service Related Posts LeEco partners with Amazon for attractive offers on TV Mar 21st, 201702 New Delhi, March 21 (IANS) Chinese internet and technology conglomerate LeEco on Tuesday announced an...

With an IPO under its belt this month, Snapchat has cleared its first major hurdle. If Apple's smart, the next one should be in June. That's Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, and the stakes are high to unveil something great to accompany 10th anniversary iPhone. I'm not saying that Apple should recreate Snapchat — it doesn't have to. By creating a better version of just one Snapchat feature — messaging — Apple could siphon potential Snap customers into iMessage and revive interest in the iPhone brand. Apple has end-to-end technology Snap's disappearing messages launched its popularity, but Lenses — which superimpose dynamic imagery onto photos — are the secret sauce. There's an abundance of evidence that Apple can build something similar. In February, Apple received this patent on creating custom shape-shifting avatars. Tim Cook has repeatedly expressed interest in in augmented reality and may have more than 1,000 engineers working on it, according to a UBS note. Goldman Sachs thinks it will come out in the iPhone 8 later this year, and industry analyst Ben Thompson thinks the powerful camera on the iPhone 7 Plus is a dead giveaway. Analysts at JP Morgan even think the next iPhone will have facial recognition. And Apple is already adding fun effects to iMessage. Apple can one-up Snap because it has control over the hardware. Snap's graphics are limited by the lowest quality camera and processor of the phones it runs on. Apple, on the other hand, makes its own camera and its own chips — and they're good. Apple controls app distribution and has a developer platform at its disposal. Most of Snap's users already get it from the App Store. And iMessage, unlike Snapchat, has access to an entire ecosystem of iMessage apps. Imagine sending a Snap with an Apple Music soundtrack! show chapters Here's how to use all the cool features on Apple's new iMessage    Thursday, 29 Sep 2016 | 6:09 PM ET | 00:43 Apple's iMessage has a critical mass of high-value users Many of Snap's most popular features aren't difficult to recreate — Facebook's copycats show that. What is difficult to replicate is Snap's highly dedicated, engaged user base. Facebook, while accessible, long ago shed the exclusivity it had with college students. Snap's interface is minimal and cool, but opaque to some older users. If only there were a company with both ... known for software that is intuitive, yet has a minimalist design ... software that exudes a sense of exclusivity and creativity, and has a cult following. Oh yeah, it's Apple. Despite Snap's popularity, teens still use SMS. CNBC's college interns tell me that iMessage's blue bubbles and "superior emojis" are considered more cool, and it's somewhat shameful to text with a green (non-Apple) message. This is clearly something that Apple is trying to play up in their new ad, below. Big pile of money Snapchat has some things iMessage lacks, like a social feed and a broadcasting platform. That's fine. Apple doesn't need to copy every Snapchat feature. Apple may not have a social feed, but it's already got a list of all your closest friends and family members: your contacts list. Instagram's co-founder Kevin Systrom told Recode that engaging with friends and family moves the needle much more than celebrities or other content. And Apple isn't an advertising company and doesn't need advertising dollars. It just needs to be cool enough to get people to buy an iPhone. Eventually, folks may pay for other services, like Apple Music, because they work within the app. And users wouldn't have to deal with annoying ads in their personal messages. Apple's software endeavors haven't always been executed perfectly. But Apple can afford to revolutionize messaging without worrying about stemming a $514.64 million loss and reviving a struggling stock. Commentary by CNBC's Anita Balakrishnan.

As it turns out, Apple quietly recruited college students to be its Apple Music ambassadors. This new marketing campaign is Apple’s attempt of promoting its music streaming platform. In exchange, students that engage in the program would be given an extra three months of free service after the campaign stops next month. Based on the instructions, the Student Ambassadors simply have to share the links to content from Apple Music and use the graphic ad they prepared for Twitter. Both the Student Ambassador who took part in the program and anyone who uses the ad will be entitled to free three months of service. Since each one will have a unique affiliate link, Apple will be able to keep track of each student’s success. More importantly, the Ambassadors who perform the best for each task will be entitled to exclusive perks from Apple Music. Some of these perks include access to the much awaited Apple Music Festival. After digging around, it turns out the program is being handled by a third-party marketing company called Social Chain that Apple hired. As it turned out, the company reached out to prospective students and asked them if they wanted to be an Apple Music Ambassador. Another way they gained attention from interested individuals was by running a targeted ad on Facebook for intended for students. Apple then handpicked the rightful ambassadors with an instruction to keep quiet about the campaign until the first task started. The first few tweets with the hashtag came from a few users based in the U.K. Soon enough, the hashtag trended throughout the country. There’s no word on whether or not this Ambassador campaign will expand to other countries.

The practice is scrupulously legal—and therefore OK in the eyes of many. I, however, don’t think it’s right. The Situation Apple is a world leader in structuring its global operations so that profits are accounted for in low-taxing districts, regardless of where its products were actually sold. Apple pays enormous taxes in the U.S.—it’s the largest taxpayer in its home country—but it pays next to nothing in most parts of the world. As stated above, these practices are assuredly legal. At the very least, Apple’s tax practices have survived intense scrutiny from countries where Apple pays little or no taxes. The closest thing to a legit legal challenge to Apple’s practices has been questioning from grandstanding U.S. Senators and a most-likely-to-fail complaint against Ireland by the European Union. To that end, Apple Australia issued this statement to The New Zealand Herald: Apple aims to be a force for good and we’re proud of the contributions we’ve made in New Zealand over the past decade. Because our products and services are created, designed and engineered in the US, that’s where the vast majority of our tax is paid. All Politics (and Sales) Are Local At least some New Zealand politicians aren’t having it. Green Party co-leader James Shaw told The Herald: It is absolutely extraordinary that they are able to get away with paying zero tax in this country. I really like Apple products – they’re incredibly innovative – but it looks like their tax department is even more innovative than their product designers. That’s the thing. Companies with local operations should pay their fair share of taxes to local taxing districts. Roads, schools, services—all of these things are used to support Apple and its employees. All of these things support each and every Apple sale to local residents. Apple should pay its fair share to support the things that make those sales possible. I’ve made this argument before, and plenty of people disagree with me. To them, Tim Cook has a fiduciary responsibility to maximize profits for its shareholders, the end. The same is true for every other CEO of American corporations large and small. Next: Do the Right Thing, Apple’s Good, and Final Thoughts Pages: 1 2 Next Page Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Email Print Tumblr Tags: Apple, New Zealand, taxes, Tim Cook 15 Comments Add a comment John Kheit March 17, 2017 Totally disagree. If Apple is following the law, then kudos to them. Further, Bryan, the page views/ads this story, this website, and podcasts from it go to many other states where you guys do not pay taxes, yet TMO derives beneficial income from activities in all those states, and yet pays 0 taxes there. So I know it’s perfectly legal, and why I have no problem with it myself, since you don’t think such things are right, I look forward on your report of paying supplemental and non-necessary taxes there. 😀 March 17, 2017 at 9:56 EDT PM Samuel Lethaby March 18, 2017 I don’t know where the previous response is coming from. I would say amusing at very least. As a NZ RN I pay close to $1000 in tax. Locally owned businesses pay tens of thousands a month in tax to support the infrastructure that is quote “systemically underfunded”. Yet many overseas cooperations come here and literally take billions of dollars away from the economy by manipulating loopholes In the tax laws. The rest as to why this continues to be legal is completely beyond me and many of us here in New Zealand March 18, 2017 at 2:55 EDT AM John Kheit March 18, 2017 Well I’ll give you a hint without knowing anything about New Zealand. Your lawmakers made laws like that. Either the majority of folks are actually OK with that and that’s why you have those lawmakers, or you need to convince or remove and elect other lawmakers to do what most people like. That’s my out of left field speculation. Most loopholes, here and abroad, on taxes aren’t really accidental. They are enacted purposefully. Ireland new darn well what deal it was cutting. Perhaps NZ didn’t, but if the law has been that way for multiple years, I’d guess that the govt knew what it was doing, and had its reasons. March 18, 2017 at 3:33 EDT AM Lwio March 18, 2017 Apple along with many others whilst following the rules may be legally right but it’s certainly not ethically right. The problem is the rules and the people who make them, the politicians. They could stop this tomorrow if the agreed to change the system but there’s too many interests, too much corruption involved. Given the apathy of the electorate this will never change. March 18, 2017 at 5:21 EDT AM KiwiPhred March 18, 2017 As a New Zealander I’m pretty sure this is an incomplete picture of Apple’s tax payment in NZ. While they may be using the law to avoid paying taxes on profits here as they do elsewhere there is also a little thing called Goods and Services Tax which is applied to all their products at the rate of 12.5%. So sales of their products here do contribute to the NZ’s government’s coffers as opposed to the claims of zero contribution made in the article. March 18, 2017 at 9:34 EDT AM Alan March 18, 2017 New Zealand collects a large (15%, if I recall) GST sales tax on every purchase. That is, NZ collects significant taxes for every Apple product sold in NZ. The real question has nothing to do with how and where taxes are collected, but how much. 15% is partially from retail markups, and is paid more directly by the consumer than a direct corporate tax, but the real question is how much total taxes should NZ be enriched by Apple business in NZ. Perhaps it should be a lot more, but I have no problem with what route the money takes to get to the government. March 18, 2017 at 9:38 EDT AM skipaq March 18, 2017 Bryan, could you be more thorough? What exactly is Apple’s corporate footprint in NZ? What corporate taxes are they “avoiding”? Are we just talking about retail sales profits? If the later is the case then Alan and Kiwi answered that moral objection. You cannot be arguing that Apple should be paying Corporate profit taxes in every country an Apple product is sold. I would think the board would fire Cook for doing something like that. March 18, 2017 at 10:20 EDT AM early geek March 18, 2017 I think you are pointing at the wrong party. Apple didn’t write the rules/laws/tax rate. Those laws/rules were written by your politicians. Apple cannot change those rules. The politicians can. How much should Apple contribute? 10%? 15? Everyone is going to give a different answer. Shouldn’t there at least be some guidelines? – there are – it’s called the tax guidelines. And Apple is doing exactly what those guidelines say. Apple is a private entity and is answerable to its shareholders. The politicians on the other hand, are answerable to YOU You can’t change Apple. You *can* change politicians. March 18, 2017 at 10:07 EDT PM Rick Allen March 19, 2017 Bryan, I feel the issue is the same type of one that people complain about Apple not bringing back foreign profits back into the country. If people want different rules, then the government needs to change them. I don’t agree with not paying taxes. By all means support the locals. It seems that in many cases the common people are the least concern when governments make these tax laws and loopholes for corporations. There is another question, if Apple pays more taxes in a country, do they raise prices like they have in UK after Brexit referendum? Then what is the cause of that — possibly less sales, and then the net effect is less money March 19, 2017 at 1:34 EDT PM archimedes March 19, 2017 Bryan, are you sure this is accurate? Even if Apple if Apple isn’t paying certain taxes such as corporate income tax to New Zealand, its sales are almost certainly taxed via the GST. If the GST is 15%, then the tax on $4.2B would be some $630 million, certainly not “zero.” March 19, 2017 at 6:39 EDT PM archimedes March 19, 2017 @john kheit Hahaha, thanks to TMO’s resident lawyer and contrarian for weighing in on this. March 19, 2017 at 6:46 EDT PM geoduck March 19, 2017 Corporations have no business worrying about what is “right” and what isn’t in this matter. Their obligation to shareholders is to do what is legal. To do anything else lands them in hot water. If they fail to obey the absolute scrupulous letter of the law they will have government agencies after them, costing the company more. If they choose to not take advantage of every law as written, if the choose to pay a “fair” amount” or “what is right” then they will have a shareholder revolt on their hands which will cost the company more. They might even get the SEC after them. Either way Apple is doing exactly what they as a publicly traded corporation have to do. They have no wiggle room in this regard. March 19, 2017 at 7:26 EDT PM Laurie Fleming March 20, 2017 John Kheit: Either the majority of folks are actually OK with that and that’s why you have those lawmakers, or you need to convince or remove and elect other lawmakers to do what most people like. Politely: It is clear, as you say, that you know absolutely nothing about New Zealand. Up until Matt Nippert disclosed Apple’s tax avoidance, the extent of it was not known by the voting public. As the Labour Party leader Andrew Little has said, the ruling National Party has been asleep at the wheel over tax: Stuff. Labour itself has been lax in the past in stopping this, but National has had nine long years and still done nothing. But it’s hard to do anything about it – these large multi-nationals (and it’s of course it’s not just Apple) shuffle their tax dealings around the world until they find a spot where they have the least tax obligations. It’s whack-a-mole. Until the voters and tax-payers where they are not paying their fair share know about it and decide that this is not acceptable and force their governments to enact laws to stop it, these companies will continue to do it. But voting for or against a party is a binary choice – it’s possible but rare to make that vote in a particular way on a single issue. As for the companies responsibility for their shareholders overriding all others, I reject that as Friedmanesque ideology. It’s a cop-out. If companies want to do business in this country, they must follow New Zealand’s laws. And they can profit from it – there’s huge good will in being a good corporate organisation. Cartoon March 20, 2017 at 4:07 EDT PM John Kheit March 20, 2017 @Laurie, in other words, I’m right. Since it’s “difficult” you can get some money or no money from them. That’s the deal your representatives chose to take. And now the public “knows” we look forward to your voting the politicians in the “RULING” and voted in party, out for your agenda now. Want to make a bet? I love that you “disagree” with shareholder responsibility being ruled out by you. I’m sure that is of great police to the corporate officers when a shareholder suit is lobbed on them. I’m sure your post will totally put that in perspective during the law suit. Glad we have you on record as defender of truth and justice that is TOTALLY relevant to the real world. 🙄 March 20, 2017 at 8:04 EDT PM Scott B in DC March 20, 2017 I, however, don’t think it’s right. Bryan, there comes a point after reading this time and again I have to ask: What are you doing about it? Who are you complaining to? A bunch of people who come to a website called The Mac Observer that are Apple fans to begin with? Even if there are people here who agree with you, what are you doing and what would you like people to do? It’s like the boy who cried “Wolf!” one too many times. You are screaming into the proverbial hollow tube. What you are getting out is a form of an echo. To put it like my late mother used to: Stop kvetching and start stretching. What are you doing other than kvetching in so many words? Have you contacted your local representatives that control your state finances? How about your members of congress? Sure, they may be bought and sold by the lobbyists, but you can have an effect on them. As a small business owner, I am not sure I agree or disagree. I know I do not get the same tax breaks as the larger companies but I also know that when I have a problem, standing on a platform and screaming is not going to help. I’ve been to Annapolis (my state capital) to speak with my representatives. I’ve told them personally what my concerns are for both my business and the changes in the laws that they are proposing to help but will hurt me in the long run. I’ve learned to stop kvetching and I am stretching out to work with the people who are making the laws. My challenge to you is what will you do to start stretching? To start to make an impact? Otherwise, to borrow a quote from Macbeth, it’s all “full of sound and fury signifying nothing.” March 20, 2017 at 10:39 EDT PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

It’s been another exciting week across the tech world, with no end of exciting news keeping us on our toes. But if you’ve struggled to keep with it all, fear not, for 7 Days is here once more with a handy walkthrough of the week’s top tech news. "Laser beam" Our journey begins this week on a beam of light, as researchers at the University of Michigan revealed significant progress in development efforts for “lightwave” computers, relying on ultra-fast laser impulses to get electrons firing at incredible speeds. Their discoveries could pave the way towards creating quantum computing devices. Amazon announced that it’s bringing support for its Alexa digital assistant to iPhones – but oddly, not in the Alexa app. Instead, the functionality is being added to the Amazon app on iOS devices. On Thursday, Apple released the seventh betas of iOS 10.3 and macOS 10.12.4 Sierra, both for developers, and testers on its Public Beta program. A passenger on a flight to Melbourne, Australia suffered injuries when her wireless headphones ‘exploded’ on board. The incident raised fresh concerns over battery-powered consumer devices on airliners, following the ban on Samsung’s Galaxy Note7 on flights last year. Tesla CEO Elon Musk spoke with Australia's Prime Minister, offering energy storage solutions and reliable supplies to solve recent electricity shortage issues that left 40,000 people without power in South Australia. But domestic energy suppliers criticized the government for even considering Musk’s offer, calling for a “transparent bid process” and a level playing field to give Australian companies “a fair go”. Over in the UK, telecommunications giant BT agreed to spin off its Openreach network division into a separate company that will provide rivals with access to its domestic network. Rivals such as Virgin Media mocked the move, claiming that it will make little difference to BT’s competitors and to UK customers, as Openreach will continue to offer “the same old snail’s paced network with a new shell”. In Russia, Apple was found guilty of price-fixing after regulators determined that it was compelling companies to sell many of its iPhones at a minimum retail price, stifling competition in the domestic market. Several Russians were among those alleged to have been involved in major digital attacks against Yahoo, which compromised hundreds of millions of user accounts. Image: Getty Images for Visa Visa is considering launching - or at least supporting - wearable devices with support for mobile payments – but rather than going down the ‘typical’ route of wristbands, it’s instead trialling sunglasses with NFC support. On Friday, Qualcomm announced that its processors will now be known as ‘platforms’, and that it's ditching the Snapdragon branding from its current Snapdragon 200-series chips, which will now be branded under the ‘Qualcomm Mobile’ moniker. Meanwhile, rival chipmaker Intel stunned the markets by announcing its $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye, an Israeli company that focuses on developing technology for autonomous vehicles. The purchase is a hugely significant move for Intel, giving it a huge boost in the technology behind self-driving cars. Intel was also a key partner in the launch of Tag Heuer’s new Connected Modular 45 smartwatch, an Android Wear 2.0 device with a diverse ecosystem of modular accessories. Promising more than a day of power, along with water resistance, the new device also comes with a hefty price tag: you’ll need to hand over $1,600 to own one. Google has developed a new system to replace the infuriating CAPTCHA tool, which features on many websites that demand that you prove that you’re “not a robot”. The "invisible reCAPTCHA" system works in the background and uses magic and witchcraft "an advanced risk analysis engine" to determine that real humans are accessing websites. Meanwhile, the latest version of Chrome’s web browser brings massive improvements in power usage for PCs, as well as introducing a new offline reading mode to iOS. Google also updated its Gmail app on Android allowing users to send and request money, just as easily as sharing an attachment. Impressively, the company says that the feature is "completely free" for both senders and recipients. Sony’s new ultra-thin Android TV, the Bravia OLED 4K HDR TV, finally got a launch date and official price tag this week – but you’ll need to be earning some serious dough to be able to afford one. Samsung also announced details of its new QLED TVs this week, featuring ‘Quantum Dot’ technology, with the 55-inch models starting at almost half the price of Sony’s 55-inch OLED TVs. Those who pre-order LG’s impressive new G6 flagship in the United States will get a free Google Home speaker hub worth $129.99 with the device. T-Mobile will be offering the new phone in the US, and announced its pricing this week. Google Home is powered by the Google Assistant – but it hasn’t been a great month for the digital assistant so far. After spewing loony conspiracy theories last week, Google Assistant unexpectedly threw in ads for Disney’s new Beauty and the Beast movie a few days ago. However, Google later insisted that the ads weren’t ads at all, but rather “timely content”. And after announcing wider availability of the Assistant on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and 7.0 Nougat devices last month, Google confirmed this week that it won’t be supported on any Android tablets. Nougat is currently installed on just 2.8% of active Android devices. Google is believed to be planning to release the newest version of the OS, Android 7.1.2, on April 3 – but for now, its long, slow rollout continues to more handsets: T-Mobile is now testing Nougat for the HTC One M9 OnePlus brings Android 7.1.1 to the 3 and 3T Google Nexus 6 owners on Android 7.1.1 get over-the-air ‘downgrade’ to Android 7.0, causing all sorts of issues on their devices Nougat heads to Samsung’s Galaxy S6 and S6 in India Samsung begins Android 7.0 rollout to Galaxy Note5 Earlier this month, Google released its latest monthly Android security updates. Some manufacturers have begun distributing the March patches quickly – but others have not: March security updates now available for Sony’s Xperia X, X Performance, X Compact and XZ AT&T brings February security updates to Samsung Galaxy Note5, Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy S5 active Samsung (re)commits to monthly security updates for unlocked Galaxy smartphones in the US HMD says it will deliver monthly Android patches to the Nokia 3, 5 and 6 ZTE finally gets around to bringing January updates to its Blade V8 Pro, which was released in February The need for timely security updates was highlighted again this week with yet more Android malware having been discovered. Disturbingly, security researchers at Check Point found that malware had been pre-installed on 38 devices, including some from major manufacturers such as ZTE, Samsung, Lenovo, Xiaomi and ASUS. Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+ will be unveiled later this month, but there may not be much left for the company to announce by then. More details on the new flagships emerged this week: Images leak of Samsung Experience launcher ‘Black Pearl’ model revealed Galaxy S8 might have camera capable of capturing 1000 frames per second China expected to get exclusive S8 model with 6GB RAM Time ran out to develop the Galaxy S8’s on-screen fingerprint scanner Pricing of the new Galaxy Tab S3 was also revealed this week in the UK and US – but the new high-end tablet, which has a Snapdragon 820 chip – won’t come cheap. Also in the UK, Sony’s Xperia XZ Premium, which it unveiled at Mobile World Congress last month, has been priced at £649. After increasing the price of its Windows 10 Mobile flagship in the UK by 7% last week, HP is hoping to tempt people to buy the Elite x3 and Desk Dock by offering them up to £500 to trade in their existing handsets. Unfortunately, owners of Microsoft’s Windows 10 Mobile flagships will only get £125 for their devices. Meanwhile, Microsoft cut the price of the Elite x3 and Desk Dock this week… by 2.4%. Can’t see that making a big difference in boosting sales. Sales of Windows phones have plummeted over the last two years. Industry analysts Kantar Worldpanel wrote off Microsoft’s mobile OS this week, declaring that there’s no hope for a comeback, and that we’re now living in a “two-OS world” as far as the mobile industry goes. Microsoft gave in to that reality a long time ago, bringing more of its software to rival platforms in recent years. It’s made huge improvements to its Arrow Launcher for Android devices over the last few months, adding new support for Android tablets this week. There’s now less than a month until Microsoft ends support for Windows Vista, including security updates. Microsoft has also apparently begun blocking software updates for older versions of Windows running on the newest hardware. Some Windows 7 and 8.1 updates aren’t being offered to PCs running Intel’s latest Kaby Lake (7th-generation) Core processors, along with other new-gen chips, as Microsoft is trying to force encourage users to upgrade to Windows 10. At the same time, Microsoft is now preparing to push through certain Windows 10 updates to devices over metered connections. The company says that it will only do so for “critical fixes” and other “updates required to keep Windows running smoothly”. Microsoft has begun the process of finalizing its Windows 10 Creators Update, ahead of its anticipated release in April. The next step for the company is to select a release candidate which is likely to be distributed to Windows Insiders next week. Microsoft detailed new security improvements in the Creators Update this week, but it also revealed details of features being removed from Windows 10 as part of that update. It’s been a busy week for Windows 10 development, as three new builds rolled out to the Fast ring: 15058, 15060, and on Friday, build 15061. You can find details of the fixes and known issues in build 15061 here. The latest Windows 10 SDK Preview, build 15052, is also available, along with ISOs for build 15058. The latter build is now available on the Windows Insider Slow ring too. Microsoft hasn't yet announced a firm date for the Creators Update's release, so there's plenty of room for speculation! Microsoft released its latest cumulative updates for all versions of Windows 10 on Tuesday, including build 10240.17319 (Version 1507 – the original release of the OS), 10586.839 (Version 1511 – the November Update), and 14393.953 (Version 1607 – the Anniversary Update). However, the latest update for Windows 10 Mobile devices did not include a fix for a rather unpleasant bug that leaves all users’ photos available to view without unlocking a handset. That bug was revealed over a month ago, and yet Microsoft still hasn’t resolved the issue – we checked! Microsoft did fix nine critical security issues in Windows 10 with its latest Patch Tuesday updates though. We don’t yet know exactly when Microsoft plans to announce its second-generation Surface Book, but the device is certainly ripe for replacement. It went on sale almost a year and a half ago, but there are plenty of newer and more capable alternatives available now, including some at lower prices. This week, a report claimed that the new Surface Book 2 will have a more ‘traditional’ laptop form factor, ditching the detachable display of the current model, and thus helping to reduce the cost of the entry-level model by as much as a third, bringing its price down to as little as $1,000. The thing is, that doesn’t make a great deal of sense unless Microsoft plans to differentiate the Surface Book 2 in some other remarkable new way. Surface has always been dedicated to developing new product categories to lead the way for other manufacturers to follow with their own devices. Competing head-on with existing machines by launching a ‘conventional’ notebook would go against the Surface ethos, and would likely do little to help sales of similar laptops from Microsoft’s hardware partners. Over in the UK, Microsoft is continuing to soften the blow of its recent – and massive – price increases on the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 by extending its offer of free insurance and Office 365, along with new discounts on both devices. The total savings amount to as much as £600. Microsoft has been working with researchers in the UK on a remarkable project, helping visually impaired children to learn coding by using physical, tangible objects. And after several months in preview, Microsoft officially launched its Slack competitor, Teams, in 19 languages and 181 countries across the globe. Microsoft brought its OneDrive app, developed on the Universal Windows Platform, to the Xbox One this week. It also released Xbox Insider Preview build 15058 to the Alpha ring on Friday, bring a new feature along with a single fix, and a long list of known issues. It followed the release of build 15055 to the Alpha ring earlier in the week. Microsoft also revealed that its Alpha Preview of the new Xbox Game Pass will end on April 7. Game Pass is a monthly $10 subscription that will give gamers access to over 100 games, and will launch this Spring. For the first time in two weeks, Microsoft added four more titles to the list of Xbox 360 games that are backward compatible with the Xbox One. It also introduced a new in-game chat transcription feature for the Xbox One and Windows 10, with speech-to-text and text-to-speech support. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission announced a recall of Energizer’s Xbox One 2X Smart Charger, following reports of potentially dangerous overheating on some units. And after releasing its 4.50 system software update for the PlayStation 4 family last week, some owners of Sony’s consoles have reported issues being able to connect to wireless networks. In happier news, Sony announced that it’s expanding its PlayStation Now service to include PS4 games, allowing PC gamers to enjoy those titles on their Windows machines. Nintendo brought a range of indie titles to its new Switch console, which launched earlier this month. But it also emerged that the Switch is vulnerable to a WebKit exploit, demonstrated through a proof-of-concept earlier this week.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 March 2017 by Military News 3 Reasons Apple Is a Better Value Stock Than Corning At least at some level, investing can be a lot like a spy novel. A narrative might appear one way at first only to change as new details emerge; things are rarely exactly as they first seem. This idea certainly holds true in comparing tech companies Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Corning (NYSE: GLW) . Trading at roughly half of Apple’s valuation, the superficial numbers would suggest that Corning is clearly the better buy. However, for the three reasons you will see below, the numbers alone fail to tell the entire story. Here’s why Apple is a better value stock to buy today than Corning. 1. Corning isn’t as cheap as it looks The sheer cheapness of its stock jumps out immediately when looking at Corning. At a time when the S&P 500 trades at roughly 26 times earnings — admittedly well above its own historic norms — Corning stock currently trades hands at a minuscule 8.5 times earnings. However, this also contains an important investing lesson: Stocks tend to trade at such seemingly preposterous discounts for a reason. Case in point: Corning booked a $2.6 billion gain on the revaluation of one of its equity investments during its fiscal 2016, which inflated its pre-tax income by roughly 190% on the year. With its earnings per share (EPS) expect to grow at 8% this year, Corning’s 15.3 forward P/E ratio serves as a far better indicator of the company’s actual valuation than its current P/E. Again, the alarm bells should go off any time you see the shares of a healthy company like Corning trading at so seemingly cheap a valuation. Corning isn’t nearly as cheap as it appears at first glance. Image source: Apple. 2. Apple is cheaper than it looks Just as Corning isn’t as cheap as it looks, the value of Apple’s core operating business is actually far lower than its P/E suggests. The underlying reason is fairly well documented at this point; Apple’s net cash surplus totaled $158.6 billion in its most recent quarterly filing. Subtracting this staggering figure from Apple’s market capitalization reduces its valuation to $570.6 billion. Using this net-cash-adjusted market cap as the numerator to Apple’s P/E ratio provides an updated valuation for the Mac maker of just 12.6 times earnings, which is significantly lower than Corning’s valuation metric after removing the effect of the one-time accounting gains it recorded this year. Seen this way, Apple actually offers investors better value, though this line of reasoning does little to factor in either company’s growth outlook. However, the investment thesis turns even more in Apple’s favor upon adding in the companies’ long-term return profiles. 3. Apple’s growth outlook beats Corning’s Not to belabor the point, but comparing Apple’s forward growth rates against those of Corning supports the same conclusion. Looking to the top line, consensus Wall Street estimates call for Apple to increase its sales by 5.9% this year and 7.5% next year. Meanwhile, Corning is expected to see its sales rise 3.4% in 2016 and 1.2% in 2017. The same relationship — Apple slightly outgrowing Corning — also applies to sell-side estimates for the two companies’ earnings per share. Much of this is likely attributable to Apple’s expected debut of a fully redesigned 10th anniversary iPhone this fall. Corning, of course, will benefit from Apple’s latest iPhone as a component supplier for the handset. However, Apple will certainly benefit far more from the highly anticipated device. Beyond sales and earnings growth, Apple’s gigantic — and growing — cash surplus gives the company far more flexibility to enhance overall shareholder returns through increased dividends and buybacks. The company can also invest heavily in future growth initiatives like electric cars or digital streaming content without affecting its current earnings outlook. At the end of the day, although Corning is no slouch in its own right, Apple is clearly the better value stock between the two companies. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Casey | March 14, 2017 08:13 am MORE We're seeing more smoke coming from the iPad rumor mill, with the latest reinforcing the notion that Apple will be introducing a new version of the iPad Pro. According to a new report, the company's upcoming 10.5-inch iPad Pro will launch in April, slightly later than the March window we've heard previously. This updated launch date comes from Taiwanese news site DigiTimes, which reports that the 10.5-inch slate will be unveiled at a "product event to be held in early April to mark the inauguration of Apple's new headquarters in California." MORE: Our Favorite Tablets for Work and Play This is the first we're hearing of an Apple Park opening event, though an Apple press release released in February notes that the campus will be ready for employees in April. Where such an event would be held on-campus, specifically, is up in the air. The location's events auditorium, dubbed the Steve Jobs Theater, isn't expected to open until "later this year." The Steve Jobs Theater, an event auditorium where Apple may be revealing its next iPad. The new 10.5-inch iPad Pro is expected bear a striking new design with an almost borderless display and no home button, which makes it sound an awful lot like one of the new iPhones expected this year. This kind of overhaul could provide the wow-factor that the high-end corner of the tablet market needs to open its wallets up again. We're also expecting to see Apple give more modest refreshes to its 9.7-inch and 12.3-inch iPad Pro tablets. The company may also launch a 7.9-inch model and give it one of Apple's smart connectors, so that it can attach to a Smart Keyboard, just like an iPad Pro. Stay tuned to Laptop Mag for all the iPad rumors, news and announcements, as we're keeping our eyes out for Apple's next tablets. ✖ iPad Pro Tips and Tricks Multitask on the iPad Pro Every iPad Pro Keyboard Shortcut You'll Ever Need Use the iOS Keyboard as a Touchpad Display Two Safari Tabs Simultaneously on the iPad Pro How to Use the Apple Pencil with iPad Pro's Notes App Edit Multiple Streams of 4K Video on the iPad Pro Use Your iPad Pro as a Secondary Display Check the Apple Pencil’s Battery Life Use Your iPhone as a Hotspot for the iPad Pro Multitask on the iPad Pro Every iPad Pro Keyboard Shortcut You'll Ever Need Use the iOS Keyboard as a Touchpad Display Two Safari Tabs Simultaneously on the iPad Pro How to Use the Apple Pencil with iPad Pro's Notes App Edit Multiple Streams of 4K Video on the iPad Pro Use Your iPad Pro as a Secondary Display Check the Apple Pencil’s Battery Life Use Your iPhone as a Hotspot for the iPad Pro Next Tips »» «« Previous Tip Next Tip »» iPad Pro Tips and Tricks Multitask on the iPad Pro Every iPad Pro Keyboard Shortcut You'll Ever Need Use the iOS Keyboard as a Touchpad More Tips Multitask on the iPad Pro Every iPad Pro Keyboard Shortcut You'll Ever Need Use the iOS Keyboard as a Touchpad Display Two Safari Tabs Simultaneously on the iPad Pro How to Use the Apple Pencil with iPad Pro's Notes App Edit Multiple Streams of 4K Video on the iPad Pro Use Your iPad Pro as a Secondary Display Check the Apple Pencil’s Battery Life Use Your iPhone as a Hotspot for the iPad Pro Author Bio Henry T.

Apple had their time in the sun, they decided to keep regurgitating the same product over and over again and slapping a higher number and an "i" in front of it. I doubt this will garner the sales that Apple thinks it will. Their last "innovation"?...the Touchbar?...didn't bring sales up like they should have, lets see how hight things go with this.

Home News National Pressure on Apple to pay tax in NZ Author Simon Collins, Section National, Publish Date Saturday, 18 March 2017, 5:42PM Apple is the biggest taxpayer in the US but paid zero tax in NZ in the past decade American-based Apple users are weighing in behind Kiwi politicians who are calling for the US tech giant to pay its taxes in New Zealand. Bryan Chaffin of The Mac Observer, an Apple community blog site founded in 1998, has urged Apple chief executive Tim Cook to "do the right thing" even though it would mean slightly lower profits for the company's shareholders. He was commenting on revelations today in the Weekend Herald that Apple paid zero tax to the NZ Government in the past 10 years in a period when its sales in this country totalled $4.2 billion. The company's accounts show that its NZ branch paid $37 million in tax since 2007 - but all of it was passed on to the Australian Government because the NZ operation is run out of Australia. Chaffin wrote that Apple was the largest taxpayer in the United States, but "pays next to nothing in most parts of the world". "There are so many areas where Apple does enormous good - far, far more good than any other electronics giant, and probably any other for-profit company," he wrote. "But local taxes matter. Roads matter. Schools matter. Housing authorities matter. Health care matters. Regulation enforcement matters. All of the things that support civil society matter. Apple's profits are made possible by that civil society, and the company should contribute its fair share. "According to the New Zealand Herald, 'Had Apple reported the same healthy profit margin in New Zealand as it did for its operations globally it would have paid $356 million in taxes over the period. "That kind of money matters to countries the size of New Zealand. To me, Apple should kick in to help pay for the civil infrastructure it needs to make those profits. "And I won't be silent about it." Labour's revenue spokesman Michael Wood said Kiwi taxpayers had "every reason to feel outraged" by Apple's zero NZ tax bill. "Nurses, cleaners, office workers, and small business owners, who pay their fair share of tax to support public services in our country, will be dismayed at these latest revelations," he said. "We know that this is the tip of the iceberg for big multinationals being let off the hook by the National Government being completely asleep at the wheel." The Government announced a package of measures on March 3 which will deem non-residents to have NZ permanent establishments if they sell goods or services to a person in New Zealand, and have related entities carrying out activities here to bring the sales about. The package will also stop companies using interest payments to shift profits offshore. But it stops short of a diverted profits tax which has been introduced in Australia and Britain. Revenue Minister Judith Collins declined to comment specifically on Apple yesterday, but said a "minority" of international companies were exploiting rules to avoiding paying tax and "we do not consider the amount of tax paid by these multinationals is fair". An Apple spokesperson in Australia told the Herald yesterday: "Apple aims to be a force for good and we're proud of the contributions we've made in New Zealand over the past decade. Because our products and services are created, designed and engineered in the US, that's where the vast majority of our tax is paid." - NZ Herald Related Technology: 7 November Technology: 7 November Technology: 3 October Technology: 3 October Technology: 26 September Technology: 26 September Opinion Rachel Smalley: Nia Glassie's abuser can't be allowed to...

Instead, Apple responded by saying it paid most of its tax in the United States, where the company was based. Apple claims to be the largest taxpayer in the world, but a report says New Zealand got none of it. Photo: AFP A New Zealand Herald investigation found Apple paid no local tax in the last decade, despite selling $4.2 billion worth of products in New Zealand in that time. The government has refused to comment on the report. In a statement today, Apple did not say whether it had paid tax in New Zealand since 2007. Apple said it was the largest taxpayer in the world and followed the law in every country in which it operated. The company said it aimed to be a force for good and was proud of the contributions it made in New Zealand. Revenue Minister Judith Collins said earlier she could not comment on individual cases, but there was a minority of multinationals that tried to reduce their taxes. She said that was unfair and she was working to strengthen the tax rules. Revenue Minister Judith Collins. Photo: RNZ / Claire Eastham-Farrelly Untasted Apple shows govt 'too slow' on tax - Labour The Labour Party made calls for greater transparency over how multinationals conduct their tax affairs. Labour revenue spokesperson Michael Wood argued there was no reason Apple should avoid public scrutiny. "If we do have these large multinational companies who, on the basis of pretty good evidence, are potentially avoiding their tax, they don't actually have the same rights to absolute privacy about that as an ordinary individual who might be under investigation," he said. He said the government had been too slow to act on closing loopholes. "Every single tax expert who looks at this says 'yep, our current system allows for this', he said. "So Apple hasn't been doing anything illegal, they've exploiting loopholes in the tax laws that we've known about for years." Mr Wood promised greater transparency for the tax affairs of overseas corporations if Labour were to win this year's general election.

The analysts said the information is from its own sources and not based on other reports. The research firm did not disclose which products it expects Apple to announce, but rumors have widely suggested at least a trio of new iPad Pro models will be unveiled as early as this month, including an all-new 10.5-inch model with slimmer bezels and updated 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch versions. The sources expecting an iPad refresh include, among others, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis, and Japanese blog Mac Otakara. The last of the three expects a new 7.9-inch model that would supplant the iPad mini 4, but other reports deny or fail to mention that particular claim. Last month, Mac Otakara said Apple will host a March event where it will debut its new iPad Pro lineup, a larger iPhone SE model with 128GB storage, and new Apple Watch bands. The report also claimed Apple will add a red color option for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which could be part of (PRODUCT)RED. Apple has yet to invite the media to an event this month, however, and those invites would be on shorter notice than usual if it is indeed planning to announce new products this way as early as next week. In each of the past two years, Apple invited the media to its March event roughly 11-12 days beforehand, including February 26 invites for a March 9 event in 2015 and March 10 invites for a March 21 event last year. There are three plausible scenarios if new products are in the cards: Apple is planning a March event, and invites will go out soon; Apple is planning a Spring event, but not this month; or Apple will share its announcements through a press release as it did when it dropped the price of the fourth-generation iPad to $399 in March 2014. A few reports have suggested the 10.5-inch iPad Pro could face shipping delays, so perhaps Apple will delay announcing it entirely. Apple has hosted March events four times in the past six years. In 2011 and 2012, it introduced new iPad models at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. In 2015, it revealed Apple Watch pricing and release date information. Last year, Apple debuted the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and iPhone SE at its Town Hall. One rumor suggested Apple could be planning an event on April 4, but this date was based on Personal Pickup for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which is generally not a reliable indicator of an event. The in-store pickup date for 12.9-inch iPad Pro models is a rolling target, as evidenced by the April 10 date now shown. The all-new 10.5-inch iPad Pro is expected to have slimmer bezels, and possibly no Home button, allowing it to have the same overall footprint as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. This design could foreshadow the rumored 5.8-inch iPhone. The tablet is also rumored to have a higher-resolution display and quad microphones. The updated 12.9-inch iPad Pro is said to feature a 12-megapixel rear camera and True Tone display like the current 9.7-inch model, using advanced four-channel ambient light sensors to automatically adapt the color and intensity of the display to match the light in the surrounding environment.

Registered developers can download the sixth iOS 10.3 beta from the Apple Developer Center or over-the-air with the proper configuration profile installed. iOS 10.3 is a major update, introducing significant new features and changes to the iOS 10 operating system. The biggest consumer-facing feature in iOS 10.3 is "Find My AirPods," which is designed to help AirPods owners locate a lost earphone. Find My AirPods records the last known location of when an AirPod was connected to an iOS device via Bluetooth and can play a sound on a lost AirPod. Apple's latest update also introduces a new Apple File System (APFS), installed when an iOS device is updated to iOS 10.3. APFS is optimized for flash/SSD storage and includes features like strong encryption. Apple plans to introduce some App Store changes in iOS 10.3, allowing developers to respond to customer reviews for the first time. iOS users are also able to label reviews in the App Store as "Helpful" or "Not Helpful," which should help surface the most relevant review content. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. Apple also plans to limit the number of times developers can ask for a review, allow customers to leave app reviews without exiting an app, and provide a "master switch" that will let users turn off all app review request prompts. Also new in iOS 10.3 is a redesigned app open/close animation, an Apple ID profile in Settings, a better breakdown of iCloud storage usage, warnings about outdated apps that won't work with future versions of iOS, HomeKit support for programmable light switches, improvements to SiriKit (bill paying, bill status, and scheduling future rides), CarPlay interface improvements, iCloud analytics options, and more. Update: iOS 10.3 beta 6 is also available for public beta testers.

Rating: 2 Votes sbailey4 6 days ago at 10:12 am Sure if you look the totality of beta updates. But then again my comment was on the article and the comment the author pointed out that the biggest consumer update was to be able to find Airpods. So if anyone doesn't have Airpods....The current update is pretty invisible. HA ok. According to just that statement, I guess. Not sure I would deem the importance of an iOS update on what a MacRumors blogger posted but I suppose the find airpods is the most obvious change. Perhaps that's why the author focused on that. So if you don't care about bug fixes, security updates, performance optimizations, additional usable space on your device, CarPlay enhancements, Maps/Weather data enhancements and the the rest of the list of changes included in this update then yeah pretty uneventful I guess you could say. But then again it IS a point update not a new iOS major version. Rating: 2 Votes yockster 1 week ago Somebody woke up early today. Or they forgot it was daylight savings time, lol.

DigiTimes previously said the 10.5-inch iPad Pro would not be available until May or June, but now claims Apple has "moved ahead the production" of the rumored tablet. Over the past few weeks, we've heard a lot of speculation about when Apple will debut the 10.5-inch iPad Pro and its sister tablet(s). Rumors originally suggested the company would hold an event in March, but that has been in question as it is nearly mid-month with no hint of an event. Earlier today, a reliable supply chain source told MacRumors that Apple would announce products later this month, likely between Monday, March 20 and Friday, March 24. There was also a rumor circulating suggesting Apple would hold an event on April 4, but that was incorrectly based on an erroneous interpretation of Personal Pickup dates for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. While we haven't yet nailed down a specific timeline for the unveiling of new iPads, the prospective launch window is narrowing and rumors suggest we're going to see them within the next month. Just today, new iPad models were spotted in device logs gathered by Fiksu, suggesting a release is indeed on the horizon. Fiksu, like our unnamed supply chain source and DigiTimes, believes a launch is imminent. If an event takes place in April, it could potentially be held at Apple's new campus, Apple Park, but there's one snag in that plan. Apple is going to open the campus in April, but the company's press release said the auditorium where events will be held, now dubbed the Steve Jobs Theater, will open "later this year." The wording makes it unclear if the theater will be ready for Apple Park's grand opening, and thus ready for an event. According to today's report from DigiTimes, Apple plans to target the education and business sectors with both the rumored 10.5-inch iPad and a refreshed 12.9-inch model, which the site says will be Apple's "mainstream products" for the mid-tier to high-end tablet market in 2017. While DigiTimes believes the 10.5-inch iPad Pro will now see an April debut, the site says the production schedule for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro "still remains unclear" with volume production perhaps delayed until May or June. Rumors suggest that the new 12.9-inch iPad will feature a modest refresh, but the 10.5-inch model is rumored to have a nearly bezel-free edge-to-edge display and a body that's actually the same size as the existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro. There have also been rumors suggesting Apple plans to release a lower-end 9.7-inch iPad Pro and a 7.9-inch model, but whether those rumors are true remains to be seen as the focus has mainly been on Apple's larger upcoming tablets.

DigiTimes doesn't always interpret supply chain information correctly, that's true, but the information is still useful in light of other rumors, which are all solidifying around an imminent release that's set to happen in the next few weeks.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile ‘iPad mini Pro’ is reportedly one of the four new iPad Pros launching soon Chris Smith @chris_writes March 15th, 2017 at 7:53 AM Share Tweet Apple is expected to launch a slew of new iPads in the coming weeks, and it’s all going down at what may be the first press conference to be held at Apple’s shiny new Apple Campus headquarters. A new report indicates that Apple is about to unveil four new iPad models, and all of them will get the “Pro” moniker, even the brand new iPad mini. Don't Miss: The Galaxy S8 and Note 8 might not even be the best phones Samsung unveils this year Greek site TechValue says it’s able to confirm that four new iPad models are coming, including the iPad Pro 2 in 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch flavors, a 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and a brand new iPad mini Pro. With the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, Apple will introduce a new iPad size in its lineup. The 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch versions will also be upgraded. The report notes that the iPads will come in 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB versions, similar to what’s available in Apple’s iPhone 7 lineup. The tablets will be available in Space Grey, Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold. According to Phone Arena, the new 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch iPads will feature Apple’s A10X chip inside, while the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 will have an A9 processor. Earlier this week, a report from mobile marketing firm Fiksu revealed that Apple has been testing four new iPad models around Cupertino. The devices were spotted in analytics logs, TechCrunch explains, all the way back in September, but sightings increased in January and February. Fiksu found four identifiers for new iPads, including iPad 7,1, iPad 7,2, iPad 7,3, and iPad 7,4, running a mix of iOS 10.3 betas and iOS 11.

He provides unique big picture analysis of the complex world of Microsoft. Jason takes the small clues and gives you an insightful big picture perspective through storytelling that you won't find anywhere else. Seriously, this dude thinks outside the box. Follow him on Twitter at @JLTechWord. He's doing the "write" thing! I recently read an interesting article by respected writer and analyst Walt Mossberg, who said the PC is being redefined. I agree. But ... I've described the evolving personal computing landscape in the past. To communicate an accurate picture of the modern personal computing environment and the influencing factors that have shaped it, I've acknowledged that it's impossible to ignore the impact of the iPhone. Though smartphones existed before the iPhone, those business-focused devices were not relevant to the masses. The iPhone, with its "massive" touch screen merged the iPod, a phone and an internet device, and redefined the smartphone. Consumers loved it as much as they loved the popular iPod that primed them for a pocketable consumer-focused smartphone from Apple. Eventually, the iPhone and the "there's-an-app-for-that" model, which made it a veritable "swiss-army mobile computing device," evolved into much more than the phone-iPod-internet device introduced by former Apple CEO Steve Jobs in 2007. In time, Apple's introduction of the iPhone had a profound effect on the personal computing landscape. The iPhone, Android phones and to a lesser extent Windows phones — all with their supporting app ecosystems, integrated services, always-connected nature and pocketability — supplanted the traditional PC as the most used personal computers. Yes, smartphones are personal computing devices. Microsoft, not Apple, is more instrumental to the evolution of the PC. I agree with Mossberg that the mobile computing environment and ecosystems that shape personal computing today are influencers on what the PC will ultimately be. However, I disagree with his assessment that a significant shift to the new type of ARM-based PC that runs mobile apps will be determined by Apple. Millions of consumers already buy laptops that use "mobile apps" Microsoft's Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and Windows 10 laptops and 2-in-1s have already begun the process of bringing consumers to a laptop form factor that runs mobile apps, as well as traditional apps. This computing environment will be brought to ARM processors, as ARM-based Windows 10 PCs begin rolling out in several months. The change to an ARM-based system will be largely transparent to users. What won't be transparent are the advantages of ARM-based cellular Windows 10 PCs. Among other advantages, consumers will reap the benefits of lower costs, and lighter, fan-less and more power-efficient Windows 10 PCs. Mossberg said the following of a shift to ARM in relation to this problem: But the signs of a shift to ARM only set the stage for a bigger development: The migration of the most important modern software platforms, Android and iOS, to laptops and other traditional hardware that once defined the old kind of PC. ... I believe it won't matter much until Apple builds an ARM-based laptop running iOS. Here's why. Microsoft ... does have a modern breed of multi-touch apps that work properly on a tablet or clamshell screen, and some are included on every Windows tablet and laptop. Unfortunately, partly because Microsoft has no smartphone business to speak of, it also lacks a critical mass of these new-style apps and, even on its tablets, relies instead on classic Windows apps. Apple, by contrast, boasts 1.3 million tablet-optimized apps for the iPad, and these could presumably easily run on a small laptop with a built-in keyboard and touchscreen. This is more than a small advantage; it's the reason people might buy this type of device instead of a traditional laptop. I agree with the general assessments Mossberg puts forth. I also see the value in his conclusion that Apple, because of its vast and appealing app ecosystem, occupies an influential position. Consumer love for iOS apps may be a sufficient motivating factor for the masses to consciously and deliberately choose to use a laptop running those same mobile apps. That's if Apple can deliver a good mouse-and-keyboard productivity experience. Can Apple generate interest in a laptop that runs only mobile apps? I put forth a similar analysis in relation to Google's position if it ever decided to merge Chrome and Android. Google's 80 percent dominance of the mobile market would be a real threat to Microsoft's 90 percent dominance in PCs if Google brought a viable desktop experience to a desktop environment. Microsoft already invented the universal app 'wheel' Apple needs iOS apps are optimized for a slate consumption-based experience, not a peripheral-enhanced productivity setting. Mossberg stated the following in relation to this problem: The definition of a PC, a personal computer, is already undergoing a profound change. A great laptop running the new kinds of user interfaces and apps that people now love on phones and tablets would be a big, exciting event that would help seal the deal. But there hasn't yet been a product that emphatically suggests the era of the traditional PC is fading. And it feels like an opportunity only Apple can seize. Microsoft's Windows 10 and Universal Platform with Continuum are driving the evolution of the PC while also keeping the traditional PC around. Rather than just a clamshell laptop that runs mobile apps, which is Mossberg's vision for an evolved PC, Microsoft's strategy is more comprehensive. Microsoft's PC vision is more comprehensive than mobile apps on a laptop. Redmond saw the coming shift and created a device form factor with the Surface, a context-sensitive OS in Windows 10 and a Universal Platform that provides a common core for all device types and app development. The research firm IDC said the following, confirming the success and adoption of Windows laptops and 2-in-1s in a recent report: Consumers are just starting to graduate from old, consumption-based, slate tablets to a more productive detachable tablet. At the same time, the benefits of having a thin, touch-sensitive, productivity-based machine is [sic] shining light on the traditional PC category, causing vendors and consumers to focus on more premium devices in the Convertible and Ultraslim space. As the tablet market works through the challenges of a maturing user base, the notebook ecosystem has seen success in assimilating a more mobile experience to the form factor while retaining its inherent superiority in the content creation arena, which remains critical for commercial buyers. Absent major external forces, IDC believes the notebook and traditional PC market overall will see relatively stable volumes with some growth in more mobile designs offset by declines in less mobile products. As we watch the unfolding of Microsoft's strategy with the industry's embrace of 2-in-1s, Windows 10 laptops and PCs and Windows Mixed Reality (formerly Windows Holographic), Microsoft's impact on the evolution of the PC, in all of its forms, obviously exceeds Apple's. Technologically, Microsoft is where Mossberg hopes Apple will get Mossberg states, "Apple … boasts 1.3 million tablet-optimized apps for the iPad, and these could presumably easily run on a small laptop with a built-in keyboard and touchscreen." He supplies the caveat "presumably" in acknowledgment of his (and all of our) uncertainty as to the viability of iOS apps running on a small laptop with a built-in keyboard (and mouse). iOS apps are not yet optimized for a laptop environment. By contrast, we know with full certainty that Microsoft's unique UWP allows Windows Store apps to run on phones, laptops, 2-in-1s, HoloLens, Xbox, desktop PCs and any as yet to be created Windows devices. Most Windows 10 devices also run Win32 apps in conjunction with Store apps, and Windows 10 on ARM may bring that ability to phones. What Mossberg speculates would be a technological advancement for the Apple ecosystem already exists in far greater depth and breadth as part of Microsoft's UWP. Mossberg's vision of an evolved PC is a laptop with iOS apps and only iOS apps. Microsoft's personal computer vision is far broader than that. Windows 10 is key to the modern PC Though Windows 10 is only running on 400 million devices, Windows is a desktop and mobile platform. In less than two years, though far below it's one billion devices target, 400 million devices is impressive. iOS and Android have had roughly a decade to reach the billion mark those OSes achieved. Windows 10 is an evolution of the OS that embraces mobile computing. Some may argue that Windows 10 is merely an upgrade to the Windows OS that has a billion installed base. It is actually more of an evolution toward a new type of OS that retains the legacy strengths of the traditional desktop while adopting the necessary attributes of the modern, mobile personal computing environment. Universal Windows Apps, along with the coming full Windows on ARM and CShell on all types of mobile devices, help us visualize this reality. When viewing it from that proper perspective, the unique unified desktop and mobile OS that is Windows 10 has already begun to achieve in a very real way what Mossberg anticipates will be achieved with Android and iOS: bringing a relevant "mobile" OS to a desktop clamshell form factor. The market is buying, but may not "buy into" Microsoft's vision The PC's transformation, based on Windows 10 2-in-1s and even laptops, has already been accepted in the market by OEMs and consumers. Mossberg's vision awaits a move from Apple to create wide acceptance for what the success of Windows 2-in-1s is already achieving: market-wide acceptance of a laptop (or 2-in-1) OS that runs mobile apps. The Windows Store on a Windows 10 desktop has thousands of universal apps that work across various form factors, including mobile. I concede that the success of the Windows Store is not on par with Microsoft's goals. Moreover, the implementation of a Windows-based smartphone has not met commercial success. Consequently, though there are thousands of universal apps that are compatible beyond the mobility of a laptop or 2-in-1 form factor, and that work on a phone, the number is dwarfed by the number of iOS apps in the App Store. So yes, the popularity of iOS apps, if somehow made to work as efficiently in a mouse-and-keyboard laptop form factor, would produce more of a "conscious" decision by consumers to seek out or inquire about such a device. These consumers may be motivated by a desire to use the mobile apps they're familiar with from their iPhones, on a laptop-like device. PC consumers are likely not motivated by an opportunity to experience Store apps. By contrast, the universal apps that are part of Microsoft's proliferating "evolving PC" vision and that are also available to users who buy Windows 10 2-in-1s and laptops are in many cases likely just "along for the ride." Candidly speaking, these user purchases are likely less motivated by the opportunity to experience universal apps and their benefits than by the productivity legacy of Window PCs, even as manifest in modern touch-enabled laptops and 2-in-1s. The Windows Store's underperformance is likely one of the motivating factors in Microsoft's increasingly aggressive advertising efforts in Windows 10. It needs to get users that have embraced the new OS and evolving PC form-factors to also embrace the ecosystem that they exist within. Apple, with the popularity of iOS apps, but the lack of a truly universal platform akin to the UWP, and the efficient productivity environment that Windows 10 PCs bring mobile apps, would have the exact opposite challenge. Microsoft's impact on PC evolution is both deep and broad Ultimately, I agree with Mossberg's conclusion from a consumer perspective. That is, if Microsoft cannot draw developers and consumers to its modern app ecosystem, Apple may be more successful in drawing consumer "attention" to the concept of a mobile-app-focused laptop. That's if Apple invests in and successfully creates an iOS-based laptop, which the famously secretive company has made no indication of doing. I do, however, believe that Mossberg may be underestimating the industry impact Microsoft's Windows 10 and UWP has had, and is currently having, on the evolution of the PC, in the form of touch-sensitive laptops, 2-in-1s and other devices like HoloLens that run universal apps. Mossberg may be underestimating Microsoft's impact on the PC's evolution. OEM's, consumers, businesses, and various industries have greatly embraced these "modern," evolved PCs. As Microsoft's partners begin bringing ARM-based cellular PCs to market in several months, that impact will be even more evident than it is now. In truth, Apple's mimicry of the Surface with the iPad Pro is indicative of its reactive, or follower's role, in the PC's evolution. The evolution is well underway. Microsoft is driving it, and its plan goes even further than Mossberg's vision of mobile apps on a laptop form factor.

I'm oldschool enough to remember that once, Bill Gates thought that the future for MS was entertainment content! I also agree that MS will define the future of PC computing for some time to come. Apple, by contrast, went the route of non-stop upgrades and rollouts for the generations they assume will always have no issue paying $500 plus for a fancy communications device, every year. Their hardware vision is pure marketing. Meanwhile, as fun as it is, the world has changed, security wise, and now not even Apple owners are safe from hackers and virus infections. In addition, inb my mind, the continuing safe state of Cloud Computing remains viable as long as the servers can keep moving constantly to avoid detection. I still prefer to store my own data on a local drive. I can secure it myself, and shut it down overnight, etc. But then, I come out of a DIY culture and distrust anything I can't take-apart, fix and reassemble. I've built our home and business systems since the i286, and appreciate the more affordable, egalitarian approach to operating systems and hardware design that MS has given the PC World. MS has had several misfires, like most companies, but they manage to rise again, as have some of the underdog hardware manufacturers like AMD (my own preferred processor, BTW...). I think Windows will be running on all kinds of machines for a long time to come. 0 4 days ago Reply VITNE Maybe Microsoft needs to stop calling them apps and go back to calling them programs. Before iPhone, I never heard anyone say "I just got this new computer app." It was always the word "program." It may seem silly, but "app" sounds mobile and weak and "program" sounds powerful. Maybe call the Windows Store the "Windows Software Store" "app" became the buzzword after iPhone took off. Now everyone associates apps with mobile. Seeing as how MS is marrying the mobile side and desktop side with things like Continuum, maybe they need to think about word associations and the mentality behind them. Maybe just switching to the terms "software" and "program" will put the power of Windows back in people's minds, regardless of form factor. 2 4 days ago Reply ED the new guy The genie is out of the bottle. People have tasted a world not dominated by Microsoft and it's working for them. Microsoft missed the boat when they failed to challenge Chrome on the desktop and iOS and then Android in the mobile device sphere. These two operating systems have wrested a whole generation away from Microsoft's sphere of influence. Chrome's success with HTML 5 on the desktop has allowed a whole generation to become platform agnostic. And, it's also taken a substantial chunk out of previous generations. Web services are where the <30 crowd is at, and, the operating system that gives access to those services is irrelevant. You can just as easily run Chrome on a stripped down single purpose Linux OS as you can on a full blown Windows OS and still get 100% of the experience. You can easily switch between Mac OS X, Windows, Android and iOS because the experience is mediated by HTML 5! PS App is the new program. I now on the verge of needing bifocals and I have a hard time keeping app and program straight. People who aren't techies don't know the difference. To them an app is a program. Besides, app is a good short form for application. To me application is program that the user uses to perform tasks. A program is simply a piece of compiled code. It could be part of the OS or part of an application but does not in and of itself directly useful to the user. 0 4 days ago Reply md2boys This is all great, but lets get on with it.  I have been waiting for a new Microsoft Mobile device for some time now.  The HP is nice, but I'd like ot see the new Surface mobile I keep reading about.  What's taking so long, my Nokia 1520 is getting old and needs to be replaced!!! 0 4 days ago Reply Tom French2 With 10 still in a flux state improving with every update it is only a matter of time before the store apps will improve.  Right now the consumer drives the iOS and Android platforms in the mobile environment but when mobile in Windows is fully implemented then it may not completely catch up but I believe will gain some ground on the others.  They too are now being forced to rethink what they are doing because of Microsoft and Windows 10.  While what they have is nice to use I still don't like the appearance of their start screens or the lack of flexibility they do not have that Windows does in mobile.  If Satya had been in charge of Microsoft 2 years earlier we would be talking a much different mobile platform already.  The mobile platform would be a much larger share of the market than it is now.  0 4 days ago Reply AgentTheGreat "A matter of time"...yes.

It's why they emphasized hardware accessories with the iPad Pro and not so much the software. Google lacks the focus to lead this, imo.

Whether it's TV, tech sites, or companies who make money evaluating the tech industry, they all act like Apple is dominating everything.

Just because they are worth a fortune due to using older, lesser technology while charging more for it, doesn't mean they are dominating. It just means they are making their investors happy. Secondly, Apple was never innovative and neither was Steve Jobs. They have never invented anything, they never created a "new" product. They have always taken an existing product and made it look better and usually work better. That's great but it doesn't make you innovative. And Steve Jobs wasn't anything he has been made out to be. He was an ass, a selfish jerk. He was a guy who screwed over old partners, who refused to acknowledge his own daughter was his for years. He was a guy didn't want apps on the iPhone and almost shut down the whole iPad project because ge didn't like the tone of white they were using.

So very Americentric. -1 5 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi I think I agree with your assertion about Microsoft driving the evolution of the PC. It is a fact that Apple (and later Google with Android) broadened the scope, experience and market for personal computing. For some reason, I keep feeling like Microsoft's adherence to a Enterprise-first consumer base keeps limiting them from developing truly consumer-wowing (and consistent) user experiences: E.g. 1: Teams is an awesome product but they lock it within the enterprise (i.e. O365) ensuring that few outside of the 85 million (?) O365 users would ever go for it (so Slack slurps the "outcasts" up), making Teams seems more like a defensive move against Slack encroaching on existing (and future?) O365 users rather than a superior take. If it were a free/low-cost non-O365 (at first) tool, Teams could probably be used to draw people into the main ecosystem (see all the cool things you can get it to do with O365). E.g. 2: Windows 8/10 and the UI/UX confusions and inconsistencies (till date). Windows 10 (with a UI refresh) is good for desktop, but tablet and mobile are lighter and should have lighter UI. Touch-enabled Win 10 is not necessarily good enough as a tablet-only UI (especially in the 7-9" range). Legacy (business) makes them shoehorn different UI paradigms together, limiting the power of the Live Tile to evolve and show its superiority to other UI/UX paradigms). It's not whoever has the best designed product or innovation, it's whoever sells and blasts the goodness and uniqueness of their product early enough (and says they did it first and best) that gets noticed. Microsoft must point out the new innovations they bring to the market first. Not just to tech press but the general public. Look at the new HP ads with Christian Slater! Look at the responses. Relevant and good publicity (and that's just for printers). Microsoft will always attract only the work-related perception from consumers and the tech press as long as it always sells itself only on "productivity" (=business). That is why I like the focus on "Creativity" (a la Creative Update, etc.). I think it should be more than a one-off update name but rather a modern ethos (a sort of Productivity 2.0?) for Microsoft. The Creative Lifestyle. Maybe two marketing identities for business (productive) and consumers (creative)? 0 5 days ago Reply Asc aris Windows 8/10 and the UI/UX confusions and inconsistencies (till date). Windows 10 (with a UI refresh) is good for desktop, but tablet and mobile are lighter and should have lighter UI. Touch-enabled Win 10 is not necessarily good enough as a tablet-only UI (especially in the 7-9" range). So Windows 10 needs a UI refresh to be good for desktop, and is not well suited to mobile either in its current form.  If that is what you're saying, I agree completely.  What it looks like is that MS has designed "one UI to rule them all" that is equally mediocre on both of the platforms it's supposed to cover.  It seems that a lot of the excitement over this isn't about the product as delivered, but is instead about the promise of what it might deliver in the future once the rough spots are smoothed out.  Unfortunately, though, I think that the rough spots are not merely a function of as-yet incomplete development so much as a structural issue that has to do with the very nature of generalization vs. specialization.  The better MS makes Windows 10 for tablets (and phones even more so), the worse it ends up being for the desktop.  They can move that slider to an infinite number of positions along the "continuum"  between mobile and desktop platforms, but favoring one will always mean hampering the other, and that's not just an issue of polish or fine-tuning.   Ultimately, it all boils down to yet another proof of the "Jack of all trades, master of none" trope.  Mobile devices and traditional PCs have differing needs, and when you try to write one UI that covers both, it's just not going to work as well on either of them as a dedicated UI for that platform-- and since we do have examples of that on desktops (Windows 7, MacOS) and mobiles (Android, iOS), the bar is going to be set as high as the perceived quality and fitness of each dedicated UI.  Windows 10 falls far short of what desktop users have had for many years in terms of a polished, consistent, and visually coherent UI.  It still feels confused about whether it wants to be a phone or a PC. If MS insists on going down this road, the only way I can really see it working is to have two complete UIs within Windows, and to select the one that is most appropriate according to circumstance and user preferences.  Desktop PCs and traditional laptops would have the desktop UI, same as Windows always has, while mobiles would get the UWP UI.  Each UI would be feature-complete by itself and optimized for its platform, so there would never be any need to muddle through on a bit of the OS that was designed for a platform other than the one then in use.  Convertible/2 in 1 devices could default to the desktop UI when in laptop mode, and to the UWP UI when the keyboard/base is removed.  The user, ideally, would be able to change these settings to suit his needs better, since one size rarely (if ever) fits all. When you look at it in those terms, it doesn't seem all that innovative anymore (to me at least).  Including two complete UIs for two separate platforms, running on two different sets of binaries (x86 and ARM, of course) that happen to have been compiled from similar/the same source code sounds a lot like writing two distinct (though closely related) operating systems for two distinct platforms, then slapping the same name on each and caling it one product.  It may not be as "gee whiz" cool in its implementation, but it would allow a no-compromise UI for each platform, and I don't think users will (or should have to) accept anything less than that.   0 2 days ago Reply Bai So we go a full cycle and back to RT?  C-shell seriously don't matter to most.  Cellar PC, a fancy name of smartphone.  When was the last time you use a use a x86 program for personal use?  Me photo editing is the only x86 I still use, and that I don't want/care about ARM and battery life because no battery will last a few hundred RAW convertion.  I either have it plug in all the way or do it on my PC.  For office use, why do I want a ARM laptop 2-1 or whatever when I can have my x86 CRM on a regular laptop?  Or I can remote it from any Android/IOS/WP/PC.  Wake me up when adobe/sales force/auto cad...etc make a ARM UWP.  For productivity cloud is the future and cloud don't care what the front end is, it could be ios/android/wp it don't matter.  There are companies that send cad project to hosting company to render and cut the time in 1/2.  There are online RAW converter alreadyInot a very good one).  Continuum make a alot of sense, and I don't need a full feature win10 fo it. 0 5 days ago Reply LIEBER I'm interested in the possibility of running Windows 10 Pro on ARM processors. Will it be possible to run *all* Win32 bit applications on ARM 835 processor, in emulation mode? How does this relate to HP Elite X3 and the possibility to run ordinary applications on a HP server? An alternative approach... is to use an "old fashioned" solution. 30 years ago, it was possible to run X Windows terminals and remotely log in via a network. A modern solution could be: * MS includes a Windows terminal program (similar to Teamviewer, etc.) as part of Windows 10 * It should be possible to remotely log into another Windows machine via internet or via 4G/5G phone networks; it must be possible to reach through routers, firewalls, etc. * Assuming I have a desktop computer, job work station, home media computer, etc., and that I have all the 32 bit or 64 bit applications I need on these, it should be possible to log in from ARM based (and intel based) smartphones, tablets, laptops, or in principle any type of computer ("terminal machine"), and run the programs on my desktop, workstation, media computer, etc. ("server machine") -- remotely * The "terminal window" should mirror the desktop on the "server" computer. * If I have two screens on my "terminal" PC, it should be possible to run the terminal window on one screen, and run other programs on any screen. * It should be possible to cut and paste between the "terminal" PC and the terminal window of the "server". * If both "terminal" PC and the "server" PC sync files via OneDrive (or DropBox, or whatever), this gives transparent exchange of files. But copy and pasting may still be useful. OK... personally, I'm a little skeptical about completely depending on running programs on a remote computer -- what if internet is down (or the connection is slow), or what if there are expensive roaming fees on 4G/5G? So I certainly see the usefulness of running 32 bit (and if possible, 64 bit) applications on the smartphone/tablet/etc. (ARM processor, etc.), but a modern "terminal" program will make it possible to, in practice, run 32 bit and 64 bit programs on relatively light weight ARM processor based units. The main problem with this approach is with small screen devices such as smartphones: I'm not sure the user experience will be good with running *applications* on a small screen -- maybe a foldable screen device may make it possible to fold out a decent screen? UWP apps is something else -- they are designed to adapt to various screen sizes. 0 5 days ago Reply L0n3N1nja IPad apps as they currently are on a laptop? I don't see that ever going anywhere.

In the public mindspace, Windows is still a desktop OS - when they want a mobile it's Android or iOS. Part of this is Microsoft's failed "Continuum" strategy in their UI - it's still the exact same UI not matter what device you're on. This is a problem because ​people don't want a desktop/start menu on their mobile device​. This is something Microsoft hasn't learned since the days of Windows CE. Windows 8 was a good start, but failed because the "Desktop Mode" should have been more Windows 10 and Windows 10 fails the tablet/moble users because it needs to be more Windows 8. The idea is a great one, they NEED to figure out that "Desktop UI" is NOT the same as "Tablet UI" is not the same as "Phone UI" (though Tablet UI and Phone UI should be much closer to each other than Desktop UI).

Which of those two companies has behaved more like that in the past three years? This doesn't mean Microsoft will triumph over Apple (I've never bought into the fanboy view that for Apple to win, Microsoft must lose or vice versa.) because failure to spot the next disruption or a new opportunity can happen to any company, and it has happened to Microsoft before.

Love or hate Apple, you need to thank them what they did in the market. They opened it up to more of a smart device from what were using. If you wanted a SMART device, you  had a Windows Mobile/PocketPC (a pocket Windows version with the bugs) or Blackberry. Apple came with a store, and the format Microsoft has always dreamed of.  Maybe Microsoft would of came up with it but, they were 5 years too late and by then, they lost. I can go deeper into this but, Microsoft is not doing anything besides making Windows compatable with current SMALLER devices. Nothing new, just a smaller package.   -6 5 days ago Reply HenriqueNL This is all very nice and I agree with most of the article, but if Microsoft doesn't advertise what the Windows 10 vision is and how it works on several form factors, people will never realize all the positives laid out in this article. That is why time and time again, Apple or Google (through Samsung in the majority of cases) will always be heralded as the companies that "invented" features Microsoft already had before. When was the last time you saw a Microsoft ad showcasing Windows 10? I'm not talking about PC/Surface ads, but what Microsoft is doing with and for Windows 10. A 30 second ad of Windows on different form factors (including phone) would start to make people look and think more closely to Microsoft and maybe call out certain tech sites when they start babbling about how great feature x or y is on iOS or Android. The rare Microsoft ads I see in the UK on television are for the Cloud. I know professionals also watch TV but it doesn't showcase anything "useful" for the regular Joe. And it's not like Microsoft doesn't have some good hardware/form factors to show off: Xbox One, HoloLens, Elite X3, Surface Pro/Book. If people knew all of the above run Windows 10 (and not necessarily version x86/64, Mobile, etc) then maybe people (consumers and developers) can see one of the advantages of UWP and build/port more apps and services over. All of this of course won't mean anything if Microsoft doesn't push harder to improve the OS as a whole, instead of spending resources in helping out other platforms with apps containing more features. 6 5 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi You said it all! 1 5 days ago Reply sdreamer Totally agree MS is pushing the tech arena lately, but is getting almost 0 credit. We can see how Apple and Google reacted to the Surface Pro line with their own Pro lines. You can also see some new AR headsets that seem to suddenly pop after the hololens was released. MS is really pushing hard for new things, but the market just doesn't see them anymore sadly. Then their lack of consistent support, and quality of support in some cases  really does not help. Apple really has a solid foundation right now, and many draw comparison to MS back then, but the key difference is users like Apple vs back then it was the cool thing to poke at MS. Apple too is too big to fail, but even if they start to, they are so well liked that it's almost impossible to really topple; maybe stumble, but not fall face first. I just wish MS was consistent, delivered the hardward they envisioned. I'd still be on a WP if they probably had the hardware, but they don't right now, and the company that offers the most consistent experience for productivity for me right now is Apple, and I've slowly transitioned to them but still using MS services as a backbone, and that works just great. 2 5 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi I agree that MS has not always executed well enough the first time out, even when they had the lead.

There's no denying the impact Apple has had in shifting personal computing from a sedentary setting to a mobile landscape. That shift has mad mobile ecosystems and apps very important. The need for a the desktop productivity environment has not been eliminated, however. The move of the mobile landscape to the desktop environment is what we are seeing happenng. It is also what Mossberg has argued will be a massive shift as ARM processors come on laptop form factors and IF iOS also comes to that form factor. He argues that Apple will have the greatest impact in refining the PC. I argue that Microsoft, with Windows 10, the UWP and Continuum has already done, and is driving that evolution. PC makers and consumers have embraced Microsoft's PC vision. Apple is following. It is true however that most PC users are not using the Store apps, which if they are full UWP apps, are by nature also mobile apps. This is where Apple, with iOS on laptop may conciously win users to a laptop with a mobile app focus. So what do you think.

Microsoft's attempts are most of the time half-hearted and incomplete. Take WP for example. How long did we scream about updates for simple things the competition had for years? It wasn't too hard to create a decent music player on WP8.1. Now look at the Windows 10 built-in Store apps. Almost all of them seem incomplete, lacking clear design guidelines and crashing as if interns are responsible for creating the most important part of Microsoft's future. For all their "expertise" in creating software, Microsoft lacks skill in creating almost any form of software related to mobile - Windows 10 Mobile being the prime example. (I don't believe it deseves to be WP 8.1's successor in any way). The Tablet Mode on Windows 10 SUCKS. Watching a video in Tablet Mode, double click on the video and watch is the window visibly resizes to smaller size and then goes back o full screen, indicaing sloppy coding. Closeing some Win32 windows in tablet mode results in a blank screen where you can't do anything, instead of going back to the Start screen. The whole thing is incomplete, and second grade software like this will NOT challenge Apple in the long run. When Microsoft themselves decided the Windws Explorer in full screen is good enough to take care of file management even in Tablet Mode, why would anyone decide to create UWP apps for tablets and limit themselves framework-wise when they can create Win32 and target all Windows versions? This whole strategy is all patch work and will not hold up against a proper attack from either Apple or Google targeting the desktop. 6 5 days ago Reply Liam Ke Yes. 0 3 days ago Reply wpbazaar Nup.

Microsoft keeps moving the development model/sdk/api/tooling landscape.

Besides if you plan to make an app that you can't finish in a few month, you can't reserve the name in advance, since it is only protected one year. That my be one of the problem that so many not quite finished apps hit the store. The developer has to published finished or not befor one year. And when it is published and don't be a hit (maybe because it not really finished), then the developer looses intrest in it. Not all can afford to quit they job to work fulltime on an app. For most of us it a parttime thing. One thing I really miss when working with XAML is the ability to use % just as we do in HTML.

I did look at alternatives for things like mocking for unit tests, but they were either rather expensive commercial products, or, in the case of the mocking frameworks, the free components that were able to get around the "reflection emit" issue were, for me, simply inadequate. While some breaking changes are to be expected in making a change like migrating from "classic" .Net to UWP, if Microsoft really want all Windows developers to embrace the "new way of doing things" then expecting them to throw away significant portions of their existing core code because it was designed to work with components that don't (or can't) support UWP is going to deincentivise the case for bothering with a UWP version.  Though many of these components aren't under the direct control of Microsoft, and who knows why many of them haven't been upgraded to .Net Standard, for example, it wouldn't hurt for Microsoft to "encourage" them to be upgraded to help boost the case for UWP app development.  Besides, at a personal level, I don't really care if Microsoft or someone else made a particular component I use in my applications: if I can't get it to work in a UWP application then I'm more likely to conclude that UWP is way too much hassle and I'd be better off sticking to "classic" .Net (and yes, I am aware of the Centennial app bridge). 1 5 days ago Reply AgentTheGreat But honestly, what is the point of developing UWP instead of, say, WPF with "classic" .NET? We hear a lot of "it runs on phones, XBOX, HoloLens" etc. but Windows phones are nowhere to be found, XBOX is a gaming console and HoloLens is simply vaporware. You'd trade a rich set of tried and true APIs and Frameworks for...what exactly? BTW HoloLens reminds me of the original "Surface table" that excited lots of people (myself included) just to go into oblivion. Microsoft has a "vision" always in words. If you've seen any push in the direction of this vision, show me. All I've seen so far is trading of truely powerful sofware for their weak counterparts - like Windows Media Player with the "mobile" Groove Music and WP8 with W10M. By the time HoloLens gets up and running (if it ever does) the competition is very likely to get there with something of their own, and they are in the right place too: imagine an Android augmented reality headset that runs apps just like HoloLens does;  Augmented reality isn't really for content creation but mostly entertainment and collaboration and these categories are a good fit for mobile apps instead of something like Photoshop. So Google and Apple can pretty easiy release HoloLens-esque headsets and jump in the game. I'm sorry. But it seems to me that with all this fumbling of ideas Microsoft puts them on the path to oblivion in the consumer space. 3 4 days ago Reply Random DS If I buy a mini PC, hook it up to my TV, connect an IR airmouse, and enable tablet mode (because having multiple windows on your TV is pointless 99% of the time), does it still count as a desktop?

If I want to argue the other way around: the iPhone was just an iPod with technology "stolen" from the likes of Nokia to make it a phone. So this line of reasoning is invalid and Surface IS redefining the PC with sales of laptops dropping and hybrids gaining ground. Again, it was about living off a legacy.

I'm holding out hope for the Surface phone lol. 0 5 days ago Reply Robin Capper The problem with UWP is, although technically universal, it isn't universal. Even Microsoft won't sell me a decent Windows Phone these days so the mobile, primary, platform is missing. Posted from an Android S7 because I dropped my 950XL and could not replace it... 1 4 days ago Reply Tommy Sebestyen My only problem with the UWP apps is that most of the ones that are meaningful to most general users (i.e. Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, Instagram) are either clunky and not coded well, not maintained, missing from the Store entirely, or lacking basic functionality that the iOS, Android, or web apps have.  This is the biggest reason why people don't use UWP apps.  If the apps on the Store that mattered were made well, then maybe more people would use them.  The potential is massive, but devs don't use it. 0 4 days ago Reply Tommy Sebestyen For example, I usually keep the Facebook Messenger website open.  For about a week I tried to use the Messenger UWP app.  It disconnected my Bluetooth, took 5 minutes to load after being minimized, and lacked a button for entering normal emojis, forcing me to open the Windows touch keyboard to enter emojis.  It also doesn't have a reply box in the notification, which is obviously possible *cough* Skype Preview *cough* and (I think) is there in Android 7.0.  It isn't optimized for a large display at all, either.  Comparing the website with the app, I found I'd rather have to refresh the website if I lose my Internet connection than wait 5 minutes for an app to load my messages. 0 4 days ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

The policy yet to be reflected on Apple.com – but which the folks at MacRumors have been able to confirm with a senior AppleCare advisor, will see those who purchase an iPhone from the company given up to a year from the date of their purchase to add AppleCare+ protection. That’s up significanly from the usual 60 days. “Notably, the change is retro-active so if you purchased an iPhone within the last year, you are now eligible to get AppleCare+,” iClarified adds. The new policy will reportedly also be applied to Mac and Apple TV purchases – too. AppleCare+ for iPhone costs $129 in the U.S and provides up to two years of expert telephone technical support and hardware coverage, including up to two incidents of accidental damage, each subject to an excess fee of $29 for screen damage, or $99 for any other damage. In addition, you’ll get 24/7 priority access to Apple experts by either chat or phone. Learn more about AppleCare+ for iPhone. Continue Reading You may also like...

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Mar 17, 2017 at 8:43PM At least at some level, investing can be a lot like a spy novel. A narrative might appear one way at first only to change as new details emerge; things are rarely exactly as they first seem. This idea certainly holds true in comparing tech companies Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Corning (NYSE:GLW). Trading at roughly half of Apple's valuation, the superficial numbers would suggest that Corning is clearly the better buy. However, for the three reasons you will see below, the numbers alone fail to tell the entire story. Here's why Apple is a better value stock to buy today than Corning. 1. Corning isn't as cheap as it looks The sheer cheapness of its stock jumps out immediately when looking at Corning. At a time when the S&P 500 trades at roughly 26 times earnings -- admittedly well above its own historic norms -- Corning stock currently trades hands at a minuscule 8.5 times earnings. However, this also contains an important investing lesson: Stocks tend to trade at such seemingly preposterous discounts for a reason. Case in point: Corning booked a $2.6 billion gain on the revaluation of one of its equity investments during its fiscal 2016, which inflated its pre-tax income by roughly 190% on the year. With its earnings per share (EPS) expect to grow at 8% this year, Corning's 15.3 forward P/E ratio serves as a far better indicator of the company's actual valuation than its current P/E. Again, the alarm bells should go off any time you see the shares of a healthy company like Corning trading at so seemingly cheap a valuation. Corning isn't nearly as cheap as it appears at first glance. Image source: Apple. 2. Apple is cheaper than it looks Just as Corning isn't as cheap as it looks, the value of Apple's core operating business is actually far lower than its P/E suggests. The underlying reason is fairly well documented at this point; Apple's net cash surplus totaled $158.6 billion in its most recent quarterly filing. Subtracting this staggering figure from Apple's market capitalization reduces its valuation to $570.6 billion.  Using this net-cash-adjusted market cap as the numerator to Apple's P/E ratio provides an updated valuation for the Mac maker of just 12.6 times earnings, which is significantly lower than Corning's valuation metric after removing the effect of the one-time accounting gains it recorded this year. Seen this way, Apple actually offers investors better value, though this line of reasoning does little to factor in either company's growth outlook. However, the investment thesis turns even more in Apple's favor upon adding in the companies' long-term return profiles. 3. Apple's growth outlook beats Corning's Not to belabor the point, but comparing Apple's forward growth rates against those of Corning supports the same conclusion. Looking to the top line, consensus Wall Street estimates call for Apple to increase its sales by 5.9% this year and 7.5% next year. Meanwhile, Corning is expected to see its sales rise 3.4% in 2016 and 1.2% in 2017. The same relationship -- Apple slightly outgrowing Corning -- also applies to sell-side estimates for the two companies' earnings per share. Much of this is likely attributable to Apple's expected debut of a fully redesigned 10th anniversary iPhone this fall. Corning, of course, will benefit from Apple's latest iPhone as a component supplier for the handset. However, Apple will certainly benefit far more from the highly anticipated device. Beyond sales and earnings growth, Apple's gigantic -- and growing -- cash surplus gives the company far more flexibility to enhance overall shareholder returns through increased dividends and buybacks. The company can also invest heavily in future growth initiatives like electric cars or digital streaming content without affecting its current earnings outlook. At the end of the day, although Corning is no slouch in its own right, Apple is clearly the better value stock between the two companies. Andrew Tonner owns shares of Apple.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software tvOS 10.2 Beta 6 & watchOS 3.2 Beta 6 Now Available By Uzair Ghani Mar 14, 2017 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Hot on the heels of yesterday’s release, Apple has seeded tvOS 10.2 Beta 6 and watchOS 3.2 Beta 6 to developers for download. Apple Watch and Apple TV Developers Can Now Download the Latest Pre-Release Software For their Devices Apple released iOS 10.3 Beta 6 and macOS 10.12.4 Beta 6 just yesterday, and today Apple is pushing its efforts forward with the release of tvOS 10.2 Beta 6 and watchOS 3.2 Beta 6. All of the aforementioned software is available to download over the air. And since we have covered iOS 10.3 and macOS 10.12.4 beta builds yesterday, therefore we will focus on just tvOS 10.2 and watchOS 3.2 today. Related Apple Releases watchOS 3.2 Beta 7 & macOS 10.12.4 Beta 8 Assuming you have a previous beta of watchOS 3.2 already installed on your Apple Watch, launch the Watch app on your iPhone. Now place your Apple Watch on its magnetic charger. Navigate to General > Software Updates inside the Watch app and then tap on Download and Install once the latest update pops up. The entire process may take quite a while given the installation process happens over Bluetooth. Therefore please do not remove your wearable from its charger at any point during the installation. Advertisement Apple TV users can update to tvOS 10.2 Beta 6 in a breeze too. Just turn on your device, navigate to Settings > System > Software Updates and install the available update there. Just like the Apple Watch, make sure you do not do anything funny with your Apple TV during the entire process. Once everything is done and dusted, you may use your set top box as you normally would. Given the fact that we are sitting on the sixth beta release of Apple’s software across the board, it’s highly likely the final release is just a few days away. It’s best to prepare all your devices beforehand and make room for the update so that things move smoothly for you when the big download day arrives. tvOS 10.2 Beta 6 and watchOS 3.2 Beta 6 brings with them nothing more than bug fixes and performance related patches therefore do not expect something huge. If there is a worthy feature addition or change packed in this release, we will highlight in a separate post, so stay tuned for more. Related iOS 10.3 Beta 5, watchOS 3.2 Beta 5 & tvOS 10.2 Beta 5 Released Whether you are a developer or not, go ahead and update your software immediately.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Concept Imagines How AR & Siri Would Work Together on iPhone 8 By Uzair Ghani Mar 14, 2017 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Wondering how Apple might utilize augmented reality on the iPhone 8? A new concept render gives us a good glimpse into the future. New iPhone 8 Concept Imagines Device With Siri & AR Features Given Apple’s recent acquisitions, and statements made by Tim Cook, there’s no doubt left in the fact that the company is pretty serious about AR. Recent reports also suggest that the iPhone 8 would be the first device to implement AR related features, but it’s unclear how the entire package will pan out. One designer, however, took things into his own hand and conjured up a concept showing augmented reality and Siri working together to form a match that can only be described as a far-fetched dream right now. Related Apple’s ‘Teardrop’ Design For The iPhone 8 Will Resemble The iPhone 2G Claim Korean Sources Created by Gabor Balogh, the designer imagines a wonderful AR experience that begins straight from the home screen itself. Once Siri is all fired up, the background turns into a live view of the world ahead of you, with the assistant all set to interact with the device as well as the objects around it. You can then ask Siri questions like ‘What’s that building?’ or even get walking direction, with the path being outlined in real-time on the display. Advertisement The real world is not hidden by the device anymore. If raised, the environment is visible in the background of the home screen in a semi-transparent way, indicating that you can unveil it by pressing the digital Home button. Same way as now, but Siri would be present in augmented reality… Siri would now not only listen you, but would see the world. It would recognize objects, know where you are, what your activity is and what you probably need in that moment. The designer even went ahead in implementing a digital Home button much like how other concept designers have in their mockups. It’s a neat little touch and gives the smartphone a unique personality, putting focus on a ginormous display rather than the bezels that are doing nothing except eating up space. Related iPhone 8 Could Come With a Boatload of AR Features, According to Latest Report Augmented reality is going to be interesting in a lot of ways, but it remains to be seen how things will pan out once it is launched, if at all. If Apple is so confident in the technology, then it seems likely that the company has figured out something which no one else has thus far. We will wait and see what it is.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Security Apple Hires Jonathan Zdziarski – Popular iOS Security Researcher and Forensics Expert By Rafia Shaikh Mar 14, 2017 11Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple has hired Jonathan Zdziarski, a popular forensics expert and security researcher who has been long involved in the iOS security and jailbreaking community. Apple hires Jonathan Zdziarski The tech industry isn’t intrigued – and worried – about anything as much as it is about cybersecurity at the moment. With massive breaches taking down the biggest tech companies of the world and DDoS attacks, making it impossible for an entire country to connect to the internet, it is not a surprise that tech leaders are also trying to improve their bug bounty programs and hire the best talent. Related Apple’s Online Store Will Be Unavailable Tomorrow Due To ‘Maintenance’ While the latest WikiLeaks release may have only dumped vulnerabilities that were already taken care of, it made it clear that it’s the device makers who will now have to take charge of security. With iOS and Android devices being vulnerable to attacks, services such as Signal or Telegram have no chance of offering true end-to-end encrypted communications to users. Advertisement In the latest news, iPhone forensics consult and security researcher Jonathan Zdziarski announced that he has accepted a position with Apple Security Engineering and Architecture team. Zdziarski was one of the most vocal iOS security researchers during the Apple-FBI battle over encryption last year. Zdziarski posted about his new role at Apple earlier today. He hasn’t yet revealed details about his responsibilities at the company or his official starting date. I’m pleased to announce that I’ve accepted a position with Apple’s Security Engineering and Architecture team, and am very excited to be working with a group of like minded individuals so passionate about protecting the security and privacy of others. Related Apple Pledges Two More R&D Centers Investing Over Half a Billion Dollars in China This decision marks the conclusion of what I feel has been a matter of conscience for me over time. Privacy is sacred; our digital lives can reveal so much about us – our interests, our deepest thoughts, and even who we love. I am thrilled to be working with such an exceptional group of people who share a passion to protect that. Those who have been following iOS security news would recognize Zdziarski from a number of stories, including Apple’s high-profile “argument” with the FBI over unlocking an iPhone.
