Is Not Releasing the iPhone 8 Early Reports suggest that Apple is ramping iPhone 8 production earlier than usual By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Feb 10, 2017, 6:10 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Report: Apple Inc. iPhone 8 Could Cost More Than $1,000 (AAPL) Amazon.com, Inc.

Is Not Releasing the iPhone 8 Early Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Finally Fires Back at Apple With Android Wear 2.0 View All Posts A report began circulating several days ago that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) may start production of the iPhone 8 early. Typically, when a company starts manufacturing sooner than usual, that points to an accelerated release date for a new product. Source: Apple In this case, it seems unlikely the move will result in an iPhone release date before Apple’s standard September launch. If not to get it on shelves sooner, why would the company want to get an early start on new iPhone production? The iPhone 8 Early Production Ramp Up Apple has a pretty standard roadmap when it comes to new iPhone releases. With a late September iPhone release date, the company starts to ramp up production of the new model in late summer. However, this year it looks as though Apple may be breaking with tradition. According to a report from BlueFin Research Partners, there are indicators in the company’s supply chain that point to an unusually early production ramp up for the iPhone 8. Quoted in MSN Money, the BlueFin report notes: “The most intriguing data points that we have uncovered suggests that Apple is ramping the next generation iPhones earlier than historical norms.” Why Early Production Won’t Lead to an Earlier iPhone Release Date Before anyone gets too excited about the possibility of an early iPhone 8 release, that scenario is highly unlikely. First, ramping up production in June means Apple will begin having stock of the new iPhones in warehouses by the summer. But no one releases a flagship smartphone during the summer months — that’s a slow time for consumer technology news. People are on vacation and not only would an iPhone announcement not get the coverage Apple expects for its new product launches, with so many people away the line-ups at Apple Stores the company is hoping for wouldn’t happen. An early release would also reduce iPhone 7 sales. Now that production is humming on that model, Apple wouldn’t want to kneecap it by releasing the iPhone 8 early. So Why Would Apple Ramp up iPhone 8 Production Early? It’s become increasingly obvious that companies like Apple are pushing the limits of their supply chain and manufacturing partners with their latest smartphones. The new dual camera system, haptic Home button and other components led to a shortage of some iPhone 7 models at launch. Apple ramped up production in late summer as usual, but these issues caused delays. I preordered an iPhone 7 Plus, but still waited a month after the new iPhones went on sale before mine was available … Next Page   1 2 View All View All   Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, http://investorplace.com/2017/02/apple-inc-releasing-iphone-8-early/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC More on InvestorPlace 7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You Deserve 4 Dow Jones Titans Shooting Higher 3 Japanese Stocks That Will Rise 7 Stocks to Buy for the Future of Television How TWTR Fooled the Suckers Again Report: iPhone 8 May Cost More Than $1,000 More on InvestorPlace 7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You Deserve 4 Dow Jones Titans Shooting Higher 3 Japanese Stocks That Will Rise 7 Stocks to Buy for the Future of Television How TWTR Fooled the Suckers Again Report: iPhone 8 May Cost More Than $1,000 More on InvestorPlace 7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You Deserve 4 Dow Jones Titans Shooting Higher 3 Japanese Stocks That Will Rise 7 Stocks to Buy for the Future of Television How TWTR Fooled the Suckers Again Report: iPhone 8 May Cost More Than $1,000 More on InvestorPlace 7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You Deserve 4 Dow Jones Titans Shooting Higher 3 Japanese Stocks That Will Rise 7 Stocks to Buy for the Future of Television How TWTR Fooled the Suckers Again Report: iPhone 8 May Cost More Than $1,000 ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Editor's Picks 7 Dividend Stocks for the Retirement You Deserve 4 Dow Jones Titans That Are Shooting Higher 7 Stocks to Buy for the Future of TV 3 Japanese Stocks That Will Rise on Donald Trump-Shinzo Abe Summit 5 Income Tax Deductions You Can’t Afford to Miss Most Popular 7 Marvelous Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy for the Best of All Worlds 10 Super-Safe Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Today 7 High-Risk, High-Reward Stocks to Buy Now 3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in the Trump Era 5 Income Tax Deductions You Can’t Afford to Miss Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Socks the Shorts With the Model 3 Poll of the Day View and vote in our Will the 'Trump' Stock Market Rally Continue Through 2017? poll Partners ADVERTISEMENT About Us   ·   Press Center   ·   Resources   ·   Advisory Services   ·   Free Newsletters   ·   Free Reports   ·   Contact Us   ·   Advertise With Us   ·   Employment   ·   Privacy   ·   Terms and Conditions   ·   Disclosures and Disclaimers   ·   Media Sites RSS   ·   Sitemap More On InvestorPlace: Choose A Page About Us Press Center Resources Advisory Services Free Newsletters Free Reports Contact Us Advertise With Us Employment Privacy Terms and Conditions Disclosures and Disclaimers Media Sites Sitemap Financial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services, Inc.

Photo / File When Kyle Wiens' Apple laptop stopped working, he wanted to fix it. But there was just one problem. The thing standing in his way was Apple. The company's lawyers had made it as difficult as they could to repair the device by scrubbing the internet of repair information. The experience put Kyle, still a teenager at the time, on a warpath fighting against arguably the biggest scam Apple - and other technology manufacturers - perpetrate against their customers. "I couldn't find any information, and I thought that was kinda ridiculous," he recalled. "Then I decided if they're going to systematically fight having information online maybe I could fight back." That was 2003. From his college dorm room in California he launched a website dedicated to providing the world with repair information for faulty or broken electronics. You can think of it as the Wikipedia of gadget repair, filled with how-to-guides, helpful tips and tool kits for sale. Fast forward to today and iFixit.com is jaw-droppingly popular. Last year, 94 million unique global users visited the site and 3.2 million of them were from Australia. According to the iFixit CEO, now 33, the Apple iPhone is the most frequently searched device on the platform, primarily for consumers seeking battery replacement know-how. "That's because everybody values the device. Nobody throws away an iPhone because the battery is worn out. But Apple leaves such a gaping void in the market," Mr Wiens said. "They don't sell batteries, they don't provide people with any information and so people turn to other channels. "I have an entire team of people who just put batteries in boxes," he told news.com.au. Continued below.

For instance, at the bottom of the iPhone are two proprietary screws that Apple won't sell you the screwdrivers for. Mr Wiens believes consumers should have the right to repair their products, and will be propagating that message when he heads to Australia next month to give talks in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. "If you can't fix it, you don't really own it," he says. Kyle Wiens. Should we have the right to repair our products? Australia has right to repair laws on the books for the car industry after five leading automotive industry bodies signed an agreement in December 2014 paving the way for information sharing. However there is no such mandate for other industries like manufacturers of electronics or farming equipment, where replacement parts and diagnostic tools are often carefully guarded by the manufacturer. That's where iFixit, and other consumer groups, come in. Mr Wiens' company has a secondary website dedicated to its advocacy work promoting the right to repair. The tool kits the company sells on its initial platform help pay for the group to lobby for legislation in markets around the world. So far they have had some major wins in the US. "We have folks working with legislatures everywhere from Brussels to Nebraska trying to solve these issues," Mr Wiens said. They believe getting governments on side is the most effective way to push the cause. In Sweden, for example, consumers are given tax breaks for having their electronics repaired in order to reduce waste. Is planned obsolence real? The short answer is yes. The extent to which it exists today depends on how conspiratorially minded you are. But far from promoting a caricature of greedy companies fleecing their customers, product makers are often bound by imperfect technology, and a majority of times are simply responding to the desires of consumers who want a sleek new device every few years. The terms has its origins in the US light bulb industry in the 1920s when a group of light bulb manufacturers - infamously known as the Phoebus cartel - conspired to prevent technological advances that would have produced longer-lasting light bulbs. For some, today's smartphone is the new light bulb. Screens or buttons break. Operating systems, apps, and so on suddenly can no longer be upgraded. And the lithium batteries in smartphones soon die. In the past Apple has said it expects its iPhone batteries to last an average of 400 charges. "Any time you're taking a battery and gluing it into a product you're building planned obsolescence," Mr Wiens said. "Batteries have a limited life, just like the tyres on your car have a limited life and if a car manufacturer tried to sell a car with tyres you can't replace everybody would laugh at them, but that's exactly what happens with cell phones and laptops these days." An environmental issue The iFixit CEO sees the right to repair as fundamentally an environmental issue, as well as an economic one. "Repair is not seen as a green job but your car mechanic is doing wonderful things for the environment by keeping an existing machine running," he said. The amount of raw material that goes into electronics is staggering so making it easier for people to maintain their gadgets and machines instead of recycling them creates a much more sustainable world.

Consumers are still excited about the thought of an Apple Car, but Apple will probably use its cash for investments in content and other “services.” By Emily Bary Feb. 10, 2017 3:41 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple is sitting on a large pile of cash, but don't expect the company to make a groundbreaking move with it. Illustration: Getty Images Apple has $246 billion in cash sitting around, and investors have lots of ideas about how the company should spend it. Most of them, for now, seem unlikely. A Baird survey of U.S. consumers found that 22% would most like Apple to develop a car within the next five years. This was the top response, followed by a preference for an Apple streaming service that’s like Netflix. Investors have also speculated about the possibility that Apple would use its cash stash to make a big acquisition. Netflix, Tesla, and Disney are discussed from time to time, but Baird analyst William Power says these are unlikely. Unfortunately for Apple dreamers, the company will probably opt to invest money in less flashy areas, like its “Services” business. This includes the App store and Apple Music, but could come to include video content, too. “Though acquisitions might help here, we believe investing organically in content, innovative features, and new services should continue to improve the company’s long-term positioning,” Power wrote in a research note Friday. Investors tend to like when companies branch into services more, because that puts less pressure on annual hardware sales. And that’s key for Apple now that customers are upgrading their iPhones less often or increasingly opting for cheaper, older models when they get a new phone. Another investor-friendly use for the cash that Apple may choose: buying back more stock. Power notes that 94% of Apple’s cash is overseas, so a policy that makes it cheaper for companies to bring that money stateside “could result in a large increase in share buybacks.” A buyback increases earnings per share, since it means that there are fewer shares outstanding. Big Picture: Apple has $246 billion in cash on its balance sheet, but don’t expect the company to make a huge move with it.

Both are likely, although it’s possible sources are misreading Apple’s iris scanner plans. Iris scanning identifies the unique patterns in a person’s iris, much in the same way fingerprint scanning identifies the unique patterns in our finger tips. Those patterns can be used as a form of personal verification without requiring passwords. Iris scanning iPhones? Maybe For Apple, iris scanning will serve the same purpose as Touch ID for authenticating to unlock your iPhone, and possibly for Apple Pay, too. Industry sources spilled the information about the iPhone 8’s new features, according to Digitimes. This follows reports that Apple plans to use OLED screens in the new model, too. Citing supply chain sources is a sometimes dubious venture because piecing together individual parts orders rarely paints a full picture of Apple’s plans. It’s possible the Digitimes sources are on the right track, but focusing in the wrong place. Apple may be looking to facial recognition instead. The Case for Facial Recognition Over Iris Scanning Apple has been buying into facial recognition for years. The company bought Polar Rose in 2010, Faceshift in 2015, and Emotient in 2016. Apple also filed a patent application in 2011 for a facial recognition system that works as a security feature to unlock an encrypted device. The companies Apple snapped up could make technology for real-time facial mapping in games or virtual reality environments, but they could also create a system where our face is our password. Apple also has several years of experience with facial recognition already thanks to Photos on the Mac as well as the iPhone and iPad. It’s not much of a logical leap to go from Photo’s people matching feature to recognizing our faces to unlock our iPhones. Apple does, however, have a trademark for “Iris Engine,” which implies scanning our eye instead of our face. That said, “Iris Engine” sounds a lot sexier than “Face Engine,” regardless of what Apple’s actually scanning—and holding the Iris Engine trademark doesn’t necessarily mean the company is committed to eye scanning. Considering Apple’s multi-year investment in facial recognition it seems plausible that’s the route the company is taking. iPhone Wireless Charging The other part of the Digitimes report says the iPhone 8 will support some form of wireless charging. This isn’t the first time wireless charging has come up as a reported feature for the next iPhone. Apple Watch-style induction charging seems plausible for the next iPhone since it’s already proven effective for the smartwatch. It’s more efficient that contactless charging, and doesn’t require the stringent government approval process that goes along with true contactless charging like WattUp from Energous. Since Apple has plenty of induction charging field testing under its belt thanks to Apple Watch users, that’s most likely the route the company will take.

Angela Reed, of Clydebank, Scotland, is living with cerebral palsy, but says some of Apple's lesser known features, like Handoff and AssistiveTouch, have given her back her freedom. She was recently given a surprise opportunity to thank Apple's CEO Time Cook for the firm's efforts to develop the features - after bumping into the Apple boss in her local Apple Store. Scroll down for video  A majority of people use their iPhone to snap selfies, play games or listen to music - but for one woman, the technology helps her interact with the rest of the world. Angela Reed (right), of Clydebank, Scotland, is living with cerebral palsy, but her iPhone has given her more freedom CEREBRAL PALSY  Cerebral palsy is a life-long affliction. 1,800 children are diagnosed with the condition in the UK every year.  Cerebral palsy affects 1 in 500 newborns.  And there are over 17 million people suffering with the disorder. Visible signs are usually spotted early in a child's life.  One in three children with cerebral palsy is unable to walk.  Common symptoms are muscle weakness, random and uncontrolled body movements, and problems with balance and co-ordination.  Some people with the condition may have communication and learning difficulties.  The more severe the condition, the lower the life expectancy. 'He was so lovely and I had asked the shop assistant to express my thanks to him, Reed told DailyMail.com. 'Even my lights at home are controlled through the WiFi, so I wanted to express that the work they do is making a very real difference to people’s lives.' Cook stopped in at one of Apple's flagship stores in Glasgow city center this week, which is where he met Reed. Once the crowd at the store began to die down, Reed made her way up to Cook to speak with him about her experience with the iPhone. She told the Apple CEO that their smartphone and tablet changed her life and allowed her to do things she never thought would be possible. 'I used to have to write things down, or have people write things down for me,' Reed told DailyMail.com. 'So the iPhone has made life so much easier and given me more freedom.'  Reed uses both her iPhone and iPad to write messages, which allows her to interact with other people - she has a difficulty verbally communicating because of her disability. She also uses a new feature that was made available with iOS 10 that lets users control devices, and helps them perform gestures like a pinch, multi-finger swipe or 3D Touch and use Siri.

'This puts a dot on the screen and it enables me to reach features such as multi-tasking, gestures, volume, lock screen etc. - things that people who struggle with buttons will have difficulty with.'  'I found this by accident, so how many more people don’t know such a valuable tool is there?'  Reed uses both her iPhone and tablet to write messages, which allows her to interact with other people - she has a difficulty verbally communicating because of her disability. She also uses a feature that lets users control devices, and helps them perform gestures like a pinch, multi-finger swipe or 3D Touch and use Siri APPLE'S ASSISTIVE FEATURES AssistiveTouch: Controls devices and helps perform gestures like a pinch, multi-finger swipe, or 3D Touch, and use Siri. It finds and adjusts certain settings on a device like Volume, Rotate Screen, Lock Screen, and more. Switch Control: Lets users swipe between menus, select apps and control the device's screen using just head movements. When the Switch Control feature is enabled, it will scroll through and highlight different onscreen sections - including individual menus and apps. VoiceOver: Gives users auditory descriptions of each onscreen element and provides helpful hints along the way — whether you prefer using gestures, a keyboard or a braille display. Handoff: Lets users start work on one device, then another nearby device and pick up where they left off. 'Handoff is also invaluable, as it allows me to work across the platform, and my notes, reminders follow me from device to device.  'So I can work on an iPad and then that work is on the iMac for me.'  And because she also has limited mobility, these features have had a major impact on her life. 'Our whole emphasis is on the accessibility of our products,' Cook told The Scotsman. 'We design with people with disabilities in mind. 'We think everyone should be able to take advantage of technology. It shouldn't just be for people that are lucky enough not to have disabilities.' Tim Cook stopped in at one of Apple's flagship stores in Glasgow city center this week, which is where he met Reed. Once the crowd at the store began to die down, Reed made her way up to Cook to speak with him about her experience with the iPhone 'I loved meeting Angela, and she shared a message with me on her iPhone. 'It really hit home with me.'   Reed also told DailyMail.com that Apple's partnership with Philips in developing an app to control Philips Hue lights has also made things easier. 'This enables me to turn the lights off when it suits me, not carers,' she said. And Reed also has some ideas of her own for more technology that would help her and others with similar disabilities. She suggests Apple could designate gestures for the Apple Watch that would translate to others what she wants, such as 'I need a drink' or 'where's my book'.   Read more: Apple boss Tim Cook takes inspiration from Scottish student - The Scotsman Share or comment on this article e-mail 51 shares Most watched News videos Danielle Bregoli throws punches while boarding Spirit Airways Cameraman 'zooms in' on woman's breasts in 'see-through' swimsuit Caught on camera: Bystanders watch topless men fighting in street Moment Lindsay Hoyle and Alex Salmond scream at each other Danielle Bregoli discusses fighting a 'crack head' with her mom 'I don't take no s***': Bus driver kicks drunk man off bus Watch Barack Obama wipe out in kite surfing battle McConnell blocks Warren from reading letter from MLK's wife Footage shows hostile environment that Alexander Blackman endured Melissa McCarthy nails screeching Sean Spicer on SNL Danielle went viral after appearing on Dr Phil in 2016 Moment woman pops open her shirt by flexing her boobs Socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, 45, dies at her London...

 The iPhone 8 will likely have wireless charging — but that could make it prone to overheating Kif Leswing Feb. 9, 2017, 1:07 PM 73,545 facebook linkedin twitter email print A fan's concept drawing of the iPhone 8, based on current rumors.YouTube/ConceptsiPhone All three iPhones expected to launch later this year will have wireless charging, according to a new forecast by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Apple is expected to release three new iPhones in the fall — one premium model with a better screen using OLED technology, and two iterative improvements to the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. All three will have glass casing and wireless charging, according to Kuo's note, which was seen by Business Insider. Apple may be concerned that the new iPhones may overheat more than older phones, according to the research. Glass casing and wireless charging are "unfavorable to thermal system operation," Kuo says. From the note: "Adoption of glass casing & wireless charging unfavorable to thermal system operation for three new 2017F iPhone models; bigger impact on OLED model. The thermal system becomes less efficient with glass casing, as compared to metal casing used previously. Furthermore, wireless charging increases handset temperature. "While we don't expect general users to notice any difference, lamination of an additional graphite sheet is needed for better thermal control and, thus, steady operation; this is because FPCB is replaced with film, which is more sensitive to temperature change of the 3D Touch sensor in OLED iPhone." Kuo says the premium phone would have more overheating issues than the other two, and that Apple might have to add an insulating graphite sheet to prevent it from malfunctioning. That sheet and other tech changes could raise the price that Apple pays for the 3D Touch module for the new OLED iPhone by as much as 50%. The research note distributed to clients focuses on some of the parts that Apple buys from suppliers to make its screens and features like 3D Touch work. "We believe OLED iPhone will provide a better 3D Touch user experience on the back of the new design," Kuo wrote. Because of this, Kuo advises clients to expect shares of the Apple suppliers General Interface Solution and TPK Holding Company to outperform. The cost of cutting edge parts may be one reason the premium OLED iPhone could cost over $1,000, according to a recent report. Here's what we're expecting from the iPhone 8: A 5.8-inch OLED screen. Wireless charging. Sides made of "forged stainless steel" and a back made of glass. The home button and fingerprint sensor built into and under an edge-to-edge screen. A double-lens camera, like on the iPhone 7 Plus. New 3D-sensing technology enabling "some form of facial/gesture recognition." A launch date in the fall — likely in September, as usual.

I get it. But somehow I have become The Verge’s resident USB Type-C reporter, and I suspect it’s because I love the little thing, despite its many problems. I love it because of its potential to replace all the different kinds of plugs that are out there. I love it because I can use the same cable to charge my phone (a Pixel XL), my laptop (a MacBook), and many of the random devices I end up reviewing. I also love USB-C because it’s a standard. That means I can charge my laptop from a little spare USB battery pack I keep in my bag. It also means that if I don’t really like Apple’s power brick, I’m free to find and use a better one. I have found a better one. It’s Finsix’s Dart charger. It can provide up to 65W of power — more than enough to charge both a normal MacBook and a phone at the same time. It also is thin and tall instead of squarish, which means when I plug it into a power strip it doesn’t cover up the plugs next to it. The cable that comes with it has a female USB-A port on the side for charging a spare device, which means I don’t have to carry around an extra dongle or an extra wall wart to charge my phone. I mean, I even like that it comes with a velcro cable organizer that’s big enough to hold the whole cable in place. Grid View Vjeran Pavic / The Verge Vjeran Pavic / The Verge Vjeran Pavic / The Verge Vjeran Pavic / The Verge Vjeran Pavic / The Verge All of these are the good parts! But there are also bad parts: that USB port on the cable doesn’t work for data, so I can’t use it as a USB dongle. The cable also has an amber power indicator that doesn’t really do anything except tell you that it’s plugged in — I wish it would turn green when it’s done charging stuff. I also don’t love that the connector on the Dart itself is proprietary. It should be USB-C, just like the other end. If the cable ever frays or fails, I’ll have to buy a replacement from Finsix for 35 bucks — and they’re backordered. Since it’s 65W, it probably won’t do a great job powering a 15-inch MacBook Pro as fast as the stock 87W charger, but it should be fine for a 13-inch Pro, which comes with a 61W charger. The prongs don’t fold in, if you care about that. Anyway, point is: <3 you little dude. You weigh less and take up less space in my bag. You keep me from having to carry around another little thing. You make the pain of losing out on MagSafe a little easier. You are the thing Apple should have put in the bag with the MacBook and MacBook Pro in the first place. The Finsix Dart is backordered ‘till March, but you can preorder it for $99.

But, as CEO Tim Cook has illustrated frequently in the past, there are ways to drop hints and talk around the concrete facts. Much like how Cook gave rough outlines in interviews of Apple’s interest in the TV space, the executive is now doing the same for augmented reality. And if past comments from Cook are any indication, a product unveiling could be around the corner. The latest comments, from an interview the Apple chief gave to The Independent, indicate that Cook sees AR as a fundamental, revolutionary technology similar to the smartphone. I regard it as a big idea, like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone, we don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it’s for everyone. I think AR is that big, it’s huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives. And be entertaining. Cook goes on to say that he views AR like the silicon used in the iPhone’s chips, in other words as a “core technology” and “not a product per se.” Back in September, Cook told Good Morning America that AR held more potential than virtual reality because it allowed people to remain present in the real world while interacting with technology. Cook is strategically being cryptic about AR These comments are not just the random pontifications of a tech CEO. Apple, and Cook in particular, has honed his skills at cryptically talking up product roadmaps, announcements, and secret projects without having to confirm on-the-record that the company is up to anything at all. These comments are straight from that playbook, indicating to investors, analysts, and eager Apple fans that work is underway on these technologies and announcements may happen sooner rather than later. It’s well known now, from job postings and leaks, that the company has hundreds of employees working on AR and VR applications to some end. It’s just not yet clear what kinds of hardware or software the company may be trying to produce. More than likely, Apple will take light steps into the space, starting with AR tech similar to Google’s Project Tango. However, we can’t rule out the possibility that Apple is interested in developing a headset of its own or smart glasses of some sort. And if Cook keeps talking up AT at this level of frequency, we can be sure that something interesting is not too far off from a public reveal. - Via: Business Insider - Source: The Independent More From The Verge The Hawai’ian volcano that created a spectacular firehose of lava just collapsed Apple, Facebook, Google, and 94 others file opposition to Trump's immigration ban Google’s Super Bowl ad accidentally set off a lot of Google Homes Lady Gaga opened her Super Bowl performance with a protest anthem Trump is turning Elon Musk into a crony capitalist Why the sounds of eating make some people so angry Now Trending Congressman is righteously booed after dodging a young girl’s simple question about science Android’s convenient Instant Tethering is now rolling out to Pixel and Nexus devices First photo of Magic Leap prototype leaks This Article has a component height of 11.

Laptops by Matt Elliott February 10, 2017 1:10 PM PST @themattelliott Staring at a blue screen before bed, whether it be a phone, tablet or laptop, can shift your body's natural clock and make it difficult to get a good night's sleep. With Apple's Night Shift feature, the colors of your display are shifted to the warmer end of the spectrum during the evening hours. Your iPhone and iPad have it, and soon your MacBook will, too. Apple added Night Shift to iOS last year, and it will soon bring the feature to Macs. Night Shift has been added to the second public beta of MacOS Sierra 10.12.4, which you can get here or wait for it to arrive in the next official update to Sierra. But that Flux though? Like many Mac and Windows users, I use a free app called Flux to warm up the color temp of my display at night. With Night Shift coming as standard, the question becomes: Do I ditch Flux? After using both, I'm sticking with Flux for now, because it offers an extra phase for shifting the color temperature and gradual transitions. Enlarge Image Matt Elliott/CNET With Flux, you get three phases: daytime, sunset and bedtime. With Night Shift, it's either on or off, missing out on that middle phase that eases you toward the darkest hours. Also, Flux sets the transitions between its three phases to be gradual by default, letting your eyes adjust if you are in front of your screen during one of the transition times. Taking Night Shift to bed Night Shift isn't without its settings and customizations, which you'll find in a new Night Shift tab in System Preferences > Displays. Like Flux, you can set Night Shift to come on from sunset to sunrise, but you can also manually set the time period for it to be active. Also like Flux, Night Shift provides a slider to adjust the color temperature of the effect between less warm and more. Enlarge Image Matt Elliott/CNET You can enable and disable Night Shift from the Notification Center but it's somewhat hidden. From either the Today or Notifications view, you need to swipe up to reveal the toggle switch for Night Shift. It's just above the toggle for Do Not Disturb. Enlarge Image Matt Elliott/CNET In related news, Windows 10 will soon add a night light mode. It's one of the 10 best features coming to Windows 10.

Based in a gritty part of Croydon, its alumni include Adele and Amy Winehouse. A school that started off as a brave experiment 25 years ago has emerged as a major talent agency for Hollywood, the music industry, the theatre, the world of interactive digital design and the performing arts. Tim Cook with students at The Brit School for Performing Arts and Technology Credit: Geoff Pugh for The Telegraph Dubbed the “Fame Academy”, it now also embodies the rise and rise of a new British industry that could eventually come to rival the City of London as a source of economic growth: the intersection of the creative arts and technology.   As he tours the classrooms, Cook is greeted like royalty by the pupils, who are keen to show him their often remarkable work and talent; in turn, his praise for the school, which his company supports through donations of tablets and computers, is effusive and clearly heartfelt. “Some of these kids are travelling an hour and half, one way, to attend,” says Cook. “I have never been to a school like this, anywhere in the world. I think it’s that unique. “I can see why as a 14 or 17 or a 19-year-old you would want to come here. It’s a very special place.” Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, is so relaxed about Britain leaving the EU that he is opening a major HQ in London Credit: Geoff Pugh for The Telegraph For Cook, companies such as his operate at the intersection of the liberal arts and the humanities, which is exactly where the school is positioning itself. “In one place you have visual artists, you have dancers, choreographers, film directors, producers, you have musicians, you have costume designers,” he says of the Brit School. “It’s a lot of the creative community in one place, feeding off one another, collaborating, pushing each other.” There may well be another good reason why Cook is such a fan of the school: it embodies all of the virtues of modern, creative and diverse Britain, assets that he thinks will ensure that we thrive and prosper after we leave the European Union. Profile | Tim Cook Not for him the debilitating negativity of Project Fear, or even the “remoaning” one still occasionally hears in some unreconstructed sections of the business community: the Apple boss is strikingly upbeat about the prospects for Britain post-Brexit. “I’m not saying that there aren’t going to be some potholes in the short-term. There are. But if you look beyond those the UK is going to be just fine. Not just OK but great,” he says in his clear, measured Southern tang. Why, I ask the 56-year-old, who grew up in Alabama? “The culture of the people here, the resilience that’s here, and I think people will look around and say that these are the things that made us successful and hold on to those things,” he says. “So yes, I’m really optimistic.” Cook, a ferociously driven man who wakes up at 3:45 every morning, is putting his money where his mouth is: last October, a few months after the referendum, Apple announced that it had taken out a lease on a major new headquarters in London. The company will take up almost half of the redevelopment of Battersea Power Station, and will relocate all of its 1,400 London staff to the iconic building.  It will be housed over six floors, and the staff will move in when the landmark project is completed in four years’ time. The deal was the largest such letting in the area in 20 years, according to the site’s developer; it was just one of many such transactions struck in recent months that have demolished the idea that London would no longer be able to attract the world’s largest firms after Brexit. An artist's impression of the Battersea Power Station redevelopment Credit: Press Association Cook is enthusiastic about his new offices, and about what they mean for his commitment to the UK. “We’ve doubled down on our headquarters here. It’s going to be beautiful, we feel great about the place, we feel great about getting our employees under one roof. “We didn’t just want space for our current employees, but we also wanted sizeable space for expansion. London is an unbelievable place to live today and it’s going to be an unbelievable place to live tomorrow. And the UK at large will be.” For companies such as Apple, Britain’s open culture and its meritocracy matter hugely. “London and the UK at large are such an attractive place to live and, historically – and I hope in the future – have been very welcoming for all people from everywhere. It’s very diverse. If you walk the streets of London and close your eyes a bit and listen around you, you would hear most languages in the world. That’s a part of it.” Creative industries succeed best in these sorts of environments and even though the Government has pledged to regain control of immigration post-Brexit, it has also said that the UK will remain open to talent, which is undoubtedly a key reason for Cook’s optimism about our future prospects. Tim Cook waves as he leaves 10 Downing Street on Thursday Credit: Matt Dunham/AP “To be the most creative and innovative, tech depends on people from all walks of life coming together”, he explains.  “It combines the artists and the engineers. It combines maybe someone from Japan with a Brit, an Italian, an American, throwing it all together. It’s that which brings out the best and London arguably has been one of the best cities in the world for doing that. “The tech community here has clearly been one of the fastest growing in the world.” Cook raised all of these issues in his meeting with Theresa May. “We had a very open dialogue and I felt very good about the exchange that we had.” It’s the end of a long and gruelling trip across Europe for Cook, who picked up an honorary doctorate at Glasgow University and visited France and Germany, but he is as energetic and lucid as ever. He has visibly lost weight since our previous meetings, a development for which he (unsurprisingly) credits the health apps on his Apple watch. Tim Cook introduces the Apple Watch at an event in San Francisco in March 2015 Credit: Reuters He is as passionate as ever about the contribution of technology to the economy, and he singles out the British entrepreneurs behind Ustwo, a Shoreditch-based digital product studio, as an example of why embracing innovation and entrepreneurship will help drive Britain over the next few years. “They started up in their apartment; now they have two different sites,” says Cook. In their Bafta-winning game Monument Valley, players lead Princess Ida through mazes of optical illusions and impossible objects while manipulating the world around her to reach various platforms. “It’s a game with what I would call a family uplifting narrative. The storytelling, and the purpose, and all the stuff I love to see is there. The vast majority of their revenues are coming from outside the UK.” Cook believes that his platform alone has helped create a large tech industry in the UK in the past few years. “There are a quarter of a million people like [Ustwo] in the UK. I would strongly guess that if you could isolate IoS developers [programmers working on Apple’s platform] and look at them over the past few years, it has got to be the fastest-growing jobs segment here in the UK.” Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive Credit: Geoff Pugh for The Telegraph The Apple boss is unsurprisingly positive about the potential of technology to continue to transform entire industries, and to provide opportunities to grow his company further. Apple bounced back in the final quarter of last year, and for the first time in five years is once again the world’s largest maker of smartphones, in part because of the woes of Samsung, its biggest rival. He still believes that there is a massive amount of expansion to be had, not least because one day everybody in the world will want a phone, and by harnessing the wonders of artificial intelligence to improve his products. Watch | Tim Cook?s rise to fame in 90 seconds 01:33 One area of long-term growth for tech firms will be health, with apps that monitor all aspects of the human condition; another is education, where at the moment he says that the problem often is that “you sit in front of the textbook and you are not engaged”. Cook is a fan of another school here in the UK that he also visited on his tour: Woodberry Down Community Primary School in Harringay, north London, a pioneer in using technology in the classroom in a much more radical manner that is usually the case. He is interested in education for another reason: he believes that it is the answer to the growing worries about the losers from technological change. “It’s true that globalisation hasn’t helped everyone. It has helped a lot of people and has been very good overall. But some people it hasn’t helped and in some cases it’s hard.” We had a very open dialogue and I felt very good about the exchange that we hadTim Cook on his meeting with Theresa May So what is to be done to help those who are falling behind as result of the change that continues to engulf our economies? “We have to put our energies into figuring out what we can do to lift them up. It shouldn’t be acceptable to any of us that these two groups diverge,” he says. “But the most important thing is investing in skills, not looking back to where the past was but move towards where it’s going.” As a manifesto for a post-Brexit Britain, selling its high-value-added creative services around the world, it’s certainly a vision that will take some beating.

We first covered installing and setting up your Accessories and then discussed how you could control them individually and create Scenes to control them in groups. In this installment, I’m going to show you how to use Automations to toggle Accessories or Scenes when certain triggers fire. Before you can automate HomeKit, you must have a device that can act as a hub: either a fourth-generation Apple TV or an iPad running iOS 10. The hub is necessary because something in the house has to be present to trigger Automations. Setting up a HomeKit hub confers an additional advantage: it lets you control your Accessories while you’re away from home. The Hubbub About Hubs -- Why can only Apple TVs and iPads work as HomeKit hubs? Why not AirPort base stations, which are already hubs of a sort? The reason is likely that the Apple TV and iPad both support Bluetooth, which is how many HomeKit devices are controlled. Why can’t you use a Mac as a hub? Your guess is as good as mine. An iPad is slightly easier than an Apple TV to set up as a hub, and chances are better that you have one, so I’ll start there: In Settings > iCloud, make sure that you’re signed into your primary iCloud account. Also under Settings > iCloud, make sure that iCloud Keychain and Home are enabled. Go to Settings > Home and enable Use this iPad as a Home Hub. It’s that simple! But here’s the trick: if you want your Automations to work while you’re out and about, your iPad must stay home! If you take your iPad hub with you, the Automations won’t work, because your hub isn’t connected to your home Wi-Fi network. Therefore, if you own a fourth-generation Apple TV, it makes a better hub than the iPad, because it’s unlikely that you’ll take it out of the house. However, the trick here is that two-factor authentication must be enabled on your iCloud account. Note that this is different than Apple’s older two-step verification scheme, and if you have that enabled, you’ll have to disable it first to enable two-factor authentication. Apple explains this process in a support article, and I give easy, concise directions in “iOS 10: A Take Control Crash Course.” Once you’re past that hurdle, using your Apple TV as a HomeKit hub is as simple as making sure that you’re signed in to your primary iCloud account under Settings > Accounts. You also need to have iCloud Keychain enabled on an iOS device or Mac. Then, under Settings > Accounts > iCloud, you should see a HomeKit header, and under that, you should see Home: Connected. If you don’t, make sure everything is signed in properly. The other way to check on your hubs is via the iOS Home app. First, if a hub isn’t responding, you’ll see that in the status messages on the Home screen. To see the status of all your hubs, tap the arrow in the upper left. Under Home Hubs, you’ll see your hubs and their statuses. To test if your hubs will work as you expect while you’re away from home, turn off Wi-Fi on your iPhone temporarily. Then, while you’re connected to cellular data, try controlling your HomeKit Accessories. If your hubs are working properly, everything should work just as it does when you’re connected to Wi-Fi. Finally, note that when it comes to HomeKit reliability, the more hubs, the better. I recommend setting up as many as you can, because if one is disconnected or flakes out for some reason, you’ll have backups to ensure your Automations keep running. I’ve found HomeKit to be much more reliable since I added a second hub. Once your hubs are set up, you can control your HomeKit devices from anywhere in the world! That works exactly the same as it does when you control HomeKit devices inside your home. You can also set up Automations because the hub will always be available to invoke them. Automatic for the Home -- The hardest part of setting up HomeKit Automation is getting the hubs in place. Then it comes down to figuring out what you want to do. Just as with other aspects of home automation, be sure to communicate with your housemates and proceed carefully. If you set up an Automation to turn off the lights when you leave the house, you could leave your spouse and kids in the dark when you run to get ice cream. It’s easy to go overboard on Automations, so I recommend keeping them simple. My wife wakes up at 5:30 AM, so I have my Good Morning scene set to light up the house for her. I then have my Good Night scene set to trigger at 8:30 AM, because I don’t need the lights by that point. And then at 3:00 PM, Good Morning comes on again, so the house is lit up when she comes home from school. I’d like to set up an Automation to turn outside lights on and off at appropriate times of day. We like to keep our exterior lights on at night for security reasons, but I often forget to turn them off during the day, which wastes power and reduces bulb lifespan. Our encased porch light could probably hold a Hue bulb safely, but Philips doesn’t make outdoor flood lights like we have on the side of the house, so I’d need to install something like Elgato’s Eve Light Switch to automate those lights. If you had a HomeKit-compatible thermostat, you could also create an Automation to set the temperature down when you drive away in the morning and back up when you leave work. That should give you a few ideas for useful Automations. What you want to avoid is making it seem like your house is haunted — lights turning off or on at seemingly random times, spooking everyone in the house. Setting Up Automations -- Once you set up a hub, the Automation screen in Home becomes available. In it, you can see existing Automations and set up four different Automation types: My Location Changes, A Time of Day Occurs, An Accessory Is Controlled, and A Sensor Detects Something. The steps for configuring them are roughly similar in each case. First, you tap Create New Automation in the Automation tab and then configure the trigger — the conditions that will cause the Automation to be invoked. Then you choose which Accessories and Scenes to turn on or off. My Location Changes: I’m not wild about geofence triggers that go off when you arrive at or leave a specified location. They’re fine if you live alone, but if you share your house with others, they can create all sorts of problems unless everyone has the same schedule. For instance, there’s no way to configure the lights to turn off only if my wife and I both leave the house. However, geofence triggers do have their uses. For instance, you could set up your outdoor lights to turn on when you approach your house. If you had a HomeKit-enabled garage door, you could even have it open automatically as you drive up. To set up a location Automation, tap Create New Automation in the Automation tab and then My Location Changes. At the Location Automation screen, first choose a triggering location. This can be your home, a recently accessed Maps location, or a location you find in a search. Then choose whether to trigger the automation when you arrive at or leave the location. Finally, the map lets you adjust the trigger’s sensitivity. The red pushpin marks the spot, and you can drag the blue dot to adjust the trigger radius around the spot. Tap Next when you’re satisfied. Once you’ve defined the location, choose Scenes and Accessories to activate. Tap Next. The final screen lets you review your options and offers a few more tweaks. You can set the location trigger to work only after sunset. If you added any Accessories to the Automation, you can choose whether to turn them on or off; you can also press and hold on the Accessory button to make adjustments like brightness and temperature, just as you normally would when controlling it. If you’re unhappy with any of the settings, tap Back to go back in the process and change things. If you’re satisfied, tap Done to finish. A Time of Day Occurs: Setting a Time Automation works almost the same way, except at the Time Automation screen you choose the days and times when the trigger should go off. Two time options are sunrise and sunset, which are determined automatically based on where you live. An Accessory Is Controlled: With this option, you can set HomeKit to activate something when you control an Accessory. For instance, if you turn on a light bulb, you could set smart plugs in the room to turn on lamps as well. I haven’t found a use for this option yet, but you might. You start by choosing one Accessory that will trigger the automation. Next, choose whether to trigger the automation when the Accessory turns on or off. Then, choose Accessories and Scenes to activate with the trigger, and proceed as normal. A Sensor Detects Something: In theory, you could set this to trigger actions when say, a smoke alarm or water detector is activated. However, even though I have an Elgato Eve Room sensor, which monitors air quality, temperature, and humidity, this option is grayed out. That’s unfortunate, because it would be great to use these sensors alongside a HomeKit thermostat to better balance the temperature in my house. If you know of a sensor that works with this trigger, let me know! Editing Automations -- Once your Automations are set up, you can view them from the Automations screen in Home. Tap one to see its settings. It’s important to see how to disable an Automation, which is the first switch on the Automation settings screen. If you have a day off or know that you’ll be too sick to go to work the next day, you probably don’t want your lights coming on at 5:30 in the morning. You can also change the triggers for the Automation and what Scenes and Accessories will be set by the automation. Finally, there’s an option to delete the Automation. I seldom do this unless I’m just playing with test Automations that I don’t intend to keep. Instead, disable an unwanted Automation first, and then delete it later if you don’t miss it. HomeKit home automation is incredibly powerful, and it’s even more powerful when you configure it to be truly automated. But as always, with great power comes great responsibility, so be careful what you set, discuss your Automations with other family members, and keep things simple so they’re easy to manage. This concludes our coverage of the Home app, but we’re not done with HomeKit. Next time, I’ll tell you about a more powerful HomeKit app that gives you additional control over your devices.

Image: Bob Al-Greene/Mashable By Damon Beres2017-02-10 21:47:10 UTC Opinion There once was a time I texted without fireworks. I'm never going back.  Honestly, is there a better way to say you have a stomachache than with virtual pyrotechnics? Nope, and it doesn't even stop there. You communicate your malaise with fireworks and then toss in an animation of an obese cat eating pizza. And ice cream.  SEE ALSO: I ditched Android for an iPhone 7, and I'm not sorry This is what it's like to text with an iPhone in 2017. Apple's iOS 10 update transformed iMessage, the iPhone-to-iPhone texting service, allowing users to speak to one another with a variety of ridiculous effects. You could call it indulgent, but a better word might be "personal". iMessage has become the most individual form of texting on the market, and it's good enough to keep me, a lapsed Android-lover, on Apple's system forever. That'll cost me. iPhones aren't a great value: iOS is inferior to Android in a number of ways, and the devices are expensive (peep the latest rumor that the iPhone 8 could cost upwards of $1,000). Off-contract, the iPhone 7 starts at $649. More likely: You pay for the gadget on an installment plan, perhaps via Apple's own "Upgrade Program," a brilliantly designed treadmill wherein you'll fork over at least $32.41 every month for as long as you want to use an iPhone.  This scheme mirrors what you've probably seen from your carrier, the chief difference being that you're filling Apple's coffers directly, without the chance to ever switch from an iPhone to a Galaxy phone, say. (Google, for what it's worth, offers a very similar financing plan for its Pixel phones.) This seems tangential to a celebration of iMessage fireworks, but it's not. Now more than ever, Apple needs strategies to lock users into their universe, because it's easier than ever to switch from iPhone to an Android. Some time ago, that wasn't really true: Android was clumsy compared to iOS, with a confusing UI that typically ran on phones that felt a lot clunkier than the iPhone. Today, Android is totally user friendly, easy on the eyes and runs on sleek, modern handsets that have challenged the iPhone's design if not overtaken it entirely. The Samsung Galaxy Note7, rest its soul, was perfect... minus the explosions. Image: Brittany Herbert/Mashable So, there are two strategies: Lock users into company-specific payment plans, or hook them on software. Because in an era when basically any high-end phone is amazing, software like iMessage or Google Assistant can be the tipping point that keeps someone on a platform—and that means bank, with millions upon millions of people upgrading their phones every year or two. Which takes us back to this: It seems absurd, but it's true: An iPhone might cost you upwards of $649, but the most compelling reason to have one is its free, built-in texting app. It's a fast, standardized and secure way to talk to your friends. You know they're seeing the same thing you are, whether it's an embedded tweet or, yes, a cat sticker, and the communication is near-immediate.  There is literally nothing else about my iPhone 7 that I would describe as "superior" to high-end Android phones A lot of this will depend on your personal circumstances, but almost all of my friends and family own iPhones. I text much more than I make phone calls. The quality-of-life improvement that came with switching from an Android to an iPhone last fall shocked me, purely on the basis of text messaging. On my Note7 (again, R.I.P.), group messages with iPhone owners became garbled. Things would arrive and send out of order. I couldn't keep pace. There was no option to "send with fireworks." My text bubbles displayed in a toxic green. Months later, there is literally nothing else about my iPhone 7 that I would describe as "superior" to high-end Android phones (or even a midrange device like the OnePlus 3T). I used the Google Now assistant all the time and never touch Siri. The design I was so keen on at first ("its butt looks fantastic") is prone to greasy smudges, and it's too small (alas, I've also found the 7 Plus to be uncomfortably large).  And despite the old Mac credo ("It just works"), I've found the iPhone rarely functions in quite the way I want it to. Apps must be snapped to a standardized home screen grid; a step back from the highly customizable Android home screens. I assumed, as it had on my Android phone, that Google Maps would track my full location history—as I want it to. Just yesterday, I figured out that I hadn't given the app quite the right kind of access in the separate Settings app for that to happen. Cool. And installing a third-party keyboard is a friction-y mess. Say you download Word Flow: You open the app, and then there's a stupid, static set of instructions on screen that guide you into your settings to make a series of changes that will enable the keyboard.  It's bad: There are steps to enable a keyboard on an Android phone, of course, but the platform is a bit more lenient about apps messing with your settings: If you download Swift Key on Android, it'll tell you to "enable" the keyboard but allow you to tap a button to go directly into your settings and do so. Anyway, this is all arcane mumbo jumbo that most sane humans wouldn't care about. The point is that, in aggregate, I vastly prefer Android, as a platform, to iOS. But the aggregate doesn't make a difference, because the one most important thing—messaging—is so much better on an iPhone. I couldn't convince my friends and family to change instead to WhatsApp, Signal, Facebook Messenger or Allo (lol), because they would see no reason to: iMessage is perfectly fine. And so, in a sense, Apple has trapped me. iMessage, for the foreseeable future, will be the reason I stay on an iPhone, the reason I update my iOS software and ultimately the reason I buy a new iPhone when upgrade time rolls around. It's fitting, I suppose: Even with actual phone calls in decline, Apple wins out for making direct communication easy, personal and fun. It really is that simple. Or in my case, not so simple: Sorry, friends.

Owners Of Matte Black iPhones Complaining About Chipping Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Owners Of Matte Black iPhones Complaining About Chipping Image courtesy of Apple Discussion February 10, 2017 4:23 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler chipping away damage phone chip where's the paint paint matte black apple device warranty When Apple debuted the iPhone 7 last fall, the company also introduced two new finishes: the glossy Jet Black and the subdued Matte Black, both of which cost more than the usual iPhone colors. However, some folks who shelled out extra money for that matte-finish shell say their iPhones are starting to chip — in some instances after only a few weeks. 9to5 Mac reports that owners of the devices say they haven’t dropped, or otherwise damaged their phones, yet the sight of silver has begun to interrupt the all-black smartphones. The issues, according to a discussion thread on Apple’s website, began shortly after the phones were purchased, with several owners noting that chips – generally near the volume controls or bottom speakers – appeared not long after coming out of the box. According to the first poster on the thread, the phone was just a month old when it began to chip on the edges. Apple Discussion “I just open the casing once a week to wipe the dust off from the phone,” the poster writes. “Until yesterday when I take off the casing, and notice there is something at the edge of the phone body next to UP Volume button. At first I thought it just the dust. I try to wipe it using microfiber cloth as usual.” But when he looked closer, the device appeared to be chipped from the phone body. “I am really disappointed with what happened to the phone because I was using it very careful,” the poster says. The owner says that he contacted Apple Support about the issue, but was told the chipping — referred to as “cosmetic damage” — wasn’t covered by warranty. Other phone owners say they’ve experienced similar problems with their phones. “I am using the matte black model and I realized a bit of the paint chipped off at my volume button too,” another poster said in November. “I am a very meticulous user and it never happened with my old iPhone 6 model.” The chips, which can be rather small, are often initially thought to be dust or dirt by owners. “I have this issue on my matte black too,” a poster wrote in December. “I noticed it on my mute switch, 2 small dots that I initially thought was dust. But after cleaning it off I realized that it’s the paint chipping off.” Apple Discussion This owner was also told that the damage wasn’t covered by warranty. In the end, he sold the phone and replaced it with a silver one. Another user noticed chips on the bottom speaker area of their phone just three weeks after purchasing the device. “I have contacted Apple care and they asked to send a few images of the problem and after 12 days they told me it is not covered under warranty since it is under cosmetic damage,” the poster says. “How can they see it is a cosmetic problem and not a manufacturing problem through a photo? The only thing I know is that this is getting worse.” In addition to the chips along the edges, some users say the back of the device near the Apple logo is susceptible to the damage. Apple Discussion “There’s one tiny spot smack dab in between the Apple logo and the edge of the device,” the poster said. “I don’t know how this happened given I use a lint roller on the pocket I keep the phone in and I have a screen protector and TPU case on, also I’ve never dropped it.” One owner wrote that they were able to remedy the issue with black acrylic paint purchased at a craft store. “It’s not perfect, but it made the chipped paint sports on my 7+ matte black less of an eye sore,” the owner said. Consumerist has reached out to Apple on the chipping reports. We’ll update this post when we hear back.

Traders weigh in Rebecca Ungarino | @ungarino 12 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Can Apple keep driving the Nasdaq 100 higher?    Thursday, 9 Feb 2017 | 4:18 PM ET | 04:01 The Nasdaq 100 has rallied more than 7 percent year to date, and just this week notched a record close, with the help of its largest component, Apple. With a weight in the index of about 12 percent, the tech giant has served as the biggest contributor to the Nasdaq 100 this year, adding nearly twice as much to the index as second-biggest contributor Facebook. So far this year, Apple has surged more than 14 percent, with the bulk of those gains coming after the company's earnings report handily bested analysts' expectations. Apple's surge has been good for a roughly 1.7 percent rally in the large-tech index. The outlook for Apple remains bullish, said Gina Sanchez, CEO of Chantico Global. But she's looking for "innovation" from the company. "Apple has been really undervalued for most of 2016. Apple has had high dividends, it has had good growth, and it has also had a great buyback program that has been buoying stocks. The problem going forward is that now that the move is done, now that you've gone from 10 times to 15 times earnings, where do you go from here?" Sanchez said Thursday on CNBC's "Trading Nation." "You really have to continue to see growth in Apple revenue, and the problem is they haven't really unveiled anything really beyond new iPhones," Sanchez added. The company in its latest quarterly earnings release reported it sold more than 78 million iPhones, exceeding analysts' expectations; the news sent the stock surging more than 6 percent. Apple is expected to release its next iPhone later this year. "We don't think it's certainly overvalued, I mean it's maybe a little overbought, but it's certainly not overvalued where it is, but we need to see a reason to get excited for the next leg of growth," Sanchez said. While Apple is the Nasdaq 100 behemoth, Gibbs said investors shouldn't neglect other tech heavies in the index. "There's still another 90 percent of weight of companies in the Nasdaq 100, and you get companies like Google, Microsoft. So I definitely see value in that diversification versus Apple that is really so tied to what it's doing with its iPhone sales," Gibbs said, adding that expectations for the newest iPhone are already quite high. "You might want to look at what other companies are doing up until then," Gibbs said. Analysts currently give Apple an average rating of overweight, with an average price target of $140.70 on the now-$132 stock, according to FactSet estimates.

 Apple CEO Tim Cook believes augmented reality is 'a big idea like the smartphone' Kif Leswing Feb. 10, 2017, 3:45 PM 4,123 facebook linkedin twitter email print Not a real picture of Apple CEO Tim Cook.AP / Matthew Sumner for Getty Images Nobody outside of Apple knows what its next big product is. But Apple CEO Tim Cook continues to drop hints that the company is investing and sees huge potential in augmented reality. That's what techies call the technology that integrates computer graphics and the internet with the real world to let you see virtual objects in real environments. The end game of this technology is a pair of smart glasses, although current applications like Pokémon Go mostly use smartphones. Cook compared AR to the smartphone in an interview with The Independent's David Phelan published on Friday: "I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone. We don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market; it's for everyone. I think AR is that big. It's huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives and be entertaining." But Cook also threw cold water on the idea that Apple is preparing a specific AR product like the smart glasses that have been recently rumored. "I view AR like I view the silicon here in my iPhone," he said. "It's not a product per se — it's a core technology." This could mean that Apple would include AR technology in some of its apps, such as the camera app, and its underlying technology. Apple has purchased several AR startups in the past few years. "This is something you know it's coming," Loup Ventures founder Gene Munster previously told Business Insider. "The only other times they've talked like this is before the iPhone came out, they started to indicate they could do something in the phone market. Before the Apple Watch came out they talked about wearables and the wrist being a better option." It's not the first time Cook has spoken at length about the potential he sees in AR. At an appearance in October, he laid out why he thinks is a superior bet to other immersive technologies like virtual reality, and said a "significant portion" of people around the world would "have AR experiences every day." "AR is going to take a while because there are some really hard technology challenges there," Cook said in October. "But it will happen, it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it. Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today."

Loyalists have taken to Apple's support forums to complain that the matte black model of the Sir Jony Ive-designed iPhone 7 is prone to easily chipping off, even when a protective case is used. "I have been using iPhone 7 Plus Matt Black for about one month with fully covered by a TPU casing and full screen tempered glass most of the time," writes one customer. "I just open the casing once a week to wipe the dust off from the phone. Until yesterday when I take off the casing, and notice there is something at the edge of the phone body next to UP Volume button. At first I thought it just the dust. I try to wipe it using microfibre cloth as usual. Until I look closely it is the metal part of the body. It seems that the black anodised paint had been chipped off from the phone body." Other iPhone buyers are having similar experiences. A bunch of photos posted to Apple support forums show just how bad the problem is for a handset that has only been on the market for months. iPh-oh-no ... The flakey paint job has customers furious (Source) The problem is only the latest in an ongoing parade of technical flaws that have plagued the Cupertino idiot-tax operation, which prides itself on its meticulous design and engineering standards. The iPhone 5 had similar quality issues, and the iPhone 4 was famous for its antenna woes. More recently, Apple has been called out for the flimsy cases and defective batteries that were found in various handsets. ® Tips and corrections 21 Comments More from The Register What links macOS, iOS, Safari, tvOS, watchOS?

Misleading or fraudulent news stories are “one of today’s chief problems” and there is no “simple solution,” Cook told Good Morning Britain. Cook was at a north London primary school when he made the comments, which is just one of his many stops in his trip to Europe, according to Business Insider. (RELATED: Apple CEO Considering Legal Action To Combat Trump’s Immigration Restrictions) “We have to give the consumer tools to help with this and we’ve got to filter out part of it before it ever gets there without losing the great openness of the internet,” Cook said. He did not explain if Apple itself would try to directly address the problem of false information dissemination, or what he means by filtering.

 Apple just poached an Amazon executive to save its struggling Apple TV business Eugene Kim Feb. 7, 2017, 9:35 PM 5,000 facebook linkedin twitter email print LinkedIn Apple has poached Timothy D. Twerdahl, former director and GM of Amazon's Fire TV unit, in an effort to revive its struggling Apple TV business, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Twerdahl's will oversee product marketing for Apple TV, the report said. Twerdahl's LinkedIn page says he joined Apple this month. Twerdahl spent nearly four years at Amazon, after joining the company's Fire TV unit in 2013. Prior to that, he's held a number of positions at WIMM Labs, Roku, and Netflix. Twerdahl replaces Pete Distad, who has moved to Apple's content team, run by Eddie Cue. The hiring comes at a time when Apple TV has struggled to gain much traction. In its most recent earnings, Apple CFO Luca Maestri blamed Apple TV for the "other" category's sales decline. Amazon hasn't disclosed any sales numbers of its Fire TV, but often calls its TV streaming device the best-selling device on its e-commerce site.

Mobile by Gordon Gottsegen February 10, 2017 11:54 AM PST @ggottsegen An iris scanner, wireless charging and an OLED display (instead of an LCD screen) could come to the 10th-anniversary iPhone, according to a new report from Digitimes. In addition, the phone we're calling the iPhone 8 for now could also enter production "earlier than usual" to give suppliers time to create enough supply to meet demand. (Apple is also said to be placing more stringent inspection rules for these chips and components.) As Apple celebrates the tenth anniversary of the original iPhone, the Cupertino, California company is expected to bring on big hardware changes and software updates to compete against ever more sophisticated rivals and satisfy buyers who have become bored with the iPhone's incremental changes. We've heard all sorts of rumors about a glass and steel body with a curved edge display, and no more physical home button. Apple could even release two iPhone 7S models in addition to the iPhone 8, noted Digitimes, citing KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. German site Handy Abovergleich's concept illustration beautifully ties together many of the current iPhone 8 rumors. Handy Abovergleich Using an iris scanner as one way to unlock a phone has been implemented in phones by Samsung and Microsoft, but this would be the first Apple phone to feature the technology. German site Handy Abovergleich even created some renders of what the next iPhone could look like. As for the wireless charging rumor, Apple's supplier Foxconn was reportedly testing wireless charging for the next iPhone, which Kuo claims will come to all of this year's iPhones. OLED displays on the next iPhone have also been talked about in the past, and some believe that this technology will result in an iPhone that costs over $1,000. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

But there's another Apple wireless headphone from the company's Beats by Dre subsidiary that's also received its share of buzz: The BeatsX ($150, £130, AU$200). And like the AirPods, the BeatsX was also delayed, but it's officially available as of February 10. Popular Searches Homeland Security Corp HSCC ▼ 0.0090 -0.0014 -13.29% DNO ASA DTNOF ▼ 1.00 -0.04 -3.71% IGM Financial Inc IGIFF ▲ 31.00 +0.63 +2.07% Michael Kors Holdings Ltd KORS ▲ 38.38 +0.11 +0.29% The BeatsX employs Apple's new custom low-power Bluetooth chip, the W1, which is also found in the AirPods, PowerBeats3 Wireless and the Solo3 Wireless, and allows for automatic pairing with Apple devices updated with the latest versions of its operating systems (iOS 10, MacOS Sierra and WatchOS 3). But among that trio of new Beats models, the BeatsX is the only truly fresh model, and the first one designed with the help of Apple's design and engineering teams. (The PowerBeats3 Wireless and Solo3 Wireless just updated the previous models in their respective lines with Apple's new wireless chip.) Another bonus: the BeatsX is the only one that charges with a Lightning cable. Ultimately, the BeatsX is a fresh take -- or really Apple's take -- on the neckband-style wireless headphone that LG made so popular with its Tone headsets and has been copied in recent years by an assortment of other companies. As in the past, Apple and Beats haven't reinvented the mousetrap so to speak, but they have built a better one. The BeatsX's neckband -- Beats calls it a Flex-Form cable -- has two wires running through it that are made of nickel titanium alloy or nitinol, which was developed by the US Navy in the late 1950s and is very malleable, durable and lightweight. The key to it here is that it gives the band just enough rigidity and allows you to roll up the headphone so it fits it in an included compact carrying case. You can't do that with an LG Tone headset. (Side note: the soft-to-touch rubber carrying case is a bit of a dust magnet.) It's also worth noting that the cable is anchored to your neck with two equally weighted bulges in the cord, one of which houses the battery and the other the headphone's electronics. This really isn't any different from what you find with other current neckband-style headphones, such as Skullcandy's affordable Ink'd Wireless, but the BeatsX's design is decidedly slicker and seemingly more durable. The lightweight magnetized buds, which house 8mm drivers, adhere to each other, so you can pin them together when they're not in your ears and wear them like a pendant. Like other neckband-style headphones, these are designed to be worn around all day and they're light enough to make you forget you're wearing them (when they aren't in your ears anyway). The only design gripe I have is that the cords may seem a little long to some people -- by that I mean people with smaller necks. In the box, you'll find four different sizes of eartips and a couple of sizes of fins to anchor the buds in your ears. You can opt to use the fins or not, but if you're doing anything active, like running, you'll want to use them; they work well and fit comfortably. The headphones are water-resistant, according to Beats, but are not waterproof. I got a pretty tight seal with the medium tip but ended up opting for the larger one because it offered the best seal. Like other in-ear noise-isolating headphones, it's crucial to get a good seal to maximize sound quality and bass response. To its credit, Beats has been trying to get away from its earlier reputation as a company that made uber-popular headphones that sounded mediocre thanks to their loose, bloated bass and lack of detail. The BeatsX has more bass and overall bigger, slightly richer sound than the AirPods, but they can't be accused of having too much bass. As always, whether one prefers that deeper sound to that of the AirPods is totally a personal preference. I liked their sound, especially for a Bluetooth headphone of this type (they sound very good for a neckband-style Bluetooth 'phone). Ironically, however, my quibbles are with the treble, not the bass. Some may find this headphone has a touch too much sizzle. We audio reviewers sometimes refer to this as sibilance, and it's most noticeable with high-hat strikes and tambourine shakes but also creeps into the upper mids (there's a bit of a harshness to the vocals of The Veronicas' "You Ruin Me" track, for example). Like the PowerBeats3, the BeatsX has an integrated microphone and Beats has redesigned the RemoteTalk button to make it more tactile and responsive (it's definitely improved). I had no problems making calls -- sound quality seemed quite good and callers said they had no problem hearing me, though they lack the vibration feature of the LG Tone models. I'm not quite ready to declare the BeatsX better or worse than the AirPods at making calls, but I will say that since this is a noise-isolating headphone, it's a little easier to hear people in noisier environments. (We'll be doing some further testing on call quality comparisons). I tested the BeatsX with an iPhone 6S, MacBook Air, Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. As I said, the headphone incorporates Apple's new custom low-power Bluetooth chip, the W1, which allows for automatic pairing with Apple devices. To pair, you just turn on the BeatsX -- the power button is on the right bulge -- and hold the BeatsX near your iPhone (it will also try to pair with other nearby iPhones, which is a small problem). That should automatically pair the headphone to your Apple Watch, iPad and Mac -- anything registered to you on your iCloud account -- and once I went through the initial pairing process I was able to switch among my Apple devices with minimal hiccups. (Translation: like the AirPods -- and any other wireless product -- do not expect completely glitch-free operation.) BeatsX also works with non-Apple Bluetooth devices, but you have to pair it the old-fashioned way, which is still pretty simple. The headphone delivers up to eight hours battery life at moderate volume levels (even with non-Apple devices), which is decent for this type of headphone, though not exceptionally good. But the good news is that if you give the headphone a quick five-minute charge via its Lightning port -- yes, I said Lightning, not MicroUSB -- you get two hours of usage. I tested this, running the BeatsX all the way down, then charging it for five minutes. After I reconnected, the battery life indicator showed 27 percent. Beats markets this quick-charge feature as "Fast Fuel." Sound quality shootout At $150, this headphone isn't cheap, but it is the least expensive wireless model from Beats and costs slightly less than Apple's AirPods, sounds slightly better, and delivers longer battery life. Aside from the AirPods, I also compared the BeatsX to Bose's SoundSport Wireless, Beats' Powerbeats3 Wireless, Jaybird's X3 and for kicks, Bose's SoundTrue Ultra wired in-ear headphone. The wired Bose Ultra clearly delivered superior sound (it just has a smoother tonal balance and smoother, more detailed sound, with tighter bass). The Bose SoundSport Wireless has more bass and I liked its sound better overall; it's a tad more comfortable to wear. However, I preferred the BeatsX's more discreet design (the SoundSport Wireless' buds really stick out). The Bose does have a semi-open design that allows more sound in than the BeatsX -- again, a personal preference decision. The Jaybird X3 and Powerbeats3 Wireless offer comparable sound to the BeatsX. The Jaybird X3 costs $20 less than the BeatsX and is also an excellent wireless sports headphone (though not quite as comfortable as the Beats X), while the popular Powerbeats3 Wireless delivers more battery life (13 hours) but may not fit everybody's ears as well as the BeatsX and is $50 more expensive. AirPods' DNA in a different body If you're trying to decide between the BeatsX and the AirPods, there are plusses and minuses to each. With the AirPods you're getting a set of cord-free, totally wireless earphones that offer maximum untethered freedom. But on the downside, a lot of people don't like how they look, and they have an open design (a plus for those who don't like eartips jammed in their ears), which makes them hard to use in noisier environments like the streets of New York. Also, the AirPods fit more securely in some people's ears than others. (Plenty of folks are able to run with AirPods but they don't stay in my ears when I run with them.) Though not without its faults, the BeatsX gives you most of the "magic" features of the AirPods (for users of Apple products anyway), including Lightning charging and effortless syncing. This all comes in a wearable design that rolls up into a compact carrying case that's arguably harder to lose than the AirPods' smooth plastic dental floss-size case. It may not be the ultimate neckband-style wireless headphone, but it's a fresh take with a lot of appeal.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Business & Tech Apple CEO Tim Cook waves at members of the media as he leaves 10 Downing Street in London on Thursday. Picture by Matt Dunham AP/Press Association Images 12:40 10 Feb 2017 Craig Fitzpatrick 20 hours ago Beaming in every photo he's posted of his European trip this week – as he enjoys French cuisine and swings by the Berlin Philharmonic – Apple CEO Tim Cook's upbeat mood extended as far as declaring that his company is "very optimistic" about Brexit. Hopping across the English Channel for a meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May, he told Downing Street that the Cupertino tech giant is a “big believer in the UK" and that, while there could be "bumps in the road along the way", Britain would be "just fine" without the EU. The 56-year-old Alabamian also told ITV's Good Morning Britain: "We're doubling down on a huge headquarters in the Battersea area and we're leaving significant space there to expand." Apple is planning to move 1,600 employees to the south London office by 2021, which the British government has pointed to as an example of how multinationals are still willing to invest in the nation after the Brexit referendum. A Downing Street spokesperson said of the meeting between Cook and May: "It was a very positive and useful discussion. Apple have made a recent announcement about their investment in the UK and they had a conversation around that and the importance of government and business on digital skills which going forward will clearly be a huge part of the future industry. "It was a chance for the prime minister to outline her plans for negotiating our EU exit. It was also a chance for her to reiterate and welcome Apple's investment in the UK." Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, accompanied by headteacher Derek Hewie interacts with Year 2 pupils in a classroom during a visit to Woodberry Down Primary School, north London. Picture by Yui Mok PA Wire/PA Images Dire new Brexit forecast The positive notes sounded by the iPhone maker's top dog aren't in harmony, however, with a new study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). MIT's Sloan School of Management has calculated that the negative impact on Britain's gross domestic product per capita will be almost four times that of previous estimates, causing output losses of nearly 10%. “The cost is going to be way bigger than the amount we currently send to Europe,” John Van Reenen, the British economist who worked on the study, told Bloomberg Television. "By splitting more away from the rest of Europe, we’ll lose foreign investment, we’ll lose some trade and the consequences will actually be negative for our productivity." Cook in Europe On Wednesday, Cook received an honorary degree from the University of Glasgow and used his speech to speak out about US President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration. He said: "Our simple view is that Apple would not exist without immigration, so this is a huge issue for us. So what do we do? We voice our opinion and stand up - we don’t sit in silence." The majority of his European visit has been far lighter fare and made for many Kodak (or iPhone camera) moments...

Opinion | 06 Feb 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (38) What Apple Can Learn from Airwalk by Josh Centers When I was a teenager in the 1990s, Airwalk shoes were all the rage. They were a mandatory accessory for grunge-oriented youths, along with plaid shirts and corduroy pants. The company was founded in 1986, and in its heyday in the 1990s, it had grown to be the third-largest sneaker brand, behind only Nike and Adidas. Today’s teens have undoubtedly never even heard of Airwalk sneakers, which are now found on the bargain rack at Payless Shoesource. What happened? Wait, this is TidBITS, not a fashion magazine, so why am I talking about shoes? Keep reading. I’m about to tell you a story that may sound chillingly familiar. Airwalk began as a niche shoe for professional skateboarders. Skating legend Tony Hawk (who starred in an eponymous video game that ran on the Mac, along with many other platforms) was one of their first customers, and actually suggested the name. Much of Airwalk’s early popularity was due to getting input from skaters to create superior skateboarding shoes that wouldn’t cause blisters or crashes. Airwalk had a healthy business, but it didn’t hit the big time until it hired advertising firm Lambesis to run an ultra-chic, counter-cultural ad campaign. As Malcolm Gladwell wrote in “The Tipping Point,” Airwalk was a $16 million company in 1993. In 1994, it was a $44 million company. In 1995, it was a $150 million company. To satisfy the vast influx of teenage customers while keeping skateboarders and boutique shops happy, Airwalk developed a two-tier strategy. It sold cheaper, consumer-grade shoes to mainstream retailers like Footlocker while continuing to provide pricier, professional-grade shoes to boutique shops. But Airwalk’s success didn’t last. The company’s troubles began in 1997 as production problems led to limited back-to-school supplies. Meanwhile, its lineup had become stale, with few new models. Worst of all, Airwalk abandoned its professional line of shoes. Serious skaters dropped Airwalk, causing the brand to lose its cachet with teens, and it wasn’t long before Airwalk’s time in the sun was over. A smallish company exploding due to quality products and a hip ad campaign. A product line that split into both consumer and professional tiers to provide different price points and features. A company that was later plagued by production problems, stagnant product designs, and ignoring its professional market. Does that sound like another company you can think of? Airwalk might have skated along for a while with its old designs and made peace with retailers, but abandoning its key market of hardcore skaters was what drove it into market irrelevance. In terms of managing supply chains and industrial design, Apple has a pair of superstars in Tim Cook and Jony Ive (to the extent Ive is still involved in product design, anyway). And Apple no longer worries about disappointing retailers, having opened hundreds of its own stores. More concerning is how Apple is treating its professional users. Let’s itemize a few of the ways Apple has moved away from the professional market over the past five years: Killing the Xserve Dumbing down Final Cut Pro with Final Cut Pro X Replacing the pro app Aperture with the consumer-level Photos Increasing burdensome restrictions on Mac App Store apps Releasing a new Mac Pro without internal expandability Failing to update that Mac Pro for over 3 years Delaying updates to the MacBook Pro line for nearly 18 months Releasing a new MacBook Pro that has drawn criticism from professionals Showing a lack of support for automation by eliminating the position of Product Manager of Automation Technologies We’re not alone in saying that Apple is now the iPhone company (see “Understanding Apple’s Marginalization of the Mac,” 21 November 2016). That’s where most of its profit comes from, and so that’s where most of its resources go. Fair enough. But, here’s the thing: the Mac and the capabilities it provides to professionals are the foundation of that iPhone business. Die-hard Mac users kept Apple afloat in the dark years before the iPod and then iPhone. And even now, regardless of all other professional uses of the Mac, developers need Xcode on the Mac to create iOS apps. Apple still has many things in its favor: $241 billion in cash, massive profits every quarter, one of the most popular brands in the world, and nearly 500 successful retail stores. And it might seem odd to criticize Apple now, especially when the company just broke a quarterly record with the most iPhone and Mac sales ever (helped by new iPhone and MacBook Pro models, plus the holiday shopping season, see “Apple Sees Apparent Return to Growth with Q1 2017’s Record Results,” 31 January 2017). But as we saw with Airwalk, things could go downhill fast if professional users were to leave the platform, taking with them all the people and organizations they currently keep loyal to Apple products. I don’t want to be too hard on Apple. The company is still incredibly strong and is doing better in some areas where it has been weak. By many accounts, Final Cut Pro X has improved greatly since its initial release, and some professional movie makers are giving it a chance. App Store review times are plummeting, and Apple is planning to allow developers to respond directly to App Store reviews. Swift is an exciting new programming language with a bright future, and it’s suitable for both compiled apps and scripts. You might argue that Apple and Airwalk aren’t comparable. For instance, although it may have gotten its start providing athletic shoes, Airwalk ultimately became a fashion company. But isn’t Apple similar in many respects? Apple opened its doors with the Apple I hobby kit, and by the mid-2000s, the iPod and its white earbuds were fashion mainstays. The Apple Watch is clearly intended to be a fashion item today. Even the MacBook, with its prominent usage in coffee shops, airports, and other public places, makes its own fashion statement. Despite these similarities, Apple is a much, much larger company than Airwalk ever was. Plus, Apple is making so much money and has so much cash that it can afford many more missteps than a plucky young footwear company. Perhaps most important, Apple can learn from the example of companies like Airwalk that fell from grace after losing sight of their most influential users. Here’s hoping Apple realizes the danger of diverting too much attention away from the Mac and its professional users.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Josh Centers explores what Apple can learn from a once-mighty shoe company. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 10:37 Josh, I was thinking about this over the weekend, but came to a different conclusion. Relying on fashion is not the winning strategy for a company that is this large. Nor is relying on what used to sell - gizmos. I am an Apple computer/phone/watch/TV user. I'll probably buy AirPods. But as a stock holder, I don't want Apple to stay there. I want Apple to move into healthcare and financial services and be willing to abandon computer power users along the way. Shoes are a great analogy, they move to a diminishing market. I want Apple to thrive, and I think it is time to move out of the diminishing phone and computers business and into services. If I could delegate Apple resources, I'd put some of the best folks they have on healthcare and finance. What does that make the phone and Mac? Loss leaders in 2020. Important to have but not the future of the company. So I guess that I am hoping Apple does the reverse of your last paragraph. Thanks for letting me think aloud, Peter Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-06 13:46 There's a lot to be said for Apple and services, but it's a matter of convincing the right people to write up their thoughts for us. :-) I think Apple is making some smart moves in the healthcare and IT spaces, especially with its IBM partnership. But as someone who uses Apple computers professionally, I don't want to see Apple become like IBM, moving entirely out of the end-user market to focus on back-end stuff. The iPhone is still by far Apple's largest revenue source, and the Mac users who create things for it are the backbone of that market. Reply David   2017-02-06 10:38 The day that a teen puts a poster of Marco Arment on the wall of their bedroom is the day that I will believe that the professionals you're talking about with regards to Apple are comparable to Tony Hawk. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-06 13:46 Ha! Teens may not idolize developers, but they certainly enjoy the apps they produce, including maybe some of Marco's. You could argue that Snapchat today is what skateboarding was 20+ years ago, though that's sort of a lousy analogy. Another way to think about this is: imagine walking into a coffee shop and instead of MacBooks, everyone was working on Surface Pro tablets. Given enough scale, that'd certainly have a network effect. Something Gladwell describes in his book, which I didn't go into in the article, is how trends develop. You first have what he calls innovators, oddballs who do new things. Then you have other groups who translate those things for the masses, like mavens and connectors. My point is, to put it in Gladwell speak, if those innovators drop Apple for another platform, over time that could trickle down to the masses and quickly eat away Apple's bottom line. Reply David   2017-02-06 17:54 They may enjoy the apps, but I doubt that 1 in 100 of them know the name of the developer who wrote it. And that breaks the link between "I have to wear what Tony Hawk is wearing" and "I have to code on what Marco Arment is coding on." I can equally imagine -- in the coffee shop analogy -- the teens being horrified that the "old people" are using the same thing they are, and fleeing Apple en masse. Finally, I don't find Gladwell's arguments particularly convincing. He seems to me to regularly take a small part of a social science finding (10,000 hours of practice, eg) and blow it up into a much larger and simpler conclusion, one that makes a good pop-sci headline but doesn't really tells us much about the real world. The narrative at the moment seems to be that Apple is neglecting pros and that's going to cost them, but what I've mostly seen is a range of strained arguments about why it's going to cost them, ranging from possibly plausible to pretty outlandish. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:34 I agree about Gladwell, which is why I didn't go too much into his theories in the article. However, outside of the linked interview, his book was the best source for the Airwalk story. The problem with arguments in favor of the professional markets is that there are a lot of intangibles there. In the case of Airwalk, it likely made total sense to dump the pro skater market for consumers — I'm sure they made far, far more money from Foot Locker than local skate shops. However, that turned out to be an enormous mistake, one that wouldn't appear on any spreadsheet. Reply David   2017-02-07 10:44 I think I'd like to see more than an anecdote before I buy into a narrative that is highly convenient for the people telling and reading it. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 22:44 One might say the same thing about your arguments. There's a whole truckload of wishful thinking there. Just from a local perspective, the predominant healthcare provider in my area, Palo Alto Medical Foundation, has excellent computerized records and services. They work on Windows PCs, not Macs. Other medical professionals use tablets, though they're not iPads, because they have to link with their non-Apple computer systems. Which is to say, without a Mac backbone, medical providers are not going to be using Apple products and services. Sure there are some highly visible Macs on some popular medical TV shows, but again, those are the Macs you so blithely dismiss. Great product placement, by the way. As Josh says, Macs are at the core of Apple's business. Without the Mac, the iPhone is just another gadget, here today, gone tomorrow. You know, like the iPad. And without the Mac, there will be no Apple products in medicine. As for financial whatever, all Apple does now is provide an access point via Apple Pay for consumers to the real financial service providers. They don't actually provide any of those financial services, nor are they likely to do so. Though they make a tidy profit with every Apple Pay transaction. You want to buy a Mac on credit through Apple you'll be using a Barclaycard, one of the highest interest rate charge cards on the planet, to whom Apple is only an intermediate business. In other words, I don't think your ambitions for Apple growth are grounded in anything like reality. As for shoes being a diminishing market, what planet are you living on? As large third-world countries like China, Mexico and India grow more prosperous, shoes will continue to be a growth industry. Just like iPhones. Which is why Apple is working so hard to break into the Indian market with lower price, recycled iPhones. That's where the growth is for them—and for Nike. The iPhone is the primary driver for the App Store, Apple's most prosperous service niche. And the App Store sells apps. And apps for the App Store are developed on Macs. Without the Mac there would be no apps and no App Store and, for all practical purposes, no iPhone. And no Apple. While Microsoft's Surface PCs are not yet a dominant product, Microsoft is clearly thinking long term, hence their huge investment in product placement in the NFL. The Surface Studio is coming out this year and will eventually, I presume to predict, make a significant dent in Apple's base among design professionals. Unless, as Josh hopes, Apple begins to take their professional base seriously once again. If I were twenty years younger I would certainly take the Surface Pro seriously. I share Josh's hope, but I don't share his optimism. If the new MacBook Pro is Apple's idea of a professional computer, with only 16GB of RAM, they've lost their way big time. They've taken their obsession with thin well past the point of diminishing returns. In the meantime, Tim Cook is good at blowing smoke at financial analysts, but as has been pointed out elsewhere in this issue of TidBITS, Apple's record first quarter was a week longer than the same quarter last year. In other words, Cook is using accounting gimmicks to draw a false equivalency between the two. Adjusted for that extra week, Apple's sales and profits are far less rosy than Cook would have us believe. At best they are flat, year over year. Is Apple making lots of money right now? Sure. Even with no growth they're still a rich company with money to burn. But they don't appear to be burning any of it on serious R&D. Like, perhaps, a touch interface for the macOS that can compete with Microsoft. iOS does touch just fine. But Cook refuses to acknowledge the need for it in OS X. Apple is riding high right now. But there's an old expression, what goes up must come down. Put another way, in business if you're not growing, you're dying. Implicit in Josh's argument is the proposition that Apple may have reached the peak of it's growth and success. They won't fail overnight, but that doesn't mean they're not failing. If Tim Cook is not aware of that, as he seems not to be, then Apple will be going downhill from now on. There may be a blip of success here and there, but that won't halt the downward momentum. Tim Cook is a nice guy and Steve Jobs was a jerk. Still, some might say the biggest difference between them is the vision thing. Steve had it. Tim does not. But I think the biggest difference between them is that Steve Jobs would not tolerate mediocrity. Time Cook seems to tolerate it all to well. Thanks David for giving me a jumping off point for my rant. I would have made it anyway, but you gave me a convenient place to start. I agree with Josh's premise, but I'm more skeptical than he is. Josh is politely suggesting that Apple needs to return it's attention to the Mac and the wide range of professional users who depend on it. Unlike Josh, however, I feel no need to be polite. Tim Cook needs to wake the f*ck up. Reply David   2017-02-07 22:37 You're certainly welcome. None of what you said was in response to my actual points, enough that I was wondering if there was another David in the thread. Apparently not. If you'd like to engage with my actual arguments, you're welcome to do that, too. Reply Nicholas Croft  2017-02-09 20:19 The PC 'enthusiast' market (broad term, basically power users of yore) is the only growth/margin market in the PC business. Apple are leaving money on the table by not addressing the enthusiast. Reply Zac Imboden   2017-02-06 15:06 What a thoughtful and well-written analysis. Regarding Peter Meyer's comments, I understand that Apple has it's own unique needs. What I would add is that what may be good for Apple (i.e. corporate expansion, diversification) may not be good for end users, specifically Mac users. I wish Apple to succeed as a company only as far as it concerns how they can continue to meet my needs and not theirs, my needs, not as a content revenue stream, an iPhone user, an iPad user, but as a MAC user. It appears to me that there is no longer any strong financial incentive for Apple to support and innovate their computer hardware and software as that segment continues to shrink in comparison to phone and content revenue. Continuing to complain about ridiculous mistakes in design and implementation and continuing to beg Apple to innovate and improve in the areas which matter the most to Mac users are losing propositions in the long run. If Apple wanted to do a great service to its various "niches", in my un-expert opinion, it would spin off the Mac and its system software and core apps into a separate company and let that company focus and innovate to meet the needs of its "niche" of Mac computer users at its own pace and peril. I'm not a investment guru, so I leave the financial merits of spin-offs for others. From an end-user endpoint, it seems to be the only way to get someone to pay closer attention to the very specific needs of computer users. Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-06 18:39 I think that would be courting the death of the Mac, honestly. As I argued in my other comment, the halo effect runs the other way - more people are buying Macs because they have used and liked Apple's consumer products. I think the main reason Macs have been bucking the overall decline in the computer industry is because they have Apple's strength in the consumer market to support them. If you cut the link there, you cut the main driving force for Mac market growth. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:19 Thanks for the kind words, Zac. However, I disagree with Apple spinning off the Mac. Tight integration with other Apple devices is still one of the Mac's strengths, and a spin-off would threaten that. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:20 I agree that the popularity of the iPhone and other Apple products helps drive Mac adoption. No argument there, and I think that's also still an important market for Apple. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 22:49 If Apple could value the Mac well enough to spin it off, they could value it enough to develop it internally. The problem is Apple doesn't seem to care one way or the other. Reply Derek Roff   2017-02-06 18:17 While Peter's suggestion that Apple get out of the hardware business strikes fear into my heart, I think it also misses Josh's key message. Why should a prudent investor like Peter assume that Apple can compete effectively in Services? This is an area where Apple has no particular expertise, and no intrinsic advantages. There are dozens of companies who understand Services better than Apple, and have both a deeper background and more agility. Airwalk survived as a fashion company, barely, and Apple might survive as an also-ran Services company, but as Josh indicates, this looks like the path to obscurity. Apple is a significant force in Services at the moment, because they are rich from hardware sales, and incredibly well known, from their integrated hardware, software, and lifestyle sales. Tossing all that out is, as Josh says, a losing strategy. Apple will not make its investors richer by proclaiming, "Think Conventionally". Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-06 18:30 Sigh. Another day, another 'Apple is doomed because they aren't catering to Important Users Like Me' article. The glaring flaw in this example is that it argues that people are drawn to Apple's consumer products because of the popularity of their computers among the elite - the halo effect. But if anything, the halo effect has run in the opposite direction, and has since the heyday of the iPod. People are buying Apple's consumer products, like the experience, and buying Macs to go with them. I've argued this before: Apple has, from the very first Apple ][, *always* catered to the ordinary user above the elite. When 'personal' computers were bulky S100 boxes that needed a separate dumb terminal and the arcane C/PM OS, Apple released a cute, streamlined all-in-one that hooked to a TV and booted into BASIC. When IBM introduced the designed-for-cubicles PC, Apple introduced the novice-user-friendly Mac. When smartphones were geeky tools, Apple released the iPhone. That's who they are. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-06 18:44 So you're saying that none of your less-technical family, friends, or clients buy Apple hardware because of your recommendations? In my experience, most people who know they don't have the technical chops to make an informed decision buy based on social influence. Reply David   2017-02-06 21:27 Are his family & friends a sufficient sample to generalize? Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-07 04:51 Actually, seriously, yes. I've been asked for advice on *which* Mac to buy, but everyone I know who bought Mac in the last year decided to go that route on their own. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-07 10:11 This is a discussion, not a research study. :-) Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-07 10:10 I obviously don't know the specifics, but unless you're well known for being platform agnostic, I doubt people would ask you for advice on other platforms. Your social influence to recommend Apple products is likely well known. Lots of people ask me for my opinions about what to buy, but they're always aware that I know Apple technology. But the article's point is that if you'd said, "Apple's hardware is stagnating and you'd be throwing money away if you didn't look at an Android phone or Windows PC" would those people ignore you and still buy Apple gear? In other words, if you as a tech influencer switched away from Apple gear, how many people would go with you eventually, purely because of your influence? Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:22 I'm not arguing that Apple is doomed. I can't count how many times I've written here something to the effect of "Apple is far from doomed." However, I do think shirking the professional market is an enormous mistake. Nor would I want Apple to drop or lose focus of its massively successful consumer line. The professional and consumer sides of Apple help build its strong ecosystem. Reply David   2017-02-07 10:50 2 people would go with me. Which would reduce Apple customers for the last quarter from 96 million people to 95,999,998. Even if there were 50,000 tech influencers who took 2 people with them, it would reduce Apple's customers from 96 million to 95,900,000 last quarter. (all numbers either approximate (customer numbers, people I influence) or made up (number of tech influencers)). Math done badly and on the fly. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 23:26 I'm not arguing that Apple is doomed, either, though I'm more cynical on the subject that Josh is. For one thing, doomed is a vague and melodramatic term. If Apple fails to innovate and improve the Mac, then their base of support will be eroded over time because, as I said before, the Mac is the core of Apple's business. Without it Apple's other business interests would fail to flourish. And that's putting it mildly. In my opinion, without the Mac there is no Apple. But I don't see Apple killing the Mac. After all, it's still making money. What I see happening, as Josh points out in more polite terms, is that the Mac appears to be declining in importance for Apple. This doesn't spell doom, but it does spell stagnation. Meanwhile, Apple competitors continue to innovate. As an artist, the Surface Studio is the first Windows PC that has ever piqued my interest. If Apple continues to rest on it's laurels Microsoft is going to eat their lunch. Now that they are making good hardware, Microsoft is playing in the same ballpark with Apple. And, like macOS X 10.12.x, Windows 10 is a solid and accessible OS. And there are areas, like cloud services, where Microsoft far exceeds Apple's success. So do Google and Amazon. Services aren't going to save Apple's bacon. The Mac is the only thing that can do that, not because it makes the most money, but because it's central to the success of every other Apple venture. What I don't understand is why Tim Cook doesn't seem to know this. His desultory remarks about the future of the Mac are not encouraging. Another incremental update to the iMac or the Mac mini isn't going to get the job done. Nor are incremental improvements to the macOS. As I've said before, at the top of my wish list is a touch screen interface for the macOS. Without this it's very hard to see how Apple is going to keep up with the competition. Reply Christian Kaatmann   2017-02-06 19:21 The thing that Apple is certainly doing right now - seen from a user perspective - is that _all_ of their systems are much more reliable now than they used to be. I very rarely have to reboot, if one app crashes the rest of the system carries on unperturbed, I can go seamlessly from my Mac to my iPhone to iCloud on a windows machine without ever loosing a comma in the text I'm working on. It's like magic compared to not so many years ago. And Apple has got us all happily hooked on its services with iCloud at the centre. And I mean happily, thinking of the days back with Excel 1.04, swapping disks on my Mac SE or more recently trying to keep my iMac from crashing every time I switched from Mail to Word to Excel to ... Apple keeps a lot of customers happy and deeply dependent. Reply Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 19:31 That is a great point. Thank you! Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:23 Apple does enjoy tremendous lock-in, which certainly gives it staying power. iCloud is one of the weaker service bundles, but it's bolstered by the popularity of the hardware, which in turn benefits from iCloud lock-in. Not to mention dependence on iMessage. Reply Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 19:30 A quick addition if you don't mind. I am going to express my opinion, not fact. I don't think that Apple will abandon the larger Mac and phone and iPod markets (or TV or iPads.) I am looking at these devices as critically important. Not important as computing devices, but highly valuable as data devices. What is the difference? Computing takes place in a small fairly closed environment. Data is fed by and then feeds a larger system. (I think of the Mac Pro as being about computing, the iPad and Apple TV as being about data.) If I look at this as an investor, I see that data system as services with end point devices. The devices are either commodity products or are really sophisticated at handling data to and from the user. That data is the core of the future services. (Again, this is me as businessman, not as the guy who is really enjoying this MBP right now). Apple should, absolutely should, stay in the end point market and make exceptionally exciting devices like an iPhone so light that you need a lanyard to hold it in place. Those devices are data portals, and the real economic engine for what might be the most valuable company on the planet will be the data services. They actually might subsidize the hardware experiments that many of us love. For those hardware experiments, my credit card vibrates in anticipation. My business mind is looking for services in healthcare and automobiles. The hardware is what we know, the services that we do not yet know will be our future, just as the pocket computer once was. So much for me being quick. Josh, Adam, thank you! Reply Herb Bowie  2017-02-06 20:16 The analogy seems a bit contrived, and the conclusions a bit overblown. Part of what we have always loved and respected about Apple is its intent and ability to skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it is. If we think about these issues from that perspective, we might make the following observations: 1. As device buses get increasingly powerful, and as the pace of technology change quickens, and as the desire for smaller computers increases, it will make sense for users to do "upgrades" by adding or swapping out peripherals, not through changes to the internals of their computers. 2. As SSD, memory, networks and microprocessors all get faster, the simple desire for ever bigger numbers -- faster chips, more RAM, etc. -- becomes less and less relevant for most users. 3. While Apple needs to provide core apps and services to make the average consumer happy, Apple's primary contribution to the larger app ecosystem is to make better tools for developers, not to make "Pro" level applications themselves. 4. As security becomes more and more of an issue, tight controls on the App store become increasingly important; however, third-party software suppliers still have the ability to deliver apps to their customers outside of the App store, so customers can have the best of both worlds. 5. As it becomes easier and easier to develop Mac applications, and as the Mac development tools grow stronger, and as the number of specialized apps continues to grow, it becomes ever harder to see why the Mac would need a special department for "Automation Technologies" for those few users who cannot find already developed solutions to their problems, yet who are also unable to develop new solutions themselves. So, yes, in all these cases, there are some short-term bumps in the road for many of us, and some more difficult issues for a few of us, but isn't this what we've always expected from Apple? Reply mike sanders  2017-02-06 21:53 Excellent response and a much more focussed overview, great respect to Josh but like so many "old" Apple users you still expect them to be a computer company which they no longer are. I have been a user since 1987 and an investor since the 2000s and have to say I am completely satisfied on both accounts. A very well run company which clearly knows where it is going just that it doesn't share it with us until the time is right. Have you seen the stock price today? Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:25 Per your point on automation — I think Apple sees Swift as eventually overtaking AppleScript. That's fine with me, but Apple also needs to continue to create automation tools for professionals who aren't programmers. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 23:47 I agree. Unfortunately, Apple has a habit of dropping the ball on good ideas and technologies. For example, iWeb was overtaken by the competition because Apple lost interest in developing it. The same goes for Aperture. Now Apple Script and Automator are threatened with extinction, with no accessible replacement in sight. Apple Script and Automator enable the user to plug right into the OS and their applications. They are essentially programmable apps. Swift, on the other hand, is a programming language not an application. It's hard to imagine a third party developing a program with Swift that will have the broad capabilities of Apple's native apps. If history is any guide, apprehension is called for. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-02-07 00:35 You forgot bonehead moves like killing Apple Displays, AirPort, and now it looks like the iPad lines will be next. Possibly even the desktop Macs. Tim Cook needs to be canned. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:26 Indeed, I should have mentioned the loss of Apple displays and the apparent abandonment of AirPort routers. The latter is a thorn in my side at the moment, since my Express is on its last legs, and I'm distrustful of others on the market. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-08 01:06 Right you are. Both Apple Displays and Airport routers have been overtaken by the competition because Apple has apparently lost interest in supporting and improving them. This has the look of a tradition at Apple. Or a disability, like ADD. There was a time when third-party routers did not support the Mac with decent setup software. Airport routers solved that problem, though they tended to be less capable than the competition. They had the virtue of being simple. That time is past. Though various routers handle the matter differently, their setup software has improved. For instance, I can get into a Comcast router's built-in setup software with a simple URL, as I did with Linksys routers in the past. AT&T has always bumped me to a web site where I entered the appropriate information and the web site passed it to the router. This was particularly useful in the old days when routers and modem settings often got corrupted. If something went wrong, pop, there I was at the AT&T setup page. Nowadays routers are more reliable and such problems are rare—though not unheard of. Apple eventually improved the simple Airport Base Station by including a hard drive that interfaced easily with Time Machine—the Airport Time Capsule, an appropriate name at the time. And the Time Capsule has improved over the years with a space saving tower configuration and larger hard drives. Though you can still get the Airport Extreme which is a simple router without the hard drive. It's comparably priced with similar routers, except that you still need an external modem, which might be a disadvantage, unless you're used to setting up modems. That said, I don't know why Apple is apparently dropping their WiFi product line. They work perfectly well. Perhaps sales have declined as service providers now so often provide their own routers and independent modems are less common. Airport routers still require an external modem, which puts them behind the curve. I used to like a separate modem because they tended to fail more often that routers. But now I rent my router from Comcast and if it fails for any reason I just pop down to the Xfinity store and get a replacement. The same goes for AT&T. I haven't had occasion to set up an Airport router in years. Still, I don't think it's a good reason not to get a replacement Airport Express if your Airport Extreme orTime Capsule is still working OK. Current models have the fastest WiFi, 802.11ac, and they are still for sale on the Apple web site, as is the Airport Express. Replacing the Express seems to me to be simpler than regigering your entire system with a new router and a new repeater. But then if your router is also having issues, there are less expensive alternatives to the Airport, depending on your setup. Reply Jean-Pierre SMITH  2017-02-07 04:37 Great analogy and thinking, for the Mac platform. I liked the idea the combination of (1) techical brilliance, as seen by the recognised "experts" and (2) some hype (better call it "intelligent design") is a key factor of success for the Mac. Remove one of the two pillars and the structure collapses. To remember, I still have on my LC-475's screen saver (not used any more) the picture of a snail carrying on its back a rival PC's Intel CISC processor. These old macs used Motorola RISC processors, deemed faster by the "experts". You may have called to the bar Michelin, whose tyres for trucks (trucking fleets are the tyre equivalent to the Mac's "expert" users) are in demand for their durability (mileage), while car drivers don't measure mileage but simply benefit from it without knowing. Car tyres benefit directly from R&D invested in truck tyres just as the Mac for me [ordinary Joe] directly benefits from the Mac used, misused and challenged by its professional users (the "experts"). I am not so sure, though, the above analogy works for the iPhone, iPad and iWatch lines (is it still true that the iPhone for the Presidents is called "Blackberry"?). Thanks for the brain teaser. Reply Nicholas Croft  2017-02-09 20:13 The PC 'enthusiast' market is the only one with growth. Sell the OS for $500 - restricted to 6 core+ (ie X99) motherboards, only from (a few) vetted vendors. No manufacturing costs. Pure profit once initial outlay of programming is covered.

Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here NEW DELHI: The Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) is optimistic that the iPhone maker Apple would soon be able to start local production through its contract manufacturer and take advantage of India's readily available skilled workforce. "We are supportive of Apple's proposal (to manufacture in India)," MeitY additional secretary Ajay Kumar told ET, adding though that a final decision is yet to be taken on the issue. Beyond devices, Apple's mobile payment service also ties in well with India's move gradually shifting to a less cash economy, he added. On January 25, a six-member Apple team led by its vice president for operations Priya Balasubramani am and government affairs head Ali Khanafer, met central government officials including the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP) to discuss the concessions Apple sought. The Tim Cook-headed company has sought fiscal concessions, including customs duty waiver on the import of components required for local manufacturing. "This is not uncommon when companies ask for certain incentives to start production," Kumar said. A major hurdle is with Apple's demand seeking a 15-year exemption on countervailing duty (CVD) on imported components, a demand India may find difficult to accept under the soon to be rolled out goods and services tax (GST). Revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia recent ly told ET that there can't be individual exemptions under GST which will subsume central taxes such as central excise, service tax, countervailing duty and state taxes including value-added tax, octroi and purchase tax. It is expected to be implemented from July 1. Countervailing duty is levied as part of import duty in lieu of central excise duty. But DIPP, which is anchoring the Apple-government talks, recently indicated that a way could be found with some tweaks to existing policy but stressed that any change will be for the industry as a whole and not for any one company. Kumar rejected allegations by the local industry of government bias towards Apple, saying it's too premature. "We have not reached any decision yet on Apple's demands. But we are hopeful about the discussions that are going on," he said. Karnataka has already confirmed that Apple is planning to commence initial manufacturing operations in the Bengaluru's Peenya industrial area, which will "foster cutting edge technology eco system and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally". Kumar said the proposition to manufacture in India is significantly superior to what it was two years back, with the country offering scalable manpower and industry-based skills that could facilitate large-scale customized production operations. He expects Apple's contact-manufacturing partners such as Taiwan-based Foxconn Technology Group and Wistron Corporation to invest big in India. "Apple recognizes India as a very important and growing market and Digital India with digital payments gives further push to it," the top official added. He said the smartphone giant could tap India's growing appetite for digital transactions and may expand mobile payment and digital wallet platform Apple Pay to India. Globally, Apple is pushing its Apple Pay service and its user base surged three-fold in 2016 with a 500% growth in transaction volume year-on-year. The payment platform is currently available in 13 markets and was recently launched in Russia, Spain, Japan and New Zealand. Apple did not respond to ET's e-mailed query.

Photo by Jeff Zelevansky/Getty Images It is the middle of February. The last football season just ended. The next one is miles off in the distance. It is freezing outside here in the northeast, feeling like a ridiculous 6 degrees outside in upstate New York. I think we could all use a heart-warming thought that will make us look forward to the next New York Giants football season with a smile. So, here’s one. ESPN has posted a list of 10 2016 rookies poised to make a leap to stardom in 2017. Three of those players — Eli Apple, Sterling Shepard, Paul Perkins — are Giants. So, thinking about the progress those three players could make next season should provide you with happy thoughts about the 2017 season. Let’s look at some of what ESPN’s Matt Bowen, a former NFL defensive back, said about each player. Eli Apple Apple has the size (6-1, 199 pounds), top-end speed (4.40-second 40-yard dash) and man-coverage ability to make a big jump as a second-year pro, based on what I am watching on film. The skill set is there, and so is the length in a press position. Apple is going to challenge routes and use his hands at the line of scrimmage. And he flashes the transition speed to close on the ball. Plus, he tackles. Think of a physical, press-man cornerback who is going to compete outside. The next step is to become that playmaker when the ball is in the air. Finish at the point of attack. ... The way I see it, there is a lot of room to grow with Apple, and I believe he has a high ceiling as a cornerback in this league. This is a guy I would love to coach. And with an entire offseason to train like a pro (no combine prep), Apple can make the jump in his second year. The talent, the size, the physicality? That's what I want in the secondary. Great job playing through the hands!!!! Eli Apple! pic.twitter.com/zeZzzgTxZK— WeAreDBnation (@WeAreDBNation1) January 8, 2017 Sterling Shepard Shepard (5-10, 194 pounds) is a dynamic talent who can create matchups for the Giants due to his electric footwork, route running and speed in the high-4.4 range. In 2016, Shepard produced 65 receptions for 683 yards and eight touchdowns. And with the Giants expected to move on from receiver Victor Cruz, look for Shepard to make even more plays in 2017. He will get a lot of one-on-one coverage working opposite of Odell Beckham Jr. Aligned inside or outside the numbers, Shepard can create matchups with his lateral and vertical speed. Go inside the film room w/ @Schmeelk & @davediehl66 for a look at @sterl_shep3's rookie season! WATCH: https://t.co/umenMcyZkE pic.twitter.com/bmNX5sy5QU— New York Giants (@Giants) January 23, 2017 Paul Perkins Perkins' lateral ability is off the charts. He can make a linebacker miss in a phone booth and then find a crease to burst up the field. This guy is lightning quick. In 2016, Perkins (5-10, 208 pounds) rushed for 456 yards on 112 carries (4.1 yards per carry), and he also caught 15 passes for 162 yards. Decent numbers, but the tape is telling us that he can be a weapon for the Giants' offense next year. Think of the nickel runs (three-receiver personnel), the quick option routes and the screen game. The Giants' rushing attack was an issue last season. But Perkins' ability gives New York an opportunity to create specific game-plan opportunities to get him the ball.

John Donovan and Steve Mullane from BlueFin Research Partners told the outlet there is “some indication” the Big A is ramping up production for its next-generation smartphone ahead of schedule, with plans to start supply chain as early as June. “The most awesome stage” Last year, Facebook's VP of Design thought the TNW Conference main stage was the best she'd ever been on. FIND OUT WHY The sources further say that, while Apple could indeed begin putting together its revamped iPhones in advance, this might not necessarily lead to any changes in the usual fall release period. Here’s what BlueFin wrote in its report: The most intriguing data points that we have uncovered suggests that AAPL is ramping the next generation iPhones earlier than historical norms, although we have no indication that there has been any change in release plans for the iPhone 8/X. Donovan and Mullan further add that overall quarter builds for this year have increased from 45 to 48 million compared to last June. As MacRumors remarks, moving up the production date seems like a logical decision given the radical changes expected in the iPhone 8. This will not only give Apple a wider window of time to sort out manufacturing issues, but also provide better supply upon launching. It also ought to help them avoid technical issues like the iPhone 6’s battery woes as well as the much-dreaded ‘Touch Disease.’ Among other things, Apple’s next-gen flagship handset is slated to come in an all-glass design with a stainless steel frame as well as an all-new OLED display. via MacRumors Apple Building ‘iPhone 8′ Earlier Than Normal, It Would Appear, Says BlueFin on Barron's Tech Trader Daily Read next: If all you have to do is get out of the way, where exactly do you go?

Hopes to Grow Its Services Business to $50 Billion by 2020 We focus on a high growth segment that helped to push the company's results over the top in its latest report and what investors can expect next. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Feb 10, 2017 at 1:00PM Services continue to be an increasingly important segment for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), in part due to the recurring nature of the revenue it produces. In this segment from Industry Focus: Tech, the cast discusses how Apple plans to double the size of this business over the next four years. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Feb. 3, 2017. Dylan Lewis: One of the segments that is gaining more and more attention from analysts and the market in general is Apple's services segment. This is the iTunes Store, the App Store, Apple Pay, Apple Music, TV App Store, etc. Services, this time, came in at $7.2 billion, which is roughly 9% of revenue. But, perhaps more impressively, it was up 18% year over year. It seems like the company and the Street are both giving this a little bit more emphasis as time goes on. Evan Niu: Yeah. And that was a quarterly record, one of those records they set this quarter. If you look at it now on a trailing 12-month basis, services has now crossed $25 billion, in terms of the size of the business. So this is a huge business already. Here's the crazy thing: They're very ambitiously saying they're hoping to double the services business within four years. That's saying, "We think we can make this a $50 billion business by 2020." Which is pretty ambitious. As far as how they'll get there, they highlighted a couple things. First of all, now, there are 150 million paid subscriptions that are being automatically billed, recurring subscriptions. That includes Apple's services as well as third-party services. But that's the total number that is being billed through iTunes and the App Store right now. That's a pretty big number. They do expect that to keep growing. That's a pretty big base of regular subscriptions of various types of services that they sell. Transaction volumes are going up, the installed base is growing. There's really all these different aspects of it. They even mentioned -- this is kind of surprising -- the iCloud storage business is growing quite a bit. I would never have thought it would be a growth driver. But, basically, all these different aspects are really putting up good growth, and combined, they're really bullish about this going forward. It's a pretty ambitious goal there. Lewis: Yeah. Looking at the inputs of what makes up that services revenue, there's momentum on both sides. Not only is the installed base is getting larger -- so, the number of people that are actually somehow transacting with the services segment -- they indicated in the call that that's increasing in the strong double digits. Also, the ARPU (average revenue per user) for each paying customer is increasing in the double digits. So it's not that one side of that equation is really crushing it and the other one is stagnating. Both sides are performing well. And I think that's what you want to see.  Niu: Yeah. And they also had mentioned the music business, which had been declining for quite some time, for many years. Before Apple got into the streaming side, when it was all the download business for music, as people shifted toward streaming, that business was shrinking. Now, we're back to this inflection point where music is growing again. If you include both download and streaming -- so both iTunes plus Apple Music -- if you combine them, the music business as a whole is now growing again. That's always nice to see, particularly as the shift toward streaming continues, more and more people are willing to pay. The industry itself really likes the shift to paid streaming versus ad-supported streaming. And Apple is a big proponent in that transition. That's also another good sign. They are really helping the music industry grow as a whole, as well as their cut of the whole music business growing again. Lewis: And you have to like that, considering that they are, what some people might argue, kind of a late entrant into streaming music. You already had Spotify with tens of millions of people using it, and you might have wondered what adoption might have looked like for Apple Music and the streaming service. But results seem to be pretty good so far. Dylan Lewis owns shares of Apple. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Mobile 4 0 0 February 10, 2017 iPhone X With Over $1000 Price Tag To Feature Wireless Charging & OLED Screen? Venus Montalbo Apple will reportedly release three versions of iPhones this 2017 and one of them – rumored to be the special 10th-anniversary edition – will have a price tag north of a thousand U.S. dollars. The long-standing speculations about Apple’s next iPhone models are saying that the upcoming releases will include the iPhone 7S, the iPhone 7S Plus and the anniversary model, the iPhone 8, which is also unofficially referred to as the iPhone X. A post from Fast Company described the iPhone X to be the “ultimate iPhone” as it is expected to feature very high-end specs. So if the iPhone X’ specs will be too advanced; tech fans can also anticipate a significant price hike from the Apple smartphone. The iPhone X or the iPhone 8’s price is most likely to be set for more than $1,000, Fast Company reported citing “a source with knowledge of Apple’s plans.” Considering the price tags of the recent iPhone models and the expected specs and features of the iPhone 8, one can easily assume that Apple will offer a costlier tenth-anniversary iOS phone. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] The iPhone 7 Plus, for instance, with 256GB storage is available for $969 in the United States or €1,119 in Europe, according to GSM Arena. As for the specs, the iPhone X could be a 5.8-inch iOS handset with OLED touchscreen and could sport a “button-free design with an edge-to-edge OLED screen with the home button somehow built in,” the report added. Moreover, the iPhone 8’s side buttons could be substituted by “touch-sensitive inlays in a metal frame with a glass back,” Engadget explained. Talking more about the possible iPhone X design, Fast Company shared the following. “As rumored, the sides of the iPhone 8 will likely be made of forged stainless steel, a less expensive material than the aluminum used in current iPhones. The back of the iPhone 8 is expected to be made of glass rather than metal, our source says, confirming previous reports.” Apple’s 2017 top-of-the-line smartphone could also feature the 3D-sensing technology from Lumentum, which could be applied in various functions including facial recognition, enhanced camera performance by providing better image resolution, and for augmented reality features. What do you think of this iPhone 8 concept? https://t.co/AGQhPapabs pic.twitter.com/TLH3sU8qdJ — TAXI (@designtaxi) February 6, 2017 Furthermore, there’s a recent news update which strengthens speculations that the three iPhone models in 2017, including the iPhone X, will sport a wireless charging functionality as one of its features. Popular analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, who noted that wireless charging increases smartphone’s internal temperate, explained how the Cupertino-based tech giant will prevent the iPhone 8 from failing because of overheating. MacRumors cited the following statement from Kuo’s research notes. “While we don’t expect general users to notice any difference, lamination of an additional graphite sheet is needed for better thermal control and, thus, steady operation; this is because FPCB is replaced with film, which is more sensitive to temperature change of the 3D touch sensor in OLED iPhone.” Unlike the iPhone 8, which is expected to sport an OLED screen, the two other upcoming iPhone models, the 4.7-inch iPhone 7s and the 5.5-inch iPhone 7s Plus are said to be equipped with LCD displays. Meanwhile, when it comes to camera specs, a dual-lens primary snapper can be expected from both the iPhone 7s Plus and the iPhone X. As for possible release timeframe, there are rumors that the iPhone 8, alongside iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus could arrive earlier than the usual launch pattern. However, Fast Company believes that Apple won’t be doing so and will instead stick to its release tradition, announcing its new smartphone products in the fall. Are you excited to see Apple’s iPhones for 2017? Here’s one of the most recent iPhone concept videos posted on YouTube. The Inquisitr will keep you in the loop for more release, price tag and specs rumors about the alleged iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus and iPhone 8.

Bailey claims Australians are using Apple Pay more frequently than customers in any other countries, which she said "is in large part due to Australia being a recognized global leader in contactless payments and usage." That's good news for ING Direct and Macquarie, which have announced they will enable support for Apple Pay in Australia by the end of February. Both banks are listed as "coming soon" on the Apple Pay website in Australia, alongside ANZ, Bank Australia, Beyond Bank, P&N Bank, and over 30 other smaller banks. Bailey's comments, made in an interview with the Australian Financial Review, appear to be directed towards three of Australia's "Big Four" banks that refuse to accept Apple Pay, namely Commonwealth Bank, NAB, and Westpac. The fourth bank, ANZ, has supported Apple Pay since April 2016. The trio of banks, along with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, instead turned to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in an attempt to gain access to the NFC hardware in the iPhone. The banks want access to the NFC chip so they can offer their own existing bank-run mobile payments services. "While initially, in many markets, there have been banks that have initially been wary about working with a company as large as Apple, once they begin to work with us and understand the Apple Pay platform, they see the benefits of it," said Bailey. "That hasn't fully happened with the ACCC applicants, because the conversation is happening through the ACCC process, compared to what normally happens, which is we have the conversation bilaterally."The ACCC denied rejected the application from the banks in November as part of a draft ruling, and its final decision will be announced in March. Last year, Apple told the ACCC that "allowing the banks to form a cartel to collectively dictate terms to new business models and services would set a troubling precedent and delay the introduction of new, potentially disruptive technologies." Apple upholds very high security standards for our customers when they use Apple devices to make payments. Providing simple access to the NFC antenna by banking applications would fundamentally diminish the high level of security Apple aims to have on our devices. Unfortunately, and based on their limited understanding of the offering, the [banks] perceive Apple Pay as a competitive threat. These banks want to maintain complete control over their customers. The present application is only the latest tactic employed by these competing banks to blunt Apple's entry into the Australian market.Earlier this week, the banks said they are fighting to provide "real choice" and "real competition" for consumers. The application has never been about preventing Apple Pay from coming to Australia or reducing competition between wallets. It has always been about providing real choice and real competition for consumers and facilitating innovation and investment in the digital wallet functionality available to Australians. Apple's statement that the application is fundamentally about an objection to the fees that Apple wish to be given rather than NFC access, is incorrect and unsupported.Despite the ACCC negotiations and apparent ill-will, Bailey said Apple still wants "to work with the banks in Australia to bring Apple Pay to our customers, in a way that advantages many of the things they are offering through their banking apps, which we have done already in other markets." "That's why the announcement about these new banks is important and we are continually on that path – because as more banks get on the platform, I think there is more of an industry understanding about how Apple Pay really compliments their services," she added, referring to ING Direct and Macquarie. Commonwealth Bank, NAB, Westpac, and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank reportedly serve two-thirds of Australian cardholders.

Here in NZ most banks are Aussie-owned, so we get mostly the same choices plus some independents. ANZ is therefore the only one with Apple Pay. I opened an account with them the day it was announced and use it exclusively where available, and find myself avoiding shops that don't accept it if possible. I hardly use my other cards now.

How Apple's New 'Spaceship' Headquarters Expresses Steve Job's Vision Four months before he died, late Apple CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs revealed his company's plans to build a gigantic circular building which was soon dubbed the Apple Spaceship. This slide show discusses how the new headquarters, which is nearing completion, expresses Jobs' vision. The Gigantic Facility Will Accommodate Thousands of Employees Apple Campus 2 will be downright monstrous when it’s complete. The facility will span 2.8 million square feet and will accommodate up to 14,200 employees (though it’s estimated that 13,000 employees will be there). It’s sitting on 176 acres of land and the spaceship itself will be more than a mile around. Campus 2 Was Steve Jobs Last Great Project Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs played a critical role in making Apple Campus 2 a reality. He had a hand in designing the facility and placed demands on the architectural team to ensure the facility would match his vision. He also was the most vocal supporter for the project and worked with the City of Cupertino until his death to get it approved. It's Designed to Run on Green Power Apple’s new campus will rely solely on renewable energy. Solar panels, fuel cells and design features will deliver all the power the campus needs—and it will need a lot. It’s part of a broader effort by Apple to act as a leader in “green” initiatives around the world. Apple Will Have a New Home for Events Apple traditionally has used its current campus for some press events and hosted other, larger gatherings at venues including the Moscone Center in San Francisco. But Apple Campus 2 will have an auditorium large enough to host major events. Its Construction Will Cost Billions Apple hasn’t released a final estimate on construction costs, but the price tag will be hefty. Apple initially hoped to spend less than $1 billion on the facility, but soon boosted those estimates. As of this writing, it’s believed Apple Campus 2 will cost Apple more than $5 billion. Apple Will Consolidate Some Locations Since Apple Campus 2 will be both bigger than its current campus and able to house more employees, Apple reportedly plans to shutter some of its offices and move those employees to the new facility. However, Apple also plans to maintain its current campus at 1 Infinite Loop in Cupertino. An HP Campus Occupied Part of the Site Apple’s campus site has some history. Hewlett-Packard once had a campus at the same location. But Apple’s facility will be downright forest-like (approximately 7,000 trees) and put more employees into more environmentally friendly space. Apple’s Obsession with Detail Is Apparent Apple’s obsession with detail is on full display at Apple Campus 2. For one, the Spaceship is a big round building with curved glass throughout, and will be home to the world’s largest piece of curved glass. And a recent Reuters report noted that Apple required tolerances much lower than the standard 1/8 of an inch and even placed those demands on “hidden surfaces.” The Campus Will Have Many Nice Amenities The campus will include bike paths, several restaurants and a state-of-the-art fitness center that will be open to employees all day, every day. The company is hoping to turn Apple Campus 2 into a community. When Is Apple Moving In? The big question on everyone’s mind is when Apple will move into the facility. While the company itself hasn’t announced a move-in date, it’s expected to get into its new digs sometime this year.

Right now, construction crews are putting working to complete the new facilities prosaically called Apple Campus 2, but is generally known as the Apple Spaceship, a gigantic circular building located one mile east of the company's original campus. It was dubbed the spaceship as soon as the architectural plans were presented to Cupertino city planners in mid-2011. Around the Spaceship, employees will have access restaurants, a fitness facility, bike paths and more. Campus 2 was the brainchild of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs who first disclosed that the company had quietly acquired nine contiguous properties totally 176 acres to accommodate the company's ambitious plans. With a huge courtyard in its center that includes an orchard, the spaceship isn't designed as place to pack in as many employees as possible. It's designed to perhaps inspire them to be more creative and productive. This slide show will describe in more detail "spaceship Apple” and the amenities that will be available to Apple’s employees when they move into the sprawling facility later this year.

Not from their TVs, though, because that’s already happened. According to Cult Of Mac, the next three iPhones could feature wireless charging. The site cites KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who claims that iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) as well as the tweaked versions of the iPhone 7 we’re bound to get will be free of chargers. “All three models will reportedly boast new Apple wireless charging tech, rather than the feature being limited to a high-end OLED handset,” Cult Of Mac’s source claims. There are no specifics on the new powering mechanism, but it already sounds like Apple’s phones are about to get expensive as fuck (well, even more so). The wireless charging technology would heat up the phones more, necessitating a “new graphite layer to protect the 3D Touch sensor from being damaged.” That feature will probably also be required because the glass casing the new iPhone’s expected to have is not very good at dissipating heat. But that glass casing is needed for the wireless charging to work, bringing us right back to where we began. Those 3D Touch sensors and cord-free charging will reportedly come at a price to the consumer, of course. Kuo says the new production requirements could prompt a 30-50 percent increase in cost, with the top-of-the-line iPhone model going for as much as $1,000—or, roughly the cost of a new Macbook Air.

The incident led to a recall and subsequent one year investigation by the California Department of Public Health. The outbreak began in October 2015 when a number of people complained of becoming sick from drinking unpasteurized cider consumed at High Hill Ranch in Camino. The illnesses were thought to be caused by cider that had become contaminated with E. coli bacteria. Following those reports, High Hill Ranch issued a press release indicating the sicknesses may have occurred when someone with an existing illness used the public cider sampling station as this was the first time in 50 years there had been a problem with the juice. Later, Jerry Visman, owner of High Hill Ranch, ordered a voluntary recall of High Hill brand apple juice purchased on or after Oct. 6, 2015. The CDPH collected additional laboratory samples from High Hill Ranch on Oct. 21, 2015, and found them to be negative for the presence of E. coli 0111. Visman also submitted his apple juice to an independent lab for testing and on Nov. 3, 2015 announced that the juice samples were negative for E. coli and the juice was safe to drink. Because of the nature of the outbreak, the CDPH conducted a study that was done in collaboration with the environmental management division of the El Dorado County Community Development Agency. According to the final report, the CDPH identified a total of 15 cases in three California counties with illness onset dates ranging from Oct. 12-19, 2015. The cases were all infected with Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) bacteria. The Sacramento County Department of Health and Human Services staff completed food history interviews with three initial cases and determined these individuals had all visited Apple Hill between Oct. 9-12, 2015, and had consumed unpasteurized apple cider at High Hill Ranch. As additional clinical cases emerged, local health departments questioned patients about any visits to Apple Hill, specific ranches visited in Apple Hill and what foods the patient consumed at each location. All clinical cases interviewed had either visited High Hill Ranch in the Apple Hill region and consumed unpasteurized apple cider; or had not visited Apple Hill, but consumed unpasteurized apple cider that had been purchased from High Hill Ranch. CDPH staff collected and reviewed traceback documents in order to determine the sources for apples used to produce High Hill Ranch apple cider. This traceback investigation concluded that High Hill Ranch received and pressed apples from three apple suppliers during the period of time prior to the cases’ exposures. Staff also conducted assessments at the farms that supplied apples used as ingredients for High Hill Ranch cider as well as High Hill Ranch. The teams observed evidence of animal intrusion at each of these farms and feces samples were collected from two of them. Three confirmed case patients and a single unconfirmed case patient had leftover cider that they had consumed before they became ill. CDPH staff collected these leftover samples. One of the cider samples (from a confirmed case patient) tested positive for E. coli that had a pattern that was indistinguishable from one of the outbreak strains. Investigators were not able to determine the exact cause of the outbreak, but observations were made of suspect conditions in the cider processing facility and at the apple farms. These included both animal intrusion and unsanitary conditions, according to the report. In the course of the investigation CDPH officials collected 60 environmental samples from the High Hill processing area, nine environmental fecal samples from the ranches assessed, 11 finished and in-process product samples and four case patient product samples. Two samples of cow feces tested positive for STEC; however it was not the same strain as the outbreak and did not have the same pattern as the outbreak strain. In conducting the investigation, the CDPH determined that the unpasteurized apple cider produced by High Hill was the most likely source of the E. coli that caused 15 illnesses in California. A single sample apple cider collected from a patient in Sacramento County tested positive for E. coli and the pattern of this sample was indistinguishable from one of the patterns found in case patients in the outbreak. Based on that, the report states that officials believed that the unpasteurized cider produced by High Hill Ranch was the most likely source of the outbreak. The environmental assessments conducted at the High Hill Ranch apple pressing facility identified several unsanitary areas and the potential for contamination of the cider through multiple routes. Evidence of animal intrusion was seen in all three of the orchards investigated. One of those had cows immediately adjacent to and uphill from the orchard and two samples of feces from that pen tested positive for STEC. While the samples did not match the outbreak strains, pathogen transfer by animals or water to the apple orchard was deemed possible by state investigators. The report went on to conclude that, “The outbreak centered on a small range of production dates and was likely the result of a single contamination event and not a sign of a harborage within High Hill Ranch’s pressing equipment or a larger failure in their system.” CDPH and El Dorado County staff worked together to provide recommendations to High Hill Ranch and the two other apple suppliers and to assist the ranches with identifying and correcting suspect conditions so any future illnesses from consuming High Hill Ranch unpasteurized apple cider could be prevented. The improvements included sanitation of equipment, exclusion of animals in the processing facility and the use of deer fences and other deterrents to keep wildlife out of the orchards. On Aug. 9, 2016, county and state inspectors conducted an inspection of High Hill Ranch’s cider operations prior to it opening for the 2016 season. Most of the planned repairs, corrective actions and upgrades had been completed. Greg Stanton, director of the Environmental Management Division for the county, said staff regularly inspects High Hill Ranch and other facilities before the season opens and sometimes will do it during the season as well. Visman was contacted for a comment but was not available at press time.

Blog :  Majority of Organizations Don’t Have Risk Management Plan Article :  Gain More Control of BYOD Apps with an Enterprise App Store Apple’s Class-Action Lawsuit: Never Intentionally Break Your Product Rob Enderle |   Unfiltered Opinion   |   Posted 10 Feb, 2017          |         |     Share Apple has been sued for allegedly breaking FaceTime on iOS 6 and iPhones running earlier versions of iOS in order to cut costs and force upgrades. If this turns out to be true, it will be far from the first time I’ve seen this strategy implemented. And it always has turned out badly. Let’s talk about why you never intentionally break a product in order to extort money out of a customer. (The word “extort” should be your first clue.) Intentionally Cutting the Phone System The first time I ran into this kind of behavior was at ROLM Systems. A large enterprise customer didn’t feel it needed a service contract and discontinued it because the ROLM telephone system never broke. Telephone systems tend to be pretty reliable. So, an enterprising tech remotely logged into the customer’s phone system and disabled all of the company’s trunks. This was before cell phones and the result was that the expensive phone system became an internal-only intercom. It turned out that our CEO sat on that company’s board. To suggest he wasn’t pleased by his enterprising employee is an understatement. I’ve only ever seen one guy fired more quickly than this tech was. Making Customers Feel Mistreated In the late 1990s, one of the biggest complaints Microsoft got was that its pricing was very hard to figure out. Steve Ballmer took fix this problem as a personal challenge but, in the process, it was discovered that a huge number of companies weren’t paying for the licenses they bought, with some companies responsible for millions of unpaid obligations. Even though it wasn’t Microsoft’s intent to extort money from these firms, that was how its collection efforts were seen. This formed one of the strongest foundations for efforts to divest from Microsoft and invest in Linux. It was also one of the major reasons Ballmer wasn’t successful as a CEO, and it wasn’t even intentional. Negative Results When a company intentionally harms a customer in order to force that customer to give it money, it not only is likely actionable, but it breaches trust. In addition, people do not want to do business with firms that do them harm and they tend to have a really long memory with regard to this kind of behavior. Planned Obsolescence A variant is called “planned obsolescence,” which is when premature product failure or an inability to make what otherwise would be easy repairs are built into the system. This practice only works if the customer is locked onto your platform and can’t easily move to something else, kind of like an Apple user. Apple has been accused of this before and this seems to be a recurring practice at Apple. It has even been sued for planned obsolescence, so it’s hardly new. Customer Abuse In the best case, this is customer abuse, in the worst case, it is basically extortion: Buy what we want you to buy when we want you to buy it or we break your device. Generally, with the exception of the new T-Mobile lady, customers don’t want to be abused, and they hate having vendors extort money from them, but if the switching cost is high enough, they will tolerate for a time. The really bad news for Apple is that if the customers eventually do switch, they will not easily switch back. That is something that IBM discovered in the 1980s when it figured it was a good idea to release buggy products and then charge customers to fix them. IBM went from the most powerful company in the tech market to having a fired CEO and being put on deathwatch in a very short few years. Wrapping Up: Stop Abusing Customers This kind of a practice doesn’t bode well for any company. Apple had already begun a process of massively cutting the cost out of its products and it is currently threatening to raise prices. Add to this the possibility that customers could come to believe that Apple is taking extreme advantage of them and you have the potential for a massive migration to something else. Right now, according to Consumer Reports, LG has a product in market better than the iPhone for $200 less. That is not a formula for success. Apple may become yet one more example of why you should never intentionally break the products you sell. Ever! This also speaks to why I’ll never again use an Apple product.

BeatsX are finally here, and will the Apple TV ever be relevant? by Brian Tong 5:17 Close Drag We've only got about seven or eight months to go before Apple introduces its next iPhones and there's been some chatter about Apple putting out three new iPhones instead of the usual two, with one being a super high-end model with prices for it approaching $1,000 in the U.S. Now the site MacRumors is reporting that an analyst from KGI Securities, Ming-Chi Kuo, is claiming that all three new models will not only feature all-glass casings but wireless charging and OLED displays. In a research note obtained by MacRumors, Kuo says that wireless charging increases the internal temperature of smartphones and Apple will be equipping the new iPhones with a new 3D Touch module with "additional graphite sheet lamination" to prevent the phones from overheating and wigging out. We take all these analyst claims with a grain of salt, but the wireless charging rumors have been fairly persistent and it does seem like a logical feature that Apple might add to the next iPhones, whatever they're called. All that said, Apple could simply come out with "S" versions of its current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. As you might expect, Apple didn't have anything to say about Kuo's research note. It does not comment on rumor or speculation. 13 iPhone 8: Most-wanted features Share your voice 0 comments Tags Apple Phones More stories LG G6 teasers emphasize battery life, artificial intelligence LeEco's one-day sale includes phones, large-screen TVs Sprint pushes crazy-cheap deal, but there's a catch Best Phones of 2017 Close   Discuss: All new iPhones will feature wireless charging,...

Of that amount, $16.2 billion came from China, making it Apple’s third-largest geographical region for sales. That total from China was nothing to sneeze at. But it was also a 12 percent decline from the year-ago period, which was when China was Apple’s second-biggest revenue location. That’s not the direction Apple wants its Chinese sales to go. And it doesn’t help the company that Apple is also dealing with questions from the Chinese government about reports that some iPhone 6S phones sold in China are suffering from malfunctions that cause the smartphones to shut down when their batteries reach the 30 percent power level. Apple officials reportedly met with the Chinese Consumer Association this week to discuss the matter. What makes Apple’s visit to China notable is that the CCA is a “watchdog” group with close ties to the Beijing government. Chinese officials are said to have questioned Apple due to their concerns about security issues with electronics products made by foreign companies, as well as China’s efforts to grow, and promote, its own consumer-electronics companies. According to a report from Quartz, Apple told the CCA that it doesn’t believe there are any safety issues to be concerned about with the iPhones shutting down, and that the company would replace any phones affected by the technological glitch. The iPhone 6 battery problem is not limited to China. U.S. iPhone users have also been complaining about the issue. In November, Apple offered to replace certain iPhones’ batteries for free. In December, the company admitted the problem was affecting more devices than it had announced.

Beats X bring Apple’s wireless headphone tech to a tethered form factor Posted 15 hours ago by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story Subaru is the latest to get a self-driving test licence in California It’s hard to say precisely what took Beats X so long to arrive. Unlike Apple’s own house-branded AirPods, the company didn’t really start from scratch. Sure, it’s a somewhat new form factor, but the wireless earbuds don’t stray all that far from the company’s existing lines. But nearly six months after being announced, the headphones arrive this week. As promised, Apple hasn’t done too much to mess with the line’s successful formula under its watch, though, as with a number of other already launched Beats products, the company’s thrown in a few extra bits that sweeten the deal for macOS and iOS users. Sure, you’ll be able to use them with any Bluetooth-capable device, but, as ever, Apple’s all about the ecosystem, and, as such, some tweaks like the addition of Lightning charging and the W1 chip ensure that Apple users will get more out of the buds than the competition. Flex-form factor It’s easy to see why the Beats X got overshadowed at launch by AirPods. Design-wise, the headphones don’t stray too far from existing offerings from companies like Jaybird and JBL — earbuds tethered with a cord designed to wrap around the back of the wearer’s head. In fact, they’re not all that different from the Powerbeats3, though the X move the hardware from the over-ear hook casing to the cord itself, re-distributing the weight in the process. The cord itself has also been lengthened a fair bit, designed for more of a yolk-like effect, with enough slack for the cable to sit on the wearer’s shoulders. The back of the cable is what the company calls “flex-form,” a semi-rigid material that can be sculpted to better fit the contours of the neck — kind of like a wearable pipe cleaner of sorts. The cable houses a small panel below the left earbud that features a microphone for calls, volume controls and a small panel that activates Siri when held down. The rest of the hardware has been moved to a pair of oblong plastic modules that sit on either side of the wearer’s neck. The right side has the power button and the left a Lightning port for charging, with Apple further placing its mark on the product. That means that charging is plenty quick, but you won’t be able to top it off with the far more ubiquitous USB-C technology. If you’re an iPhone user, however, you likely already have plenty of Lightning cables in a drawer already. Behind the neck The cable system feels a bit awkward at first, but actually fits pretty comfortably, thanks to a lightweight design and good distribution. I was able to wear them with minimal rubbing, but things got a little more awkward when wearing a jacket, requiring a bit of maneuvering to figure out the best spot to position all of that extra slack. For my money, I would take a good look at the Powerbeats. I prefer the over-ear design and smaller cord — particularly as someone who goes running several times a week. The Beats X do a decent enough job staying in place, particularly when you employ the included secure fit fins (which come in two sizes and are generally more comfortable than those offered by much of the competition), but the Powerbeats do a much better job staying out of the way — a good quality in a pair of workout headphones. What the additional cord slack does afford, however, is quick access to the control/volume buttons. It also lets the user dangle the headphones around their neck when out of use, like a necklace. Beats has also built magnets into the backs of the buds themselves, so they snap together securely when out of use. This keeps them out of the way, but close by, making them easier to keep track of than Apple’s infamously losable AirPods. Chips ahoy Like the Powerbeats before it, Apple’s most significant contribution to Beats X is easily the W1. The chip is the same as the one found in AirPods, and really does enhance the experience, circumventing annoying Bluetooth syncing — for Apple users at least. The whole process is ridiculously simple. Fire up the headphones and a card pops up on your Apple device. Click “connect;” that’s basically it. As long as it’s connected, you’ll see a small headphone icon in iOS next to the battery icon. Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to check the headphones’ battery level. Of course, you can still connect with an Android device, but the experience isn’t nearly as seamless. The headphones get solid range, as well. I was able to walk all throughout my New York City apartment without losing the connection. I did, however, run into a few issues outside, when the connection randomly dropped a couple of times. It mostly re-paired itself, but it was a nuisance, particularly in the 20-degree weather, when I had to take the phone out and re-pair it manually. X-perience The new Beats deliver a decent sound experience for a pair of wireless buds. The company seems to have taken some of the emphasis off of the driving bass of earlier models in favor of a fuller experience, which is always welcome. Isolation has been improved, as well. The result is a solid pair of Bluetooth headphones — not the nicest sound I’ve heard on a wireless pair, but surely good enough for listening to music on the go for most. If you really want to settle in with some music, you’ll probably want to shell out for a pair of over-ears, but the Beats X are perfectly suited for the commuter. The battery is rated at eight hours, and I found I was able to get a solid day’s use out of the things, no problem. And when it comes time for a refill, the Lightning cable does the trick pretty quickly, with a couple of hours’ worth of life after a five-minute charge. Beating the competition GET IT HERE Shop ▾ What is this? Amazon Shop buttons are programmatically attached to our reviews. TechCrunch receives revenue for shopping activity generated by the links. Because the buttons are attached programmatically, they should not be interpreted as editorial endorsements. At $150, the Beats X are just a hair under the AirPods. In spite of the company’s big “No Strings” ad campaign, they’re ultimately not as flashy as Apple’s primary offering, lacking some of the more refined interface and noise-canceling design. They’re also notably pricier than a number of comparable wireless headphones. You’re certainly paying for branding here, though the inclusion of the W1 chip is a nice addition for any on iOS. From a pure form-factor perspective, I prefer the Powerbeats, which do a better job staying out of the way and keeping in place when you go for a run. But the solid sound, good battery life and form factor add up to a good overall wireless headphone experience for users looking for an AirPod-like experience in a more conventional package. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Beats Electronics Founded 2006 Overview Established in 2006 as the brainchild of legendary artist and producer Dr. Dre and Chairman of Interscope Geffen A&M Records Jimmy Iovine, Beats Electronics provides a premium sound experience at every touch point of the consumer’s life.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple surpasses PayPal, now accepted at 36% of U.S. merchants according to recent study Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Wednesday, February 8th, 2017, 05:10 Category: Apple Pay, News, Samsung PayPal has apparently fallen as the leader among U.S. merchants and Apple Pay has taken its place. Per NFC World, Apple today sits at 36 percent versus 16 percent a year ago. PayPal, by contrast, is being offered by 34 percent of merchants. Both Apple and PayPal are trailed by MasterCard PayPass (25 percent), Android Pay (24 percent), Visa Checkout (20 percent), Samsung Pay (18 percent) and Chase Pay (11 percent). Notably, Samsung Pay can be used at businesses that don’t officially support the platform. The data found that about 22 percent of businesses are planning to adopt Apple Pay within the next 12 months, whereas 11 percent are expecting to support it in the next 1 to 3 years. Roughly 31 percent, according to the study, are waiting to see how things shake out in the long term. Apple has faced a number of hurdles in the pursuit of U.S. merchant adoption of its payment platform. In the cases of major chains which still haven’t come aboard, a good number cited the cost of upgrading to sale terminals with compatible NFC technology. Small businesses are potentially more flexible, though the extent of their Apple Pay adoption is unknown. Recently Apple and Square partnered to promote the latter’s compatible card reader. During a recent results call, Apple said that global Apple Pay transactions were up 500 percent year-over-year in the December quarter, backed by triple the number of users. As always, stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

The report also claims that Apple is still planning an iris scanner for the new iPhone. Apple has requested its chip and component suppliers start trial production, inspection and prepare inventories for the new iPhone series earlier than usual, said the sources. Deliveries of chips and parts for the new models are expected to kick off in the second half of first-quarter 2017, the sources indicated. While the report suggest Apple will begin production early, it’s likely that Apple is still aiming for the early September announcement for the device. It’s possible that Apple will begin production early to meet what’s expected to be greater demand than usual for the device. The report also notes that wireless charging will be coming to the next generation iPhone, which has already been widely rumored.

The company upped its fall iPhone count for the first time in 2014 when it released the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and it followed suit in 2015 with the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, then again last year with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Rumors now suggest that the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will both be released this coming year as expected, but a third new model will debut as well. It might be called the iPhone 8, iPhone X or something else, but whatever Apple chooses to call it, this will be the iPhone that garners the most attention in 2017 thanks to a bold redesign and a number of exciting new features. Now, yet another new feature may have been revealed in a report on Friday. Don't Miss: This iPhone 8 concept running iOS 11 is the stuff dreams are made of If all the reports we’ve seen so far from trusted sources pan out like they have in previous years, Apple’s new tenth anniversary iPhone is shaping up to be the most exciting new smartphone the world has ever seen. The same might be said of every new iPhone that launches each year considering how many handsets Apple sells, but this year we’re in for something special. Reports from sources with very good track records suggest that the iPhone 8 will be redesigned from the ground up. Apple will seemingly do away with the aluminum housing from the iPhones 6, 6s and 7, and will move to a design that features glass on the front and back with a stainless steel mid-section. The home button will be removed for the first time ever on an iPhone, and the Touch ID fingerprint scanner will reportedly be embedded underneath the new OLED display, which is expected to take up much more of the phone’s face than Apple’s LCD screens have in previous years. Now, it also looks like the security offered by Touch ID will be further enhanced by the addition of an iris scanner. Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 was the first widely available flagship phone to ship with an integrated iris scanner, but the phone wasn’t widely available for very long; Samsung had to recall the device due to faulty batteries that caused many Note 7 phones to spontaneously catch fire. The South Korean electronics giant is expected to include its new iris scanner in the upcoming Galaxy S8 as well, and now Digitimes reports that Apple will add an iris scanner to the iPhone 8 this fall. It is currently unclear how Apple plans to utilize the iris scanner in the iPhone 8, if this new report is in fact accurate.

Robert Scoble, tech evangelist and co-author of “The Fourth Transformation” wearing his Microsoft HoloLens. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) Virtual and mixed reality technology is developing even more rapidly than many anticipated. For some, that’s a nightmare scenario, a foreshadowing of a dystopian future and a loss of human connection. For others, it is an immense opportunity. Robert Scoble falls distinctly in the second category. A blogger and tech evangelist, Scoble has been a vocal advocate for virtual and mixed reality, making the case and explaining the implications of these emerging technologies in the new book he co-authored with Shel Israel, “The Fourth Transformation: How Augmented Reality & Artificial Intelligence Will Change Everything.” On a recent episode of the GeekWire podcast, Scoble spoke with editor Todd Bishop and reporter Taylor Soper about his vision for this technology, and he says the future is closer than we think. “I predict within three years I’m not using a phone very often,” he said. “I’m using mostly [mixed reality] glasses, because with glasses you get as many virtual monitors as you want.” Scoble also predicted that Apple will announce a new line of mixed reality-enabled devices this year, and noted that platforms like Microsoft’s HoloLens and the Google-backed Magic Leap have been ramping up with engineering talent and funding for their mixed reality devices. “You’re starting to see a lot of companies spending a lot of money at this new world coming at us,” he said. And while relatively clumsy technology of the past has given mixed reality a bit of a bad rep — anyone remember Google Glass? — Scoble said upcoming technology will be mind-blowingly realistic and easy to use. “These glasses that are coming put virtual stuff on top of the real world. The Google Glass didn’t do that, and that’s part of the problem with Google Glass. The night I got them home, my wife said ‘Oh, do these show me anything about the people I’m going to meet?’ Because that’s the expectation, that it’s going to overlay information about things, and people that you are looking at. And the [new] glasses will do that,” he said. Listen to the podcast above to hear our full conversation with Scoble, or download the podcast as an MP3. Keep reading for an edited transcript of the interview.  Robert Scoble. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) Todd Bishop: So this book is called ” The Fourth Transformation.”  What were the first three briefly, and then, what is the fourth and how is it going to change the world? Scoble: For me, this is the fourth transformation of our personal computer age. Right? We started out in our journey down this path, if you are old enough, on an apple 2, with a character mode interface. And you would have to type commands to talk to the computer and make the computer do something. DOS is another example of this. And then the second transformation was when we went to GUI when the Macintosh came out in 89 and we used a mouse to click on icons. And the third one is mobile phones, particularly when we went to touch, the iPhone. And, that meant you’re carrying the computer with you and you are touching it. And we wrote a book called “Age of Context” about that world. And this one is mixed reality, or next generation augmented reality, where you are going to wear some glasses, so it’s going to overlay the interface on top of the real world. So you can use your hands, your eyes, your voice to control the computer. And that let’s you do all sorts of weird things like, virtual reality. Bishop: So you and Shel make some very bold claims about this in the book, and I think people have been been somewhat — they have been somewhat skeptical of this since Google Glass did not do as well as many people thought. Scoble: Yep. Bishop: But you’re saying, that eventually. It may take a couple decades, but eventually people will be turning to their glasses and experiencing a world. Scoble: I don’t think it’s two decades either. Bishop: So, increasingly they will be doing things through their glasses instead of their phones. Defend that case, because I think there are some skeptics out there. Scoble: Well, it’s hard to get the future when you haven’t seen it yet. And fortunately I have been going around R&D labs and companies like Lumus who’s making new kinds of optics and understanding where theses glasses are coming from. And I have interviewed the founder of PrimeSense that Apple bought out. Scoble: Let’s talk about apple, because I think that will take this conversation into a an interesting world. I believe in June, Apple going to announce more new technology than it has ever announced in it’s history. Bishop: Okay, so first off. Why June? WWDC, World Wide Developers Conference?  It’s hard to get the future when you haven’t seen it yet.Scoble: No, they are opening a new headquarters, which is a massive headquarters. It’s the most modern building in the world. It was built — designed and built with more technology than any other building, from what the people who built it told me. And they said when you walk in, you are going to be able to control ever room by using gestures. So every room has a 3D sensor in it. Every room is set up for next reality. So that’s the fist. Right? So they are going to bring us to that new headquarters in June or September, because they are already moving into it. And it’s going to be mostly one in June, and completely done in September. In June you are going to get invited to this new building first. Second, it’s the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, of receiving an iPhone. And, there is a lesson in their by the way. Because the first Iphone release was announced in January and we didn’t get it until June. And that will be the case with these products. They are keeping them very secretive because they don’t want pictures of these things leaking. And it’ll be apparent why in a second. So and along with that, they’re going to announce a new iPad, three new iPhones, a new TV product, a new watch, a new 3D map, a new Siri. And new glasses, all concerning augmented reality. And Tim Cook has been signaling to this for — since last June. And every week he has been in the press talking about how important augmented reality is to the world. And he is signaling that a big thing is coming. He has spent more that 10 billion dollars doing this, and spent 7 years of his life doing this. So, what is coming this year is going to be a massive deal. And that is going to wake everybody up. And then we are going to see: is the Hololens better than the Apple one? Is the Magic Leap better than the Apple one? Is the Facebook one better than the Apple one? Is the Snap one better than the Apple one? Bishop: So you think that Apple is going to be much as it was with the iPhone, the pace setter in the new world of mixed reality. Scoble: Yes. Yes. Bishop: Wow. Taylor Soper: And you think it’s going to be glasses that they are going to announce. Scoble: Well they are going to show a clear iPhone. So the three iPhones going to do mixed reality. They all have a 3D sensor from Primesense, they have 600 engineers in Tel Aviv working on that sensor. And four years ago when I saw that sensor it could tell how hard I was pressing on a table from three feet away. That’s how detailed it is, right. And you’re going to see a whole new realm of AI. Because that sensor is going to see stuff on your table in front of you, separate it into objects and then start looking things up. So, you can make Skrillex come out of this La Croix can and give a performance right on your table. I mean that’s where we’re going over the next decade. We’ll see how much of that arrives this year. But I think a lot of it is going to arrive this year, because it’s not just Apple. It’s Microsoft, it has 1800 people working on Hololens and it’s betting their whole company on the user interface of mixed reality. Snap is making many, many hires, right? Google just bought a company called Eyefluence which is in the book, for eye tracking and glasses, that tells me Google is building glasses that are separate from Magic Leap, which they also invested half a billion dollars in, right? And so, boom, boom, boom, boom. You’re starting to see a lot of companies spending a lot of money at this new world coming at us. Bishop: So, what do you say to the skeptics who say, ‘hey look, yes all these companies are making these bets, but in the end users are not going to want to immerse themselves in a whole other world’? Or these point clouds, as you talk about in the book. I think for people, it’s a bit of a leap for them to think about immersing themselves in alternate realities. What do you say to those skeptics? Scoble: Well, the market place is spending hundreds of billions of dollars to bring these things to you, and they will have some real advantages. Forget all the holographic stuff that Hololens is doing. Just getting as many screens around you as you want. So, let’s say you are a financial trader. Right now you are working in front of five screens cost? So, now you are talking about 2500 for five monitors around you. Well, what if you want to do that while you are walking around, or on a subway, or at a beach or at a party? Well, now you can wear those Apple glasses and get those same five monitors around you and be running your business on matter where you are. Bishop: So there is this company called Envelop VR, that had that exact plan. They shut down, they couldn’t make it. So doesn’t that speak to the fact that — Soper: But they aren’t Apple. Bishop: They’re not Apple, Okay.  I predict within three years I’m not using a phone very often. I’m using mostly glasses because with glasses you get as many virtual monitors as you want.Scoble: They’re not Apple, and these glasses I’m expecting are going to cost less than 500 dollars and they are going to be two ounces, and that’s a real important factor. Some where around two ounces. I’m seeing lots of glasses that are about four ounces that will get announced this year, with lenses from Lumus and from Vuzix and other places. But those are all stuff contained. Apple, I’m hearing, is going to put all that stuff down in the phone in your pocket or in your purse and you are going to wear glasses that have very little compute power on them, to make them really light and make the batteries on them really small, but last a long time. And so, we are going to see differing philosophies, right? Microsoft Holo ones might go in a little bit different direction. Magic Leap will go in a completely different direction, and then we’ll see, we’ll see. Bishop: So I know there is tons to talk about. What do you get most excited about, what’s on your mind on this topic? Scoble: You know at CES — I just came back from CES and Sundance to study this new world — and I saw these Lumus lenses. Now Lumus is a little start up nobody has ever heard of from Israel, and all they make is optics. I’m showing you a pair on my phone right next to the Snap Spectacles. Now, Snap Spectacles don’t have any screens in them, and the Lumus lenses in them have a 720p monitor on these lenses and they’re the same size. Which is why I believe this stuff is happening this year. It’s not just coming from Apple it’s coming from all sorts of places. Bishop: So it’s a tiny display embedded in the glasses and of course when it is that close up it looks like it’s actually big. You know there was a company, I think they might still be around, that did this on contact lenses too. Scoble: Yeah, those are farther away. Bishop: Yeah. Scoble: People ask me that all the time — when are we going to get contact lenses, or when are we going get brain jacking in. I mean, if you are blind you are already getting brain jacking in. It cost $150,000 to have surgery like that. And it comes with some downsides, because you are going to touch the optic nerve. And if they do that wrong well, it’ll screw stuff up, but if you’re already blind you are willing to take those risks because you are going to get sight maybe where you don’t have any sight today. And those techniques will lead down the path to figuring out how to jack in for far less money. But, that’s down. Bishop: Down the road. Scoble: It’s like 15, 20, 25 years. I can’t see that far. We all know it’s coming. But, you know — when? But the next decade is going to be about glasses. I don’t see how you’re going to do anything other than glasses in a mass market way anytime soon. Soper: I’m think I’m still one of the skeptics. Let’s talk about Google Glass little bit, because we were talking about this last night. And you’ve tried the Google Glass. There is a famous picture of you in the shower with them. Scoble: Yeah. Soper: What was wrong about those, both from maybe hardware and software and why is it different now with all these other new specs? Scoble: First of all, what’s coming on the market is completely different than Google Glass. Google Glass was just a little small screen up on the corner of your eye that would show you notifications, like you know, take a left turn on this corner. Or, hey your wife just wrote you on Facebook messenger. Real lightweight, not what we are talking about. What we are talking about mixed reality is you’re going to be having Aliens coming out from your walls. That all ready happens with my Hololens. Bishop: That happens every night at my house. Scoble: Well, you know. Bishop: Or is that — that’s something else though. Scoble: You know, it is legal in Seattle!  The next decade is going to be about glasses. I don’t see how you’re going to do anything other than glasses in a mass market way anytime soon.Scoble: These glasses that are coming put virtual stuff on top of the real world. The Google Glass didn’t do that, and that’s part of the problem with Google Glass. The night I got them home, my wife said ” oh, do these show me anything about the people I’m going to meet?’ Because that’s the expectation, that it’s going to overlay information about things, and people that you are looking at. And the glasses will do that, that are coming out, but not Google Glass. And then Google Glass just was early. The batter life only lasted 45 minutes. The camera on it was compressing in software, so it was blurry. It wasn’t as sharp as a GoPro for instance — blah, blah, blah. Those problems are all going away at some level, or they are going to be avoided. I keep hearing rumors that the Apple glasses have no camera in them other than the 3D sensor, which is a form of a camera. But, we’ll see, you know. Because Apples trying to avoid the privacy problems with these, Right? So we’ll see there is going to be different philosophies. Snap is going to put two cameras in these things and give you 3D. Bishop: What do you think about Snap, because I think a lot of folks, and of course for people who don’t know this is the parent of SnapChat. They have rebranded themselves as basically a camera company. Which seems a little dubious to me, but do you think — are they a legitimate player in this space? Because it seems like a novelty. Scoble: The glasses are the best way to create media for snaps. So if you care about looking cool to 20 year olds, you are going to be getting this. Bishop: Not really. Scoble: Well you don’t care, but there’s a lot of people out there who do care. There’s a lot of brands who want to meet 20 year olds and talk them into using their toothpaste and stuff like that. Bishop: I care about 20 year old GeekWire readers. Scoble: Well, there you go. Bishop: And should-be GeekWire readers.  The glasses are the best way to create media for snaps. So if you care about looking cool to 20 year olds, you are going to be getting this.Scoble: So, most of those people are on Snap or Instagram, instead of Facebook or Twitter. So if we want to reach them, we have to start channels and media properties for them. And if you’re going to do that, then you are probably going to get a pair of Snap Glasses because they are going to create the best media for that channel. And that’s a great way to look at it: that’s the camera for that channel. And if you want to use Facebook, you are going to use a different channel. Bishop: Yeah, well, that’s interesting — do you see a place for smartphones in this new world? Because you know a lot of the initial VR experiences are smart phone based, you just put it in the headset. Scoble: I predict within three years I’m not using a phone very often. I’m using mostly glasses because with glasses you get as many virtual monitors as you want. At home I have five monitors sitting on my desk — virtual monitors that look real — when I am wearing the glasses they look like real monitors, they are real monitors. Bishop: What are you using a Vive or something? Scoble: Hololens. Bishop: Like a developer edition. Scoble: Yeah I have it right here. They say it’s a developer edition, it’s just too expensive for consumers. Scoble: And too heavy and too dorky, right. Great for the GeekWire. Bishop: It’s perfect. Scoble: It’s perfect right, everybody who has a Hololens marks themselves as a geek right now. But soon those big things are going to be small. And then, we find out where the fun is really. Because I’ll wear a really light weight pair of glasses a long time. Hololens is really hard to wear for longer than an hour. Soper: The form factors still bugs me. At the dinner, we were at this VR dinner last night and two people brought out their Snap Spectacles and they are these sunglasses and they took, you know video of each other. But for me, I don’t want to have to bring my glasses or put on glasses when I’m at dinner, I just want to enjoy it, or use my smartphone to do some things. Scoble: Let’s talk about the game. Because I just spoke to the sports teams. Soper: Yeah, this is interesting. Scoble: And they are already putting sensors around the stadium to track every player in real-time. And you are going to wear the glasses and you are going to look at, you know, who’s your favorite player? Soper: Damian Lillard, on the Blazers. Scoble: All right, so you are going to have a look at Damiam Lillard, and as he is doing his sport you are going to see stats on top of him, how fast is he running. If he gets hit, how hard was that hit, you know. We can predict even by the time the ball leaves his hand, is that shot going to be made, right? Because we already have missiles — technology to figure out whether a missile’s going to hit anything right, before we shoot it down and spend half a million dollars. Bishop: I think only Steph Curry’s shots can be qualified as missiles.  I keep hearing rumors that the Apple glasses have no camera in them other than the 3D sensor… because Apples trying to avoid the privacy problems with these.Scoble: Well, in football there putting a sensor in the ball it’s self to watch its spin rate as it leaves the quarterbacks hands. I mean, that’s what is about to happen. So you are going to wear these glasses while going to NASCAR, going to a football game, to see a football game in much better detail. Plus you are going to be able to say, you know what, I’m tired of these bleacher seats. Because that’s all I can afford. So, can I click on Bill Gates’s glasses and see it from his point of view?  Possibly. And certainly, if there is a Nokia 360 camera next to him, you can choose that camera and sit next to Bill Gates for a while. Bishop: So, one company that has not yet come up — which I am surprised by, because the last time you stopped by here they were maybe first on your list — Amazon. Where are they in this world? Scoble: They are working on it. They’re not — Bishop: Do you know things? Scoble: Yeah, I mean, I know people — Bishop: We have ways, Robert. Scoble: I know people who are working on it. And it’s too big of a deal for Amazon to ignore anyways, because this is going to change shopping malls and shopping. An their competition is working on it, so of course Amazon is working on it, not to mention they have some real advantages in this world. Because we are already buying everything off of Amazon. My book is published by Amazon so. Soper: Well you mentioned yesterday, if I had my glasses now and I’m looking at your book here, looking at your jacket, I could just instantly buy it. Just by looking at it. I’m sure Amazon is thinking that, right? Scoble: Yeah. And that exact thing was show to me by the founder of Eyefluence who got sold to Google. So we’ll see what Amazon is up to. Amazon doesn’t need to move fast because we don’t have that expectation — that they are going to be the computer that we are going to use. We have that expectation with Google, with Android and Apple, with ISO. But Amazon could be a disruptor here. It will be fun to watch, how amazon comes into this market. Bishop: We’ll they’ve got Alexa, so it seems like there will be a natural confluence between voice technologies, machine learning, artificial intelligence and this new world of mixed reality. Scoble: Yeah. Bishop: So wouldn’t that give them a leg up in a inroad if they have that system?  If I had my glasses now and I’m looking at your book here, looking at your jacket, I could just instantly buy it. Just by looking at it.Scoble: It could, and they have a lot of media, as well. Which you are going to want to play in this new world, because this is going to be how you watch TV. This is personalized TV, right? When you are wearing two or four ounce glasses only you see what you’re watching, and you get as big a screen as you want. So why am I watching a 60 inch screen over in the corner. Why don’t I just grab it with my hands, make it bigger and put the screen where ever I want to around me. And that’s what’s coming with mixed reality. You know, that’s why the TV product is going to be interesting. Because you are going to have to buy the new TV, the new iPad, the new iPhone, the new watch and the new glasses. This is $3000 worth of Apple stuff coming at us. Bishop: Well maybe you don’t actually have to get the new TV, maybe you can take that out of the equation. Scoble: No, you’re still, your going to want the TV box because it has the PrimeSense sensor on it. Now why do you want a 3D sensor on your TV or sitting next to your TV? Because it can aim at your body and now you can do full body VR. You can do kick boxing or yoga or anything that requires you to use your legs and your hands. Right now, all the VR tools use only hands, so that HTC Vibe that I have in my house or Oculus rift they have sensors that watch your headset and your hands and know where those things are in space. But, coming soon, where are you going to get full body VR. Bishop: As you are describing it seems like Kinect was kind of the equivalent of the black and white era, in a lot of ways. Scoble: And where did Kinect come from? It was licensed from PrimeSense. Bishop: PrimeSense, that’s right. Scoble: Which Apple bought. Bishop: Although Microsoft would — the people who were on that team with Alex Kipman would get into a knock down drag out argument with you over that. Scoble: I know. But you know what, they did license their technology from PrimeSense. Bishop: They did, yes. Yes. Soper: Yeah, I’m curious — Robert, obviously you are somewhat excited for this future, but are you worried about anything? Are you scared? Or are you just supper psyched about it? Bishop: Have you met this man? Scoble: Battery life. Soper: Battery life? Scoble: I’m worried about battery life, because these batteries are going to be really small and the processors are really small — everything is really small. Bishop: Wireless charging. Scoble: Wireless charging is going to be a big part of this, right? And I hear Apple has some cool stuff coming, some next generation wireless charging. We’ll see if it shows up. Bishop: Nathan Myhrvold and Intellectual Ventures, they showed how to do this last week with meta materials, it’s one of their new things to check out. Scoble: There we go. So I keep hearing this kind of stuff. That wireless charging is coming. Broadcom at CES for two years now has been showing me wireless charging pads, where you can hold a watch or a phone over it, and even a foot away from it and it will still charge. So, I hear there are newer technology than that coming. So we’ll see. Bishop: But to Taylor’s point, privacy and loss of human connection would be two of the top concerns people would have. Scoble: You mean dressing up the SpongeBob is a little weird? Bishop: Wait, I’m sorry what did I miss? Scoble: Because with next reality I can do anything visual that you can dream up. Anything! Soper: Is that good or bad? Bishop: At that point I’m not going to want to be experience the real world if I can make the virtual world anything I want. Scoble: Well, first of all the AR world is the, their is stuff on top of the real world, so you are getting mixture, this is why I call it mixed reality. Bishop: Yeah, you guys use that phrase, MR is the phrase you use. Scoble: And, whether it gets call that at Apple we’ll see. I doubt it. Apple will come up with some trade markable — Bishop: iWorld. Robert Scoble, wearing his developer edition HoloLens. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) Scoble: Yeah, Apple world, you know. But there is a lot of truth to that. We should talk about these new 3D maps that are coming out. But in my Holo’s I play a game called fragments. Where you map out your room with the glasses and then it puts murder in your room and you have to solve the murder with clues that are on all the walls. And there are even little virtual rats that run around your feet. And it is freaky as hell. But this shows, when you get mixed reality, you are going to mix reality. Some things are going to be virtual and some things are going to be physical, and in 10 years it’s going to be really hard to tell the difference. Maybe less, right? Bishop: Because even the physical objects will have IP addresses, they will be kind of natural citizens of the virtual world. Scoble: Not to mention, think about what the marketers are going do with this. You are going to walk into a hotel and see an augmented hotel. You are going to see a coke can that’s augmented, and Skrillex is going to pop out of the coke can and give a performance right in front of you and then jump back into the coke can. Your car companies are all thinking about this. Mercedes Benz is already thinking about giving you a pair of mixed reality glasses in the glove compartment so that when you blow out the tire you are going to put on the glasses and its going to show you how to change the tire step by step. And it’s going to watch you to make sure you did your work properly. Did you turn the lug nuts hard enough, and enough turns. And it can watch that, and it can give you Pokemon points when you do it right, if they wanted to. Bishop: So if you look at it this way in terms of people creating their own reality. Frankly, our President is decades ahead. Scoble: Oh, absolutely. Bishop: Just fashioning his own environment. Scoble: Why do you think I am so into VR? Because VR solves both physical and emotional pain. And it’s really hard to get into one of the creations I saw at Sundance and think about work, or think about troubles with your family, or think about politics. It’s really hard, it why we all go skiing and snowboarding, or surfing. Because in those activities your in a high flow state activity, and it’s really hard to focus on your troubles. And VR is permanent skiing. It’s fun. Soper: Permanent skiing, I like that.  Why do you think I am so into VR? Because VR solves both physical and emotional pain.Scoble: Yeah. Because you’re shooting your friend in paintball and you’re forgetting your troubles. This is why I got into VR. Anyways, at Bowing, up the street, they have hundreds of HoloLenses and they are teaching people how to fix jet engines with these things. This is the best education technology humans have ever invented, and it teaches you in real time when your doing something, and it’s not — you don’t have to go to a classroom for a week anymore. You just go, they give you the glasses, you go to work. And it shows you — on top of the jet engine — the steps that you need to take to fix that Jet engine. And it checks your work as you are doing, so it makes sure that you screwed that screw in properly and it won’t fall out in the middle of the air, right. Bishop: One of my favorite HoloLens demos early on was the electrician demon, or the plumber demo, where the plumber is sitting at his or her office scrolling on a tablet, the consumer in the home has a HoloLens on and is literally seeing, annotated in front of them, how to fix the plumbing. Based on what the plumber is doing. To your point, I mean, there is lots of different business applications here too. Scoble: Absolutely. Disney’s new theme park in Shanghai, China. I’ve been to it, it’s beautiful. It was all built in VR. Fords new cars, you go to their R&D labs, they use VR to build cars now. They don’t build clay models anymore as often, because they are really expensive. And if you want to change the fender design on a clay model it takes you a week to re-shave the fender. Now it takes you a few seconds on, in VR. You just aim at it and you change the shape. Bishop: So you’re saying, basically, that the benefits are going out weigh any negatives. Scoble: Yeah. By far, on this one. And that’s why I know that this is going to happen fast. When people get their HoloLens on their face and realize just what mixed reality does for them, they just are floored. My son calls it his super power. Soper: And you think, speaking of Hololens, earlier you talking about how Satya, CEO of Microsoft is betting, you said something like betting the whole company’s future on Hololens? Scoble: Yeah, when I was at Gitech, all you saw on the front door was Microsoft Hololens. They are betting a lot on it. Because they know this user interface is going to be usable by a lot more people, even illiterate people can use mixed reality because it works the same way as the real world works. As a two year old you learn to pick up a can or a pencil very early in life, and that’s the skill you need to work in VR or AR.  It’s zero instruction learning, I saw a little four year old come into my house, just pick up the headset, the HTC Vibe headset and the controllers and went to town without anybody telling her what to do. She knew how it worked because that’s how the real world works. Bishop: If you were somebody who was just wanting to get into virtual reality, which device would you pick? Scoble: Today? Bishop: Yeah, today.  Even illiterate people can use mixed reality because it works the same way as the real world works.Scoble: I would probably point them to the HTC Vibe, because it has the best room scale technology, where it defines the little box that you can walk around in. And the games are — the experiences on HTV Vibe are more mature. Than on the Sony play station VR or on the Oculus Rift. Now Oculus, it’s tough one. Six months ago I would have been very strong, you have to go HTC. Now I’m not to sure, because the touch controllers on Oculus are nicer than on the controllers on the HTC Vibe. But HTC has new controllers come out so, it’s a war right now. So you wait six months and everything about this market is changed. And certainly, when Apple comes in the market it’s going to do most or much of what a HTC Vibe does, because it’s going to do full six-degrees-of-freedom VR, as well as mixed reality. So, it’s going to be a fun year to see how all these companies compete with each other. I think HTC is fine, by the way. Even if Apple is very, very successful. Because I think HTC is going to be the choice for putting in a lot of these VR arcades. And in China alone, I hear there is already 1000 VR arcades, where you can go in and rent some time on a HTC Vibe or Oculus Rift and play with your friends, right. Bishop: Now Microsoft has windows holographic which essentially extends the technology that’s in the Hololens to third party devices. Speaking very generally there. Scoble: Yep. Bishop: And they are coming out with third party devices this year, some of their partners. Will Windows be the dominate underlining OS here? How does that work? Scoble: As much as I love my HoloLens — I think Microsoft has been doing the best work — They’re still swimming upstream. Everybody in the world has an android or an iPhone in their pocket, and how is Microsoft going to get your to buy a 1000 dollar thing on top of that? That’s really hard. I don’t understand how they are going to get there. But, they were first into this new space. And I expect a new 2.0 Hololens and I expect major improvements. And we’ll see, it’s going to be a war over these things. And I don’t know how it plays out. You know, we haven’t seen the players yet. As much as I know about what Apple is coming out with, I have no idea how good their artificial intelligence is. I expect it to be mind blowing because they have 600 people working on it. But I don’t know. You know, there’s a lot of if’s. And, I don’t know how good Microsoft is. Clearly the first one was pretty good. That was a pretty good first attempt in a new field. But they need to improve that a lot to be a mass market consumer product and one that will steal the users away from Google and Apple. Right, that’s a hard thing. Bishop: Taylor I know you probably have more to ask, but I always get sentimental when you come in Robert, because you were the subject of one of my first ever front page stories at the Seattle PI. Do you remember this? Scoble: Barely, but yeah I do. Bishop: I’ve got it right here, look at yourself. I’ll link to this from the show notes. It was 2003, July. Soper: Looking good Robert, looking good. Bishop: Yeah, you’re looking good. You actually, you’ve lost a lot of weight. Scoble: Yeah, I’ve lost 50 pounds the last two years. Bishop: Yeah, you really have. Anyway, the headline was ” All the new kids on the blog”. It was when there was all this excitement and surprise that all the Microsoft employees were finally speaking publicly. On their blogs. So, at any rate I’ll link to that. Scoble: We changed a lot about how PR worked, and how these companies had to build social teams. And now, those teams have been — are part of the companies. Every company has a social team, if they don’t they’re screwing up. Soper: One thing I wanted to ask was, I think I’m thinking about unity and you mentioned all the employees now working on these technologies. And I think a piece of advice, I think you mentioned this earlier, was go study that because you will get a job, right, if you know how to do that. I’m thinking about the whole new world. Scoble: Unity people are going to be in short supply because every brand is going to need to virtualize. When we visited Sephora, a big cosmetic retailer, they already have augmented reality makeup, and you can already try it on your iPhone. So you get the Sephora app, aim it at your face, try out some pink lipstick on your face. And the product that you experience on your iPhone is color matched to the physical product. So that took a lot of work. And they’re building — they’re thinking about this mixed reality world where Apple and other people are going to walk into their stores and want to experience the store in a different way. So they are thinking about it, and they are already augmenting signs when you walk into the store with your phone. So they are already thinking about when you are walking in the store with your glasses on, and you have this Sephora app, you can try all sorts of stuff without putting on your skin. Soper: And this is just Sephora, and we mentioned sports teams. I mean, it’s everywhere. Scoble: Yeah that’s why we say it’s going to change everything. When we started doing the kind of work — visiting companies and really thinking this through — it’s like, what happens if Apple really does sell glasses to every iPhone user? You know, last quarter alone they sold 78 million of these iPhone 7’s and 7 Pluses, and this is a product that’s really not that inspired. It’s iterative. You know, compared to a 6S, it has a little better camera. Okay, great. Is that really a reason to buy a new phone? But they sold 78 million anyways. Imagine next year when they have really amazing new technologies and products. How many people are going to buy it — 100 million, 150 million, 200 million? I don’t think they are even going to be able to build enough. That’s going to be a problem for Apple, right. So, I think he just opened a factory in India for that reason. If he really is going to expand the market noticeably in the next three years, he’s going to have to build a lot of product. Bishop: So, when you are talking Apple, are you basing this on public clues or inside knowledge?  Watch with the self-driving industry does with mixed reality, because the technologies are very, very similar.Scoble: Both. When you visit so many R&D labs, and have so many relationships with people high up in the consumer electronics industry, you find out stuff. And I’ve interviewed the founder of PrimeSense and the founder and the CTO of Metaio back in 2011 which lead to this book. And those companies got bought by Apple. See, if you go back to those interview, they tell you what they are going to do with their lives. And I assume they are going to give it to us this year. Back in 2011, the Metaio CTO showed me monsters on the sides of skyscrapers. He took us outside and he said look, we can put monsters on the sides of buildings. So now when I get these glasses I’m expecting to blow up the entire city with aliens. And it will be viewed from your position. So, if you are behind a building you will see it properly occluded. And if he doesn’t do that Magic Leap is going to do that, or Hololens is going to do that. Because I already have aliens coming out of my walls with my Hololens, so what’s next for entertainment? A lot. In fact, I just had dinner with Ted Schilowitz the futurist at 20th Century Fox, the movie company. And he’s very bullish on this technology. He said this is a huge deal for the entertainment industry, because we are going to be able to see a huge screen in front of us, even while sitting in the coach section of a plane, or taking the light rail to the airport. Now, all of sudden we can watch a movie in the same glory you would watch it in a movie theater. Bishop: What’s this going to mean for sex? Scoble: Oh, you had to go there didn’t you. Soper: That’s a whole other show. Sex robots in augmentation, yeah. Scoble: I think it will change deeply, because my wife will be able to dress me up as Brad Pitt. Bishop: Enough said. Robert Scoble! Thanks for joining us this week on the podcast! Oh, that’s good. Any other big areas that you would cover? Scoble: Watch with the self-driving industry does with mixed reality, because the technologies are very, very similar. The LiDARs are focusable on the newer stuff that’s coming a long, from companies like Quanergy. There’s a new AI engine in soft driving cars coming from a company called DeepScale and others. And there is a new 3D map coming from a company called Luminar Technologies, who also is building sensors for the front bumper. And these are all stealth mode companies, you haven’t seen their products yet. But they are coming. And they work very similarly to these mixed reality glasses which have a sensor on them that see’s the world in 3D. It has an artificial intelligence brain and it’s going to need a 3D map. Because when you walk into a certain room at the Ritz ,it’s going to know it’s in that room, because every room is different. If you think about it, I’ve been paying attention to this now for more than a year, I’ve never been in a room that’s exactly the same. Even in a hotel, where the rooms are pretty much the same, but each room has something slightly different from any other room in the world. So if your glasses can see those difference — and they will, it will know exactly that you are in room 318 at the Ritz right now, and you are looking out toward the window — and so it can do stuff with all those surfaces and put Mick Jagger in your hotel room if you want to. Bishop: Hey, before you go. You’ve been sitting here this whole time with this sort of amulet around your neck. And it’s been flashing with little LED’s I guess? What is this thing? Scoble: It’s geek jewelry I call it. Zackery Vor, he’s an artist and entrepreneur in San Francisco is making this little geek jewelry. Bishop: So it’s for show, it’s not actually doing anything? Scoble: It’s not doing anything but he’s building one that will react to sound. So if you are at a rave or at a nightclub it will be doing fun stuff with LED’s. Yeah, it’s burning man art basically.  This is the best education technology humans have ever invented. Bishop: All right, so let’s turn this over to the audience. We’re going to be turning this over to the audience, we’re going to give away a copy, a signed copy of The Fourth Transformation by Scoble and Shel Isreal. What I am going to ask you to do is send an e-mail to contest@geekwire.com and describe the application of mixed reality that you are most looking forward to in the future. You can say sex if you want, you can say you’re going to look like Brad Pitt, too. But if there’s other things that you want to talk about I want to hear that instead. Once again, send your e-mail to contest@geekwire.com, describe the application of mixed reality that you are most excited about in the future and from the answer, and from the responses we’ll pick one person at random to win a copy. Scoble: I’ll give you one that I want and Microsoft has already showed it to us. I want to say “hey Cortana” — if I am using the Microsoft classes — show me the Hubble telescope view on the sky. Because I can never see the sky because we have light pollution in most modern cities. And we have you know, lots of other pollution. And Microsoft has this thing called the World Wide Telescope, where they have 30 different telescopes and you can go from, you know, from the Hubble telescope view to the Keck telescope view. And I want to see that on top of the sky when I’m outside with my kids and I want to show them the universe the way the Hubble sees it, not the way my eyes sees it. Bishop: So when the ozone layer is gone we can just re-create it virtually is what you are saying. Scoble: Yeah, you know we’ll just put snow on the mountains again, and we’ll put, you know. Bishop: Sorry, I didn’t mean to end it on a downer there. Soper: I’ve got nothing there. Brad Pitt and sex, I’m still thinking about that. Scoble: But seriously, you hit on something. This is the best education technology humans have ever invented. So if we can show people the universe, we can maybe get them to start thinking about things other than just protecting the United States. That’ll take America back forward again, instead of going backwards as we currently are.

He also visited some education centers, telling students not to work just for the money, while warning that technology in the classroom is no substitute for traditional teaching. During a meeting with the PM at Downing Street yesterday, Cook said he thought Britain would be “just fine” outside of the European Union. He later told ITV’s Good Morning program that his firm would “double down” on the country. Apple is one of several companies that have raised their prices in the UK as a result of the pound's fall against the dollar in the wake of Brexit. The iPhone maker added hundreds of pounds to the price of all its UK Macs last October and increased app store prices by 25 percent last month. But Cook is still “very optimistic” about post-Brexit Britain. "Yes there will be bumps in the road along the way but the UK's going to be fine," said Cook. "We are proud that Apple's innovation and growth now supports nearly 300,000 jobs across the UK." Last year, Apple revealed it was moving its London headquarters to the redeveloped Battersea Power Station, and Cook explained that the company was "leaving significant space there to expand." The UK government took this as a sign that foreign firms were still willing to invest in the country following the vote to leave Europe. The day before the meeting with May, Cook visited the University of Glasgow, where he received an honorary degree. He also had some advice for students: don’t make money the main factor when picking a career path. Humbled & honored to become part of the @UofGlasgow community tonight. Thank you to the faculty & students of this great university! pic.twitter.com/YpwArFUgGr — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) February 8, 2017 "My advice to all of you is, don't work for money — it will wear out fast, or you'll never make enough and you will never be happy, one or the other," Cook said. "There's a big difference between loving to work and loving the work. And there's a big difference between whether you fall in love with some work that is just for profits or revenues versus work that is in the service of others. And so I feel very strongly about that," he added. Surprisingly, some people haven’t responded well to being told that money isn’t that important by a man whose net worth is almost one billion dollars. Cook also commented on tech’s role in the classroom during a visit to a north London school. Woodberry Down Community Primary School in Harringay is one of a group of schools that have incorporated iPads and related software into its lesson plans. It may be a certified Apple Distinguished school, but the CEO stressed that class technology is a "compliment to tradition teaching and not a substitute."

Will 2017 be the year that happens? Probably not. By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | February 10, 2017 -- 15:15 GMT (07:15 PST) | Topic: Apple Sarah Tew iPad sales are awful. Truly awful, and while CEO Tim Cook might be bullish about the tablet's future, Apple desperately needs to do something to turn sales around if it's going to come off life support. Must read: Does your iPhone have a battery drain problem? Cloud TV These business leaders are embracing cloud services See how the cloud is disrupting traditional operating models for IT departments and entire organizations. Read More "We've got some exciting things coming on iPad," Cook said during Apple's last financial conference call, "and I'm optimistic about where things are headed." While this could mean a lot of things, what this is likely to mean is a hardware refresh, especially given how stocks of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro seem to be dried up to where shipping times in the United States, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, and elsewhere have jumped to the 2 to 3 week mark. When could this refresh happen? Well, during the Q1 2017 financial conference call Cook said that "beyond the 90-day clock, I'm very bullish on iPad." This to me suggests that we're not going to see a refresh happening during this quarter, or at the very least new iPads won't ship until the end of March at the earliest. Rumors are all over the place, with everything from the end of March to the middle of 2017. But when it comes to giving iPad owners reason to upgrade, the rumors don't deliver. It seems to be more of the same -- faster processor, new 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch displays which feature the same True Tone technology found on the 9.7-inch iPad, 12-megapixel camera, and such. Basically all just evolutionary upgrades which you'd expect from a mature product. If iPads were already selling well, theses types of upgrades would be enough to keep the iPad relevant, but with sales having fallen to where they are now, I think it's too little, too late. Even iOS 10 making some 40 percent of all iPads in use at that point obsolete hasn't been the catalyst that encouraged existing owners to part with their cash for new hardware. So what's the problem? The bottom line is that the iPad is plagued by two issues. The first is that it's overpriced compared to other tablets. For most casual users, an Amazon Fire tablet will do everything they need at a fraction of the price. Secondly, for professional and business users, the lack of a mouse or trackpad makes the iPad a poor choice for working on spreadsheets and the like. Apple's made the device more friendly to creative and artistic types with the Apple Pencil, but that market doesn't seem to be as lucrative as Apple had hoped it would be. Will Apple drop the price of the iPad? I doubt it. The company is heavily focused on squeezing as much cash as it can from its lineup, and if anything it's doubling down on the higher-end stuff at the expense of the cheaper stuff. As to adding a trackpad or mouse support, again I don't think this fits in with the direction that Apple wants to take the iPad in, and that would bring it too close to being a Mac, which would resurrect that old discussion about Mac tablets again. My best estimate says that this time next year, Apple will be looking at iPad sales that are some 10 to 15 percent lower than what they were the year before. And that puts the iPad on very shaky ground indeed.

Braun @johnfbraun · +John F. Braun Feb 10th, 2017 11:00 AM EST | Product News Kwikset recently introduced Premis, the company’s first Apple HomeKit-compabitle touchscreen smart lock. We received a demonstration of the new product from Marty Hoffmann, VP of Marketing, and here are the features we think you’ll like. HomeKit Smart Lock Being compatible with HomeKit offers several options to monitor and control the lock without having to use the physical key or touchpad.  One can use Siri voice to unlock or check the status of Premis, and you can remotely access the lock using Apple TV (3rd generation or later). Users can also control it with the Apple Home app on an iOS device. Then there’s the Kwikset Premis app, which offers the ability to program up to 30 unique user codes, check lock status, lock history and battery life, lock scheduling, and receive lock status notifications. Kwikset Premis HomeKit Compatible Smart Lock Setup and the Smudge Attack Using the touchscreen to lock and unlock the Premis seemed odd at first, since we first had to cover the entire screen with our hand, then enter a random two digit code, and then enter a four digit code hard coded for demonstration purposes. We then learned about a “smudge attack” where someone who wants to open the lock could just look for residue on the keypad to help guess a code to open it.  By introducing two random digits before entering the code (SecureScreen) this type of attack isn’t possible. Kwikset Premis is available now with a, MSRP of US$229.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Fake News is unlikely Hurting Apple, so why is the CEO of Apple making it an Issue Today? | Main | Apple CEO Takes a Magical Ride to Several Major Events in Britain Today and Talked Up Augmented Reality » February 10, 2017 Apple VP Tells Australian Financial Paper that Aussies are Trail Blazers when it comes to using Apple Pay   We started the week with a report titled "Apple tells Australian Commission that their Bank's acting as a Cartel has a Chilling Effect on the Benefits of Competition." While three of Australia's biggest banks are hoping that the final decision from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will fall in their favor, Apple let it be known today that they're going to be left behind in the development of digital wallets and lose customers if they don't deal with them. On a more possitive note, Apple Pay VP Jenniffer Bailey said today in an interview that "Australians are using Apple Pay more frequently each month than any customers in other countries, which is in large part due to Australia being a recognized global leader in contactless payments and usage."   Apple's VP went on to say that Apple is so confident of the supremacy of its payments system that "customers will say they are happy to switch banks to use it."   To date ANZ Banking Group has been the only major bank allowing their customers to use Apple Pay. They even went out of their way to make a funny commercial to show how the issue was completely overblown by the other banks.     But that's about to change by month's end. According to the The Australian Financial Review Macquarie Bank and ING Direct will turn on the Apple Pay service for their customers by the end of February.   Ms Bailey accused the banks holding out on joining Apple Pay – Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank, Westpac Banking Corp and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, who control two-thirds of Australian cardholders – of paying lip service to acting in the best interests of their customers. And their application to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for permission to collectively negotiate to boost their bargaining power to take on Apple shows a naivety about how the platform works and Apple's desire to work collaboratively with banks.   "While initially, in many markets, there have been banks that have initially been wary about working with a company as large as Apple, once they begin to work with us and understand the Apple Pay platform, they see the benefits of it. That hasn't fully happened with the ACCC applicants, because the conversation is happening through the ACCC process, compared to what normally happens, which is we have the conversation bilaterally."   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

We’ve seen plenty of images that prove Jet Black is prone to horrifying scratches, but we weren’t surprised. Apple told everyone from the start that Jet Black iPhones will scratch. However, the company never said anything about the regular black option, and it looks like matte black paint chips off easily as well. Don't Miss: The Galaxy Note 7 disaster is forcing Samsung to make the Galaxy S8 worse A thread on Apple’s forum spotted by 9to5Mac contains many stories from users who purchased matte black iPhone 7 versions only to discover that the paint chips around the corners, speakers, and physical buttons. You’d think that using a protective case would prevent chipping and scratching, right? Well, it doesn’t. “I have been using iPhone 7 Plus Matte Black for about one month with fully covered by a TPU casing and full-screen tempered glass most of the time. I just open the casing once a week to wipe the dust off from the phone,” user syazwanmnoor said. “Until yesterday when I take off the casing and notice there is something at the edge of the phone body next to UP Volume button. At first, I thought it just the dust. I try to wipe it using microfibre cloth as usual. Until I look closely, it is the metal part of the body. It seems that the black anodized paint had been chipped off from the phone body. I am really disappointed with what happen to the phone because I was using it very carefully.” iphone-7-matte-black-chipped-paint-1More You’d think the problem would be covered by warranty, right? Well, it’s not. “I have chat with Apple Customer Support, and it is not covered under warranty since it is under cosmetic damage. Seems that the anodized paint quality on iPhone 7 is same as what is on iPhone 5. The iPhone 7 body paint will chip at any time regardless you are using it very carefully. Just to share with you guys,” the same user concluded, with a wink, and pictures showing his Black Matte iPhone. Other affected buyers quickly responded with similar stories and images. “I am in the UK and got my phone (Matte Black 7 Plus) on 1st Nov. I found a first paint chip on the top left of the phone on 25th Nov… just had it less than a month,” user GangCS said, posting this image: iphone-7-matte-black-chipped-paint-2More Read More Here’s one that’s even worse, yet Apple still labels it as cosmetic damage: iphone-7-matte-black-chipped-paint-3More So, there you have it, iPhone 7 fans — this is what can happen once you go black.

Here are five of the most popular for non-iCloud users. By Erik Eckel | February 10, 2017, 7:49 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Apple Inc. iCloud simplifies migrating files from an old Mac to a new model, but for those Apple users not using iCloud, alternatives exist for making the process almost as smooth. Here are options for non-iCloud users who need to move files to a new Mac. SEE: Cloud Data Storage Policy (Tech Pro Research) Dropbox Must-Read Cloud Microsoft offers free Windows 10 upgrades to certain customers Video: The hybrid cloud 'condition,' and what Amazon is doing to address it How Mark Shuttleworth became the first African in space and launched a software revolution (PDF download) Subscribe to our Cloud Insights newsletter As an IT consultant, it's rare to encounter clients, particularly small businesses, that don't possess Dropbox accounts. Apple users who store files in a Dropbox account need to ensure that all the files—including documents, spreadsheets, presentations, PDFs, photos, and videos—are synchronized with Dropbox on the old Mac. Then, install Dropbox on the new Mac and log in to the Dropbox account on the new machine. Dropbox will copy the files within the account to the local Dropbox folder the application creates on the new Mac. OneDrive Similar to Dropbox, Mac users can leverage Microsoft's cloud-based file-storage service to migrate files to a new Mac. Users can download OneDrive from the App Store. Once the application is installed and the user logs in to his or her corresponding Microsoft account, OneDrive can sync all files and folders within the OneDrive directory that's created within the user's Home folder with Microsoft's cloud service. Users need to ensure the correct files and folders are parked within the old Mac's corresponding OneDrive folder, install the application, and log in on the new Mac. Then, the program will copy the files to the new Mac. Several OneDrive preferences are adjustable, including configuring the application to automatically open at login. To set custom preferences, open OneDrive from within the Applications directory, click OneDrive from the menu bar, and select Preferences. SEE: Terahertz wireless could help cover the planet with internet that's 10X faster than 5G (TechRepublic) Gigabit Ethernet While wired Ethernet connections are becoming an obsolete technology for many Mac users, including MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro consumers increasingly relying upon wireless connections, if both your old and new Macs possess Ethernet ports or you possess the required Ethernet adapters, another option is to transfer files between Macs using a fast Gigabit connection. CNET has published how-to instructions. Thunderbolt or FireWire Another file migration option available to Mac users is to connect the old and new Macs directly via a Thunderbolt or FireWire cable. The Apple Migration Assistant, which is capable of copying files as well as user accounts and settings between Macs, eliminates the need to manually move files, using such direction connections. The same migration tool also supports the Gigabit Ethernet option mentioned earlier. SEE: MacBook Pro classic tangled up in plugs? Thunderbolt 2 Dock to the rescue (ZDNet) Thumb drives and external hard drives Apple users can always go low tech, and simply connect a thumb drive or an external hard disk to the old Mac. When the external drive is connected to the old Mac, the old Mac should subsequently display a corresponding desktop icon. Double-clicking that desktop icon should prompt the Mac to open a Finder window. Users can drag all the files and directories they wish to migrate to the new Mac to that window. Once the file transfer completes, users can connect the drive to the new Mac, open Finder, double-click the external drive, and copy the files and directories to the intended locations on the new Mac's drive.

They were a mandatory accessory for grunge-oriented youths, along with plaid shirts and corduroy pants. The company was founded in 1986, and in its heyday in the 1990s, it had grown to be the third-largest sneaker brand, behind only Nike and Adidas. Today’s teens have undoubtedly never even heard of Airwalk sneakers, which are now found on the bargain rack at Payless Shoesource. What happened? Wait, this is TidBITS, not a fashion magazine, so why am I talking about shoes? Keep reading. I’m about to tell you a story that may sound chillingly familiar. Airwalk began as a niche shoe for professional skateboarders. Skating legend Tony Hawk (who starred in an eponymous video game that ran on the Mac, along with many other platforms) was one of their first customers, and actually suggested the name. Much of Airwalk’s early popularity was due to getting input from skaters to create superior skateboarding shoes that wouldn’t cause blisters or crashes. Airwalk had a healthy business, but it didn’t hit the big time until it hired advertising firm Lambesis to run an ultra-chic, counter-cultural ad campaign. As Malcolm Gladwell wrote in “The Tipping Point,” Airwalk was a $16 million company in 1993. In 1994, it was a $44 million company. In 1995, it was a $150 million company. To satisfy the vast influx of teenage customers while keeping skateboarders and boutique shops happy, Airwalk developed a two-tier strategy. It sold cheaper, consumer-grade shoes to mainstream retailers like Footlocker while continuing to provide pricier, professional-grade shoes to boutique shops. But Airwalk’s success didn’t last. The company’s troubles began in 1997 as production problems led to limited back-to-school supplies. Meanwhile, its lineup had become stale, with few new models. Worst of all, Airwalk abandoned its professional line of shoes. Serious skaters dropped Airwalk, causing the brand to lose its cachet with teens, and it wasn’t long before Airwalk’s time in the sun was over. A smallish company exploding due to quality products and a hip ad campaign. A product line that split into both consumer and professional tiers to provide different price points and features. A company that was later plagued by production problems, stagnant product designs, and ignoring its professional market. Does that sound like another company you can think of? Airwalk might have skated along for a while with its old designs and made peace with retailers, but abandoning its key market of hardcore skaters was what drove it into market irrelevance. In terms of managing supply chains and industrial design, Apple has a pair of superstars in Tim Cook and Jony Ive (to the extent Ive is still involved in product design, anyway). And Apple no longer worries about disappointing retailers, having opened hundreds of its own stores. More concerning is how Apple is treating its professional users. Let’s itemize a few of the ways Apple has moved away from the professional market over the past five years: Killing the Xserve Dumbing down Final Cut Pro with Final Cut Pro X Replacing the pro app Aperture with the consumer-level Photos Increasing burdensome restrictions on Mac App Store apps Releasing a new Mac Pro without internal expandability Failing to update that Mac Pro for over 3 years Delaying updates to the MacBook Pro line for nearly 18 months Releasing a new MacBook Pro that has drawn criticism from professionals Showing a lack of support for automation by eliminating the position of Product Manager of Automation Technologies We’re not alone in saying that Apple is now the iPhone company (see “Understanding Apple’s Marginalization of the Mac,” 21 November 2016). That’s where most of its profit comes from, and so that’s where most of its resources go. Fair enough. But, here’s the thing: the Mac and the capabilities it provides to professionals are the foundation of that iPhone business. Die-hard Mac users kept Apple afloat in the dark years before the iPod and then iPhone. And even now, regardless of all other professional uses of the Mac, developers need Xcode on the Mac to create iOS apps. Apple still has many things in its favor: $241 billion in cash, massive profits every quarter, one of the most popular brands in the world, and nearly 500 successful retail stores. And it might seem odd to criticize Apple now, especially when the company just broke a quarterly record with the most iPhone and Mac sales ever (helped by new iPhone and MacBook Pro models, plus the holiday shopping season, see “Apple Sees Apparent Return to Growth with Q1 2017’s Record Results,” 31 January 2017). But as we saw with Airwalk, things could go downhill fast if professional users were to leave the platform, taking with them all the people and organizations they currently keep loyal to Apple products. I don’t want to be too hard on Apple. The company is still incredibly strong and is doing better in some areas where it has been weak. By many accounts, Final Cut Pro X has improved greatly since its initial release, and some professional movie makers are giving it a chance. App Store review times are plummeting, and Apple is planning to allow developers to respond directly to App Store reviews. Swift is an exciting new programming language with a bright future, and it’s suitable for both compiled apps and scripts. You might argue that Apple and Airwalk aren’t comparable. For instance, although it may have gotten its start providing athletic shoes, Airwalk ultimately became a fashion company. But isn’t Apple similar in many respects? Apple opened its doors with the Apple I hobby kit, and by the mid-2000s, the iPod and its white earbuds were fashion mainstays. The Apple Watch is clearly intended to be a fashion item today. Even the MacBook, with its prominent usage in coffee shops, airports, and other public places, makes its own fashion statement. Despite these similarities, Apple is a much, much larger company than Airwalk ever was. Plus, Apple is making so much money and has so much cash that it can afford many more missteps than a plucky young footwear company. Perhaps most important, Apple can learn from the example of companies like Airwalk that fell from grace after losing sight of their most influential users. Here’s hoping Apple realizes the danger of diverting too much attention away from the Mac and its professional users.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 10:37 Josh, I was thinking about this over the weekend, but came to a different conclusion. Relying on fashion is not the winning strategy for a company that is this large. Nor is relying on what used to sell - gizmos. I am an Apple computer/phone/watch/TV user. I'll probably buy AirPods. But as a stock holder, I don't want Apple to stay there. I want Apple to move into healthcare and financial services and be willing to abandon computer power users along the way. Shoes are a great analogy, they move to a diminishing market. I want Apple to thrive, and I think it is time to move out of the diminishing phone and computers business and into services. If I could delegate Apple resources, I'd put some of the best folks they have on healthcare and finance. What does that make the phone and Mac? Loss leaders in 2020. Important to have but not the future of the company. So I guess that I am hoping Apple does the reverse of your last paragraph. Thanks for letting me think aloud, Peter Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-06 13:46 There's a lot to be said for Apple and services, but it's a matter of convincing the right people to write up their thoughts for us. :-) I think Apple is making some smart moves in the healthcare and IT spaces, especially with its IBM partnership. But as someone who uses Apple computers professionally, I don't want to see Apple become like IBM, moving entirely out of the end-user market to focus on back-end stuff. The iPhone is still by far Apple's largest revenue source, and the Mac users who create things for it are the backbone of that market. Reply David   2017-02-06 10:38 The day that a teen puts a poster of Marco Arment on the wall of their bedroom is the day that I will believe that the professionals you're talking about with regards to Apple are comparable to Tony Hawk. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-06 13:46 Ha! Teens may not idolize developers, but they certainly enjoy the apps they produce, including maybe some of Marco's. You could argue that Snapchat today is what skateboarding was 20+ years ago, though that's sort of a lousy analogy. Another way to think about this is: imagine walking into a coffee shop and instead of MacBooks, everyone was working on Surface Pro tablets. Given enough scale, that'd certainly have a network effect. Something Gladwell describes in his book, which I didn't go into in the article, is how trends develop. You first have what he calls innovators, oddballs who do new things. Then you have other groups who translate those things for the masses, like mavens and connectors. My point is, to put it in Gladwell speak, if those innovators drop Apple for another platform, over time that could trickle down to the masses and quickly eat away Apple's bottom line. Reply David   2017-02-06 17:54 They may enjoy the apps, but I doubt that 1 in 100 of them know the name of the developer who wrote it. And that breaks the link between "I have to wear what Tony Hawk is wearing" and "I have to code on what Marco Arment is coding on." I can equally imagine -- in the coffee shop analogy -- the teens being horrified that the "old people" are using the same thing they are, and fleeing Apple en masse. Finally, I don't find Gladwell's arguments particularly convincing. He seems to me to regularly take a small part of a social science finding (10,000 hours of practice, eg) and blow it up into a much larger and simpler conclusion, one that makes a good pop-sci headline but doesn't really tells us much about the real world. The narrative at the moment seems to be that Apple is neglecting pros and that's going to cost them, but what I've mostly seen is a range of strained arguments about why it's going to cost them, ranging from possibly plausible to pretty outlandish. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:34 I agree about Gladwell, which is why I didn't go too much into his theories in the article. However, outside of the linked interview, his book was the best source for the Airwalk story. The problem with arguments in favor of the professional markets is that there are a lot of intangibles there. In the case of Airwalk, it likely made total sense to dump the pro skater market for consumers — I'm sure they made far, far more money from Foot Locker than local skate shops. However, that turned out to be an enormous mistake, one that wouldn't appear on any spreadsheet. Reply David   2017-02-07 10:44 I think I'd like to see more than an anecdote before I buy into a narrative that is highly convenient for the people telling and reading it. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 22:44 One might say the same thing about your arguments. There's a whole truckload of wishful thinking there. Just from a local perspective, the predominant healthcare provider in my area, Palo Alto Medical Foundation, has excellent computerized records and services. They work on Windows PCs, not Macs. Other medical professionals use tablets, though they're not iPads, because they have to link with their non-Apple computer systems. Which is to say, without a Mac backbone, medical providers are not going to be using Apple products and services. Sure there are some highly visible Macs on some popular medical TV shows, but again, those are the Macs you so blithely dismiss. Great product placement, by the way. As Josh says, Macs are at the core of Apple's business. Without the Mac, the iPhone is just another gadget, here today, gone tomorrow. You know, like the iPad. And without the Mac, there will be no Apple products in medicine. As for financial whatever, all Apple does now is provide an access point via Apple Pay for consumers to the real financial service providers. They don't actually provide any of those financial services, nor are they likely to do so. Though they make a tidy profit with every Apple Pay transaction. You want to buy a Mac on credit through Apple you'll be using a Barclaycard, one of the highest interest rate charge cards on the planet, to whom Apple is only an intermediate business. In other words, I don't think your ambitions for Apple growth are grounded in anything like reality. As for shoes being a diminishing market, what planet are you living on? As large third-world countries like China, Mexico and India grow more prosperous, shoes will continue to be a growth industry. Just like iPhones. Which is why Apple is working so hard to break into the Indian market with lower price, recycled iPhones. That's where the growth is for them—and for Nike. The iPhone is the primary driver for the App Store, Apple's most prosperous service niche. And the App Store sells apps. And apps for the App Store are developed on Macs. Without the Mac there would be no apps and no App Store and, for all practical purposes, no iPhone. And no Apple. While Microsoft's Surface PCs are not yet a dominant product, Microsoft is clearly thinking long term, hence their huge investment in product placement in the NFL. The Surface Studio is coming out this year and will eventually, I presume to predict, make a significant dent in Apple's base among design professionals. Unless, as Josh hopes, Apple begins to take their professional base seriously once again. If I were twenty years younger I would certainly take the Surface Pro seriously. I share Josh's hope, but I don't share his optimism. If the new MacBook Pro is Apple's idea of a professional computer, with only 16GB of RAM, they've lost their way big time. They've taken their obsession with thin well past the point of diminishing returns. In the meantime, Tim Cook is good at blowing smoke at financial analysts, but as has been pointed out elsewhere in this issue of TidBITS, Apple's record first quarter was a week longer than the same quarter last year. In other words, Cook is using accounting gimmicks to draw a false equivalency between the two. Adjusted for that extra week, Apple's sales and profits are far less rosy than Cook would have us believe. At best they are flat, year over year. Is Apple making lots of money right now? Sure. Even with no growth they're still a rich company with money to burn. But they don't appear to be burning any of it on serious R&D. Like, perhaps, a touch interface for the macOS that can compete with Microsoft. iOS does touch just fine. But Cook refuses to acknowledge the need for it in OS X. Apple is riding high right now. But there's an old expression, what goes up must come down. Put another way, in business if you're not growing, you're dying. Implicit in Josh's argument is the proposition that Apple may have reached the peak of it's growth and success. They won't fail overnight, but that doesn't mean they're not failing. If Tim Cook is not aware of that, as he seems not to be, then Apple will be going downhill from now on. There may be a blip of success here and there, but that won't halt the downward momentum. Tim Cook is a nice guy and Steve Jobs was a jerk. Still, some might say the biggest difference between them is the vision thing. Steve had it. Tim does not. But I think the biggest difference between them is that Steve Jobs would not tolerate mediocrity. Time Cook seems to tolerate it all to well. Thanks David for giving me a jumping off point for my rant. I would have made it anyway, but you gave me a convenient place to start. I agree with Josh's premise, but I'm more skeptical than he is. Josh is politely suggesting that Apple needs to return it's attention to the Mac and the wide range of professional users who depend on it. Unlike Josh, however, I feel no need to be polite. Tim Cook needs to wake the f*ck up. Reply David   2017-02-07 22:37 You're certainly welcome. None of what you said was in response to my actual points, enough that I was wondering if there was another David in the thread. Apparently not. If you'd like to engage with my actual arguments, you're welcome to do that, too. Reply Nicholas Croft  2017-02-09 20:19 The PC 'enthusiast' market (broad term, basically power users of yore) is the only growth/margin market in the PC business. Apple are leaving money on the table by not addressing the enthusiast. Reply Zac Imboden   2017-02-06 15:06 What a thoughtful and well-written analysis. Regarding Peter Meyer's comments, I understand that Apple has it's own unique needs. What I would add is that what may be good for Apple (i.e. corporate expansion, diversification) may not be good for end users, specifically Mac users. I wish Apple to succeed as a company only as far as it concerns how they can continue to meet my needs and not theirs, my needs, not as a content revenue stream, an iPhone user, an iPad user, but as a MAC user. It appears to me that there is no longer any strong financial incentive for Apple to support and innovate their computer hardware and software as that segment continues to shrink in comparison to phone and content revenue. Continuing to complain about ridiculous mistakes in design and implementation and continuing to beg Apple to innovate and improve in the areas which matter the most to Mac users are losing propositions in the long run. If Apple wanted to do a great service to its various "niches", in my un-expert opinion, it would spin off the Mac and its system software and core apps into a separate company and let that company focus and innovate to meet the needs of its "niche" of Mac computer users at its own pace and peril. I'm not a investment guru, so I leave the financial merits of spin-offs for others. From an end-user endpoint, it seems to be the only way to get someone to pay closer attention to the very specific needs of computer users. Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-06 18:39 I think that would be courting the death of the Mac, honestly. As I argued in my other comment, the halo effect runs the other way - more people are buying Macs because they have used and liked Apple's consumer products. I think the main reason Macs have been bucking the overall decline in the computer industry is because they have Apple's strength in the consumer market to support them. If you cut the link there, you cut the main driving force for Mac market growth. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:19 Thanks for the kind words, Zac. However, I disagree with Apple spinning off the Mac. Tight integration with other Apple devices is still one of the Mac's strengths, and a spin-off would threaten that. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:20 I agree that the popularity of the iPhone and other Apple products helps drive Mac adoption. No argument there, and I think that's also still an important market for Apple. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 22:49 If Apple could value the Mac well enough to spin it off, they could value it enough to develop it internally. The problem is Apple doesn't seem to care one way or the other. Reply Derek Roff   2017-02-06 18:17 While Peter's suggestion that Apple get out of the hardware business strikes fear into my heart, I think it also misses Josh's key message. Why should a prudent investor like Peter assume that Apple can compete effectively in Services? This is an area where Apple has no particular expertise, and no intrinsic advantages. There are dozens of companies who understand Services better than Apple, and have both a deeper background and more agility. Airwalk survived as a fashion company, barely, and Apple might survive as an also-ran Services company, but as Josh indicates, this looks like the path to obscurity. Apple is a significant force in Services at the moment, because they are rich from hardware sales, and incredibly well known, from their integrated hardware, software, and lifestyle sales. Tossing all that out is, as Josh says, a losing strategy. Apple will not make its investors richer by proclaiming, "Think Conventionally". Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-06 18:30 Sigh. Another day, another 'Apple is doomed because they aren't catering to Important Users Like Me' article. The glaring flaw in this example is that it argues that people are drawn to Apple's consumer products because of the popularity of their computers among the elite - the halo effect. But if anything, the halo effect has run in the opposite direction, and has since the heyday of the iPod. People are buying Apple's consumer products, like the experience, and buying Macs to go with them. I've argued this before: Apple has, from the very first Apple ][, *always* catered to the ordinary user above the elite. When 'personal' computers were bulky S100 boxes that needed a separate dumb terminal and the arcane C/PM OS, Apple released a cute, streamlined all-in-one that hooked to a TV and booted into BASIC. When IBM introduced the designed-for-cubicles PC, Apple introduced the novice-user-friendly Mac. When smartphones were geeky tools, Apple released the iPhone. That's who they are. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-06 18:44 So you're saying that none of your less-technical family, friends, or clients buy Apple hardware because of your recommendations? In my experience, most people who know they don't have the technical chops to make an informed decision buy based on social influence. Reply David   2017-02-06 21:27 Are his family & friends a sufficient sample to generalize? Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-07 04:51 Actually, seriously, yes. I've been asked for advice on *which* Mac to buy, but everyone I know who bought Mac in the last year decided to go that route on their own. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-07 10:11 This is a discussion, not a research study. :-) Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-07 10:10 I obviously don't know the specifics, but unless you're well known for being platform agnostic, I doubt people would ask you for advice on other platforms. Your social influence to recommend Apple products is likely well known. Lots of people ask me for my opinions about what to buy, but they're always aware that I know Apple technology. But the article's point is that if you'd said, "Apple's hardware is stagnating and you'd be throwing money away if you didn't look at an Android phone or Windows PC" would those people ignore you and still buy Apple gear? In other words, if you as a tech influencer switched away from Apple gear, how many people would go with you eventually, purely because of your influence? Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:22 I'm not arguing that Apple is doomed. I can't count how many times I've written here something to the effect of "Apple is far from doomed." However, I do think shirking the professional market is an enormous mistake. Nor would I want Apple to drop or lose focus of its massively successful consumer line. The professional and consumer sides of Apple help build its strong ecosystem. Reply David   2017-02-07 10:50 2 people would go with me. Which would reduce Apple customers for the last quarter from 96 million people to 95,999,998. Even if there were 50,000 tech influencers who took 2 people with them, it would reduce Apple's customers from 96 million to 95,900,000 last quarter. (all numbers either approximate (customer numbers, people I influence) or made up (number of tech influencers)). Math done badly and on the fly. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 23:26 I'm not arguing that Apple is doomed, either, though I'm more cynical on the subject that Josh is. For one thing, doomed is a vague and melodramatic term. If Apple fails to innovate and improve the Mac, then their base of support will be eroded over time because, as I said before, the Mac is the core of Apple's business. Without it Apple's other business interests would fail to flourish. And that's putting it mildly. In my opinion, without the Mac there is no Apple. But I don't see Apple killing the Mac. After all, it's still making money. What I see happening, as Josh points out in more polite terms, is that the Mac appears to be declining in importance for Apple. This doesn't spell doom, but it does spell stagnation. Meanwhile, Apple competitors continue to innovate. As an artist, the Surface Studio is the first Windows PC that has ever piqued my interest. If Apple continues to rest on it's laurels Microsoft is going to eat their lunch. Now that they are making good hardware, Microsoft is playing in the same ballpark with Apple. And, like macOS X 10.12.x, Windows 10 is a solid and accessible OS. And there are areas, like cloud services, where Microsoft far exceeds Apple's success. So do Google and Amazon. Services aren't going to save Apple's bacon. The Mac is the only thing that can do that, not because it makes the most money, but because it's central to the success of every other Apple venture. What I don't understand is why Tim Cook doesn't seem to know this. His desultory remarks about the future of the Mac are not encouraging. Another incremental update to the iMac or the Mac mini isn't going to get the job done. Nor are incremental improvements to the macOS. As I've said before, at the top of my wish list is a touch screen interface for the macOS. Without this it's very hard to see how Apple is going to keep up with the competition. Reply Christian Kaatmann   2017-02-06 19:21 The thing that Apple is certainly doing right now - seen from a user perspective - is that _all_ of their systems are much more reliable now than they used to be. I very rarely have to reboot, if one app crashes the rest of the system carries on unperturbed, I can go seamlessly from my Mac to my iPhone to iCloud on a windows machine without ever loosing a comma in the text I'm working on. It's like magic compared to not so many years ago. And Apple has got us all happily hooked on its services with iCloud at the centre. And I mean happily, thinking of the days back with Excel 1.04, swapping disks on my Mac SE or more recently trying to keep my iMac from crashing every time I switched from Mail to Word to Excel to ... Apple keeps a lot of customers happy and deeply dependent. Reply Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 19:31 That is a great point. Thank you! Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:23 Apple does enjoy tremendous lock-in, which certainly gives it staying power. iCloud is one of the weaker service bundles, but it's bolstered by the popularity of the hardware, which in turn benefits from iCloud lock-in. Not to mention dependence on iMessage. Reply Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 19:30 A quick addition if you don't mind. I am going to express my opinion, not fact. I don't think that Apple will abandon the larger Mac and phone and iPod markets (or TV or iPads.) I am looking at these devices as critically important. Not important as computing devices, but highly valuable as data devices. What is the difference? Computing takes place in a small fairly closed environment. Data is fed by and then feeds a larger system. (I think of the Mac Pro as being about computing, the iPad and Apple TV as being about data.) If I look at this as an investor, I see that data system as services with end point devices. The devices are either commodity products or are really sophisticated at handling data to and from the user. That data is the core of the future services. (Again, this is me as businessman, not as the guy who is really enjoying this MBP right now). Apple should, absolutely should, stay in the end point market and make exceptionally exciting devices like an iPhone so light that you need a lanyard to hold it in place. Those devices are data portals, and the real economic engine for what might be the most valuable company on the planet will be the data services. They actually might subsidize the hardware experiments that many of us love. For those hardware experiments, my credit card vibrates in anticipation. My business mind is looking for services in healthcare and automobiles. The hardware is what we know, the services that we do not yet know will be our future, just as the pocket computer once was. So much for me being quick. Josh, Adam, thank you! Reply Herb Bowie  2017-02-06 20:16 The analogy seems a bit contrived, and the conclusions a bit overblown. Part of what we have always loved and respected about Apple is its intent and ability to skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it is. If we think about these issues from that perspective, we might make the following observations: 1. As device buses get increasingly powerful, and as the pace of technology change quickens, and as the desire for smaller computers increases, it will make sense for users to do "upgrades" by adding or swapping out peripherals, not through changes to the internals of their computers. 2. As SSD, memory, networks and microprocessors all get faster, the simple desire for ever bigger numbers -- faster chips, more RAM, etc. -- becomes less and less relevant for most users. 3. While Apple needs to provide core apps and services to make the average consumer happy, Apple's primary contribution to the larger app ecosystem is to make better tools for developers, not to make "Pro" level applications themselves. 4. As security becomes more and more of an issue, tight controls on the App store become increasingly important; however, third-party software suppliers still have the ability to deliver apps to their customers outside of the App store, so customers can have the best of both worlds. 5. As it becomes easier and easier to develop Mac applications, and as the Mac development tools grow stronger, and as the number of specialized apps continues to grow, it becomes ever harder to see why the Mac would need a special department for "Automation Technologies" for those few users who cannot find already developed solutions to their problems, yet who are also unable to develop new solutions themselves. So, yes, in all these cases, there are some short-term bumps in the road for many of us, and some more difficult issues for a few of us, but isn't this what we've always expected from Apple? Reply mike sanders  2017-02-06 21:53 Excellent response and a much more focussed overview, great respect to Josh but like so many "old" Apple users you still expect them to be a computer company which they no longer are. I have been a user since 1987 and an investor since the 2000s and have to say I am completely satisfied on both accounts. A very well run company which clearly knows where it is going just that it doesn't share it with us until the time is right. Have you seen the stock price today? Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:25 Per your point on automation — I think Apple sees Swift as eventually overtaking AppleScript. That's fine with me, but Apple also needs to continue to create automation tools for professionals who aren't programmers. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 23:47 I agree. Unfortunately, Apple has a habit of dropping the ball on good ideas and technologies. For example, iWeb was overtaken by the competition because Apple lost interest in developing it. The same goes for Aperture. Now Apple Script and Automator are threatened with extinction, with no accessible replacement in sight. Apple Script and Automator enable the user to plug right into the OS and their applications. They are essentially programmable apps. Swift, on the other hand, is a programming language not an application. It's hard to imagine a third party developing a program with Swift that will have the broad capabilities of Apple's native apps. If history is any guide, apprehension is called for. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-02-07 00:35 You forgot bonehead moves like killing Apple Displays, AirPort, and now it looks like the iPad lines will be next. Possibly even the desktop Macs. Tim Cook needs to be canned. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:26 Indeed, I should have mentioned the loss of Apple displays and the apparent abandonment of AirPort routers. The latter is a thorn in my side at the moment, since my Express is on its last legs, and I'm distrustful of others on the market. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-08 01:06 Right you are. Both Apple Displays and Airport routers have been overtaken by the competition because Apple has apparently lost interest in supporting and improving them. This has the look of a tradition at Apple. Or a disability, like ADD. There was a time when third-party routers did not support the Mac with decent setup software. Airport routers solved that problem, though they tended to be less capable than the competition. They had the virtue of being simple. That time is past. Though various routers handle the matter differently, their setup software has improved. For instance, I can get into a Comcast router's built-in setup software with a simple URL, as I did with Linksys routers in the past. AT&T has always bumped me to a web site where I entered the appropriate information and the web site passed it to the router. This was particularly useful in the old days when routers and modem settings often got corrupted. If something went wrong, pop, there I was at the AT&T setup page. Nowadays routers are more reliable and such problems are rare—though not unheard of. Apple eventually improved the simple Airport Base Station by including a hard drive that interfaced easily with Time Machine—the Airport Time Capsule, an appropriate name at the time. And the Time Capsule has improved over the years with a space saving tower configuration and larger hard drives. Though you can still get the Airport Extreme which is a simple router without the hard drive. It's comparably priced with similar routers, except that you still need an external modem, which might be a disadvantage, unless you're used to setting up modems. That said, I don't know why Apple is apparently dropping their WiFi product line. They work perfectly well. Perhaps sales have declined as service providers now so often provide their own routers and independent modems are less common. Airport routers still require an external modem, which puts them behind the curve. I used to like a separate modem because they tended to fail more often that routers. But now I rent my router from Comcast and if it fails for any reason I just pop down to the Xfinity store and get a replacement. The same goes for AT&T. I haven't had occasion to set up an Airport router in years. Still, I don't think it's a good reason not to get a replacement Airport Express if your Airport Extreme orTime Capsule is still working OK. Current models have the fastest WiFi, 802.11ac, and they are still for sale on the Apple web site, as is the Airport Express. Replacing the Express seems to me to be simpler than regigering your entire system with a new router and a new repeater. But then if your router is also having issues, there are less expensive alternatives to the Airport, depending on your setup. Reply Jean-Pierre SMITH  2017-02-07 04:37 Great analogy and thinking, for the Mac platform. I liked the idea the combination of (1) techical brilliance, as seen by the recognised "experts" and (2) some hype (better call it "intelligent design") is a key factor of success for the Mac. Remove one of the two pillars and the structure collapses. To remember, I still have on my LC-475's screen saver (not used any more) the picture of a snail carrying on its back a rival PC's Intel CISC processor. These old macs used Motorola RISC processors, deemed faster by the "experts". You may have called to the bar Michelin, whose tyres for trucks (trucking fleets are the tyre equivalent to the Mac's "expert" users) are in demand for their durability (mileage), while car drivers don't measure mileage but simply benefit from it without knowing. Car tyres benefit directly from R&D invested in truck tyres just as the Mac for me [ordinary Joe] directly benefits from the Mac used, misused and challenged by its professional users (the "experts"). I am not so sure, though, the above analogy works for the iPhone, iPad and iWatch lines (is it still true that the iPhone for the Presidents is called "Blackberry"?). Thanks for the brain teaser.

No manufacturing costs. Pure profit once initial outlay of programming is covered.

Industry Sources Claim Samsung Galaxy Note 7’s Advanced Feature Coming To Apple’s Next Flagship Phone By Corazon Victorino On 02/10/17 AT 11:58 AM Close Apple could be setting the bar high for its famous smartphone line with the launch of its 10th anniversary iPhone. Apart from the  rumored redesign and specifications upgrade of the handset, there is now information claiming that iPhone 8 will come with an iris scanner — something Samsung attempted with its now canned Galaxy Note 7 phablet.  Taiwanese daily newspaper DigiTimes is back with an update from its so-called industry sources, who are said to be Apple supply chain insiders. According to the publication, the unnamed sources disclosed that the iPhone 8 will come with iris scanning technology. Should this be true, it’s clear that Apple has a big plan for its next-generation smartphone.  Adding an iris scanner on a smartphone only means one thing: advanced biometrics security. Just like what Samsung did with its  Note 7’s iris scanner, the eye-examining feature would likely serve the purpose of authenticating the user’s identity. This sophisticated technology could then be used in unlocking the 10th anniversary iPhone or verifying Apple Pay transactions. Related Stories Verizon Announces Same-Day Cracked Screen Repair Service Future Apple iPhones and iPads Could Have Stretchy Displays, Patent Shows New Apple iPhone 8 Could Feature Wireless Charging An iris scanner is more advanced than the fingerprint scanner, which has undeniably become ubiquitous among flagship devices on the market. For one thing, iris scanning is a more specific type of biometrics technology because each person’s iris has a complex and very unique pattern.  However, MacRumors pointed out the inconsistency in DigiTimes’ Apple coverage. The Apple-centric news site noted that this new report is contradicting the newspaper’s previous story on how Apple intends to introduce iris scanning capabilities to its iPhones in 2018. It is also worth noting that credible Apple insider and KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said that Apple is more interested in developing facial recognition technology than iris scanning.  Given that these stories do not agree with each other and since Apple has never confirmed any of them, it is best for consumers to take everything with a pinch of salt for now. So far what’s really certain here is the fact that Apple’s is working on a new iPhone model that will be introduced to the public in September as the Cupertino giant's 10th anniversary iPhone.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

The new BeatsX earphones mark the third pair of Beats by Dr. Dre headphones to sport Apple’s new W1 wireless chip, which uses the latest Bluetooth technology but enhances it with simplified pairing and some other special features. Of course, there is a fourth pair of wireless headphones that utilize Apple’s W1 technology, but they don’t fall within the company’s Beats brand. That’s right, it’s the AirPods. And now that Apple’s new BeatsX earbuds are finally available for sale, it’s time to see how they stack up to the hottest pair of truly wireless headphones in the world. Don't Miss: This iPhone 8 concept running iOS 11 is the stuff dreams are made of Apple’s truly wireless AirPods earbuds are still next to impossible to find in stores, but tens of thousands of people around the world have already managed to get their hands on the hot new headphones. There are plenty of things to love about the AirPods — even if you hate to love them, like we do — but the cool W1 features have to be near the top of the list. Thanks to the W1, pairing the AirPods to an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus takes about 1 second, and opening the case near your phone instantly pops up a little card that shows you how much battery is remaining in your AirPods. They also fit pretty well in most ears, and they sound much better than you would think. Meanwhile, the BeatsX go for a much more conventional wireless earbud design. The two buds are joined by a wire (they’re still “wireless” because they use Bluetooth to connect to your phone, tablet or any other media player), and there’s a small box on the wire that includes a mic as well as controls. As for sound quality, early adopters have said that the BeatsX buds are in line with AirPods, but the rubber tips provide a better seal in your ear canal so they offer better sound isolation, and therefore better bass. Looking for a more in-depth comparison between AirPods and BeatsX wireless earbuds? There are a few good comparisons floating around the web right now, but the best we’ve seen thus far comes from popular YouTuber Jonathan Morrison. The full video is embedded below, and you can learn more about how and where to buy the new BeatsX earbuds in this post.

Moscow based company sells software to extract data from iCloud backups and works with police forces and intelligence agencies. Chief executive Vladimir Katalov accidentally uncovered the glitch when he was browsing his own iPhone, according to Forbes.  Apple has worked to restore there reputation after a series of scanals surrounding the iCloud, and has now fixed the problem. This is not the first time that Apple has received criticism for potential security flaws in its iCloud service. The most notorious breach came after hackers released private images, many of them naked, of celebrities back in 2014. Apple has worked hard to rebuild its reputation following the fiasco, but some users are still concerned about certain types of data being uploaded to the cloud without their approval or notification. Elcomsoft previously analysed logs to show files uploaded to Apple's iCloud servers contained a list of all calls made and received on an iOS device, complete with phone numbers, dates and times, and duration. Speaking at the time, a spokesman for Apple said: 'Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers' data.' 'That's why we give our customers the ability to keep their data private. Device data is encrypted with a user's passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user's Apple ID and password.' 'Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.'  Mail Online has contacted Apple for a comment on the latest iCloud glitch.   Read more: Apple iCloud Hoards 'Deleted' Browser History Going Back More Than A Year www.dailymail.co...

Back in 2012, a problem was identified with the anodizing used on the iPhone 5. Owners started noticing the casing had chips where the aluminum was visible beneath the anodized surface. In some cases the iPhone arrived with the chips already visible. As spotted by 9to5Mac, it looks as though that same issue is happening again with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, but only on matte black models. Apple's support forum is slowly filling up with reports of the matte black iPhones being chipped (three pages long at the time of writing). These chips expose the silver aluminum underneath and can occur within the first month, or even first week of ownership. Even if the iPhone is protected inside a case, chips can appear. The chips occur most often around the volume button and speaker grille, but they can also happen along any of the edges or on the back of the smartphone. The matte black iPhone 7 Plus seems to suffer from the problem more than the smaller iPhone 7. The headache for iPhone owners is Apple's policy on case damage. As it's viewed as "cosmetic damage," which occurs through normal daily use, Apple doesn't cover it under warranty. Even if a chip appears after a few days, it's still cosmetic damage. Related The Best iPhone 7 Wireless Headphones The Best iPhone 7 Wireless Headphones Smartphones are constantly being handled, slipped in and out of a pocket or bag, and can quite easily be dropped or knocked. Damage to the case is something we all accept and that's why protective cases exist. But if it chips without cause in the first few weeks of owning the phone, or even while inside a case, that's not acceptable. If the complaints in the support forum continue to grow in number, Apple will need to respond with something more than claiming cosmetic damage. It looks as though there's some issue with the matte black anodizing process, and I'd be surprised if Apple wasn't already quietly carrying out a review with its manufacturing partners.

Bailey revealed that participating customers in Australia use the contactless payment service more frequently than any other country, and that the holdout banks do not fully understand the benefits of Apple Pay yet. Bailey says customers are prepared to switch banks in order to use Apple Pay, which should help Apple wield its bargaining power. In fact, a handful of smaller Australian banks have signed up to Apple Pay as of today … The following Australian institutions now support Apple Pay for contactless purchases: Australian Unity, Catalyst Money, Customs Bank, Horizon Credit Union, Laboratories Credit Union Ltd, Nexus Mutual, Northern Beaches Credit Union, The Rock, and UniBank. Apple has also announced that Macquarie Bank and ING Direct will support Apple Pay before the end of the month. Although slightly ambiguous, Bailey’s claims that Australian Apple users depend on Apple Pay more often than users in any other country must be comparing typical customers on a bank that supports the service. Total usage of Apple Pay is low as major banks refuse to sign up. They have reported Apple to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for behaving unfairly. ANZ Banking Group is the only major financial institution cooperating with Apple in the country. The others are deep in a legal battle claiming Apple is unfairly monopolizing contactless payments services on the iPhone. The banks have requested access to the NFC hardware inside iOS devices so they can run their own competing services; Apple refused. The case is ongoing. Bailey says that all banks around the world have agreed to use Apple Pay on the same terms and that giving special privileges to the NFC hardware to Australian institutions would undermine the security model of the iPhone. Bailey says the legal process has prevented a reasonable discussion about the service’s merits from happening. She seems confident that the banks will eventually sign on once the legal duress is put to rest. “While initially, in many markets, there have been banks that have initially been wary about working with a company as large as Apple, once they begin to work with us and understand the Apple Pay platform, they see the benefits of it. That hasn’t fully happened with the ACCC applicants, because the conversation is happening through the ACCC process, compared to what normally happens, which is we have the conversation bilaterally.” A draft verdict in the legal case rejected the idea that Apple was holding an unfair competitive advantage over the banks, but a conclusive judgement is not expected until March. In the meantime, some smaller banks in Australia are signing up like those listed above. Apple Pay was first introduced with the iPhone 6 in 2014, allowing users to tap to pay at supporting merchants and points of sale. All iPhones sold today support contactless payments with hundreds of banks signed on to the service in the United States, Canada, UK, France, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand and Singapore. Apple Pay is also available in apps on newer iPads and Touch ID payments came to the Mac with the new MacBook Pro. With iOS 10, loyalty and reward cards can also be stored in the Wallet app and activated via Apple Pay. Guides Apple Pay Apple Pay is Apple's mobile payments solution first introduced in 2014.

By Luke Johnson / Published 10th February 2017 GETTY HERE'S LOOKING AT YOU: The next iPhone will be watching you thanks to an integrate iris scanner The iPhone 8 release date is edging ever closer and new reports have suggested the phone will play host to an impressive new security feature. Instead of troubling you with lengthy passwords or complex pin codes, however, like the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7, it's been suggested the iPhone 8 will always be watching you, with the phone tipped to play host to an integrated iris scanner. Built into the phone's front-facing camera, this eye-tracking technology will be able to map your eye, automatically unlocking the phone when you, and only you, look at it. Ensuring the phone's security system isn't tripped up by glasses or a lack of sunlight, the system will reportedly be equipped with both a laser sensor and infrared sensor for always on reading. Apple iPhone 8 - Leaked photographs, concept images and renders Friday, 6th January 2017 iPhone 8 is shaping up to be one of the most impressive Apple smartphones to date, with glass panels on the front and rear of the device, a curved borderless OLED display and no Home Button 1 / 10 VENIAMIN GESKIN • TWITTER • CONCEPT IMAGES Apple iPhone 8 will debut a brand-new all-glass look, with a curved OLED display and no physical Home Button According to Taiwanese outlet DigitTimes, unnamed "industry sources" have claimed the eagerly awaited iPhone 8 will drop later this year with the integrated iris scanner to line up alongside a new OLED display and the long coveted wireless charging technology. Like your fingerprints, everyone's iris features a complex and unique pattern, meaning it can be used as a personal and completely secure biometric security measure. With the iPhone 8 expected to lose its fingerprint scanner incorporating physical home button in order to allow a larger display to be squeezed in to a phone with a similar overall footprint, such as addition would help the phone maintain its high level of security. REDDIT • FLOCKMANN • CONCEPTSIPHONE This isn't the first time the iPhone 8 has been tipped to rock a futuristic iris scanner. The latest reports have been backed up by KGI Securities analyst and reputed Apple tipster, Ming-Chi Kuo who recently suggested Apple was leaning towards iris and facial recognition for its future smartphone offerings. He claimed that the firm's finger-friendly Touch ID efforts will "ultimately be replaced by a facial recognition system" although in the immediate future a "combination of fingerprint and facial recognition" is a more likely option. Despite the iPhone 8 being set to ditch the home button, further reports have suggested the phone will adopt either a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, or slide the security measure under the screen itself. Just one of a host of new additions reportedly bound for the iPhone 8, Apple's tenth anniversary handset is expected to feature a series of high-end updates. As well as a visually superior OLED display that'll offer deeper, more immersive blacks and sharper, more impactful colours, the iPhone 8 will reportedly feature a brand new design. Early reports have suggested this will see the phone line up as a glass-backed option, potentially with curved edges, much like the existing Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Beneath the surface, a new A11 processor will reportedly line up alongside new cameras and the heavily revamped iOS 11 operating system.

"The person who has influenced me the most in life is Steve by far," says Cook, who spoke in Scotland on Wednesday after receiving an honorary degree from The University of Glasgow. Jobs hired Cook when Cook was 36 years old and, in his words, "rudderless." Two decades later, Cook took over Apple after Jobs' untimely death in 2011. The most remarkable aspect of Jobs was his singular obsessiveness. "He had a focus that was unlike any other," says Cook. In his role at Apple, that focus was entirely on making excellent products. Watch the full speech below. (Warning, the video is not of the highest quality.) What allowed Jobs to focus so intently was his ability to prioritize, says Cook: "His thinking was so pure. He wasn't trying to maximize his wealth, or anything else." Jobs did become quite wealthy in his time leading Apple. But that was because Jobs never chased the cash, according to Cook. Jobs obsessed over making excellent products that people wanted, and the money followed. "His thinking was so pure." -Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Most CEOs get the priorities flipped, but Jobs "never did," says Cook. Jobs was similarly ruthless in prioritizing his time outside the office. "He also, more than any individual I have ever met, had a clear pecking order in his life," says Cook. "And he knew he couldn't do very many things and so it was family, Apple, Pixar, and very little else." That meant that Jobs didn't travel very often. He wanted to be able to get home and be with his family in the evenings, says Cook. "I learned a lot from him, not only about being a CEO, but about ways to conduct your life."

The former Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization, who also oversaw her eponymous line of clothing, accessories and footwear, is now devoting a majority of her  energy into acclimating her children to their new environment. That means that her days have been spent visiting the new schools that she and husband Jared Kushner have selected for 5-year-old daughter Arabella and 3-year-old son Joseph, and carving out time for a weekly date night. At the same time, Ivanka also appears to be taking on a role as White House proxy. As a result, Ivanka's days have also been spent sitting down for coffee with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's wife Priscilla Chan, grabbing lunch with Apple CEO Tim Cook, and make an appearance at the lunar new year celebration at the Chinese Embassy as a guest of Ambassador Cui Tiankai. Ivanka has managed to keep a relatively low profile as she goes about her new life, despite intense public interest, and scrutiny, in her life as First Daughter.  And that scrutiny heated up this week after her father lashed out Seattle-based retailer Nordstrom for dropping the Ivanka Trump line, which Ivanka does retain ownership of while also receiving fixed payments, rather than profits, from the Trump Organization. Her husband is not getting paid in his new role as a senior advisor to President Trump.  Scroll down for videos  New town: Ivanka Trump (arriving in DC the day before the inauguration) has been in Washington DC for close to a month now after spending her entire life living in New York City Getting ready: Her primary focus she said was to get her husband Jared Kushner and children settled into their new $5.5million home (Ivanka and Arabella last week at the Chinese Embassy) Mom duty: In that role she has spent time visiting the new schools she selected for 5-year-old daughter Arabella and 3-year-old son Joseph (Ivanka and son Theodore earlier this week in the White House) Be a boss lady in black suede pumps like Ivanka $135 Ivanka Trump Carra pump Get them at Zappos Buy now Another day another stylish ensemble from Ivanka Trump.

Barron and Melania may move to DC at the end of the school year.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next EXCLUSIVE: 'I am haunted by the moment I saw her slipping... How Kate took ten years off her face: The Duchess of... Share this article Share Ivanka remains focused on her fitness down in DC, with residents spotting her out jogging in Rock Creek Park with Secret Service agents.  The Washington Post reported that she 'wore sleek black leggings, a hat — and a smile for passersby' on the jog, through the same park where murdered DC intern Chandra Levy's body was discovered over a decade ago. The jogger who spotted Ivanka also noted that she 'looked glowy.' Ivanka has also stopped by Flywheel, having been a fan of the studio for years and frequented the chain's Manhattan locations as well, where riders are ranked on a board displayed for everyone to see throughout the class. Most refuse to use their real name for this reason, but not Ivanka who always signs up for classes as 'Ivanka.'  Flywheel is not as popular however as Soul Cycle, which is the spin studio of choice for the likes of Michelle Obama and Chelsea Clinton. Chelsea even hosted a fundraiser for her mother's presidential campaign at one of the chain's Manhattan locations last January.  Ivanka's evenings meanwhile have been spent with her kids, out at events, or enjoying dinner dates with Kushner. The two dined at the upscale eatery RPM Italian just last week, which is owned by Trump family friend and Apprentice winner Bill Rancic. And in one of her first big outings about town, Ivanka took daughter Arabella to an event at the Chinese Embassy to celebrate the lunar new year. Couples retreat: Ivanka and Jared arrive for a joint press conference between US President Donald Trump and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday (above) Official trips: Ivanka accompanied her father on Marine One last week (above) to receive the body of a fallen SEAL Team 6 member Taxing conversation: Ivanka chats with Ernst & Young CEO Mark Weinberger during a forum with chief executives of major US companies at the White House last week That capped off a busy day for the First Daughter, who accompanied her father to Dover Air Force Base in the afternoon to receive the body of a fallen SEAL Team 6 member and then headed back to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue on Marine One to watch as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was sworn into office. She then headed straight from the White House to the embassy event, at which her role seemed to be that of White House proxy, much like it was on Saturday when she and husband Jared Kushner attended the annual Alfalfa Dinner. And Ivanka proved herself to be excellent in her proxy role last Wednesday by bringing along the star of some hugely popular videos in China - her daughter. Arabella has appeared in two videos that went viral on Chinese social media after being posted by her mother, including one that has close to 100million views of her reciting Tang Dynasty poems in Mandarin while dressed in a traditional Chinese blouse.  Two days later, Ivanka demonstrated her ability to work a room like a seasoned politician at the Four Seasons, with Politico reporting that she made her way through the establishment greeting Nancy Pelosi, Vernon Jordan and Steve Schwarzman among others.  Ivanka was joined on Friday by Dina Powell, a former Goldman Sachs partner who joined the administration as an assistant to the president and senior counselor for economic initiatives.  The pair have worked to arrange sit-downs recently with Ivanka and Bill Gates and Chan where Ivanka can discuss her aim to develop policies to support women in the work place. Ivanka also chatted privately with Brian Krzanich, the CEO of Intel, after he visited the White House this week. And she spent an entire evening with DC's biggest politicians back on January 28 when she and Kushner attended the annual Alfalfa Dinner at the Capital Hilton. That event did not go quite as planned however when Ivanka was widely criticized for posting an Instagram picture of her $5,000 Carolina Herrera evening gown on the same  night thousands of immigrants were being held in airports across the country as part of her father's immigrant travel ban.  Mom on the go: Ivanka heads out of her DC home last Friday with her two children (above) School days: Ivanka was taking daughter Arabella (left) and son Joseph (right) to school  Dad's off: Kushner departed for his job at the White House before the rest of his family (abobve) Ivanka was publicly silent this week as she found herself at the center of the latest debate over ethics and Trump family business conflicts.  A person close to her said she was not involved in her father's decision to fire off a tweet slamming Nordstrom for dropping her fashion line, a move that looked to some like a dad defending his daughter, and to others like the president ripping a private enterprise for the financial benefit of a family member. Ivanka kept quiet because she takes the decision she made last month to step down from her brand very seriously, and wants to be certain that she has no ties to her line, according to that same person.  That became even more difficult to do for the new First Daughter after White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer stated that Nordstrom made their decision not based on sales, but because they did not agree with President Trump's politics.  One day later, Kellyanne Conway stirred up the controversy further when she offered her support by telling people to 'go buy Ivanka's stuff,' boasting in a national television interview that she was giving the brand a free commercial.' That move managed to rile ethics experts and got Conway 'counseled' by the White House as in her job as counselor to President Trump she is a federal employee, and therefore barred from endorsing products.   Date night: Ivanka and Kushner posted a photo as they headed out for the annual Alfalfa Dinner at the Capital Hilton last month (above), and were quickly criticized for showcasing their black-tie attire on the night President Trump's now overturned immigrant travel ban went into affect Coffee talk: Ivanka has also been meeting with big-name executives including Bill Gates, Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg's wife Priscilla Chan (above with Zuckerberg last week) Opposites attract: Ivanka has been hitting up Flywheel for spin classes in DC, the competition of Soul Cycle, which is the studio of choice for Chelsea Clinton (above at their Tribeca location last January for a Hillary Clinton fundraiser) Ivanka has said she will not take a formal role in the White House, a move that some would likely oppose as a violation of the emoluments clause, but she has had a much bigger presence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue this month.  Women's issues were also on the agenda at a recent White House meeting with business leaders at Ivanka Trump's urging. On the social side, Trump has pushed back against the suggestion that she would serve as a fill-in for first lady Melania Trump, who has not yet moved to Washington. But she is undoubtedly getting a lot of invites. 'My feeling is she, more than anybody else, has the potential to be the ambassador from the Trump White House to the Washington scene,' said longtime Washington Post writer Sally Quinn. Quinn noted that with Ivanka Trump's close relationship to her father and her husband's job as adviser to the president, 'they are probably the two most powerful people in Washington. From that perspective, she would be the person people would most want to be around.'

Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies TV Politics Business Super Bowl Ads     IPhone 8 Will Feature Wireless Charging Posted: Feb 10 2017, 9:30am CST | by Ahmed Humayun, in Rumors | Apple   iPhone 8 concept by Thadeu Brandão   With all the companies unloading their flagship models and announcing their plans for the year, Apple has been a bit quiet in publicizing their plans. Many experts are suggesting that Apple Inc is playing a poker game and waiting for the competition to show their hand, only then will Apple swoop-in to steal the spotlight. A surprising report from KGI has strengthened the chances of that happening. Don't Miss: Super Bowl 2017 Commercials & Advertisers There were a lot of rumors about the iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone 8, but none of them mentioned any possibility of wireless charging feature. The report from KGI states with certainty that unlike popular belief, Apple iPhone 8 will not be the only one featuring the wireless charging, instead all of the iPhones being released by Apple this year will have this as a standard feature. Apple will also be celebrating iPhone’s tenth anniversary this year and the iPhone 8 is rumored to be the tenth anniversary edition handset by Apple. Of course, Apple will be planning to mark this year in its history and also create a state of the art handset to live-up to the ten-year legacy of iPhone, so a strong guess is that iPhone 8 is going to be a Christmas of latest technologies and features. At first it was expected that Apple iPhone 8 will have the wireless charging feature as a celebrity feature but now we know that Apple has something else in store for iPhone 8 as the wireless charging feature is going to be standard. The report also claims that the prices of iPhone models released this year will have a price tag of around $1000. Apparently, the charging component will generate intense heat which could hard the 3D touch sensor. So, to protect the panel and its components, it is laminated by the help of a graphite sheet. This safety precaution is the reason behind the bulky price tag and Apple thinks that the public while find it justifiable. Apple iPhone 8 might have an even heavier price tag due to all the extra features it will have for being the tenth anniversary celebration edition.

By Karthekayan IyerKarthekayan Iyer Published Date 10 - Feb - 2017 | Last Updated 10 - Feb - 2017 Tweet   Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime (Gold, 32GB) 8999 Apple is expected to launch three new iPhones in 2017, and one of the key new features rumoured to be standard across all the variants is wireless charging. A new report from KGI Securities' analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has had a particular proclivity for iPhone predictions, state that all the new iPhones will support wireless charging. Kuo has previously stated inclusion of wireless charging in iPhones, too. The new report claims that Apple is working on including wireless charging for its next generation iPhones, and not keep it limited to the premium, anniversary-edition iPhone with the OLED display. It is not yet clear if Apple will employ one of the existing wireless charging standards, or is developing its own standard from scratch. Looking at Apple's tendency for introducing proprietary standards, a completely new wireless charging method may not be entirely out of the cards. Apple is rumoured to introduce three new iPhones this year, two of them being an iterative update to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus while the third one will be a redesigned iPhone 8, also referred to as iPhone X. Kuo says the new iPhone with an OLED display will also come with "additional graphite sheet lamination" to prevent Touch ID from overheating. "While we don’t expect general users to notice any difference, lamination of an additional graphite sheet is needed for better thermal control and, thus, steady operation; this is because FPCB is replaced with film, which is more sensitive to temperature change of the 3D touch sensor in OLED iPhone," Kuo said in a research note obtained by MacRumors. Apple is rumoured to be working on a new long-range wireless charging technology also called as inductive technology. Apple's patent filings suggests the handset will rely on magnetic coils to provide power and not radio waves used in technologies available right now. The new iPhone with OLED display and glass casing is also rumoured to be priced upwards of $1,000. With Apple's next-generation iPhones are not expected to launch anytime before September 2017, we can expect to have more clarity on Apple's proposed technology in the coming days.

That’s because the iPhone maker is already sourcing components and placing orders for the next-gen iPhone, and it’s all happening a lot earlier than expected. Don't Miss: These 4 iPhone hacks might just blow your mind This is the second time in a matter of days that we’ve heard that iPhone 8 manufacturing might kick off sooner than expected. Digitimes says that supply chain sources have already confirmed that Apple will start receiving parts for the 2017 iPhones toward the end of the first quarter this year. The earlier these iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s parts start shipping, the faster we’ll see the devices and their new components. Why? Well, it’s likely that we’ll get plenty of image leaks showing the devices and internal parts after they hit production, just like we’ve seen every other year. The sooner parts start shipping, the sooner we’ll see them leak. Taiwan-based suppliers told the site that companies will start working on OLED panel bonding for the iPhone 8 around the end of the first quarter, and that Apple has already begun ordering OLED panels from Samsung Display. Apple is apparently also placing orders for chips, and has set “more stringent” inspection requirements for processors, components, modules, and mechanical parts. It sounds like Apple is doubling-down on quality assurance, and that’s probably a good thing considering Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 debacle is still fresh on everyone’s minds. The report also notes that the iPhone 8 will feature wireless charging and iris scanning technology, according to unnamed sources. Apple suppliers are said to be “generally optimistic” about the iPhone 8’s popularity. Some analysts expect the iPhone 8 to fuel a super-cycle this year, with sales seen benefiting not only Apple but also its complex network of suppliers.

Parts and components for production are scheduled to be delivered in the first quarter of 2017, earlier than in previous years. Apple has requested its chip and component suppliers start trial production, inspection and prepare inventories for the new iPhone series earlier than usual, said the sources. Deliveries of chips and parts for the new models are expected to kick off in the second half of first-quarter 2017, the sources indicated. This corroborates a report from BlueFin which was then contradicted by FastCompany. Sources at Taiwan based suppliers claim that they will start working on OLED panel bonding for the device around the end of the first quarter. Apple is also said to have ordered sufficient OLED panels from Samsung for the new device. Possibly due to the new design, Apple is being more stringent on inspection requirements. Apple is more active in placing chip orders for the 2017 iPhone series, and has set more stringent inspection requirements for related chips, components, modules and mechanical parts, according to sources at analog IC vendors. It's widely believed that the 10th anniversary iPhone will be a major update. It will purportedly have a front glass cover and chassis, joined by a metal bezel and an edge-to-edge display that has no bezels on the top and bottom. Additionally, the front camera, Touch ID, speaker, and other sensors will apparently be embedded into the display. Another report claims that the device would be a clear piece of glass with a next-generation OLED screen. More recently, Apple is said to be equipping the phone with wireless charging and a 3D camera. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

(REUTERS/Thomas Peter) Apple’s radical new iPhone may come with a $1,000 price tag. Or an even bigger price tag. Apple’s 2017 premium iPhone – which some Wall Street analysts are calling the “iPhone X” with “X” designating the 10th anniversary of the iPhone – could be priced at over $1,000. That argument was made this week by Fast Company. In fact, that case – as Fast Company points out – isn’t very hard to make, considering the top-of-the-line iPhone 7 Plus today, with 256GB of storage, has a retail price of $969. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH APPLE’S 2017 iPHONE 'X' But the $1,000-plus price would cement, if accurate, an upward trend in Apple iPhone pricing. If, for example, the priciest 2017 iPhone falls somewhere in the $1,000 to $1,200 range, that would put it squarely in MacBook Air territory. Apple’s popular MacBook line starts at $999. “The OLED display will definitely be very expensive,” Daniel Matte, an analyst with market researcher Canalys, told Fox News in an email. Matte is referring to the centerpiece of the rumored premium iPhone, an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display. That display technology would allow Apple to offer a curved display, analogous to Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge.   “The limited quantities available will definitely require some models to stick with LCDs,” he added, meaning that not all new 2017 iPhones will be priced in the stratosphere. New iPhones with more conventional LCDs (liquid crystal displays – which Apple uses now) are also expected to be available and be cheaper than the premium iPhone. APPLE WILL START BUILDING IPHONES IN INDIA THIS SPRING, REPORT SAYS “Apple will probably continue with the current LCD models and introduce one or two new premium flagship iPhones with OLED displays,” Raymond Soneira, president of DisplayMate Technologies, told Fox News last week. But because it’s so early – with the 2017 premium iPhone not due until summer at the earliest and more likely in the fall – it’s possible that Apple doesn’t even know what the exact price will be yet. A source familiar with activity in the “supply chain” of manufacturers, which build components for the iPhone, tells Fox News that Apple is likely testing early prototype versions of future iPhones at the moment. And that Apple is moving quickly to secure as many OLED displays as possible. APPLE WATCH SALES SPIKED OVER THE HOLIDAY: SMARTWATCHES ARE HERE TO STAY Pricing aside, the iPhone X – rumored to have a 5.8-inch display compared to the current 7 Plus’ 5.5-incher – should be a stunner.  “With a curved screen OLED, the iPhone display will almost certainly be bezel and border free to the outside edges, and fill all or almost all of the entire front view edge-to-edge, with rumors predicting that the home button, fingerprint sensor, ambient light and proximity sensors will be incorporated within the display,” DisplayMate’s Soneira said.  All new iPhone models are also slated to come with wireless charging, according to reports.  Apple did not respond to a request for comment on this story.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Rumor: Apple may add wireless charging to iPhone 8, but top-end model could cost $1,000 Rumor: Apple may add wireless charging to iPhone 8, but top-end model could cost $1,000 By Joel Hruska on February 10, 2017 at 10:00 am Comment There are rumors swirling around the iPhone 8 suggesting Apple could be planning to offer a major technology leap forward with its 10th Anniversary iPhone, but the highest-end devices may not be cheap. Business Insider has published a pair of rumors on various aspects of the upcoming iPhone 8. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo Apple will move back to all-glass construction with the iPhone 8 for all three models. The use of glass could make it more difficult to implement the wireless charging support Kuo expects the new device to offer, and overheating could be a problem due to the difference in thermal dissipation between glass and metal. Kuo writes: Adoption of glass casing & wireless charging unfavorable to thermal system operation for three new 2017F iPhone models; bigger impact on OLED model. The thermal system becomes less efficient with glass casing, as compared to metal casing used previously. Furthermore, wireless charging increases handset temperature. While we don’t expect general users to notice any difference, lamination of an additional graphite sheet is needed for better thermal control and, thus, steady operation; this is because FPCB is replaced with film, which is more sensitive to temperature change of the 3D touch sensor in OLED iPhone. Kuo suspects that Apple can solve this problem by adding the aforementioned graphene sheet, but that it could increase the cost of the OLED panel by as much as 50%. That brings us to our second rumor. Scuttlebutt suggests the top-end iPhone 8 with an OLED display, wireless charging, and a 5.8-inch screen could hit $1,000 or even more. Mark Sullivan of Fast Company agrees with Kuo on this point. Sullivan expects the iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) to offer more RAM, more storage, and possibly higher clock speeds than other Apple devices. The new iPhone 8 will push for a display across its entire surface, and a 5.8-inch screen size. The iPhone 8/X is also expected to offer home buttons and fingerprint sensors built directly into its edge-to-edge screen, a double camera, and 3D-sensing technology provided by Lumentum. Companies like Amazon and Google have played with 3D-sensing technology to varying degrees, and the tech could be useful in augmented reality and virtual reality applications. Now, keep in mind, that $1,000+ price tag is strictly for the premium model. There would be three smartphones in total: A 4.7-inch model (iPhone 7s), a 5.5-inch model (iPhone 7s Plus) and the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 or iPhone X with higher specs wherever possible. Apple has supposedly tied up OLED suppliers and is working on integrating a much larger battery into the iPhone 8/X. The company is also expected to use both Intel and Qualcomm modems. For now, it looks like Apple will debut a number of brand-new features for the iPhone 8/X, then roll those features out to the entire product lineup, most likely the following year. That would keep some technologies positioned as halo items for the luxury buyers, while simultaneously ensuring over the long term that these features would be used.

NEWS: Nunavut February 10, 2017 - 10:30 am Recall on President’s Choice brand baby food pouches expanded: GN Earlier recall expanded due to possibility of dangerous bacteriaNUNATSIAQ NEWS If you have a baby food pouch like this, toss it out or return it to where you bought it, warns the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. (FILE PHOTO) If you have baby food that looks like this in your home, don’t eat it. A food recall warning, first issued on Feb. 3, has also been updated to include additional products. Loblaw Companies Ltd. has already pulled President’s Choice (PC) Organics brand baby food pouches from the marketplace because they may permit the growth of clostridium botulinum, which causes botulism. Botulism can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, blurred or double vision, dry mouth, respiratory failure and paralysis. A manufacturing error resulted in excess water in the recalled products, which under certain circumstances could support the growth of clostridium Botulinum and pose a health risk to consumers, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said Feb. 8. Nunavut’s department of health earlier warned about a food recall on one specific lot code of President’s Choice (PC) Organics brand Apple, Blueberry and Green Pea strained baby food because it may contain clostridium botulinum, which causes botulism. The Health Department issued another warning Feb. 10 about the expanded recall, which now includes all flavours of PC Organics strained baby food pouches. Specifically, that includes: PC Organics Apple, Blueberry & Green Pea strained baby food, 128 ml. PC Organics Apple Crisp Muffin flavour puree snack, 128 ml.

The most talked-about W1 headphones are obviously Apple’s truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods, which are still next to impossible to find unless you’re willing to pay a premium. Then you had the Powerbeats3 wireless earbuds and the Beats Solo3 wireless over-ear headphones, both of which are widely available for purchase. As of Friday morning, however, Apple has added a fourth option for wireless headphones equipped with the W1 chip: After a long wait, Apple’s new BeatsX earbuds are finally available for sale online and in Apple stores. Don't Miss: These 4 iPhone hacks might just blow your mind Apple seems to be having a bunch of trouble with its wireless headphones these days. The company’s manufacturing partners still can’t manage to build anywhere close to enough supply to meet AirPods demand, and the launch itself was delayed by about two months last year. Then the new BeatsX launch was behind schedule as well, leaving people wondering if they were ever going to be able to get their hands on these new wireless earbuds from Apple’s Beats by Dr. Dre brand. As the company noted earlier this week, however, BeatsX earbuds are finally available for purchase. They come in four different colors — gray, white, blue and black — and as of the time of this writing, both the white and the black BeatsX models were available to ship immediately. New orders placed for the gray or blue models had an estimated delivery date of February 22nd at the earliest, at the time this post was written. The BeatsX wireless earbuds sell for $149.95, which is $50 less expensive than the Powerbeats3 (although the Powerbeats3 earbuds are on sale for $50 off on Amazon right now). Early reviews suggest that the new BeatsX earbuds have impressive sound quality that is in line with the AirPods, but perhaps a touch more bass-heavy. This is the result of a more secure fit in the ear canal, which provides better sound isolation and therefore stronger bass. As we noted in our earlier AirPods coverage, the AirPods offer terrific sound quality and impressive bass, but it’s difficult to keep a good seal in the ear since they’re made out of smooth plastic.

GST is still an evolving tax structure and the GST council has to see if they can incorporate the sops Apple is asking for under the new tax regime,” the official said. But revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia, told HT that the government right now cannot give any exemption in terms of excise or service tax. Read: Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone 8 may support wireless charging “As far as excise and service tax is concerned there can be no exemption at this point as this will go into GST. The question is that by giving custom duty exemption you are going against Make-In-India, unless it is for importing parts. But then we should encourage all parts to be made in India otherwise it is assembly of a product,” he said. The government official also said that India might allow Apple to set up its refurbished iPhone facility in the country which Tim Cook had hinted at during his India visit last year. “As long as they export the refurbished phones, we have no problems in allowing the facility,” the official said. Read: Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone 8 to come with OLED displays Earlier in December, reports and industry sources hinted that Apple was in talks with Taiwanese contract-manufacturer Wistron to assemble iPhones in a new plant that is being setup in the industrial area of Peenya in Bengaluru. “Apple is in talks with Wistron to start assembly in Peenya. The company is expected to start assembly first and then scale up slowly to complete knock down manufacturing as the demand arises,” an industry source in the know of things, told HT. However, he had also said that assembly might not start in April next year but is more likely to start during the last quarter of 2017. Read: Apple to come out with iPhone 7S in red colour before iPhone 8 Meanwhile, an inter-ministerial panel has been set up to look into Apple’s demands for starting manufacturing in the country. The panel has reserved its decision for now after a presentation was made by Apple on January 25. Apple has a laundry list of demands that includes income tax holiday, subsidy on freight and other things. “Apple might want MSIPS and other incentives to continue even after the introduction of the GST. It could also look at income-tax holiday in the country similar to China and Vietnam,” an industry expert told HT. Read: Apple chooses Wistron to ‘make in India’ However, another government official said that it might not be provided with special incentives. “Apple has been looking for several duty and tax incentives for manufacturing handsets in India, but the government is unlikely to make any exception for one company,” said a top official in one of the departments mentioned above. Speaking to HT on conditions of anonymity, the official said that any exception for the iPhone manufacturer will defeat the purpose of an integrated policy such as Make-in-India. Apple Inc in a statement said that “it was working hard to develop our operations in India.” “We appreciate the constructive and open dialogue we’ve had with government about further expanding our local operations.” tags Apple Apple India Wistron GST Hasmukh Adhia more from business Inside Infosys: No breakdown in corporate governance says Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw Feb 10, 2017 20:38 IST Inside Infosys: Murthy flags ‘huge’ severance pay, governance issues Feb 10, 2017 20:26 IST Recommended for you Presenting sponsor co-sponsor partner India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Health & fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

The company is expected to release an update to its iPhone 7 series in the form of a 7S and 7S Plus in the first half of 2017. Apple iPhone 8’s rumour bandwagon keeps getting heavier and this time speculations are making rounds that the 10th-anniversary edition of iPhone will come with a wireless charging facility. Who is sparking the rumours? None other than noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who works for KGI securities. “While we don’t expect general users to notice any difference, lamination of an additional graphite sheet is needed for better thermal control and, thus, steady operation; this is because FPCB is replaced with film, which is more sensitive to temperature change of the 3D touch sensor in OLED iPhone,” a note from Kuo reads. Read: Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone 8 to come with OLED displays However, Kuo’s note might not all be good news for consumers as the additional graphite sheet is going to make iPhones costlier. A recent report had also suggested that the iPhone 8 will come with an onerous price tag pf $1,000 or something really close to it. Other speculations indicate that the iPhone 8 will come in two sizes with OLED displays and better water resistant features. It is also expected to come with better 3D Touch technology. Read: Apple to come out with iPhone 7S in red colour before iPhone 8 Taiwanese sources have also claimed that Apple has bypassed usual supplier Foxconn and placed orders for forged stainless steel iPhone casings from manufacturing partner Jabil. The iPhone-maker had last relied on stainless steel instead of aluminium on the iPhone 4S but had to switch to aluminium due to quality issues. This means that the iPhone 8 may come with glass front and rear with a steel chasis on the sides. tags Apple Apple iPhone 8 Apple iPhone 7 iPhone 7S iPhone 7 Plus more from tech WhatsApp gets two-setep verification for Android, iPhones and Windows Feb 10, 2017 20:33 IST BHIM app registration crossed 140 lakh: Prasad Feb 10, 2017 19:46 IST Recommended for you Presenting sponsor co-sponsor partner India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Health & fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

The report, citing sources from Apple’s supply chain, adds that the Cupertino company has moved up iPhone 8 production earlier than the schedule in previous years. According to the report, suppliers are scheduled to begin delivering parts and components for Apple’s tenth anniversary handset later in the first quarter of this year. Apple has requested its chip suppliers and other component makers to kick off trial production and prepare inventories for iPhone 8 earlier than usual, reads the report. Deliveries of chips and parts for the upcoming iPhone models are expected to kick off in the second half of first-quarter 2017. “Apple is more active in placing chip orders for the 2017 iPhone series, and has set more stringent inspection requirements for related chips, components, modules and mechanical parts,” according to sources. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently reiterated predictions that 2017 iPhone family would include a new OLED-based iPhone 8 model packed with the latest technologies, in addition to LCD-based iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus refreshes. Suppliers should start working on OLED panel bonding for iPhone 8 around the end of the first quarter. Samsung Display is said to be the lone provider of OLEDs for iPhone 8 until Sharp, Japan Display and LG Display being churning out OLEDs in volume. KGI also said that iPhone 8’s 3D Touch module might be 30-50 percent costlier to build than its predecessor due to an additional graphite sheet lamination. The new layer is understood to be needed to prevent the device from overheating due to wireless charging, which increases the internal temperature of a smartphone. FastCo said a few days ago that iPhone 8 may cost north of $1,000 due to components like a pricier OLED display with embedded sensors, an enhanced 3D Touch module, fast wireless charging, improved water resistance and other perks. DigiTimes said last month that iPhone 8 should include enhanced Siri capabilities. Makers in the supply chain are “generally optimistic” about the popularity of the device, the sources said. The Taiwanese trade publication claims that new iPhones are slated for launch in September 2017. iPhone 8 concept via iDrop News.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search BeatsX Earphones are now available at last Eric Abent - Feb 10, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit It’s been a bit of bumpy road getting to this point, but Beats by Dre‘s new BeatsX Earphones are finally available for purchase. Beats and Apple originally intended to have these on store shelves in time for the holiday shopping season, but then their release was pushed back into 2017. Their release mirrors that of the AirPods in some ways, as those were hit with a delay as well. The similarities between BeatsX Earphones and Apple AirPods don’t stop there. Both use Apple’s W1 chip which, among other things, aims to make pairing as painless as possible. Once they’re synced to your iPhone, for instance, BeatsX Earphones will also automatically sync with any other device signed into the same Apple ID. The W1 chip should also help you squeeze out some extra battery life. With the BeatsX, Apple quotes 8 hours, and even if your own usage comes in below that official estimate, it won’t be long before you’re up and running again. That’s because BeatsX features some degree of fast charging capability – called Fast Fuel in this case – that promises two hours of battery life from a five minute charge. The BeatsX features a behind-the-neck design, similar to other headsets like LG’s Tones. The earbuds aren’t retractable here, but they don’t necessarily need to be. Instead, the earbuds are held together by a magnet when not in use, keeping things tangle-free whether they’re around your neck or in your pocket. In-line controls allow you to place and end calls, change the volume, and summon Siri, and these can be used with iOS and Android devices alike. The whole BeatsX package costs $149.95, and they’re available in four different colors: white, black, blue, and gray. They’re shipping out now from Apple’s online storefront, but you might want to jump in sooner rather than later, as delivery has already been delayed to the end of February for some colors.

Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks on stage during a product launch event on October 27, 2016. Image: stephen lam/Getty Images By Emma Hinchliffe2017-02-10 15:11:14 UTC Tech companies are finally catching up to their responsibility in spreading fake news — and that includes Apple.  "You have to give the consumer tools to help with this," Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview with Good Morning Britain posted Friday. "We’ve got to filter out part of it before it ever gets there without losing the great openness of the internet."  Cook didn't say what Apple would do to combat fake news, a term that is now almost meaningless thanks to its use as a pejorative for anything from misleading, false and partisan articles online that mimic real reporting to stories that don't meet the approval of President Donald Trump. Apple — unlike Facebook — hasn't been tagged with the blame for fake news and its influence on the U.S. presidential election. Facebook introduced a few fixes in December meant to stem the spread of misleading information on its platform.  Apple does offer Apple News, its iOS app and main news platform that curates articles from news sources for Apple users.  "This is one of today’s chief problems," Cook said. "It is not something that has a simple solution."  EXCLUSIVE: With fake news hitting the headlines, how does Apple boss @Tim_Cook think the issue should be dealt with? pic.twitter.com/kqF9scLzYh — Good Morning Britain (@GMB) February 10, 2017 Cook also weighed in, again, on President Donald Trump's travel and immigration ban against seven Muslim-majority countries.  "He's our president. On the issue of immigration specifically, we support broad-immigration, particularly of high-skilled folks," Cook said. "I think this is so important for the world. We are better because we're a diverse company." Cook discussed Apple's investment in its British business despite the United Kingdom's impending exit from the European Union during his trip.  "We're a big believer in the U.K.," Cook said. "The U.K. will be just fine."

Opinion | 06 Feb 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (38) What Apple Can Learn from Airwalk by Josh Centers When I was a teenager in the 1990s, Airwalk shoes were all the rage. They were a mandatory accessory for grunge-oriented youths, along with plaid shirts and corduroy pants. The company was founded in 1986, and in its heyday in the 1990s, it had grown to be the third-largest sneaker brand, behind only Nike and Adidas. Today’s teens have undoubtedly never even heard of Airwalk sneakers, which are now found on the bargain rack at Payless Shoesource. What happened? Wait, this is TidBITS, not a fashion magazine, so why am I talking about shoes? Keep reading. I’m about to tell you a story that may sound chillingly familiar. Airwalk began as a niche shoe for professional skateboarders. Skating legend Tony Hawk (who starred in an eponymous video game that ran on the Mac, along with many other platforms) was one of their first customers, and actually suggested the name. Much of Airwalk’s early popularity was due to getting input from skaters to create superior skateboarding shoes that wouldn’t cause blisters or crashes. Airwalk had a healthy business, but it didn’t hit the big time until it hired advertising firm Lambesis to run an ultra-chic, counter-cultural ad campaign. As Malcolm Gladwell wrote in “The Tipping Point,” Airwalk was a $16 million company in 1993. In 1994, it was a $44 million company. In 1995, it was a $150 million company. To satisfy the vast influx of teenage customers while keeping skateboarders and boutique shops happy, Airwalk developed a two-tier strategy. It sold cheaper, consumer-grade shoes to mainstream retailers like Footlocker while continuing to provide pricier, professional-grade shoes to boutique shops. But Airwalk’s success didn’t last. The company’s troubles began in 1997 as production problems led to limited back-to-school supplies. Meanwhile, its lineup had become stale, with few new models. Worst of all, Airwalk abandoned its professional line of shoes. Serious skaters dropped Airwalk, causing the brand to lose its cachet with teens, and it wasn’t long before Airwalk’s time in the sun was over. A smallish company exploding due to quality products and a hip ad campaign. A product line that split into both consumer and professional tiers to provide different price points and features. A company that was later plagued by production problems, stagnant product designs, and ignoring its professional market. Does that sound like another company you can think of? Airwalk might have skated along for a while with its old designs and made peace with retailers, but abandoning its key market of hardcore skaters was what drove it into market irrelevance. In terms of managing supply chains and industrial design, Apple has a pair of superstars in Tim Cook and Jony Ive (to the extent Ive is still involved in product design, anyway). And Apple no longer worries about disappointing retailers, having opened hundreds of its own stores. More concerning is how Apple is treating its professional users. Let’s itemize a few of the ways Apple has moved away from the professional market over the past five years: Killing the Xserve Dumbing down Final Cut Pro with Final Cut Pro X Replacing the pro app Aperture with the consumer-level Photos Increasing burdensome restrictions on Mac App Store apps Releasing a new Mac Pro without internal expandability Failing to update that Mac Pro for over 3 years Delaying updates to the MacBook Pro line for nearly 18 months Releasing a new MacBook Pro that has drawn criticism from professionals Showing a lack of support for automation by eliminating the position of Product Manager of Automation Technologies We’re not alone in saying that Apple is now the iPhone company (see “Understanding Apple’s Marginalization of the Mac,” 21 November 2016). That’s where most of its profit comes from, and so that’s where most of its resources go. Fair enough. But, here’s the thing: the Mac and the capabilities it provides to professionals are the foundation of that iPhone business. Die-hard Mac users kept Apple afloat in the dark years before the iPod and then iPhone. And even now, regardless of all other professional uses of the Mac, developers need Xcode on the Mac to create iOS apps. Apple still has many things in its favor: $241 billion in cash, massive profits every quarter, one of the most popular brands in the world, and nearly 500 successful retail stores. And it might seem odd to criticize Apple now, especially when the company just broke a quarterly record with the most iPhone and Mac sales ever (helped by new iPhone and MacBook Pro models, plus the holiday shopping season, see “Apple Sees Apparent Return to Growth with Q1 2017’s Record Results,” 31 January 2017). But as we saw with Airwalk, things could go downhill fast if professional users were to leave the platform, taking with them all the people and organizations they currently keep loyal to Apple products. I don’t want to be too hard on Apple. The company is still incredibly strong and is doing better in some areas where it has been weak. By many accounts, Final Cut Pro X has improved greatly since its initial release, and some professional movie makers are giving it a chance. App Store review times are plummeting, and Apple is planning to allow developers to respond directly to App Store reviews. Swift is an exciting new programming language with a bright future, and it’s suitable for both compiled apps and scripts. You might argue that Apple and Airwalk aren’t comparable. For instance, although it may have gotten its start providing athletic shoes, Airwalk ultimately became a fashion company. But isn’t Apple similar in many respects? Apple opened its doors with the Apple I hobby kit, and by the mid-2000s, the iPod and its white earbuds were fashion mainstays. The Apple Watch is clearly intended to be a fashion item today. Even the MacBook, with its prominent usage in coffee shops, airports, and other public places, makes its own fashion statement. Despite these similarities, Apple is a much, much larger company than Airwalk ever was. Plus, Apple is making so much money and has so much cash that it can afford many more missteps than a plucky young footwear company. Perhaps most important, Apple can learn from the example of companies like Airwalk that fell from grace after losing sight of their most influential users. Here’s hoping Apple realizes the danger of diverting too much attention away from the Mac and its professional users.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 10:37 Josh, I was thinking about this over the weekend, but came to a different conclusion. Relying on fashion is not the winning strategy for a company that is this large. Nor is relying on what used to sell - gizmos. I am an Apple computer/phone/watch/TV user. I'll probably buy AirPods. But as a stock holder, I don't want Apple to stay there. I want Apple to move into healthcare and financial services and be willing to abandon computer power users along the way. Shoes are a great analogy, they move to a diminishing market. I want Apple to thrive, and I think it is time to move out of the diminishing phone and computers business and into services. If I could delegate Apple resources, I'd put some of the best folks they have on healthcare and finance. What does that make the phone and Mac? Loss leaders in 2020. Important to have but not the future of the company. So I guess that I am hoping Apple does the reverse of your last paragraph. Thanks for letting me think aloud, Peter Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-06 13:46 There's a lot to be said for Apple and services, but it's a matter of convincing the right people to write up their thoughts for us. :-) I think Apple is making some smart moves in the healthcare and IT spaces, especially with its IBM partnership. But as someone who uses Apple computers professionally, I don't want to see Apple become like IBM, moving entirely out of the end-user market to focus on back-end stuff. The iPhone is still by far Apple's largest revenue source, and the Mac users who create things for it are the backbone of that market. Reply David   2017-02-06 10:38 The day that a teen puts a poster of Marco Arment on the wall of their bedroom is the day that I will believe that the professionals you're talking about with regards to Apple are comparable to Tony Hawk. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-06 13:46 Ha! Teens may not idolize developers, but they certainly enjoy the apps they produce, including maybe some of Marco's. You could argue that Snapchat today is what skateboarding was 20+ years ago, though that's sort of a lousy analogy. Another way to think about this is: imagine walking into a coffee shop and instead of MacBooks, everyone was working on Surface Pro tablets. Given enough scale, that'd certainly have a network effect. Something Gladwell describes in his book, which I didn't go into in the article, is how trends develop. You first have what he calls innovators, oddballs who do new things. Then you have other groups who translate those things for the masses, like mavens and connectors. My point is, to put it in Gladwell speak, if those innovators drop Apple for another platform, over time that could trickle down to the masses and quickly eat away Apple's bottom line. Reply David   2017-02-06 17:54 They may enjoy the apps, but I doubt that 1 in 100 of them know the name of the developer who wrote it. And that breaks the link between "I have to wear what Tony Hawk is wearing" and "I have to code on what Marco Arment is coding on." I can equally imagine -- in the coffee shop analogy -- the teens being horrified that the "old people" are using the same thing they are, and fleeing Apple en masse. Finally, I don't find Gladwell's arguments particularly convincing. He seems to me to regularly take a small part of a social science finding (10,000 hours of practice, eg) and blow it up into a much larger and simpler conclusion, one that makes a good pop-sci headline but doesn't really tells us much about the real world. The narrative at the moment seems to be that Apple is neglecting pros and that's going to cost them, but what I've mostly seen is a range of strained arguments about why it's going to cost them, ranging from possibly plausible to pretty outlandish. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:34 I agree about Gladwell, which is why I didn't go too much into his theories in the article. However, outside of the linked interview, his book was the best source for the Airwalk story. The problem with arguments in favor of the professional markets is that there are a lot of intangibles there. In the case of Airwalk, it likely made total sense to dump the pro skater market for consumers — I'm sure they made far, far more money from Foot Locker than local skate shops. However, that turned out to be an enormous mistake, one that wouldn't appear on any spreadsheet. Reply David   2017-02-07 10:44 I think I'd like to see more than an anecdote before I buy into a narrative that is highly convenient for the people telling and reading it. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 22:44 One might say the same thing about your arguments. There's a whole truckload of wishful thinking there. Just from a local perspective, the predominant healthcare provider in my area, Palo Alto Medical Foundation, has excellent computerized records and services. They work on Windows PCs, not Macs. Other medical professionals use tablets, though they're not iPads, because they have to link with their non-Apple computer systems. Which is to say, without a Mac backbone, medical providers are not going to be using Apple products and services. Sure there are some highly visible Macs on some popular medical TV shows, but again, those are the Macs you so blithely dismiss. Great product placement, by the way. As Josh says, Macs are at the core of Apple's business. Without the Mac, the iPhone is just another gadget, here today, gone tomorrow. You know, like the iPad. And without the Mac, there will be no Apple products in medicine. As for financial whatever, all Apple does now is provide an access point via Apple Pay for consumers to the real financial service providers. They don't actually provide any of those financial services, nor are they likely to do so. Though they make a tidy profit with every Apple Pay transaction. You want to buy a Mac on credit through Apple you'll be using a Barclaycard, one of the highest interest rate charge cards on the planet, to whom Apple is only an intermediate business. In other words, I don't think your ambitions for Apple growth are grounded in anything like reality. As for shoes being a diminishing market, what planet are you living on? As large third-world countries like China, Mexico and India grow more prosperous, shoes will continue to be a growth industry. Just like iPhones. Which is why Apple is working so hard to break into the Indian market with lower price, recycled iPhones. That's where the growth is for them—and for Nike. The iPhone is the primary driver for the App Store, Apple's most prosperous service niche. And the App Store sells apps. And apps for the App Store are developed on Macs. Without the Mac there would be no apps and no App Store and, for all practical purposes, no iPhone. And no Apple. While Microsoft's Surface PCs are not yet a dominant product, Microsoft is clearly thinking long term, hence their huge investment in product placement in the NFL. The Surface Studio is coming out this year and will eventually, I presume to predict, make a significant dent in Apple's base among design professionals. Unless, as Josh hopes, Apple begins to take their professional base seriously once again. If I were twenty years younger I would certainly take the Surface Pro seriously. I share Josh's hope, but I don't share his optimism. If the new MacBook Pro is Apple's idea of a professional computer, with only 16GB of RAM, they've lost their way big time. They've taken their obsession with thin well past the point of diminishing returns. In the meantime, Tim Cook is good at blowing smoke at financial analysts, but as has been pointed out elsewhere in this issue of TidBITS, Apple's record first quarter was a week longer than the same quarter last year. In other words, Cook is using accounting gimmicks to draw a false equivalency between the two. Adjusted for that extra week, Apple's sales and profits are far less rosy than Cook would have us believe. At best they are flat, year over year. Is Apple making lots of money right now? Sure. Even with no growth they're still a rich company with money to burn. But they don't appear to be burning any of it on serious R&D. Like, perhaps, a touch interface for the macOS that can compete with Microsoft. iOS does touch just fine. But Cook refuses to acknowledge the need for it in OS X. Apple is riding high right now. But there's an old expression, what goes up must come down. Put another way, in business if you're not growing, you're dying. Implicit in Josh's argument is the proposition that Apple may have reached the peak of it's growth and success. They won't fail overnight, but that doesn't mean they're not failing. If Tim Cook is not aware of that, as he seems not to be, then Apple will be going downhill from now on. There may be a blip of success here and there, but that won't halt the downward momentum. Tim Cook is a nice guy and Steve Jobs was a jerk. Still, some might say the biggest difference between them is the vision thing. Steve had it. Tim does not. But I think the biggest difference between them is that Steve Jobs would not tolerate mediocrity. Time Cook seems to tolerate it all to well. Thanks David for giving me a jumping off point for my rant. I would have made it anyway, but you gave me a convenient place to start. I agree with Josh's premise, but I'm more skeptical than he is. Josh is politely suggesting that Apple needs to return it's attention to the Mac and the wide range of professional users who depend on it. Unlike Josh, however, I feel no need to be polite. Tim Cook needs to wake the f*ck up. Reply David   2017-02-07 22:37 You're certainly welcome. None of what you said was in response to my actual points, enough that I was wondering if there was another David in the thread. Apparently not. If you'd like to engage with my actual arguments, you're welcome to do that, too. Reply Nicholas Croft  2017-02-09 20:19 The PC 'enthusiast' market (broad term, basically power users of yore) is the only growth/margin market in the PC business. Apple are leaving money on the table by not addressing the enthusiast. Reply Zac Imboden   2017-02-06 15:06 What a thoughtful and well-written analysis. Regarding Peter Meyer's comments, I understand that Apple has it's own unique needs. What I would add is that what may be good for Apple (i.e. corporate expansion, diversification) may not be good for end users, specifically Mac users. I wish Apple to succeed as a company only as far as it concerns how they can continue to meet my needs and not theirs, my needs, not as a content revenue stream, an iPhone user, an iPad user, but as a MAC user. It appears to me that there is no longer any strong financial incentive for Apple to support and innovate their computer hardware and software as that segment continues to shrink in comparison to phone and content revenue. Continuing to complain about ridiculous mistakes in design and implementation and continuing to beg Apple to innovate and improve in the areas which matter the most to Mac users are losing propositions in the long run. If Apple wanted to do a great service to its various "niches", in my un-expert opinion, it would spin off the Mac and its system software and core apps into a separate company and let that company focus and innovate to meet the needs of its "niche" of Mac computer users at its own pace and peril. I'm not a investment guru, so I leave the financial merits of spin-offs for others. From an end-user endpoint, it seems to be the only way to get someone to pay closer attention to the very specific needs of computer users. Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-06 18:39 I think that would be courting the death of the Mac, honestly. As I argued in my other comment, the halo effect runs the other way - more people are buying Macs because they have used and liked Apple's consumer products. I think the main reason Macs have been bucking the overall decline in the computer industry is because they have Apple's strength in the consumer market to support them. If you cut the link there, you cut the main driving force for Mac market growth. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:19 Thanks for the kind words, Zac. However, I disagree with Apple spinning off the Mac. Tight integration with other Apple devices is still one of the Mac's strengths, and a spin-off would threaten that. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:20 I agree that the popularity of the iPhone and other Apple products helps drive Mac adoption. No argument there, and I think that's also still an important market for Apple. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 22:49 If Apple could value the Mac well enough to spin it off, they could value it enough to develop it internally. The problem is Apple doesn't seem to care one way or the other. Reply Derek Roff   2017-02-06 18:17 While Peter's suggestion that Apple get out of the hardware business strikes fear into my heart, I think it also misses Josh's key message. Why should a prudent investor like Peter assume that Apple can compete effectively in Services? This is an area where Apple has no particular expertise, and no intrinsic advantages. There are dozens of companies who understand Services better than Apple, and have both a deeper background and more agility. Airwalk survived as a fashion company, barely, and Apple might survive as an also-ran Services company, but as Josh indicates, this looks like the path to obscurity. Apple is a significant force in Services at the moment, because they are rich from hardware sales, and incredibly well known, from their integrated hardware, software, and lifestyle sales. Tossing all that out is, as Josh says, a losing strategy. Apple will not make its investors richer by proclaiming, "Think Conventionally". Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-06 18:30 Sigh. Another day, another 'Apple is doomed because they aren't catering to Important Users Like Me' article. The glaring flaw in this example is that it argues that people are drawn to Apple's consumer products because of the popularity of their computers among the elite - the halo effect. But if anything, the halo effect has run in the opposite direction, and has since the heyday of the iPod. People are buying Apple's consumer products, like the experience, and buying Macs to go with them. I've argued this before: Apple has, from the very first Apple ][, *always* catered to the ordinary user above the elite. When 'personal' computers were bulky S100 boxes that needed a separate dumb terminal and the arcane C/PM OS, Apple released a cute, streamlined all-in-one that hooked to a TV and booted into BASIC. When IBM introduced the designed-for-cubicles PC, Apple introduced the novice-user-friendly Mac. When smartphones were geeky tools, Apple released the iPhone. That's who they are. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-06 18:44 So you're saying that none of your less-technical family, friends, or clients buy Apple hardware because of your recommendations? In my experience, most people who know they don't have the technical chops to make an informed decision buy based on social influence. Reply David   2017-02-06 21:27 Are his family & friends a sufficient sample to generalize? Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-07 04:51 Actually, seriously, yes. I've been asked for advice on *which* Mac to buy, but everyone I know who bought Mac in the last year decided to go that route on their own. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-07 10:11 This is a discussion, not a research study. :-) Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-07 10:10 I obviously don't know the specifics, but unless you're well known for being platform agnostic, I doubt people would ask you for advice on other platforms. Your social influence to recommend Apple products is likely well known. Lots of people ask me for my opinions about what to buy, but they're always aware that I know Apple technology. But the article's point is that if you'd said, "Apple's hardware is stagnating and you'd be throwing money away if you didn't look at an Android phone or Windows PC" would those people ignore you and still buy Apple gear? In other words, if you as a tech influencer switched away from Apple gear, how many people would go with you eventually, purely because of your influence? Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:22 I'm not arguing that Apple is doomed. I can't count how many times I've written here something to the effect of "Apple is far from doomed." However, I do think shirking the professional market is an enormous mistake. Nor would I want Apple to drop or lose focus of its massively successful consumer line. The professional and consumer sides of Apple help build its strong ecosystem. Reply David   2017-02-07 10:50 2 people would go with me. Which would reduce Apple customers for the last quarter from 96 million people to 95,999,998. Even if there were 50,000 tech influencers who took 2 people with them, it would reduce Apple's customers from 96 million to 95,900,000 last quarter. (all numbers either approximate (customer numbers, people I influence) or made up (number of tech influencers)). Math done badly and on the fly. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 23:26 I'm not arguing that Apple is doomed, either, though I'm more cynical on the subject that Josh is. For one thing, doomed is a vague and melodramatic term. If Apple fails to innovate and improve the Mac, then their base of support will be eroded over time because, as I said before, the Mac is the core of Apple's business. Without it Apple's other business interests would fail to flourish. And that's putting it mildly. In my opinion, without the Mac there is no Apple. But I don't see Apple killing the Mac. After all, it's still making money. What I see happening, as Josh points out in more polite terms, is that the Mac appears to be declining in importance for Apple. This doesn't spell doom, but it does spell stagnation. Meanwhile, Apple competitors continue to innovate. As an artist, the Surface Studio is the first Windows PC that has ever piqued my interest. If Apple continues to rest on it's laurels Microsoft is going to eat their lunch. Now that they are making good hardware, Microsoft is playing in the same ballpark with Apple. And, like macOS X 10.12.x, Windows 10 is a solid and accessible OS. And there are areas, like cloud services, where Microsoft far exceeds Apple's success. So do Google and Amazon. Services aren't going to save Apple's bacon. The Mac is the only thing that can do that, not because it makes the most money, but because it's central to the success of every other Apple venture. What I don't understand is why Tim Cook doesn't seem to know this. His desultory remarks about the future of the Mac are not encouraging. Another incremental update to the iMac or the Mac mini isn't going to get the job done. Nor are incremental improvements to the macOS. As I've said before, at the top of my wish list is a touch screen interface for the macOS. Without this it's very hard to see how Apple is going to keep up with the competition. Reply Christian Kaatmann   2017-02-06 19:21 The thing that Apple is certainly doing right now - seen from a user perspective - is that _all_ of their systems are much more reliable now than they used to be. I very rarely have to reboot, if one app crashes the rest of the system carries on unperturbed, I can go seamlessly from my Mac to my iPhone to iCloud on a windows machine without ever loosing a comma in the text I'm working on. It's like magic compared to not so many years ago. And Apple has got us all happily hooked on its services with iCloud at the centre. And I mean happily, thinking of the days back with Excel 1.04, swapping disks on my Mac SE or more recently trying to keep my iMac from crashing every time I switched from Mail to Word to Excel to ... Apple keeps a lot of customers happy and deeply dependent. Reply Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 19:31 That is a great point. Thank you! Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:23 Apple does enjoy tremendous lock-in, which certainly gives it staying power. iCloud is one of the weaker service bundles, but it's bolstered by the popularity of the hardware, which in turn benefits from iCloud lock-in. Not to mention dependence on iMessage. Reply Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 19:30 A quick addition if you don't mind. I am going to express my opinion, not fact. I don't think that Apple will abandon the larger Mac and phone and iPod markets (or TV or iPads.) I am looking at these devices as critically important. Not important as computing devices, but highly valuable as data devices. What is the difference? Computing takes place in a small fairly closed environment. Data is fed by and then feeds a larger system. (I think of the Mac Pro as being about computing, the iPad and Apple TV as being about data.) If I look at this as an investor, I see that data system as services with end point devices. The devices are either commodity products or are really sophisticated at handling data to and from the user. That data is the core of the future services. (Again, this is me as businessman, not as the guy who is really enjoying this MBP right now). Apple should, absolutely should, stay in the end point market and make exceptionally exciting devices like an iPhone so light that you need a lanyard to hold it in place. Those devices are data portals, and the real economic engine for what might be the most valuable company on the planet will be the data services. They actually might subsidize the hardware experiments that many of us love. For those hardware experiments, my credit card vibrates in anticipation. My business mind is looking for services in healthcare and automobiles. The hardware is what we know, the services that we do not yet know will be our future, just as the pocket computer once was. So much for me being quick. Josh, Adam, thank you! Reply Herb Bowie  2017-02-06 20:16 The analogy seems a bit contrived, and the conclusions a bit overblown. Part of what we have always loved and respected about Apple is its intent and ability to skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it is. If we think about these issues from that perspective, we might make the following observations: 1. As device buses get increasingly powerful, and as the pace of technology change quickens, and as the desire for smaller computers increases, it will make sense for users to do "upgrades" by adding or swapping out peripherals, not through changes to the internals of their computers. 2. As SSD, memory, networks and microprocessors all get faster, the simple desire for ever bigger numbers -- faster chips, more RAM, etc. -- becomes less and less relevant for most users. 3. While Apple needs to provide core apps and services to make the average consumer happy, Apple's primary contribution to the larger app ecosystem is to make better tools for developers, not to make "Pro" level applications themselves. 4. As security becomes more and more of an issue, tight controls on the App store become increasingly important; however, third-party software suppliers still have the ability to deliver apps to their customers outside of the App store, so customers can have the best of both worlds. 5. As it becomes easier and easier to develop Mac applications, and as the Mac development tools grow stronger, and as the number of specialized apps continues to grow, it becomes ever harder to see why the Mac would need a special department for "Automation Technologies" for those few users who cannot find already developed solutions to their problems, yet who are also unable to develop new solutions themselves. So, yes, in all these cases, there are some short-term bumps in the road for many of us, and some more difficult issues for a few of us, but isn't this what we've always expected from Apple? Reply mike sanders  2017-02-06 21:53 Excellent response and a much more focussed overview, great respect to Josh but like so many "old" Apple users you still expect them to be a computer company which they no longer are. I have been a user since 1987 and an investor since the 2000s and have to say I am completely satisfied on both accounts. A very well run company which clearly knows where it is going just that it doesn't share it with us until the time is right. Have you seen the stock price today? Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:25 Per your point on automation — I think Apple sees Swift as eventually overtaking AppleScript. That's fine with me, but Apple also needs to continue to create automation tools for professionals who aren't programmers. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 23:47 I agree. Unfortunately, Apple has a habit of dropping the ball on good ideas and technologies. For example, iWeb was overtaken by the competition because Apple lost interest in developing it. The same goes for Aperture. Now Apple Script and Automator are threatened with extinction, with no accessible replacement in sight. Apple Script and Automator enable the user to plug right into the OS and their applications. They are essentially programmable apps. Swift, on the other hand, is a programming language not an application. It's hard to imagine a third party developing a program with Swift that will have the broad capabilities of Apple's native apps. If history is any guide, apprehension is called for. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-02-07 00:35 You forgot bonehead moves like killing Apple Displays, AirPort, and now it looks like the iPad lines will be next. Possibly even the desktop Macs. Tim Cook needs to be canned. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:26 Indeed, I should have mentioned the loss of Apple displays and the apparent abandonment of AirPort routers. The latter is a thorn in my side at the moment, since my Express is on its last legs, and I'm distrustful of others on the market. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-08 01:06 Right you are. Both Apple Displays and Airport routers have been overtaken by the competition because Apple has apparently lost interest in supporting and improving them. This has the look of a tradition at Apple. Or a disability, like ADD. There was a time when third-party routers did not support the Mac with decent setup software. Airport routers solved that problem, though they tended to be less capable than the competition. They had the virtue of being simple. That time is past. Though various routers handle the matter differently, their setup software has improved. For instance, I can get into a Comcast router's built-in setup software with a simple URL, as I did with Linksys routers in the past. AT&T has always bumped me to a web site where I entered the appropriate information and the web site passed it to the router. This was particularly useful in the old days when routers and modem settings often got corrupted. If something went wrong, pop, there I was at the AT&T setup page. Nowadays routers are more reliable and such problems are rare—though not unheard of. Apple eventually improved the simple Airport Base Station by including a hard drive that interfaced easily with Time Machine—the Airport Time Capsule, an appropriate name at the time. And the Time Capsule has improved over the years with a space saving tower configuration and larger hard drives. Though you can still get the Airport Extreme which is a simple router without the hard drive. It's comparably priced with similar routers, except that you still need an external modem, which might be a disadvantage, unless you're used to setting up modems. That said, I don't know why Apple is apparently dropping their WiFi product line. They work perfectly well. Perhaps sales have declined as service providers now so often provide their own routers and independent modems are less common. Airport routers still require an external modem, which puts them behind the curve. I used to like a separate modem because they tended to fail more often that routers. But now I rent my router from Comcast and if it fails for any reason I just pop down to the Xfinity store and get a replacement. The same goes for AT&T. I haven't had occasion to set up an Airport router in years. Still, I don't think it's a good reason not to get a replacement Airport Express if your Airport Extreme orTime Capsule is still working OK. Current models have the fastest WiFi, 802.11ac, and they are still for sale on the Apple web site, as is the Airport Express. Replacing the Express seems to me to be simpler than regigering your entire system with a new router and a new repeater. But then if your router is also having issues, there are less expensive alternatives to the Airport, depending on your setup. Reply Jean-Pierre SMITH  2017-02-07 04:37 Great analogy and thinking, for the Mac platform. I liked the idea the combination of (1) techical brilliance, as seen by the recognised "experts" and (2) some hype (better call it "intelligent design") is a key factor of success for the Mac. Remove one of the two pillars and the structure collapses. To remember, I still have on my LC-475's screen saver (not used any more) the picture of a snail carrying on its back a rival PC's Intel CISC processor. These old macs used Motorola RISC processors, deemed faster by the "experts". You may have called to the bar Michelin, whose tyres for trucks (trucking fleets are the tyre equivalent to the Mac's "expert" users) are in demand for their durability (mileage), while car drivers don't measure mileage but simply benefit from it without knowing. Car tyres benefit directly from R&D invested in truck tyres just as the Mac for me [ordinary Joe] directly benefits from the Mac used, misused and challenged by its professional users (the "experts"). I am not so sure, though, the above analogy works for the iPhone, iPad and iWatch lines (is it still true that the iPhone for the Presidents is called "Blackberry"?). Thanks for the brain teaser. Reply Nicholas Croft  2017-02-09 20:13 The PC 'enthusiast' market is the only one with growth. Sell the OS for $500 - restricted to 6 core+ (ie X99) motherboards, only from (a few) vetted vendors. No manufacturing costs. Pure profit once initial outlay of programming is covered.

The Mac maker is back to growth after an impressive quarter. Motley Fool Staff Feb 10, 2017 at 9:35AM Investors were fretting throughout 2016 about Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) business in China, which has stumbled amid intense competition from local smartphone vendors. In this segment from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analyst Dylan Lewis and contributor Evan Niu, CFA, discuss Apple's outlook in the Middle Kingdom. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Feb. 3, 2017. Dylan Lewis: Another area that I think we should spend a little bit of time focusing on here is some of the international results, specifically China. I know that four out of Apple's five geographic operating segments set fresh highs -- all but Greater China. But, China is really seen as a huge market opportunity in addition to India, for Apple. Do you want to put a little color out as to what they said in the call? Evan Niu: Yeah. Like you mentioned, more quarterly records in terms of all the other geographical segments, which, again, it's all these little things that are contributing to this overall overperformance. For example, Japan grew 20%. Japan is not a huge market for them, but just the fact that they can still put out meaningful growth numbers ... Europe was pretty much flat. But, Greater China, it has bounced back quite a bit sequentially. In the third quarter, sales were something like $8.7 [billion] to $9 billion. So, to really bounce back to $16 billion, it's shy of their all-time record, which was set a year or two ago, around $18 billion, but it is bouncing back on a sequential basis. I think there are still lingering concerns about the smartphone market in China, because it's getting really competitive with all these low-cost Chinese vendors really proliferating and flooding the market with these cheap choices. You can see in their numbers that they've had trouble in the past year as competition intensifies on the ground. But I still think that China is a very big, promising business. It's probably going to be a tough place to compete. But it's a great market. They're still growing, they still have to expand the retail footprint. There's still room to run. Lewis: Yeah. With lower-priced entrants coming into the market, Apple's brand cachet is only going to give it so much pricing power. But, you have to think there's still some room to run there.

Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) Feb 10, 2017 at 8:43AM We're just over a month into 2017, so let's look at how the Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) stock portfolio has done thus far. Berkshire itself is almost completely flat for the year, down 0.09% as of this writing, but some of the company's stock holdings have done quite well. Specifically, five of Berkshire's stocks have gained 10% or more over the first five weeks of the year. Company Stock Symbol Share Price (2/7/2017) YTD Performance Liberty Media (A Shares) LBTYA $35.54 +16.2% Moody's Corp. MCO $107.06 +13.6% Apple AAPL $131.53 +13.5% Charter Communications CHTR $323.37 +12.3% Visa V $85.78 +10%  Performance and share prices as of market close on 2/7/2017. Image Source: Getty Images. 1. Liberty Media (+16.2%) Liberty Media (NASDAQ:LBTYK) has been Berkshire's biggest winner thus far in 2017, thanks to impressive growth in its European markets. The company expects the growth to continue as it speeds up its U.K. build activity and makes major investments in its business there. In addition, the company has been aggressively repurchasing its shares, especially in the wake of the Brexit sell-off last year. 2. Moody's (+13.6%) Ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) has steadily climbed so far in 2017, partially because of its announcement that it had resolved pending civil claims with the Justice Department, 21 states, and D.C. Not only were the claims resolved faster than many experts expected, but the cost to the company will be significantly less than many expected. 3. Apple (+13.5%) In part, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) rally has been due to its strong results from the holiday shopping season. For the quarter, Apple's revenue of $78.4 billion was as high as it has ever been, and the company's earnings and revenue both handily exceeded expectations. Perhaps most importantly, Apple's service revenue (which includes sales from the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and others) grew by 18% year-over-year. While this accounts for just 9% of the company's results, it is rapidly becoming an important revenue stream to the company. Furthermore, Apple expects revenue to continue to climb in the current quarter, and CEO Tim Cook said that the company is "excited" about the products in its pipeline. 4. Charter Communications (+12.3%) In Charter Communications' (NASDAQ:CHTR) case, the reason for the strong stock performance wasn't necessarily due to strong growth or other great business metrics. Rather, the stock spiked in mid-January on rumors that Verizon (NYSE:VZ) was considering an acquisition of the company. Many think that the deal is unlikely to happen, for reasons my colleague Anders Bylund explained in a recent article, but the rumors have not faded just yet. 5. Visa (+10%) In its latest quarterly report, Visa (NYSE:V) reported impressive year-over-year earnings growth of 7%, and revenue growth of 25% thanks to the acquisition of Visa Europe. Service revenue, data processing revenue, and international transaction revenue all soared, and while operating expenses grew by 16%, the company still posted impressive growth. For fiscal year 2017, the company expects net revenue growth of 16%-18%, and EPS growth in the "mid-teens" on an adjusted basis. It's fair to say that Visa's fiscal 2017 -- the most recent quarter was the first of its fiscal year -- is going well so far. Are any of these good buys now? To be clear, I'm not saying that you should buy these, or any other stocks simply because Warren Buffett owns them. However, Berkshire invested in each of these companies for a reason, and we can learn valuable investing lessons from these purchases, as well as from how the stocks perform over time. Having said that, I would have to call Apple the best buy on this list right now, as it still trades for a compelling valuation even after the recent rally, and I tend to gravitate toward undisputed leaders in their markets.

They get you online and let you stream movies and music. You can even play a few games on your Chromebook. And now, with the Samsung Chromebook Plus, available Feb. 12, and Pro, available this April, Chromebooks let you run any of the millions of Android apps available through the Google Play Store right out of the box. To be sure, the Chromebook Plus and Pro aren’t the first Chromebooks to offer Android app compatibility; three older Chromebooks can already run Android apps via software updates. But these are the first Chromebooks purpose-built with Android apps in mind. The Plus and Pro aren’t perfect, though. There are still some kinks to work out when it comes to running Android apps on a 12-inch laptop. And they’ve got some stiff competition in the form of Apple’s iPad Pro. Still, for the first time, I’m genuinely considering buying a Chromebook. Plus and Pro: The same, but different Let’s get one thing out of the way before I dive into this review: the difference between the Plus and the Pro. In general, the systems are identical. They share the same design, though the Plus is silver and the Pro is black; the have the same 12.3-inch screen and they both included styluses. Styli? Stylusses? You know what? Let’s just say they both have pens. View photos The main difference between the Samsung Chromebook Plus and Pro is on the inside.More The main difference between these systems is their processors. The Chromebook Plus runs on an ARM processor and costs $449, while the Chromebook Pro gets a more powerful Intel chip and costs $549. How do you decide between the two? Easy. The Plus is meant for basic web browsing and gaming. Think people who check their email or use Google Drive often. The Pro, on the other hand, is for folks who tend to browse the web with 20 tabs open, while streaming music through Spotify and perusing Twitter and Facebook. Handsome hardware The Plus and Pro are thin and lightweight at just 0.55 inches thick and 2.4 pounds, respectively. I packed the Chromebook Plus into my backpack along with my regular MacBook Air 13-inch and hardly noticed the added weight. Unlike most Chromebooks, the Plus and Pro also double as tablets thanks to their 360-degree-hinged, 12.3-inch, 2,400 x 1,600 resolution displays. I watched some movies and browsed the web and found the Pro’s display to be crisp and colorful. Apple’s 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch iPad Pros are both thinner, lighter and have higher resolution screens than Samsung’s Chromebooks. But Apple’s offerings are also far more expensive. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro starts at $599, while the 12.9-inch model starts at $799. And that’s without the added cost of a keyboard and stylus. Styling stylus Speaking of styluses, the Chromebook Plus and Pro’s each have small ports built into their sides to store the pens when not in use. The iPad Pro does not. Writing with the stylus feels incredibly natural thanks to a bit of added resistance provided by its tip and Google’s machine learning magic. View photos The Chromebook Plus and Pro use Google’s machine learning software to cut down on lag when writing with the stylus.More See, Google has programmed the Plus and Pro to understand how most people write. As a result, the Chromebooks are able to predict how fast you’re jotting something down, and all but eliminate the kind of lag that makes writing with a stylus feel unnatural. The Plus and Pro’s displays are also pressure sensitive — so if you press hard while writing, you’ll see a wider, darker pen stroke. Read More Keyboard problems The Plus and Pro are well-built machines, but they do have some problems. Compared to the full-size keyboard on my MacBook Air, the Chromebooks’ keyboards feel cramped, leading me to strike the wrong keys on occasion. What’s more, the Chromebook Plus and Pro only feature USB C ports, so you’ll need to purchase a separate adapter if you want to connect legacy devices like printers. On the flip side, though, the Plus and Pro is a microSD card slot and headphone jack. As far as battery life goes, I spent the majority of my day typing away on the Chromebook Pro and didn’t need to plug it in until I got home at night. Android goes Chrome It’s great that the Plus and Pro are well-built, but the biggest reason you’d by these Chrome OS-powered machines is that they run Android apps. Core Google apps like Gmail, YouTube and Calendar all run in Chrome browser-style windows, while a handful of others like Maps and the Play Store run in their own independent, resizable Windows. But third-party apps need a bit more polish. View photos Samsung’s Chromebook Plus and Pro are the first Chromebooks purpose-built for using Android apps.More Twitter (TWTR), Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX) and Spotify all run as enlarged versions of their smartphone or tablet versions. Spotify in particular is difficult to navigate, due to the app’s confusing and stretched interface. Hulu also proved bothersome, as the Chrome OS toolbar cut off subtitles. I also noticed that I couldn’t watch videos in Netflix while browsing the web in Chrome, which was a major pain, especially when I was trying to stream “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” at the office while pretending to do work. Apple’s iPad Pro, on the other hand, lets you stream Netflix and Hulu while browsing the web via picture-in-picture mode. But again, you’re going to pay a lot more money for that privilege compared to Samsung’s Chromebooks. Should you buy it? Sure, you’re not going to get the kind of performance out of a Chromebook that you would out of a more powerful Windows PC or MacBook, but the Plus and Pro will prove to be more than enough for the majority of users. In other words, if you want a low-cost alternative to your PC, Mac or even iPad Pro, go for the Chromebook Plus or Pro.

Though Jimmy Iovine has no official title at Apple, going by just "Jimmy," he has negotiated many of the streaming deals for the service and has been a key team member since Apple purchased Beats Music in 2014. "Apple, of all the global tech companies, was the one that understood why artists make things," Iovine said, explaining why he had a close relationship with Apple even before the acquisition. Since its debut, Apple Music has grown to 20 million subscribers, with 10 million added in 2016 alone. Much of that can be attributed to Apple's evolving focus, first on exclusives and now on video. Apple is adding original content to Apple Music, in the form of two TV shows - a reality series based on Carpool Karaoke and drama that will star Dr. Dre. Iovine wouldn't go into detail about Apple's future plans for original content, but he explained that Apple's goal is to make Apple Music "a cultural point of reference." He says Apple's work on original content shouldn't be compared to other entertainment companies like Netflix. Iovine, asked if he sees Apple Music attempting to become competitive with the likes of Netflix in the original-content sphere, demurs. "I wouldn't put it that way," he says. "When I read that, or I read that we're taking on whomever, I say no. To me it's all one thing. It's Apple Music, and it happens to have video and audio. ... It has nothing to do with what Netflix is doing."On the topic of exclusive content, which has created conflict between Apple and both its competitors and record labels, Iovine says Apple is "just experimenting." He says his work with Apple hasn't caused problems with former colleagues in the music business, despite the bitterness over exclusive content. "I don't lean on [exclusives] too heavily myself," he says. "We did 'em. We'll do some more. But we're just experimenting. I just know that if something feels right and someone wants to, we're willing to do it, to help them really market their record, get the word out, and spend what it deserves."According to Iovine, the key to Apple's continued success in the music industry is an ability to "speak both languages," referring to the harmonizing of technology and music. He believes there's room in the streaming music industry for many companies, as long as "streaming is done right," with each service being culturally different with a unique feel. "Yeah, they all have the same catalog," he said." But what we're doing is we're just building on top of that. That's where the personality and the feel will come from." Iovine's full interview, which covers a range of additional topics like his childhood, early jobs, close relationship with Dr. Dre, the founding of Beats Music, Beats 1 Radio, and subscription streaming models, can be read over at Variety and is worth checking out for those who want an inside look at Apple Music.

Becoming a cultural point of reference doesn't happen via marketing. It's organic. The goal should be to make something great. Then consumers will take notice and THEN it will be come a cultural point of reference. Iovine is really the epitome of AppleThink in the Cook era.

Twerdahl, the general manager and director of Amazon's Fire TV business, to be the vice president in charge of Apple TV product marketing, reports Bloomberg. Twerdahl joined Apple earlier this month. Twerdahl has been in charge of Fire TV since 2013, overseeing two generations of the product and its rise as one of the more popular internet-connected set-top boxes. At Apple, Twerdahl will report to Greg Joswiak, VP of iOS and iPhone Product Marketing. The move will allow Pete Distad, the former head of Apple TV product marketing, to concentrate on helping Apple land content deals, which are headed by Eddy Cue. Before joining Apple in 2013, Distad was senior vice president of content distribution at Hulu. Having Distad join content negotiations is intended to shore up content for Apple TV, according to Bloomberg, as efforts to secure exclusive content deals for Apple TV have stalled in the past due to failed negotiations. With the fourth-generation Apple TV, Apple was originally aiming to provide a full a la carte television service that could replace traditional cable and satellite packages, similar to Sony's PlayStation Vue service. However, Apple unsurprisingly saw pushback from both content and cable companies after using negotiating tactics described as "assertive" and "hard-nosed," declining to back down from the terms the company wanted. Apple scaled back its TV ambitions in the past couple of years, though it considered both a slimmed-down subscription service and purchasing Time Warner. In addition to leading product marketing for the Fire TV, Twerdahl was also the senior director of internet TV at Netflix and a vice president of consumer devices at Roku, according to his LinkedIn.

The second macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta is available for download through the Apple Developer Center or the software update mechanism in the Mac App Store for those who have previously installed a beta. macOS Sierra 10.12.4 brings iOS's Night Shift mode to the Mac for the first time. First introduced with iOS 9.3, Night Shift is designed to gradually shift the display of a device from blue to yellow, cutting down on exposure to blue light. Blue light is said to disrupt the circadian rhythm and is believed to interrupt sleeping patterns. Night Shift can be activated through the Displays section of System Preferences, where a setting to have it come on at sunset and turn off at sunrise is available. Night Shift can also be toggled on manually through the Notification Center or via Siri. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. The 10.12.4 update focuses mainly on Night Shift, but also includes dictation support for Shanghainese, cricket scores for Siri, and improved PDFKit APIs. Today's beta adds an opt-in option for iCloud Analytics that pops up after installing the update.

Rating: 3 Votes SvP 2 days ago at 04:58 pm Oh. Nice. ~~So, it still can't be used as a boot partition?~~ Edit: I realised that I was confusing this with the next (to be released) macOS version. Ignore my question. I'm fairly certain they won't do that major a change in a minor version update. They've announced they'd do the conversion in 2017, and they announced they'd convert it in-place... i think they'll do it in MacOS11. I'm very impressed by what it's capable off and think the limitations (like not being able to boot) are made intentionally.

Rating: 2 Votes adrianlondon 4 days ago at 11:35 am This beta appears to have updated Safari to a version that has broken Cookies and Safari Stand (two SIMBL plugins). As I have three, and the third one relates to Finder and is still working, I assume SIMBL itself is fine. Edit: I took Safari.app back to the beta 1 version and my plugins now work again. Ah well, I can't keep running the old version forever so either later versions will "fix" the issue, the plugin developers will fix it or I'll lose them. Pity. I like having my cookies for non-favourite websites deleted on exit. Rating: 1 Votes TSM 4 days ago at 10:41 am Any advantage over current f.lux?

(Photo : Austin Evans/YouTube) Following the announcement of the release date after months of delay, it's now been revealed that the BeatsX wireless headphones will come with an added bonus. Another good news is that all other products of Beats by Dre's that are also wireless are also included in the bonus. Most of the Apple-owned brand's wireless headphones, as well as speakers, will include a gift card or a voucher that is good for three months free subscription of Apple Music Buy BeatsX Wireless Headphones To Get Months Of Free Apple Music After few months of delays, BeatsX, Apple’s newest pair of wireless earbuds that cost $150 will finally hit store shelves tomorrow. As the company announces its launch, it also turns out that there’s a slight silver lining. According to The Verge, all buyers of the BeatsX will find a card inside the box with a code that’s good for three free months of Apple Music which costs $30. Apple will also include this promo card in other Beats products such as the Powerbeats 3 Wireless, Solo 3 Wireless, Studio Wireless and Beats Pill+ but for a limited time only. All the customers who bought BeatsX and other products that are included in the promo will have to register their headphones on the Beats By Dr. Dre official website. Once that is done, they can just plug in the code to easily get an Apple Music gift card that can be used for a straight three-month subscription for free. This offer also applies to existing 20 million Apple Music subscribers, too. Know More About BeatsX Wireless Headphones The BeatsX wireless earbuds aren’t truly that wireless like the most anticipated Apple’s AirPods. Instead, they are connected by a wire that you have to wrap around the back of your neck. But come to think of it, they are considered as wireless gadgets in the sense that they are not literally connected to your phone but just over Bluetooth. The BeatsX earbuds use the same W1 chip that Apple uses in AirPods and all other Beats headphones, which allows a quick and easy device pairing. It also gives users a much more stable connection when using them with an iPhone. The new BeatsX wireless headphone are compatible with all Android smartphones, but the user should charge it with a Lightning cable. On the hand, Apple promises up to 8 hours of battery life while using BeatsX that is connected to the iPhone. It also assures the ability to get up to two hours of battery with just five minutes of charging. Note that the BeatsX aren’t sweatproof, but its earbuds are magnetically clicked together and the cord is supposedly tangle-free, making them less of a trouble to stow away while they’re not in use. As reported by TechRadar, the BeatsX wireless headphones will hit store shelves on February 10 for the price of $150, £130, or AU$200, depending on your location. All interested buyers can learn more about this promo as well as the availability of the gadget through Apple's website or directly through Beats by Dre page. Many reviews are telling that the BeatsX is “budget-friendly alternative” of wireless headphones compared to other.   TAG Apple, apple iphone, apple news, BeatsX, Beats, Beats Electronics, Apple Music Related Articles Verizon Promises Same-Day Fix For Your Cracked Apple iPhone Screen Verizon will fix your cracked iPhone screen in just one day.

His last work - Apple Inc´s sprawling new headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. - will be a fitting tribute: a futuristic campus built with astonishing attention to detail. From the arrangement of electrical wiring to the finish of a hidden pipe, no aspect of the 2.8 million-square-foot main building has been too small to attract scrutiny. But constructing a building as flawless as a hand-held device is no easy feat, according interviews with nearly two dozen current and former workers on the project, most of whom would not be named because they signed non-disclosure agreements. Since Apple unveiled its plans in 2011, the move-in date has slowly receded: Jobs´ initial projection was 2015, but this spring now seems most likely, according to people involved in the project. A lengthy approval process with the city contributed to the delay. Apple has not revealed the total price tag, but former project managers estimate it at about $5 billion - a figure CEO Tim Cook did not dispute in a 2015 TV interview. More than $1 billion was allocated for the interior of the main building alone, according to a former construction manager. For all the time and money sunk into the project, some in the architecture community question whether Apple has focused on the right ends. The campus is something of an exception to the trend of radically open offices aimed at fostering collaboration, said Louise Mozingo, a professor and chair of the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning at U.C. Berkeley. Its central office building - a massive ring of glass frequently likened to a spaceship - could be a challenge just to navigate, she noted. "It´s not about maximizing the productivity of the office space, it´s about creating a symbolic center for this global company," she said.     0 0 Apple seeks design perfection at new spaceship campus was posted in Business of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on February 08, 2017 and was last updated on February 08, 2017.

Relax — Tim Cook says we'll be "just fine". The Apple CEO was in the UK to pick up an honorary doctorate from the University of Glasgow, and swung by Good Morning Britain for an interview. Asked about Brexit, he said: "We are very optimistic about the UK's future. We are all in." He added: "We're a big believer in the UK. The UK will be just fine. Yes, there will be bumps in the road along the way, but the UK's going to be fine." See related  Tim Cook took a blurry Super Bowl photo and people can't handle it Tim Cook reveals why he met Donald Trump Apple CEO Tim Cook just admitted it IS working on AR technology Cook didn't explain why he believed Brexit wouldn't have a negative impact, but did suggest Apple saw room for growth in the UK. The iPhone maker is building a new London office at the Battersea Power Station development, at a cost of £8 billion. "We're doubling down on a huge headquarters in the Battersea area and we're leaving significant space there to expand," he said of the project. Cook also offered a similar message to prime minister Theresa May, reportedly saying in a meeting with her that he was "optimistic" about the UK's future. Apple has bumped up prices of its MacBook Pro and App Store downloads following currency fluctuations after Brexit, as reports suggest leaving the EU is already hurting tech salaries and will hit the tech sector the hardest, with 2016 spending sliding. Shaking voice Cook also discussed American politics, in particular the recent travel ban that saw people from seven countries temporarily stopped from entering the country, catching out many Silicon Valley staff. In a talk given after being awarded the degree in Glasgow, he told students that Apple would "speak out even when our voice shakes" against such policies. He also revealed his personal work ethic and values. "My philosophy is don't work for money, it will wear out fast," he said. "Or you'll never make enough and you'll never be happy." Easy to say, perhaps, when your company's cash reserves hit a record $246 billion last month.

Mobile Accessories by Sharon Profis February 10, 2017 4:00 AM PST @sharonprofis 3 ways Apple can make the AirPods better Apple's first wireless earbuds are interesting, but there's a lot more they can do to make the AirPods really special. by Brian Tong 4:39 Close Drag Apple's AirPods aren't just special because they are one of the few "truly wireless" earbud headphones available -- models with separate left and right earpieces that aren't tethered together with a cable. Along with three Beats headphones (the PowerBeats3 Wireless, the Solo3 Wireless and the BeatsX) they're one of only a handful of products that incorporate Apple's new W1 chip, a teeny-tiny piece of hardware that will make your forget how awful pairing over Bluetooth can be. What's special about the W1? Like the A-series chips that power iPhones and iPads, the W1 is custom Apple-designed silicon. In addition to standard Bluetooth 4.1 streaming and advanced power management, the chip adds a host of key features unique to the AirPods, including balancing all of that sophisticated syncing (between the two earpieces, the case and the audio source) with the sensor inputs (automatically pausing music if you remove one from your ear). On one hand, headphones with the W1 chip are no different than any other wireless models: you can pair them with any Bluetooth-enabled device. But if you've ever gone through that process, it's a bit of a pain: Press a button on the headphones to enter pairing mode, pull up the settings menu on the phone or tablet and -- if everything works as planned -- choose the headphone from the menu to complete the connection. By comparison, the big advantage of W1-enabled headphones is that "they just work" -- when you're using them with a compatible Apple device, at least. When you pull AirPods out of their case, they'll pair with your iPhone within seconds -- around 3 seconds, actually. Kind of like the way you just plug in wired headphones. After the first time you pair W1 headphones with your iPhone, it will also be added as a Bluetooth headphone on any other device tied to your Apple ID. From there, selecting it as the sound output is easy -- no further pairing required. Jason Cipriani/CNET The W1 chip also helps improve battery life. The W1-equipped PowerBeats3 Wireless and Solo3 Wireless, for example, last longer compared to their respective predecessors, which are otherwise basically identical. So the W1 is basically the secret sauce that wrings more juice from same-size batteries. Do I have to have an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus? Nope. Because the W1 chip is Bluetooth compatible, any Bluetooth-enabled devices can still be paired with W1 headphones like the AirPods. That includes pretty much any iPhone, Android phone, tablet, Mac and many PCs. When pairing with an Android phone, for example, it works the same way as pairing any other Bluetooth headset. Even though you don't get the pairing benefits available for iPhone owners, you do seem to get the same battery life gains. That convenient auto-pairing, meanwhile, only works with these Apple devices: iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch running iOS 10.2 or later Apple Watch on WatchOS 3 or later Mac with MacOS Sierra or later Which headphones have the W1 chip? There are four W1 headphones available right now. Click through for full reviews of each one: Apple AirPods Beats Solo3 Wireless Beats PowerBeats3 Wireless BeatsX The good news is that they start at $150, £130, AU$200, which isn't a huge premium compared to similar models from other big-name manufacturers. Will we see other brands use the W1 chip? You probably noticed that the only W1 headphones available are made by Apple or its Beats subsidiary. Apple hasn't expressed intentions to license the W1 chip, so don't expect W1 headphones from Bose or the like anytime soon. However, it should be noted that many Android phones offer a "tap to pair" feature (with accessories that are equipped with NFC chips) that delivers a similar easy-pairing experience. The problem (in our experience) is that it doesn't generally work as smoothly or reliably as the W1 headphones do with iPhones. Is the headphone jack ever coming back? Are you trolling me?

Ming-Chi Kuo has said the upcoming iPhone will come in three different forms, but every one of them will let users charge their phone without having to plug it in. ConceptsiPhone 5 Rumours are rife on the web that the iPhone 8 (artist’s impression) could dispense with the charging cord In a briefing note obtained by Mac Rumours, he said the phones would use a sheet of graphite to stop them overheating while charging wirelessly. He wrote: “While we don’t expect general users to notice any difference, lamination of an additional graphite sheet is needed for better thermal control and, thus, steady operation.” It has also been rumoured that the smartphone will feature an edge to edge display in the top of the range model alongside two standard versions. Foxconn Technology in Taiwan is making wireless modules to go with their next model according to Nikkei.com. An industry source told the Asian publication: “Whether the feature can eventually make it into Apple’s updated devices will depend on whether Foxconn can boost the yield rate to a satisfactory level later on.” It is currently not obvious whether the California firm would offer a wireless charging plate, similar to Samsung’s offering or something different. But one of the patents filed by Apple in the US shows images of a charger similar to that used by the Apple Watch. The patent itself is mainly focused on a metal brushing technique but also refers to and “inductive charging station”. USPO 5 This patent appears to show a wireless charging plate, which will charge the phone up when it’s placed on top According to Mac Rumours: “In describing how the tools would work, the application includes multiple illustrations of a charging station used to provide electrical current to another device via inductive power transmission. “An inductive transmitter coil wraps around a metal core and is designed to pair with a receiver coil and charge the battery in the electronic device.” Other rumours indicate that the home button could be for the high jump and replacing it with a phone capable of scanning a fingerprint anywhere on the screen. It was also revealed last year that Apple had a patent for a foldable version of the iconic handset. USPO 5 This image is a sketch from Apple’s patent for a folding phone Sketches in the patent application show a iPhone with a fold down the middle of the screen, with carbon nanotubes giving strength to the structure. In the patent application, Apple says the housing for the phone could be aluminium, glass, ceramic or even plastic for the bendable screen. related stories iMAD Apple-obsessed Ukrainian man changes his name to 'iPhone 7' in desperate bid to win a new handset PHONE SWAP Woman persuades her 20 boyfriends to each buy her an iPhone 7 – then cashes them in and buys a HOUSE SADDAM INSANE!

But chief design officer Jony Ive gave an insight into the time involved in going from an idea to implementation last week in an interview about the new MacBook Pro Touch Bar, saying the design of the Touch Bar came after two years of trying a range of designs. Apple is expected to majorly revamp the iPhone design next year although if it does develop a fordable iPhone that is likely to be something several years down the track.

By MarketWatch Fear not, United Kingdom. The head of the biggest technology company in the world has your back. ‘We’re a big believer in the U.K. The U.K. will be just fine.’ Tim Cook, Apple Apple’s AAPL, -0.23% CEO, Tim Cook, recently recounted what he told U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May when he met with her Thursday during a visit to London. In an interview with ITV’s ITV, -0.29% “Good Morning Britain” program that aired Friday, Cook said he told May that Apple has no worries about the country’s post-Brexit life after last summer’s referendum came down in favor of leaving the European Union. “We are very optimistic about the U.K.’s future, and we are all in,” said Cook. “We’re doubling down on a huge headquarters in the Battersea area [of London] … and we’re leaving significant space there to expand. We’re a big believer in the U.K.” The company announced it was moving its London headquarters to the landmark Battersea Power Station last September. Cook, who is on a “whistlestop” tour of Europe, made the comments while checking out technology being used by student at Woodbury Down Community Primary in North London on Thursday.

Twerdahl, the former director of the Amazon Fire TV unit, who has also worked at Roku and Netflix, it appears that Apple wants to boost sales of Apple TV by making its offering of content more attractive. The latest version of the Apple TV came on the market in late 2015. At the time, the small form network appliance was distinguished by two innovations: a new touch remote with Siri integration allowing it to respond to voice commands and App Store access enabling users to take advantage of a range of games and applications on their televisions. Since then it has been enhanced by the introduction of an Apple Watch application, and iOS app, which, for the moment is only available in the US. However, content has remained a weak point. With regard to video, Apple TV enables users to take advantage of video content providers as well as more traditional iTunes purchases. But in the absence of exclusive agreements or internally produced content, Apple TV has struggled to distinguish its video offering from the generic fare available on internet boxes. Other players, notably Amazon, have had more success in this regard. Like the Apple TV, the Amazon Fire TV is a small network appliance which when connected to a television enables users to take advantage of a wide range of multimedia content. In the United States, its latest version is compatible with 4K format and provides access to 7,000 applications and games as well as more than 300,000 TV series episodes and films via applications like Netflix, HBO GO, Hulu and of course Amazon Video.

All VerticalsCentral Government Back to Home “We’re a big believer in the UK” – Tim Cook gives Brexit vote of confidence Increase / Decrease text size Ellie Burns 10th February 2017 0 0Shares 0 0 0 0 Add to favorites Meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May, the Apple CEO referenced his commitment to a new HQ in Battersea. Tim Cook has expressed his confidence for the UK’s future following Brexit, meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May on his visit to the UK. At his meeting with the Prime Minister, the Apple CEO referenced his company’s commitment to redevelop Battersea Power Station as its new UK HQ – creating at least 1,600 jobs. “We’re doubling down on a huge headquarters in the Battersea area and we’re leaving significant space there to expand,” Mr Cook said. “We’re a big believer in the UK – we think you’ll be just fine. Yes, there will be bumps in the road along the way but the UK’s going to be fine.” The Apple Chief’s visit follows a recent move by the tech giant to hike App Store prices, with the 25% rise in UK prices attributed to currency exchange rates post-Brexit vote. READ NOW: Apple cashes in on Brexit with App Store price hike In a statement, Apple said: “Tim had a positive meeting with the Prime Minister today, discussing Apple’s continued investment in the United Kingdom. “We are proud that Apple’s innovation and growth now supports nearly 300,000 jobs across the UK.” Following his vist witht the PM, Cook vistited a North London school, where he said that the increasing presence of tech in the classroom is a “compliment to tradition teaching and not a substitute”. The school, which is an Apple Distinguished School because of its commitment to innovation through learning, was praised by Cook, who said: “Technology has moved on considerably. It gets kids a lot more engaged because they’re living in a digital world. We’re all living in a digital world. This school has done an unbelievable job of integrating it.” Cook also spoke of the importance of coding, ever-important due to the UK’s increasing skills gap, saying that “it’s as important as any kind of second language.” Part of the CEO’s visit to the UK also saw Cook travel to Scotland to receive an honorary degree. Speaking at the University of Glasgow, Cook, who is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, told students: “Don’t work for money.” Warning that being driven by money will ultimately never equal happiness, he said: “You have to find the intersection of doing something you’re passionate about and at the same time something that is in the service of other people.” “If you don’t find that intersection, you’re not going to be very happy in life.”         Tags Apple Brexit Homepage News List Tim Cook Previous ArticleRackspace announces US layoffs just three months after $4.3bn buyout Next ArticleSAP puts a fresh face on S/4 HANA Cloud with analytics & AI Most read UK cloud wars intensify as Microsoft lowers prices & releases Azure data centre services Hannah Williams 7th February 2017 Driverless cars: A new way of life and a new cybersecurity challenge Ellie Burns 2nd February 2017 Liverpool launches digital currency based on Blockchain technology Tom Ball 2nd February 2017 Can machine learning help secure smart homes?

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « You Know the VR Market is Lost when Facebook's CEO gets Excited over wearing VR Gloves to type on a Virtual Keyboard | Main | Fake News is unlikely Hurting Apple, so why is the CEO of Apple making it an Issue Today? » February 10, 2017 Sportbrain Sues Apple Claiming that the Apple Watch Collects Sports Related Data in a Manner that Infringes their Patent   A new patent infringement lawsuit was filed against Apple earlier this week by Sportbrain Holdings LLC. The company sells the 'First Step" Personal Fitness Assistant on Amazon. The company has already sued Fitbit and Nike and so it was inevitable that Apple would be on their list of targets. In particular, the company claims that the Apple Watch and iPhone collect personal/sports related data in a manner that infringes their 2001 granted patent titled "Integrating personal data capturing functionality into a portable computing device and a wireless communication device."   Sportbrain's Formal Complaint In-Part   In their formal complaint before the Court Sportbrain states that "Defendant has infringed and continue to infringe Patent 7,454,002 (the '002 Patent), either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents. Upon information and belief, Defendant has infringed and continues to infringe one or more claims of the '002 Patent by making, using, selling, providing, advertising and/or importing, directly or through intermediaries, in this district and elsewhere in the United States, devices for integrating a personal data capturing functionality into a wireless communication device and for analyzing and supplying feedback information to a user through the combined use of the personal parameter receiver, a wireless communication device, a network server, and website in this district and elsewhere in the United States through its website. Each of the Accused Products and Services infringes at least claim 1 of the '002 Patent.   In particular, using at least an accelerometer and/or motion sensor, the Apple Watch and iPhone each separately and/or in conjunction with each other act as the personal parameter receiver by collecting data about the activity of the user including at least recording the number of steps taken by the user when the product is active. For example, the Apple Watch, watchOS3 and Apple companion apps (collectively the "Apple product") connect to wireless communication devices, including smartphones, for capturing personal data via a bluetooth connection."   (Sportbrain patent FIG. 2 noted above is a block diagram of one embodiment for a personal data capture device)   The complaint further notes that "The Apple product periodically transmits personal data, including at least step data, from at least a smartphone to a network server over a wireless network. A network server then analyzes the personal data of the user and generates feedback information; this feedback information is posted to a website in at least a graphical and chart form for the user, and includes at least daily and weekly progress and other health and fitness metrics, including at least step count data. The aforementioned website and Apple companion apps also allow a user to compare that user's personal data, at least in relation to the user's friends, and posts that comparison of the personal data.   Defendant has also partnered with third parties to provide additional companion apps, services, and/or fitness tracker devices; to the extent that these third party companion apps, services, and/or fitness tracker devices (in combination with the Apple Watch) carry out the remaining steps of the method in at least claim 1, these acts are attributable to Defendant under a theory of divided infringement, and Defendant directly infringes on the patent-in-suit.   Defendant also has and continues to indirectly infringe one or more claims of the asserted patent by inducing others to infringe, including merchants and end-users through their use of the Accused Products and Services. Specifically, Defendant has actively induced, and continues to induce, the infringement of one or more claims of the ʼ002 Patent at least by actively inducing its customers, including merchants and end-users to use Defendant's devices for integrating a personal data capturing functionality into a wireless communication device and for analyzing and supplying feedback information to a user through the combined use of the personal parameter receiver, a wireless communication device, a network server, and website in this district and elsewhere in the United States through its website. Upon information and belief, Defendant has specifically intended that its customers use the Accused Products and Services that infringe the '002 Patent by, at a minimum, providing access to, support for, training and instructions for, the Accused Products and Services to its customers to enable said customers to use said apparatus, products and services in such a way that infringes the '002 Patent. Even where performance of the steps required for infringement of one or more claims of the '002 Patent is accomplished by Defendant and Defendant's customer jointly, Defendant's actions have solely caused all of the steps to be performed.   Defendant also contributed to the infringement of the patent-in-suit, with knowledge of infringement, violating 35 USC § 271(c) by its design, use, manufacture, importation, distribution, sale and offer for sale of the Accused Products and Service.   Defendant knew that its conduct of advertising and instructing would induce others to use its products and services in a manner infringing the ʼ002 Patent.   Without permission or compensation to Sportbrain, Defendant decided to take Sportbrain's inventions and utilize its patented technology in its Accused Products and Services. On this basis, this infringement has been willful, deliberate, and in reckless disregard of Sportbrain's patent rights.   Sportbrain has complied with the provisions of 35 U.S.C. § 287 to the extent they are applicable. 20. Defendant's infringement has injured Sportbrain and it is entitled to recover damages adequate to compensate it for such infringement, but in no event less than a reasonable royalty, together with interest and costs."   The patent infringement case presented in today's report was filed in the Illinois Northern District Court, Chicago Office. The Presiding Judge in this case is noted as being Judge Samuel Der-Yeghiayan.   Notice: Patently Apple presents only a brief summary of certain legal cases/ lawsuits which are part of the public record for journalistic news purposes.

Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies TV Politics Business Super Bowl Ads     Apple BeatsX Earphones Are On Sale Now Online Posted: Feb 10 2017, 5:10am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Apple     The online Apple Store started to offer the new BeatsX wireless headphones. As announced earlier this wee, the Apple Store has started to sell the new BeatsX wireless headphones. The BeatsX come in four different colors and sell for $149.95 on the online Apple Store. Don't Miss: NES Classic Alternatives are Cheaper I was considering to buy the BeatsX today, but then found out that these new wireless Beats earphones are not sweat-proof. I need headphones mostly while I workout and go for a run. This is why I have ordered the PowerBeats3 wireless earphones. The technology inside the Powerbeats3 is the same as in the BeatsX. The PowerBeats3 are though $50 more expensive than the BeatsX.  Amazon has you though covered and the Beats Powerbeats3 are on sale for $149.99 (only black) right now. The shipment of the BeatsX is 7 to 10 business days. We do not know yet, if the BeatsX is in stock at Apple retail locations to pick up the BeatsX today and not have to wait up to two weeks for the delivery. BeatsX earphones deliver up to eight hours of battery life and with "Fast Fuel", a five-minute charge gives you two hours of playback. The earbuds come with unique flex-form cable that provides all-day comfort and easy pocket portability, while eartip options provide a personalized fit and secure-fit wingtips offer added stability. BeatsX features optimized noise isolation, RemoteTalk allows you to take calls with a built-in mic, play music, adjust volume and activate Siri and also comes with variety of ear-tip options to offer personalized comfort.  Comments The Author Luigi Lugmayr Luigi Lugmayr (Google+) is the founding chief Editor of I4U News and brings over 15 years experience in the technology field to the ever evolving and exciting world of gadgets.

Twerdahl, the former director of the Amazon Fire TV unit, who has also worked at Roku and Netflix, it appears that Apple wants to boost sales of Apple TV by making its offering of content more attractive. The latest version of the Apple TV came on the market in late 2015. At the time, the small form network appliance was distinguished by two innovations: a new touch remote with Siri integration allowing it to respond to voice commands and App Store access enabling users to take advantage of a range of games and applications on their televisions. Since then it has been enhanced by the introduction of an Apple Watch application, and iOS app, which, for the moment is only available in the US. However, content has remained a weak point. With regard to video, Apple TV enables users to take advantage of video content providers as well as more traditional iTunes purchases. But in the absence of exclusive agreements or internally produced content, Apple TV has struggled to distinguish its video offering from the generic fare available on internet boxes. Other players, notably Amazon, have had more success in this regard. Like the Apple TV, the Amazon Fire TV is a small network appliance which when connected to a television enables users to take advantage of a wide range of multimedia content. In the United States, its latest version is compatible with 4K format and provides access to 7,000 applications and games as well as more than 300,000 TV series episodes and films via applications like Netflix, HBO GO, Hulu and of course Amazon Video. Within the framework of its video offering, Amazon has the added attraction of numerous exclusives like the automobile show "The Grand Tour" and the "Ronja" series produced by the renowned Japanese animation studio Ghibli.

Apple Stored Years of Deleted Browser History From iPhones GO Browser history from iPhones and Mac devices was stored Feb 10, 2017 13:11 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Apple has reportedly stored Safari histories in the iCloud going back more than a year. Forbes quoted CEO of Russian hacking tool creator Elcomsoft, Vladimir Katalov who said that Apple stored Safari deleted browser history for at least a year. Apparently, Apple stored the data even after users confirmed that the browser history should be wiped from devices and servers. It seems that Apple kept a separate iCloud record titled “tombstone”, which contained deleted web visits for synching across devices. Katalov came across the issue while looking through the Safari history on his own iPhone. He then used his company’s Phone Breaker software program to extract data from his iCloud account and found that deleted records from over a year ago were still kept. Apple calls the records “cleared”, not “deleted”. Apple has started to remove ‘deleted’ records "We have found that they stay in the cloud, probably forever," Katalov claimed. It seems that Apple stored including Google searches with the full terms of searches content. Mobile browsing records were also visible, although the whole issue appears to be rather a design problem connected to the syncing technology between iOS, Mac OS x and Apple’s servers. Clearing the browsing history on an iPhone, would also delete the records on a Mac or iPad, linked to the same iCloud account, even if the devices were turned off when the request was made. Still, Elcomsoft found that some records were stored in unhashed form and dated back until November 2015. Apple responded to Forbes report and rolled out a server-side fix to stop the retrievals, deleting all records older than two weeks.

Given the momentous occasion, rumour has it that Apple has been holding back some of its most groundbreaking features for this year's model - which many expect to be called the iPhone 8 . We've rounded up all the latest rumours and leaks, so if you're unimpressed by the iPhone 7's features, you'll know what the next version has in store. Read More iPhone 7 review: More evolution than revolution Latest news Apple products are not exactly known for being cheap. When the company launched its 'budget' iPhone 5c in 2013, it still cost an eye-watering £469. But the latest reports suggest that Apple's next device will be its most expensive yet, exceeding the $1,000 (£795) mark for the first time. The price was reportedly leaked to The Fast Company by "a source with knowledge of Apple's plans". The source said that Apple will be launching three devices this year - a massive 5.8-inch model (likely called the iPhone 8), a 5.5-inch model (called iPhone 7s Plus), and a 4.7-inch model (called iPhone 7s). The iPhone 8 will reportedly have a new OLED display that will stretch across the whole front of the phone. This is part of the reason for the high price tag, according to the source, as the OLED display will cost Apple roughly twice as much as the LCD display used in current iPhones. The new phone is also likely to get a memory upgrade from the current iPhone 7 line, which will add to the cost of manufacturing the device. Release date Apple traditionally releases its latest iPhone in the first two weeks of September, in good time for the start of the Christmas shopping season. However, a new report hints that Apple may break with tradition this year and launch its next flagship smartphone earlier than expected. According to information gathered by boutique research firm BlueFin Research Partners and shared by Barron's Tech Trader Daily , there is "some indication" that Apple will start production of the iPhone 8 in June. The iPhone 8 could be Apple's most exciting launch in years (Photo: Getty) If Apple is feeling particularly nostalgic, it may opt for June 29 - the same day the first iPhone was released. However, others claims that Apple will announce its new phones in the autumn, as usual, and begin selling them soon afterwards, and even BlueFin notes that it's not clear whether kicking off production early will translate to an earlier release date. That means we're more likely to see Apple to unveil its new handset on either the week of September 4 or September 11. Read More Forget the iPhone 7 launch - experts say wait for the iPhone 8 Price It's unlikely that Apple's iPhone 8 will be any easier on the wallet than previous models, but it may not be much more expensive. In past years, Apple has launched its new handset at roughly the same price point as the previous model, and simultaneously knocked around £100 off the cost of the previous model. Apple's 32GB iPhone 7 costs £599, while the iPhone 7 Plus starts at £719. That should give you a fairly good idea of what the iPhone 8 will cost - although if it does get a major design ovehaul, we wouldn't be surprised if Apple increased the price a bit. Name Based on Apple's well-established "tick-tock" cycle, the 2017 model would be called the iPhone 7s. These photos taken in China and obtained by the blog site Apple Insider allegedly show an iPhone with a very different design. (Photo: AppleInsider) The tick-tock cycle refers to Apple releasing a new design every two years, and new features within the same casing on alternate years (which are usually known as "s" models). However, rumour has it that Apple is moving to a three-year cycle on major iPhone refreshes. This, combined with the fact that next year is the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, suggests that Apple's 2017 model will be a fairly major upgrade.

It's more likely that it will be called the iPhone 8. Apple may even decide to go for something completely different - the iPhone 10 perhaps, to mark the anniversary, or even the iPhone Air or iPhone Pro, to reflect the iPad lineup. All-glass design Apple is allegedly planning a major design overhaul for the iPhone 8. The company is said to be working on an all-glass version of its iconic iPhone , for release in 2017. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a track record of leaking accurate information on Apple products, published a report in May claiming the American tech firm will completely redesign the iPhone in 2017. Instead of the aluminium casing used in the iPhone 7 , Apple will move to an all-glass enclosure. iPhone concept image via Twitter / @GlobalFlare (Photo: Twitter / @GlobalFlare) This wouldn't be the first time Apple has used glass in its iPhones. The iPhone 4 and 4s had glass front and back panels, with a stainless steel band sandwiched between the two. However, these phones were plagued by durability issues, with many customers claiming their phones cracked too easily when dropped . Kuo noted that some investors are concerned that glass casing would be too heavy or fail a drop test, but said he believes that a return to glass casing will not be problematic for Apple. The phone screen break is the fear of all avid smartphone users (Photo: Getty) "Apple already uses glass casing for iPhone 4/ 4S, and non-Apple brands have also been using glass casings. We therefore think a drop test will not be problematic for glass casing," he wrote in his report, according to MacRumours . "A glass casing may be slightly heavier than an aluminum one of the same thickness, but the difference is so small that the use of the thinner and lighter AMOLED panel will compensate for that." Read More This ultra-strong glass could spell the end for smashed smartphone screens The rumour has been backed up by a couple of other leaks. A source reportedly told Japanese website Nikkei that "Foxconn has been trying glass chassis' since last year." The arguments to be made for a glass smartphone include better antenna reception and more options for wireless charging. Curved OLED display At least one of the iPhone 8 prototypes is said to feature a new cutting-edge curved OLED display with practically no bezels - similar to that used on Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge. Although there is no functional reason to have a curved screen, Samsung has been seeing significantly higher sales of the curved versions of its Galaxy smartphones. Concept image of an iPhone with curved OLED display (Photo: Martin Hajek) In March 2016, Nikkei reported that Apple was planning to ditch LCD displays in favour of OLED screens, with the first OLED iPhone arriving in 2017. Then in April, The Korea Herald reported that Samsung had managed to bag the $2.59 billion manufacturing contract. The company is reportedly contracted to supply 100 million 5.5-inch OLED panels per year, starting from 2017. OLED displays are superior to the LCD panels currently used in Apple’s iPhones because, rather than requiring a backlight, an OLED-based screen lights up individual pixels when necessary. Read More Apple is testing more than 10 versions of the iPhone 8 - and at least one has a CURVED screen This translates to blacker blacks and brighter whites, lower power consumption and faster response times compared to LED displays. The iPhone 8 's display could also have a 4K resolution - which would make it more suitable for virtual reality applications. End of the Home button Rumours have been swirling for some time that Apple is planning to get rid of the traditional physical Home button and replace it with a touch-sensitive digital button. This was originally rumoured for the iPhone 7, but it's now looking more likely that it will be one of the major changes coming with the iPhone 8. Weidlich has turned the entire front of the futuristic smartphone into a screen (Photo: Marek Weidlich) A Chinese website called Storm reports that the virtual home button will have the same haptic feedback motors used in the iPhone 7 to create the illusion of a Home button, even if it's really just a flat capacitive surface. Designers around the world have been speculating about what Apple has planned, and one artist, Marek Weidlich , has created an intriguing concept video (see above). Weidlich has turned the entire front of the futuristic smartphone into a screen - leaving no home button or any visible bezel. Read More Latest iPad clues suggest iPhone 8 redesign - and another massive feature may be dropped Another concept by industrial designer Herman Haidin envisions an iPhone made from a material known as "liquidmetal", which is tougher and more water-resistant than typical aluminium. In the concept, Haidin envisions the new iPhone as a mere 3mm thick with a body formed of glass and liquidmetal. Amazing 'liquidmetal' iPhone 7 concept shows what Apple's next-generation smartphone could look like (Photo: Herman Haidin) In order to get to this level of thinness, the concept ditches bulky ports such as the Lightning charging port and the 3.5mm headphone jack, as well as the physical Home button. Wireless charging Wireless charging has become a common feature of some Android smartphones - including Samsung's latest family of devices - although it is still a lot slower than wired charging methods. Some of Samsung's devices can already be charged wirelessly (Photo: Samsung) A report in Bloomberg in January claimed that Apple was working on "cutting edge" wireless technology that would allow future iPhones and iPads to be placed further away from charging mats than current smartphones. The unnamed sources said Apple was working on overcoming "technical barriers including loss of power over distance," and that the technology will feature in iPhones coming out in 2017. Iris scanner One of the stand-out features of Samsung 's latest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy Note 7 , is eye-scanning technology, allowing users to unlock their phone by simply looking at it. Eye scanning on the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (Photo: PA) Now a report from Chinese-language website MoneyDJ.com , picked up by Digitimes , indicates that Apple may be planning to introduce similar technology with the iPhone 8. According to the report, a Taiwan-based company called Xintec is to start mass producing iris-recognition chips, some of which will be embedded in the 2017 series of iPhone. Three sizes Apple is rumoured to be working on three versions of its next iPhone, including a 5-inch model to sit between its existing 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch handsets. Japanese blog Mac Otakara reports that all three models will boast identical specifications , citing sources within Apple's Taiwanese supply chain. The 5-inch version is also rumoured to feature a dual-lens camera, with iSight modules arranged vertically instead of horizontally. The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone SE (Photo: Apple) Read More Apple's iPhone 8 will have a glass back and come in THREE different sizes While Apple has long been rumoured to be working on three models of its next iPhone , earlier reports have claimed that they will not all have the same specifications. Meanwhile, a recent report in the Wall Street Journal claimed that Apple is currently testing more than 10 different prototypes for its next smartphone. Specs iPhone concept (Photo: Yasser Farahi) The iPhone 8 will, more than likely, feature an A11 chip, built on ARM's highly-efficient 10nm manufacturing process, and run the next version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 11. It will most likely come in 32BB, 128GB and 256GB storage options. Camera If you were hoping that the next version of Apple's 4.7-inch iPhone was going to feature a dual-lens camera, you may be disappointed. According to the latest investor note from well-informed KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple's dual-camera system will remain exclusive to the larger "Plus" model next year. Dual-lens camera on the iPhone 7 Plus "While an attractive addition for avid picture takers and professional photographers, the iPhone 7 Plus dual-camera is not a mass-market killer application yet," Kuo says in the note seen by Apple Insider and 9to5Mac . "Along with its high cost (estimated at over US$30-40) and the necessity for Apple to enhance the added value of high-end iPhone models, we expect only high-end new iPhone models (30-40% of them) to have a dual-camera next year." Kuo's analysis contradicts industry insider predictions that Apple's entire 2017 iPhone lineup will feature dual-camera technology. iPhone 7 Plus is expected to have a dual-lens camera Waterproof iPhone Apple's iPhone 7 is water-resistant to a depth of one metre for up to 30 minutes - a rating known as IP67, which is the same as the Apple Watch . It therefore makes sense that Apple would carry this through to the iPhone 8. IP67 means it will survive a dip in the sink or down the loo, and it won't break if you pour a drink over it, but you probably don't want to take it swimming.

According to reports in the media, Apple leaked the hardware specifications through its MacOS 10.12.4 public beta. The OS further hints at products that haven’t been released yet indicating that Apple could be having a new range of devices up its sleeves and could reveal them this year. According to Forbes report, Apple is working on its MacOS to accommodate the MacBook Pro’s update to Intel’s seventh generation chipset “Kaby Lake.” Intel has already started manufacturing these chips in large numbers and there is a strong possibility that Microsoft too is going to use these processors for its Surface Pro 5. Because MacBook Pro 2016 was released at a time when Intel was still working on Kaby Lake, Apple was forced to use Intel’s sixth generation chipset. However, with Intel now already mass producing Kaby Lake processors, MacBook Pro 2017 is expected to use them. For those who already own a MacBook Pro 2016, they wouldn’t really find a whole lot of difference in the MacBook Pro 2017 performance as Kaby Lake is only a minor upgrade of Sky lake. Beyond the slight performance improvement, we expect MacBook Pro 2017 to feature improved internal graphics as well as longer battery life and support for 4K displays. Overall, MacBook Pro lineup of Skylake processor will now be replaced Kaby Lake. The i5 6360U will be replaced by i5 7260U, the i5 6267U by the i5 7267U, the i7 6700HQ by the i7 7700HQ, and so on. You can check the complete details at Pike’s Universum. We expect MacBook Pro 2017 to be released later this year – sometime around Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference.

Cynicism is easy. All it takes is an external target and a cutting turn of phrase. It will always be easier to slam someone’s original idea than it is to build your own. Apple ignores the cynical. So should we all. Turn on, Drop in, Tune out Apple CEO Tim Cook received an honorary degree from the country of Scotland's Glasgow University last night. During the ceremony he discussed numerous topics, including the current U.S. administration. ("We'll speak up even when our voices shake.”). He also shared one of Apple's essential secrets, as reported by The Independent: "The other thing about today’s environment is the world is full of cynics. You have to tune them out. If not they become a cancer in your mind and in your thinking. You begin to think you can’t or that life is negative. The truth is, even if it doesn’t seem like this all the time, there has never been a better time to be alive than today. It’s the best time. My advice is to tune out the cynics even if they are sitting next to you." Tune them out If you think about it, tuning out cynicism has been part of Apple's D.N.A. since it began when Steve Jobs sold his car, Steve Wozniak sold his calculator and both men began on their mission to “get a computer into the hands of everyday people”. Mobile tech (including dumb mobiles) now reaches at least 77 percent of humans alive on this planet today, and iPhone sets the bar for what these devices can achieve. The Apple co-founder’s crazy dream is being realized. Look back on Apple’s history and it seems that only when the company has fallen into cynical thinking have its fortunes collapsed. How else would you characterize those dreadful years when it almost died? On his return, Steve Jobs kicked out the cynics and put the creativity and optimism into the driving seat. And it worked When it comes to Apple coverage, cynics are everywhere. From the birth of the Mac to the arrival of the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, cynics have slammed its every move. Look at the brouhaha around the iPhone 7 headphone jack. This cynical negativity amplifies Apple's errors and minimizes its achievements. Apple knows that despite all that cynicism, it has built industry leading customer satisfaction levels competitors can't match. It knows that for every angry customer amplified in a critical media, it has nearly a hundred happy ones who are silent. How does it achieve this? It tunes out the cynics to carve its own creative path. It strives to stay positive. That's a lesson for the times, if you think about it. Cynicism is retrograde Think about that time when you were in school and you wanted to learn more about Coretta Scott King. Did you? If your parents were cynical about such matters you may have skipped the topic, and if you did it is possible you will pass similar cynicism to your children. That’s a shame. Those who don’t imagine a better world seldom improve it. "Here's to the Crazy Ones," was a mission statement, not a recruitment campaign for incompetence, delusion, or a faded picture of some fictional status quo. Imagine if Apple had believed the cynics who a few years ago were telling us that mobile had hit its peak? Or if it abandoned its dream of annual iPhone improvements in order to keep releasing the same product? Yes, we’d be buying iPhone 4 for around $10 (we already can), but what else?  Don't stop believing Cook's company shrugs off the cynics in order to continue to define the next generation in mobile. (NB: It doesn’t need to dominate OS share to achieve this). In the next generation iPhone we can predict the company will weave together the important building blocks: Social, Cloud, IoT, Analytics, and Mobile (SCIAM). Apple will apply itself on figuring out how it can apply the latest technologies to resolve challenges real people in the real world face. Its success in achieving this so far has enabled it to build a great business. iPhone users love the product, recommend it. Even now, 16 percent of Samsung's churn went to Apple. Consumers aspire to have an iPhone. Where next? Cynics dismiss Apple, slam its 'lack of innovation', and criticize Cook. It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter because, just like Windows Vista, the golden towers of reactionary cynicism are going to disappear into the sands of forgotten history. I think Apple is in a great position to extend its reach across a much wider section of the smartphone market with three, or perhaps four models of iPhone: The iPhone SE 2, iPhone 7S and 7S Plus, and (expensive, advanced and radically redesigned) iPhone 8 Pro.  These products will widen its share, and with the support of its soon-to-ship AR solutions, will see Apple build profoundly strong positions across the fast-growing APAC regions in which it has been investing so much energy. Have you seen how popular AR and VR is becoming there? Mobile devices are computers. Better yet, in a decade or so you’ll be able to get smartphones as good as these for just a few dollars, and Apple will have helped enable, its founder’s mission of: Computers for the rest of us. Despite the cynics who said it couldn't. Tune out the cynics. It doesn’t matter if your voice shakes. Google+?

Mobile Accessories by Sharon Profis February 10, 2017 4:00 AM PST @sharonprofis 3 ways Apple can make the AirPods better Apple's first wireless earbuds are interesting, but there's a lot more they can do to make the AirPods really special. by Brian Tong 4:39 Close Drag Apple's AirPods aren't just special because they are one of the few "truly wireless" earbud headphones available -- models with separate left and right earpieces that aren't tethered together with a cable. Along with three Beats headphones (the PowerBeats3 Wireless, the Solo3 Wireless and the BeatsX) they're one of only a handful of products that incorporate Apple's new W1 chip, a teeny-tiny piece of hardware that will make your forget how awful pairing over Bluetooth can be. What's special about the W1? Like the A-series chips that power iPhones and iPads, the W1 is custom Apple-designed silicon. In addition to standard Bluetooth 4.1 streaming and advanced power management, the chip adds a host of key features unique to the AirPods, including balancing all of that sophisticated syncing (between the two earpieces, the case and the audio source) with the sensor inputs (automatically pausing music if you remove one from your ear). On one hand, headphones with the W1 chip are no different than any other wireless models: you can pair them with any Bluetooth-enabled device. But if you've ever gone through that process, it's a bit of a pain: Press a button on the headphones to enter pairing mode, pull up the settings menu on the phone or tablet and -- if everything works as planned -- choose the headphone from the menu to complete the connection. By comparison, the big advantage of W1-enabled headphones is that "they just work" -- when you're using them with a compatible Apple device, at least. When you pull AirPods out of their case, they'll pair with your iPhone within seconds -- around 3 seconds, actually. Kind of like the way you just plug in wired headphones. After the first time you pair W1 headphones with your iPhone, it will also be added as a Bluetooth headphone on any other device tied to your Apple ID. From there, selecting it as the sound output is easy -- no further pairing required. Jason Cipriani/CNET The W1 chip also helps improve battery life. The W1-equipped PowerBeats3 Wireless and Solo3 Wireless, for example, last longer compared to their respective predecessors, which are otherwise basically identical. So the W1 is basically the secret sauce that wrings more juice from same-size batteries. Do I have to have an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus? Nope. Because the W1 chip is Bluetooth compatible, any Bluetooth-enabled devices can still be paired with W1 headphones like the AirPods. That includes pretty much any iPhone, Android phone, tablet, Mac and many PCs. When pairing with an Android phone, for example, it works the same way as pairing any other Bluetooth headset. Even though you don't get the pairing benefits available for iPhone owners, you do seem to get the same battery life gains. That convenient auto-pairing, meanwhile, only works with these Apple devices: iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch running iOS 10.2 or later Apple Watch on WatchOS 3 or later Mac with MacOS Sierra or later Which headphones have the W1 chip? There are four W1 headphones available right now. Click through for full reviews of each one: Apple AirPods Beats Solo3 Wireless Beats PowerBeats3 Wireless BeatsX The good news is that they start at $150, £130, AU$200, which isn't a huge premium compared to similar models from other big-name manufacturers. Will we see other brands use the W1 chip? You probably noticed that the only W1 headphones available are made by Apple or its Beats subsidiary. Apple hasn't expressed intentions to license the W1 chip, so don't expect W1 headphones from Bose or the like anytime soon. However, it should be noted that many Android phones offer a "tap to pair" feature (with accessories that are equipped with NFC chips) that delivers a similar easy-pairing experience. The problem (in our experience) is that it doesn't generally work as smoothly or reliably as the W1 headphones do with iPhones. Is the headphone jack ever coming back? Are you trolling me?

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Remove DRM From iTunes Movies and TV Shows You bought a TV show or movie on iTunes. You want to watch it on your Android phone, Plex media server, or basically anything not made by Apple. Why won’t it work? All iTunes video purchases are locked down by Fairplay, Apple’s digital rights management (DRM) scheme. This does nothing to prevent piracy, but sure makes life annoying for people willing to pay for movies and TV shows. So what is a non-pirate who wants to watch things supposed to do? If you want to watch your videos on a non-Apple device, you’ll need to strip the video of its DRM. We’ve discovered two methods for doing just that, both of which strip the DRM with no loss in video quality: Requiem is free, but requires an ancient version of iTunes in order to work. Tuneskit costs $60, but is a lot easier to use, and works with the latest version of iTunes as of this writing. We’re going to go over both methods; you can decide which works better for you. We’ll be using Windows for these tutorials, though Tuneskit also offers a Mac version. Sadly, Requiem won’t work easily on a Mac—System Identity Protection makes downgrading iTunes nearly impossible. We recommend running Requiem in a virtual machine anyway, though, so you could use it on a Mac through a Windows installation in VirtualBox. The Easy, Expensive Way: Tuneskit By far, the easiest way to convert your videos is with the $60 Tuneskit. It works on Windows and macOS, is regularly updated to work with the latest version of iTunes, and is lossless. (Tuneskit has a demo that allows you to convert five minutes of video, if you want to test it first.) Fire up iTunes and make sure any videos you want to convert are currently downloaded, and authorized to play on your computer. Then, launch Tuneskit. Click “Add Files” to get started. Tuneskit will scan your iTunes library; pick which videos you want to strip the DRM from. They will be added to your list. Hit “Convert” and the conversion process will begin. Conversion may take a while, depending on your processor. When the process is done, click the “Converted” button to browse your converted media. Your original iTunes files are untouched, and your converted files are found in a separate folder. Click the magnifying glass to view your files in Windows Explorer. To ensure the process worked, try playing the videos in a non-iTunes video player. You should find that they work swimmingly. Congratulations! You’ve removed the DRM from your iTunes video, and can now watch it wherever you like. There is one small thing to note: Tuneskit’s DRM stripping is lossless for video and 5.1 audio, which means you won’t lose any quality. However, if your video comes with an stereo AAC track too—or only comes with an stereo AAC track—Tuneskit does convert that audio track, from what we can tell, which will result in a small (unnoticeable to most) loss in audio quality. So if you really care about audio quality, make sure you’re using the 5.1 Dolby Digital track, not the 2-channel AAC track—or use the Requiem method below for stereo tracks. The Free and Complicated Way: Requiem Requiem is a free, Java-based application capable of removing Fairplay DRM from iTunes videos. The catch: it hasn’t been maintained for a while, and only works with iTunes 10.7, which was released back in 2012. There are two approaches you can take to set up iTunes 10.7: You can completely uninstall iTunes from your computer, then install the ancient iTunes 10.7. If you’ve spent a lot of time tweaking your iTunes setup, and don’t want to lose anything, this approach is not recommended. It’s also a very bad idea if you’re an iPhone or iPad user, because older versions of iTunes cannot sync with newer versions of iOS. You can install iTunes 10.7 on a computer that you don’t normally use iTunes on, or set up a virtual machine specifically for stripping DRM from videos. Starting clean means you’ll need to re-download and authorize any videos you want to convert, but it prevents you from messing up an active iTunes installation. For simplicity, we recommend you set up iTunes 10.7 on a machine that you otherwise don’t use iTunes on, virtual or otherwise. There’s just a lot less than can go wrong. If that’s what you’re doing, feel free to skip step one below. Step One: Completely Uninstall Newer Versions of iTunes (If Necessary) If you’re planning on downgrading an active installation of iTunes, we’ve got some work to do. On Windows, head to the Control Panel > Programs and Features, then uninstall everything made by “Apple Inc.”—including iTunes, Bonjour, and Apple Software Update. Make sure that nothing related to Apple remains on the computer. There’s a chance that, after removing everything, installation of the old iTunes won’t work. We didn’t have this problem in our tests, but your mileage may vary. Software like Revo Unistaller might be helpful if you have problems. Step Two: Install iTunes 10.7 and Make Sure Your Videos Are Authorized Head to the iTunes 10.7 download page. Download the run the executable to install iTunes. Make sure you disable automatic updates. Then, bathe in nostalgia for the very recent past as the iPhones and iPads of yesteryear are promoted in the installation slideshow. When the installation is complete you’ll notice just how much iTunes has changed in five years. Head to the store and download all the videos you want to convert. (You can’t transfer them from an existing system—you’ll need to re-download the videos on iTunes 10.7 for this to work.) When the downloads are complete, ensure that you videos actually play in iTunes. You may need to authorize your computer, and in some cases re-download entire videos. Step Three: Install the Java Runtime Environment (if Necessary) Requiem requires the Java Runtime environment in order to run, so head to the Java download page and download the JRE installer. Run the executable to install Java. Now that Java is installed we can finally run Requiem. Step Four: Run Requiem Close iTunes, assuming all of your downloads are complete. Download Requiem, if you haven’t already. (If you get redirected to an “Anti Leech” page, try right-clicking on the download link and pasting it in the address bar.) The program comes in a ZIP file and is portable, so open it and extract the executable wherever you like. Quick note: f you want to keep subtitles and other metadata, you’re going to need to run mkvtoolnix and CCExtractor before launching Requiem. Run Requiem will scan your iTunes directory for any protected files, then remove the protections. If you get any errors, make sure you’ve authorized iTunes and that the videos are playable. When the process is done, Requiem will delete the protected versions of your videos and replace them with entirely unprotected versions. Head to your media folder in Windows Explorer… …and make sure the videos are working by opening them with something other than iTunes. Congratulations! You’ve removed the DRM from your video, and can now play it with whatever media player you damn well please. Requiem’s video and audio conversion are completely lossless, so there won’t be any loss in quality—no matter which audio track you’re using. If you can’t tell, Tuneskit is by far the easier method, especially if you have a lot of files to strip. There are just so many frustrating things that can go wrong with the free method. But if you’re really against spending the money, Requiem can work in a pinch…as long as you’re willing to put up with the hassle. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (6 REPLIES) February 10, 2017 James Paterson Requiem requiring something as outdated and inefficient as Java would be an immediate turn off to me, moreso than requiring an old version of iTunes. Even in 2012 Java was an abysmal piece of software. February 10, 2017 Alex Sim I ask about audiobooks because I upgraded my PC new iTunes it did not take all my content from the old library and so I added manually the rest, including the audio books which were purchased from iTunes but which you cannot just re-download, now they do not play properly in ibooks (Apparently known issue) I cant play in other apps because they have DRM. February 10, 2017 Justin Pot I agree: Java is another downside, but I wanted to include a free option and this is the only one we found that works. I think users should spend the $60 just to avoid downgrading iTunes, but avoiding Java is another compelling reason. February 10, 2017 Justin Pot If you can't open the audio in iTunes right now, you can't use either of these methods to remove the protection. Sorry. Got Feedback?

The CEO was in Scotland to receive an honorary doctorate of science. Picture: John Devlin/TSPL CHRIS McCALL 12:51 Friday 10 February 2017 0 Have your say The boss of the world’s most valuable company has revealed the inspiration he took from a chance meeting with a Scottish student living with cerebral palsy. Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, met Angela Reed when he made a surprise visit to the tech giant’s flagship store in Glasgow city centre on Wednesday. Reed, from Clydebank, was among a few dozen customers in the Buchanan Street premises when the CEO arrived at 2.30pm as part of a whistle-stop trip to Scotland. The 45-year-old took the opportunity to thank Cook for the research Apple has pioneered to ensure its products can benefit those living with all types of disabilities. Reed, who has difficulty communicating verbally, relies on her iPhone and tablet to write messages, as well as completing academic tasks as part of her studies. The California-based company has invested millions in innovations such as VoiceOver, a revolutionary screen reader that lets people use an iPhone without needing to see the screen. Its Siri programme, which is now installed in all of its smartphones, has proved particularly valuable to those with vision impairments. It acts an intelligent personal assistant and knowledge navigator - allowing the user to control a smartphone by voice command alone. “Our whole emphasis is on the accessibility of our products,” Cook told The Scotsman. “We design with people with disabilities in mind. “We think everyone should be able to take advantage of technology. It shouldn’t just be for people that are lucky enough not to have disabilities. “I loved meeting Angela, and she shared a message with me on her iPhone. It really hit home with me.” The technology executive from Alabama, who took charge of Apple in 2011, was in Scotland to receive an honorary doctorate of science from the University of Glasgow. He used a question-and-answer session in front of an 800-strong audience of students and academics at the city’s Bute Hall to reiterate his vision of Apple as a force for social good. “The main thing we do is provide products to people to empower them to do great things,” he said. “We have a simple philosophy that everyone should be treated with dignity and respect. We push very hard for that.” The accessibility features on iOS - Apple’s operating system on its smartphones and tablets - are widely regarded as the best in the industry. “Consider someone with low vision,” technology writer Steven Aquino wrote in a blog for industry website TechCrunch. “He or she may have struggled to use a phone with a display the size of a postage stamp, and a multi-tap keyboard. But then they buy an iPhone, and their whole world changes. They now have a phone with a touchscreen and tech like Zoom, features which make it easier to use the device. “Suddenly, they’re texting with family and friends, looking up directions, and more with a fluidity like never before. Thus, it isn’t hyperbole to say iOS’s accessibility features have been every bit as game-changing for the disabled as the iPhone was to the mass phone market.” Speaking to The Scotsman after her meeting with Cook, Reed said: “It was amazing to be able to tell him how much of a difference Apple makes to my life. I can do everything on my iPhone.” Back to the top of the page Sign in {* #userInformationForm *} Sign in socially {* loginWidget *} with your email address {* traditionalSignIn_emailAddress *} {* traditionalSignIn_password *} {* traditionalSignIn_signInButton *} Forgot your password?

By Jason Murdock February 10, 2017 12:58 GMT The storage reportedly occurred due to Apple's method of syncing data between devicesiStock When you click "delete" on your Mac's Safari browsing history, you expect those records to be expunged forever, right? Well, new research from a forensics firm has alleged a browser "syncing" feature used by Apple was causing iCloud to store such records for over a year. According to Russia-based computer analytics firm Elcomsoft, deleting your history does indeed make the records vanish from synced devices using the same Apple ID. Yet crucially, if stored in the cloud, they continued to remain available to Apple's servers for months. To probe further, the firm, which sells software used by governments and companies to break into devices, updated one of its iPhone cracking tools, dubbed PhoneBreaker, to extract records previously assumed to have been banished to the annals of history. As noted in a blog post, it was then able to pull a slew of Safari browsing data including the exact dates and times each record was visited and deleted. "Once you delete a record on one device, it will disappear on all other devices in a matter of seconds or minutes, provided that those devices are connected to the internet," wrote Vladimir Katalov, Elcomsoft's CEO. "While those records can be retained for technical reasons, a flush or clean-up will purge them sooner or later. However, those same records will be kept in Apple iCloud for much longer," he continued. "In fact, we were able to access records dated more than one year back. "The user does not see those records and does not know they still exist on Apple servers." Katalov told Forbes he came across the mysterious system by accident after testing his firm's tools on his own iPhone history and linked iCloud account. Katalov found his browsing records were not only still existing, but going back a full 12 months. Forbes tested the claim by clearing a Safari history and running PhoneBreaker on the account. Eventually it successfully uncovered thousands of records previously thought to have been deleted – including date and time the history item was deleted and even data about Google searches. A second expert later helped validate the research, running the same experiment to recover over 125,000 browsing history records going back again to 2015. Despite the concern, experts have suggested the issue is not believed to have malicious intent. If you want the issue solved right now you can switch off iCloud syncing with Safari iStock Instead, it appears the records are kept – albeit in a secretive way – to ensure data is able to be properly synchronised between iOS, Mac and Apple servers over time. The second security expert told Forbes enhanced encryption would help keep the data from prying eyes. And according to 9to5Mac, citing "sources familiar with the situation", Apple has done just this. The firm reportedly fixed the issue of plain-text data being accessible using this cracking technique in iOS 9.3, meaning the majority of users who have updated will not be affected. But for unpatched devices, Elcomsoft said the discovery could have "significant" forensic implications. "Unlike cloud backups that are created daily at best, iCloud sync works nearly in real-time. Being able to track suspect's activities almost no delay can be invaluable for surveillance," Katalov said. The purge begins Apple has not yet publicly responded to the research, yet Elcomsoft said reports have surfaced that indicate the firm has actively started to "purge" these older records. Katalov said: "[It] could be just moving them to other servers, making deleted records inaccessible from the outside. "Either way, as of right now, for most iCloud accounts we can see history records for the last two weeks only (deleted records for those two weeks are still there though). Good move, Apple. Still, we would like to get an explanation." Of course, if you want to be sure the issue will not affect you it is possible to simply turn the Safari syncing option off altogether. This is not the first time Elcomsoft research has had Tim Cook's tech giant in its crosshairs. Last November, it released analysis claiming iPhones were sending call logs in real time to Apple's servers, even when iCloud backup was switched off. Apple later fixed the issue.

Tim Cook’s Europe tour is not over just yet. Cook met the UK Prime Minister yesterday, discussing Apple’s UK investment commitments. Cook said he believes Britain will be just fine after Brexit, when the country leaves the European Union, even if there are some ‘bumps in the road along the way’. Cook then met the Mayor of London, as well as visiting a London school that uses iPads in the classroom and saw a digital artwork exhibition at the Tate Britain gallery. As usual, he documented his tour on Twitter … Apple plans to expand its UK offices moving 1600 employees to a new headquarters in Battersea. Cook says that they have significant room to expand further. In a statement given to The Independent, Apple said it is proud to support more than 300,000 jobs in the United Kingdom. In a statement released after the meeting, Apple said: “We are proud that Apple’s innovation and growth now supports nearly 300,000 jobs across the UK.” Cook met the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, discussing digital education, talent acquisition in the tech sector and Apple’s commitments to the capital.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 February 2017 by Military News Apple CEO: Britain will be ‘just fine’ after Brexit Britain will be “just fine” after it leaves the European Union, Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview broadcast on Friday (10 February). “We are very optimistic about the UK’s future and we are all in,” the CEO of the US tech giant told ITV television after meeting Prime Minister Theresa May and London Mayor Sadiq Khan on Thursday during a visit to Britain. “We’re a big believer in the UK. The UK will be just fine,” Cook said after visiting a coding class at a London primary school. But he told reporters on Thursday he expected “bumps in the road” on the path to Brexit. Britain voted to leave the European Union in a referendum in June last year and UK MPs on Wednesday approved the government’s Brexit Bill. This gives May the authority to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and begin the process of taking the UK out of the EU, a process she had promised to deliver by the end of March. Apple announced in September that it would create a London headquarters in the iconic and long-abandoned Battersea Power Station on the banks of the River Thames. Around 1,400 staff from eight existing offices in London will relocate to the renovated landmark, whose distinctive chimneys have towered over the southern riverbank since the 1930s. There will be enough space there for 3,000 staff. Cook’s comments will reassure the British government. Chancellor Philip Hammond in January hinted that the UK would slash corporation tax in a bid to remain attractive to businesses after Brexit. “We’re double-downing on a huge headquarters in the Battersea area… and we’re leaving significant space there to expand,” Cook said in the interview. The former power station lay derelict since it stopped generating electricity in 1983, but is undergoing a £9 billion makeover to turn the 170,000 square metre space into offices, apartments, shops and leisure facilities. The new “Apple complex” will take over 40% of the office space. Facebook, Google, Apple and Snapchat have all announced major investments in London in the past few months, underlining the capital’s status as a technology hub. The European Commission last year ordered Apple to pay up to €13 billion in back-taxes to Dublin, but the company and the Irish government itself have challenged the ruling. Under its special Irish tax regime, Apple paid just 1% on its European profits in 2003. According to the EU executive, this rate fell to 0.005% in 2014.

Set for a 2017 release to celebrate the iPhone's 10th anniversary, here's what the rumours say about the iPhone 8 UK release date, features and specs. 10 years of iPhone mean one thing: the iPhone 8 should be the best iPhone update yet By Chris Martin | 10 Feb 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments The iPhone 7 has only been on sale for a while, but all we seem to be hearing are rumours about the iPhone 8. We think Apple might well be holding back some major updates and improvements for the iPhone 8, which will be launched on the 10th anniverary of the first iPhone. Here we round up the rumours about the iPhone 8 release date, price, features and specifications. See also: Best phones 2016. Hang on a minute, shouldn't the next iPhone be the iPhone 7s? It still could be. Rumours suggest there will be three new iPhones, two of which are the expected iPhone 7s and 7s Plus models. The third would be the flagship, and 10th anniversary, iPhone '8'. We'd be surprised if Apple goes for that naming convention, and other rumours say it  could even be called simply The iPhone, or iPhone Pro, but for now we'll stick to calling the 2017 iPhone the iPhone 8. Latest updates: Here's a summary of the latest rumours, which could - as ever - turn out to be false: There will be three phones, including one codenamed 'Ferrari' (i.e. the anniversary iPhone) The main logic board will be in two pieces instead of the traditional one Apple may move the SIM tray to the bottom edge (this could be to allow room for other internal components or to include a Smart Connector) Wireless charging is very likely to feature, and could even have long range, up to 15ft away A glass back may be used instead of metal to facilitate wireless charging Quick charging will be supported when using a cable New speaker design could make the phone the thinnest ever It will have a 'borderless' OLED screen from Samsung - read more. The home button won't be physical, but will be under or built into the screen Laser sensor for gesture recognition - read more. The latest video from ConceptsiPhone does a decent job of showing what the iPhone 8 might look like. It's similar to the iPhone 7 but shows namely how Apple could make the screen bigger and integrate the home button. It's interesting to see an idea of how the bottom of the display might be used, similar to the Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro. Find the best Apple deals. iPhone 8 release date rumours: When is the iPhone 8 coming out? iPhone 8 UK release date: September 2017 (TBC) Although ages away, we can fairly confidently predict the iPhone 8 release date. Assuming the annual September announcement tradition continues, the iPhone 8 release date will be in September 2017. However, 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone launch, so we wouldn't be too surprised if Apple mixed things up a bit (it launched the SE - pictured below - in March). According to Tech Trader Daily (via MacRumours), Apple might be putting the iPhone 8 into production in June, sooner than expected. However, that doesn't necessarily mean the launch will be earlier than September given the potentially radical design change. It's not necessarily going to be called the iPhone 8, of course, but that's the name we're using to keep things simple. iPhone 8, iPhone 7S, iPhone X or something else? What will the iPhone in 2017 be called? It seems the name may have been confirmed with an Apple employee referring to the new device by the name 'iPhone 8' unprompted when speaking to Business Insider. However, there is another suggestion as Apple Insider claims that Apple could call this year's iPhone the iPhone X. As we've mentioned, the iPhone for 2017 is slightly harder to predict because it will mark a big anniversary for the smartphone. The latest rumours are that Apple will release three new iPhone models as part of the main lineup. This could well be the 'S' versions of the 7 and 7 Plus, and the extra 'iPhone 8', an even more premium flagship with 'revolutionary' features. The Wall Street Journal says: "Apple plans bigger design changes for 2017, the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone. Those changes could include an edge-to-edge organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen and eliminating the home button by building the fingerprint sensor into the display, according to people familiar with the matter. "At a meeting with an Apple executive, one of the company’s China-based engineers asked why this year’s model [the iPhone 7] lacked a major design change in keeping with Apple’s usual two-year cycle. The answer, one person at the meeting recalled, was that the new technology in the pipeline will take time to implement. People familiar with the matter said some features that Apple hopes to integrate into iPhones, such as curved screens, weren’t ready for this year’s models," it added. If Apple follows the usual pattern, the iPhone 7 that launched this year will be followed by the iPhone 7S in 2017. The fact that it's 10 years since the original iPhone means this could all go out the window. Apple will want to do something special to celebrate the occasion so an 'S' model, which usually just brings small tweaks, won't suffice. It's pretty much anyone's guess at the moment, hence, we're calling the 2017 model the iPhone 8 at the moment but it's perfectly plausible that the new phone won't conform to the traditional naming system at all. The iPhone SE (special edition) is already a thing, so perhaps Apple will go with 'iPhone Pro', iPhone Anniversary Edition' or even just 'iPhone' - although naming the iPad 3 as 'the new iPad' didn't go down too well. A report from Nikkei suggested that in 2017 there would be three new iPhone models. It sounded as though we were in for the usual 4.7- and 5.5in models (the regular and Plus), plus a third new 'Pro' model with a 5.5in or above curved screen. Its source said the screen would be "bent on the two sides" making it sound like a Galaxy Note 7 rival. Of course, this didn't happen with the iPhone 7, though it doesn't mean we won't see a curved-screen iPhone 8. Vote in our poll to let us know what you think Apple will name the iPhone next year. iPhone 8 price We're speculating for now, of course, as the iPhone 7 has only recently gone on sale. Whether Apple will introduce a price increase for the potentially special iPhone 8 is anyone's guess. However, the iPhone 7 price jumped up to £599 in the UK thanks to Brexit and we hope that it will stay the same with next year's anniversary model. However, in light of the latest leaks which suggest there will be three new iPhones, the 'anniversary' model could be an ultra-premium device that could cost more than any iPhone yet. We will just have to wait and see. Although one analyst predicts the iPhone 8 to be the best selling model ever - with up to 150m sales - another is worried that following the anniversary edition, Apple will see a possible 10 year slump afterwards. It is believed that moving to OLED for the iPhone 8 will push up costs as much as $50m for Apple, eating into the firm's profit margin. Whether the firm takes the hit and keeps the price of the phone the same or not remains to be seen. iPhone 8 specs and new features If Apple does indeed do something special for the iPhone's 10th anniversary, which is ever more likely from all the leaks, the iPhone 8 will be one which fans will no doubt want to upgrade to on launch day. Could we see the biggest queues ever? A combination of design and hardware changes will make the iPhone 8 the most radical new iPhone to date, if we are to go by the rumours and leaks. iPhone 8 screen Many reports are suggesting that there could be a third iPhone 8 model beyond the usual two. This more 'premium' option will be even bigger, touted at 5.8in, with a curved OLED screen. However, this may be no bigger than the current iPhone 7 Plus which is 5.5in due to the expected bezel-less design. Via MacRumours. Also, the Korean Herald reported that a source confirmed that Apple has ordered the curved screens from Samsung and that - like the screen on the Galaxy S7 Edge - it will be made from plastic and not glass. Typically glass is only used for flat screens, so this is not too surprising. There are yet more rumours on the possibility of a 5.8in iPhone with a 'wraparound' OLED screen that has embedded sensors. Apple Insider suggests it could be the iPhone X and feature a laser sensor for things like gesture recognition.  Apple has partnered with LG in the past for iPhone displays, but LG is reportedly working on a foldable screen which it's aiming to provide to Apple in 2018.  Respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who collaborated on the above info, has now said the third OLED iPhone will have a screen size of 5.1- or 5.2in rather than something bigger than the normal Plus model. According to a report on the Wall Street Journal, Apple is asking suppliers to make a screen better than Samsung, telling them to "submit prototype screens with better resolution than ones from Samsung". This means the iPhone 8 will have a resolution higher than Quad HD which is 2560x1440, a big jump from the iPhone 7. There is yet more weight to the possibility of the iPhone 8 getting an OLED screen. Multinational banking company JP Morgan has come across a purchase order in Apple's most recent Securities and Exchange Commission which is thought to be for OLED panels. The order extends for a year and is valued at around $4bn. We wanted to bring your attention to a phone which might provide a glimpse of what the iPhone 8. Xiaomi has announced the Mi Mix which is, let's face it, a stunning device. It looks like the first of a new category of phones with it's 91.3 percent screen-to-body ratio, according to the firm. A Facebook post by Robert Scoble - a well-known tech strategist - reveals new details about the next iPhone. In the lengthy post Scoble claims to have been told that it will be "a clear piece of glass... which will put holograms on top of the real world like Microsoft HoloLens does". He also says the phone will have an OLED screen and that Apple has 600 engineers working on a next-generation 3D sensor and that the phone will have eye sensors. These will bring "a new kind of interface". He also says that you'll "pop it into a headset which has eye sensors on it, which enables the next iPhone to have a higher apparent frame rate and polygon count than a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it." Plus, he says that new sources revealed we can "expect battery and antennas to be hidden around the edges of the screen, which explains how Apple will fit in some of the pieces even while most of the chips that make up a phone are in a pack/strip at the bottom of the phone." These sound like ridiculous predictions, especially the part about the phone being transparent - battery tech is not yet good enough to make one small enough to "hide" - but if true, the iPhone 8 will be a revolution rather than the evolution we've seen with the iPhone 7 this year. We'll continue to update this article as new information appears, but here's how things stand right now. This concept image via ConceptsiPhone shows what an edge-to-edge OLED display iPhone might look like: Despite all this talk of OLED screens, BRG suggests that only one of the iPhone 8 modes will use the technology. This is reportedly down to the supply not meeting the huge requirements plus the fact Apple has done decent things with LCD screens. Jony Ive has wanted to introduce an iPhone which resembles a single sheet of glass for a long time and the 2017 anniversary iPhone could be the one. It's rumoured that at least one iPhone in 2017 will use a glass body, according to Apple supplier Catcher Technology. Glass on the front and back would make it like a hugely updated version of the iPhone 4S. This, combined with the rumour that the iPhone 8 will sport an edge-to-edge OLED screen makes things rather interesting. And we're not just talking the side edges, as Apple may even go as far as to do away with the top and bottom bezels. The physical home button would be gone and the TouchID fingerprint scanner would be housed within the screen. A patent filed back in March 2015 states: "The man-machine interface device comprises an electronic display apparatus that is capable of presenting graphic text, images, icons, and other data typically shown on a screen, while further including a transparent finger touch sensor region that is seated above the display apparatus." A patent has now been awarded for a 'capacitive fingerprint sensor including an electrostatic lens'. This gets around the problem of an all-glass display and no physical home button with capacitive sensing technology working through gaps in space allowing a Touch ID component to operate below the iPhone's screen. Yet another patent points towards a bezel-free iPhone 8. It details a display technology that uses pixels capable of self-lighting (like OLEDs) arranged on a flexible surface with gaps in between. The gaps mean Apple could integrate things like sensors into the display negating the need for bezels. The concept video shown below is from DeepMind and shows what an iPhone would look like with an edge-to-edge display. And it looks pretty cool.  No home button  A new patent award to Apple is further indication, some might say proof, that the iPhone 8 will ditch the home button for a system which placed the fingerprint sensing technology underneath the screen. Named a 'capacitive fingerprint sensor including an electrostatic lens', it means Apple is looking into a fingerprint sensor which can work through various layers of the display.  Another patent, via Apple Insider, shows that we the iPhone 8 might actually look like the ambitous concept above. With not only the home button moving to the screen, Apple will also need to tackle the light sensor. Well the below patent called 'Electronic Devices With Display-Integrated Light Sensors' will do exactly that. The patent explains that having a light sensor can result in an increase in the size and weight of the device so "it would therefore be desirable to be able to provide improved electronic devices with light sensors and displays." As pointed out by Patently Apple, the firm has filed and been granted patents which may well be used on the 2017 iPhone. They suggest a curved-glass design and also that the sides of the phone could be used for virtual active buttons. For example, this could be used for certain controls when the camera app is in use. If true, the phone would rival Samsung's edge screen features. There were also some rumours we heard about the iPhone 7's screen that never made it to fruition. It's possible that they could see daylight with the iPhone 8. Economic Daily News speculated that the iPhone 7 could feature a 3D display, and one that doesn't require the use of those annoying 3D glasses. The website claimed at the time that Apple supply chain partner TPK is working on a project that could produce a glasses-free 3D display, though we're not holding out much hope for this as its been done before (remember the LG Optimus 3D?) and has never done well. There were also some rumours to suggest that the iPhone 7 could have a sidewall display, similar to that found on the Galaxy S7 edge and Note 7. This came from an Apple patent that was published in 2015. The patent hints at a future iPhone with a display that extends onto the sides of the device, providing interactive or touch sensitive portions that give access to slide-to-unlock functionality, music player controls, messaging readout, called ID, system controls and more. One of Apple's partners, Japan Display, is working in flexible an foldable screens similar to Samsung and LG. Whether this will end up in the iPhone 8 remains to be seen - it's unlikely but still interesting. Apple has plenty of patents describing bendable and folding devices, according to TechnoBuffalo. More details on the screen tech include that Apple is supposedly working on a new generation of 3D Touch. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the firm will make it from a thin film in order to introduce enhanced sensitivity - via AppleInsider.

[Rick Harris/Flickr] Apple is moving into new UK headquarters in the old Battersea power station. [Rick Harris/Flickr] Print Comments1 Britain will be “just fine” after it leaves the European Union, Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview broadcast on Friday (10 February). “We are very optimistic about the UK’s future and we are all in,” the CEO of the US tech giant told ITV television after meeting Prime Minister Theresa May and London Mayor Sadiq Khan on Thursday during a visit to Britain. “We’re a big believer in the UK. The UK will be just fine,” Cook said after visiting a coding class at a London primary school. But he told reporters on Thursday he expected “bumps in the road” on the path to Brexit. Britain voted to leave the European Union in a referendum in June last year and UK MPs on Wednesday approved the government’s Brexit Bill. This gives May the authority to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and begin the process of taking the UK out of the EU, a process she had promised to deliver by the end of March. UK's Brexit bill overcomes another hurdle British MPs overwhelmingly backed a bill yesterday (8 February) empowering Prime Minister Theresa May to start negotiations on leaving the European Union, bringing Brexit a significant step closer. EurActiv.com Apple announced in September that it would create a London headquarters in the iconic and long-abandoned Battersea Power Station on the banks of the River Thames. Around 1,400 staff from eight existing offices in London will relocate to the renovated landmark, whose distinctive chimneys have towered over the southern riverbank since the 1930s. There will be enough space there for 3,000 staff. Cook’s comments will reassure the British government. Chancellor Philip Hammond in January hinted that the UK would slash corporation tax in a bid to remain attractive to businesses after Brexit. Britain threatens to undercut EU if Brexit plans fail Britain warned on Sunday (15 January) it might undercut the EU economically if it cannot obtain both single market access and immigration controls, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepared her big Brexit strategy speech. EurActiv.com “We’re double-downing on a huge headquarters in the Battersea area… and we’re leaving significant space there to expand,” Cook said in the interview. The former power station lay derelict since it stopped generating electricity in 1983, but is undergoing a £9 billion makeover to turn the 170,000 square metre space into offices, apartments, shops and leisure facilities. The new “Apple complex” will take over 40% of the office space. Facebook, Google, Apple and Snapchat have all announced major investments in London in the past few months, underlining the capital’s status as a technology hub. Ireland set out arguments against EU in Apple tax ruling Ireland set out its arguments on Monday (19 December) against a European Commission ruling that tech firm Apple should pay billions in back-taxes to Dublin, claiming the EU executive arm has interfered in state sovereignty. EurActiv.com The European Commission last year ordered Apple to pay up to €13 billion in back-taxes to Dublin, but the company and the Irish government itself have challenged the ruling. Under its special Irish tax regime, Apple paid just 1% on its European profits in 2003. According to the EU executive, this rate fell to 0.005% in 2014.

That doesn't sound like that much of a big deal, but Strava has announced that you'll be able to finally leave the phone at home and have the app run natively on your smartwatch. However, it's only on Android Wear 2.0 devices, of which there are currently very few - the LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style are the first new devices to make use of it, and a few other smartwatches will be updated to the new platform in the coming months. No love for Apple The big miss here is the Apple Watch still - we've been hoping for a Strava app on the Apple Watch 2 (or the original Apple Watch) for months, if not years, and sadly it's still not here. We'd previously spoken to Strava to see if it's planning on supporting the Apple Watch 2 and its GPS abilities any time soon, and got this response back: "We are excited to see that Apple is introducing a native GPS into the Series 2 of the Watch. We are actively looking into how we can extend Strava's existing Apple Watch app to take advantage of the native GPS."  It's pretty likely it'll appear on Apple's timepiece in the near future, but for now, if you want Strava on the go and don't want to have to keep a phone circulating around your body, at least there's now an option.

Contact Us Newsletters Sales: 1-800-405-0844 Articles Customer Stories Plans Product Tour Research Topics Request Pricing Smartphones from Oppo, Vivo Make Gains on the iPhone in China Devices hit a sweet spot between price and functionality February 10, 2017 | Mobile Share Email Print eMarketer recently examined the results of new Kantar Worldpanel ComTech estimates suggesting a decline in market share for foreign smartphone manufacturers like Apple. And with the release of full-year 2016 estimates on smartphone shipments in China by International Data Corporation (IDC), there’s further evidence of the continued rise of local manufacturers Oppo and Vivo. The two firms appear to have found a winning combination of pricing and features, allowing them to beat out more established competitors like Apple and Xiaomi. According to IDC, iPhone manufacturer Apple’s market share in China fell to 9.6% in 2016, down from 13.6% a year earlier. Apple shipped 13.5 million fewer phones in 2016 than it did the previous year. At the same time, China-based smartphone manufacturer Oppo saw its market share more than double, climbing from 8.2% in 2015 to 16.8% last year. Oppo shipped 78.4 million smartphones in China in 2016, more than any other manufacturer. China-based device company Vivo did almost as well: Its market share jumped by more than 6 percentage points in 2016, and it shipped 69.2 million smartphones. Even before the release of full-year 2016 results from IDC, other sources have tracked the rapid growth of these two homegrown manufacturers. According to Q3 2016 data from Counterpoint Technology Market Research, the shipment share in China for both Oppo and Vivo increased by more than 6 percentage points over Q3 2015. What might explain the increasing popularity of Oppo and Vivo among smartphone buyers in China? The two companies have settled on a device strategy that combines functionality with an appealing “midrange” price point. In fact, smartphone sales in this midrange seem to be outpacing other categories. A GfK analysis of China’s smartphone sales growth by device price point in the first half 2016 found that the fastest-growing category was devices priced between RMB 2,500 and RMB 3,000 ($376 and $451). Oppo and Vivo seem to have found a sweet spot between cheaper bare-bones smartphones and the high-end products offered by Apple, helping the manufacturers position themselves for further growth among China’s growing middle class. —Jeremy Kressmann New in eMarketer PRO This Week Report: Ad Spending in Southeast Asia Report: Measuring Influencer Marketing StatPack US Mobile Coupons Forecast Data: US Ad Blocking Users Not a PRO subscriber?

WARNING SHOT: Banks risk ‘being left behind’ says Apple Pay’s Jennifer Bailey The comments made during an interview with The Australian Financial Review follow Apple’s latest submission to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) this week, which accuses the banks of using fees on Apple Pay transactions as a “trojan horse” to discourage the use of its mobile payments service and to condition the market to accept transaction fees on digital wallets. ANZ became the first of the country’s big four banks to begin supporting Apple Pay in September 2016. Some 26% of ANZ customers are now using Apple Pay, and more than 10m transactions have been made on the service since its launch, with Apple users spending 10 times more through their phones than Android users, the Australian Financial Review reports. ING Direct and Macquarie Bank have become the latest in Australia to announce their support for the mobile payment service this week. Apple still wants to “work with the banks in Australia to bring Apple Pay to our customers in a way that advantages many of the things they are offering through their banking apps, which we have done already in other markets,” Bailey says. “That’s why the announcement about these new banks is important and we are continually on that path because, as more banks get on the platform, I think there is more of an industry understanding about how Apple Pay really complements their services.” The company’s battle with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank and Westpac Bank began in July 2016, when the banks announced their intention to “collectively negotiate” with third-party mobile wallet providers over the introduction of mobile payment services in Australia.

BeatsX Image: Apple By Stan Schroeder2017-02-10 11:15:42 UTC After several months of unexplained delays, Apple's BeatsX earphones can now be bought from Apple's online store for $149.95. Similarly to Apple AirPods, BeatsX are wireless earphones that connect to other devices via Bluetooth, assisted with Apple's wireless W1 chip which makes pairing a breeze.   SEE ALSO: Apple unveils its own way to find lost AirPods The main difference is that the AirPods are fully cable free, while the BeatsX have a remote-equipped cable that goes around your neck, thus (ideally) making them harder to fall out of your ear and perhaps a bit better for use during physical activity.  BeatsX also feature "optimized noise isolation," 8 hours of battery life, extremely quick and efficient "Fast Fuel" charging, and Siri support.  With "Fast Fuel" charging, Apple claims you can get 2 hours of battery life from a 5-minute charge. Image: Apple If you're unsure whether you want the AirPods or BeatsX, take into consideration that AirPods are pretty much sold out, with 6-weeks shipping time.  For BeatsX, shipping is 1 business day for all color options: gray, white, blue and black.  BONUS: Testing out Apple's new wireless AirPods Topics: Apple, Beats Electronics, beatsx, Gadgets, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

[Illustration: eugenesergeev/iStock] Recent posts The First Public Benefit Corporation Is . . . A For-Profit College? Scotland Is Taking Over The Country's Ferries And Creating A National Ferry Service Fox News Just Made The Head Of ISIS Look Like A Pretty Decent Guy Another Reason To Let Kids Play Outside: Staying Indoors Could Cause Bad Vision Eillie Anzilotti 02.07.17 6:00 AM In the two weeks since President Donald Trump issued his executive order on immigration, banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, he's met with opposition from a surprising sector: the tech industry. In a radical change of tune since executives like Jeff Bezos and Sheryl Sandberg filed into Trump Tower to meet with the president in December, 128 tech companies have now filed an amicus brief against the ban; the Washington Post reported that Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a company-wide email that the ban "is not a policy we support" and added that "Apple would not exist without immigration." While many of these denunciations of Trump's order appear motivated by some higher corporate ethos, there's another factor at play here: pressure from employees. Reuters reported that employee and activist outcry was a crucial factor in Uber CEO Travis Kalanick's decision to quit Trump's business advisory council, and the repercussions of the ban—both personal and political—have issued a wake-up call to companies that the voices of their young, progressive workforces need to be reflected in company policies. A new study has taken a step toward measuring the importance of business ethics to young employees (in a very different sector: the apparel and textile industry) and how it could affect retention and on-the-job satisfaction. When we think about why people switch jobs, we tend to run through the usual list of suspects: more money, interpersonal conflicts, restlessness, mid- or quarter-life crises. But a new study has found that for young workers in the textile and apparel industry, reasons for job-hopping are much more moral: if they feel a disconnect between their own values and the company’s, especially when it comes to sustainability. "Young people in the workplace now have been raised with this idea of the importance of sustainability and community," says Jung Ha-Brookshire, a professor of textile and apparel management at the University of Missouri, in an interview with Co.Exist. When entering the workforce, people will often seek out opportunities at companies that tout a commitment to those values, only to find that ethos falls apart along the supply chain. "When that happens, there’s a feeling of betrayal," Ha-Brookshire says. Ha-Brookshire, along with Rachel LoMonaco-Benzing, a doctoral student at University of Missouri’s College of Human Environmental Sciences, began interviewing employees involved with corporate supply chains at apparel and textile companies in January 2016. The research was exploratory in nature: Ha-Brookshire and LoMonaco-Benzing located and interviewed 10 people who had been in the industry anywhere from 3 to 20 years, with occupations ranging from retail to textile manufacturing to outdoor apparel production. In the study, Ha-Brookshire and LoMonaco-Benzing wrote that "participants unanimously described a sense of distrust or a lack of confidence with T&A companies’ claims of or attempts towards sustainability." A healthy dose of skepticism toward corporate ethical promises is common among consumers, or should be. Often, initiatives that appear to do good—like one-to-one giving models—are more about generating buzz for a company than they are about aiding real causes. "To date, much research on corporate sustainability has focused on consumers’ willingness to buy and support sustainable products, which have recognized price, quality, service, and, when it comes to fashion products, style as critical factors towards adopting sustainable consumption practices," the authors noted in the study. In short, it’s easy for consumers to buy "sustainable" products and feel good about their choice, without actually interrogating what goes on behind the scenes. For employees, it’s a different, and less studied, issue. "One of the workers we interviewed described sustainability in the textile industry as a ‘moral dilemma,’" Ha-Brookshire says. In an industry where profit margins are tight, companies, regardless of ethical stance, will often default to the cheapest manufacturing options, despite the fact that they may not be the most sustainable or humane. Marie, a product development engineer for a textile producer interviewed in the study, described her experience working with a company that she had been eager to support as a consumer because of their claims to sustainability: "They have so many things to say, they want to do this and that. You know, good for the environment, good for the United States . . . And not a single one of these things ever plays out. They’re just constantly looking for cheaper, cheaper, cheaper, which means that they’re not buying things from the United States, they’re not setting things up in the United States. They’re touting these ideals, they’re not actually doing any of these things." Over the course of their interview process, Ha-Brookfield and LoMonaco-Benzing heard the same sentiment repeated by each person; they plan to roll out a longer and more comprehensive survey to capture more industry-wide perspectives later this year. While clothing companies like Everlane and Patagonia have forged bonds with consumers on the basis of sound ethical practices and sustainability—Everlane donated its Black Friday profits to factory workers, and Patagonia will start refurbishing and reselling used clothes—it’s important to remember that not everything stamped with a marker of sustainability means it truly is so. But Ha-Brookfield and LoMonaco-Benzing’s work is not meant as just an indictment of the industry. Rather, they hope that the study will encourage the textile and apparel companies to work to align their practices with what employees expect of them, and by doing so, truly earn their consumers’ trust.

Read More LONDON: Britain will be "just fine" after it leaves the European Union, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview broadcast on Friday. "We are very optimistic about the UK's future and we are all in," the CEO of the US tech giant told ITV television after meeting Prime Minister Theresa May and London Mayor Sadiq Khan on Thursday during a visit to Britain. "We're a big believer in the UK. The UK will be just fine," Cook said after visiting a coding class at a London primary school. But he told reporters Thursday he expected "bumps in the road" on the path to Brexit. Britain voted to leave the European Union in a referendum in June last year and Prime Minister Theresa May is preparing to kickstart the departure process by the end of March. Apple announced in September that it would create a London headquarters in the iconic and long-abandoned Battersea Power Station on the banks of the River Thames. Around 1,400 staff from eight existing offices in London will relocate to the renovated landmark, whose distinctive chimneys have towered over the southern riverbank since the 1930s. There will be enough space there for 3,000 staff. "We're double-downing on a huge headquarters in the Battersea area... and we're leaving significant space there to expand," Cook said in the interview. The former power station lay derelict since it stopped generating electricity in 1983, but is undergoing a £9 billion ($11.7 billion, 10.4 billion euros) makeover to turn the 42-acre (170,000 square metre) space into offices, apartments, shops and leisure facilities. The new "Apple complex" will take over 40 percent of the office space. Facebook, Google, Apple and Snapchat have all announced major investments in London in the past few months, underlining the capital's status as a technology hub.

By Alexandra Simon-Lewis 1 day ago By Alexandra Simon-Lewis Friday 10 February 2017 Beats by Dre Apple has today released its long-awaited Beats X earphones in the UK, five months after their unveiling. The £129.95 Beats X, designed by Dr. Dre, have up to eight hours of battery life and are available in four colours: white; blue; grey and black. ADVERTISEMENT Apple is also offering three months of free Apple Music with a selection of its music accessories, including the Beats X. The “flex-form” cable that links the magnetic earbuds let them sit around your neck without the fear they’ll fall off at a moments notice, a concern that still hangs around the Apple AirPods. While the Beats X earphones were delayed, the AirPods became went on sale in December 2016 making them the first Apple product with the W1 chip technology to hit the shelves. READ NEXT Tim Cook heads to the University of Glasgow to collect his honorary doctorate Tim Cook heads to the University of Glasgow to collect his honorary doctorate By Victoria Woollaston Subscribe to WIRED The Apple W1 chip is used in both the Apple AirPods and Beats X, supposedly making the wireless devices easier to use than rival products. This is, in part, due to the automatic pairing function. Once connected, the W1 chip works in Apple music devices to pair with any product signed into an iCloud account. The W1 chip means the Beats X earphones work with any compatible devices – including Android phones or Windows PC’s. This one-step pairing system has been a central focus of Apple’s campaign for the Beats X. Apple AirPods Bloomberg At £159, the AirPods offer more than a 24-hour charging life with the included Apple Charging case. Apple’s AirPods are selling surprisingly well Apple’s AirPods are selling surprisingly well Apple 12 Jan 2017 ADVERTISEMENT On a single charge, the battery life is around five hours. With a design that is totally wireless, the AirPods won’t get tangled but they can be easily lost – with nothing to physically connect them to your phone or person, except their fit inside the inner-ear. While the Beats X don’t have a charging case like the AirPods, a five-minute charge gives you two hours of battery life. Apple claims the Beats X audio is apparently clearer than former over-ear models designed by Dre. The Beats X focus on bass-centric beats for improved clarity and, what former products lacked in terms of noise-isolation, the latest design by Dre is said to be able to adjust to the frequency of music and background noises to offer a crisper sound.

Speaking to GMB he said: “We’re leaving significant space there to expand.” Cook went on to calm any further fears that the tech giant would be cautious about its future investment in a post-Brexit Britain by saying: “We’re a big believer in the UK.

 Some matte black iPhone 7 owners are complaining their phones are chipping really easily Rob Price Feb. 10, 2017, 5:55 AM 18,511 facebook linkedin twitter email print rjorge/Apple Some Apple customers are complaining that the paintwork on their matte black iPhone 7's are chipping — even though their devices allegedly haven't been dropped or bashed. In a discussion thread on Apple's website, numerous iPhone 7 owners have been sharing their stories of chipped devices, starting in November 2016. We first heard about the complaints via Apple news site 9to5Mac. The chips seem to be appearing most often around the speaker grille and the buttons on the device, and multiple users are complaining it happened even though they kept their iPhones in cases and did nothing to damage them. "The paint is starting to chip at the speaker grille and it is very disappointing from Apple. I have never dropped or knocked the phone against anything," one user complained. "I have this issue on my matte black too. I noticed it on my mute switch, 2 small dots that I initially thought was dust. But after cleaning it off I realized that it's the paint chipping off. So the next day I went down to my locals service center and try to make a warranty claim. But the staff said that cosmetic damages are not under warranty," another said in December. "So I ended up selling my iPhone 7 and got a silver one and after another month I never notice any sort of paint chipping." (Other users also said they had had no issues with other iPhone 7 colours.) GangCS/Apple Another customer said (emphasis ours): "I have the same issue! Not near the edges or buttons but on the back of the phone. There's one tiny spot smack dab in between the Apple logo and the edge of the device. I don't know how this happened given I use a lint roller on the pocket I keep the phone in and I have a screen protector and TPU case on, also I've never dropped it. I first thought this was dust on the device but realized it's not. it bothers me a 3/10, I try not to make a big deal out of anything that's not a least a 5/10 on the s**t that bugs me scale. I thought about getting a new one and selling the current but at this point I think it could happen to the new one too." The Matte Black iPhone chips/loses color so quickly. Color regret 😩 — Owen ⚡️ (@ow) December 4, 2016 "I am using the matt black model and I realised a bit of the paint chipped off at my volume button too. I am a very meticulous user and it never happened with my old iphone 6 model," one said in November 2016. They said they took in to an Apple Service Provider, but was told that "cosmetic damage isn't covered under warranty." greeendo/Apple This appears to be a strictly cosmetic issue, and doesn't affect how the device runs — and is less serious than previous iPhone issues like "bendgate," when iPhone 6's were found to bend easily or "antennagate," which involved signal issues for the iPhone 4. But it's clearly frustrating some customers, who have spend hundreds of dollars on the premium devices. "This is unacceptable for a phone that costs more than 1000€ and it looks pretty bad," one said. I chipped the matte black metal on my iPhone 7 :((( — strasser (@brystrasser) December 9, 2016 This isn't the first time an iPhone has been criticised over its susceptibility to cosmetic damage. Back in 2012, customers complained that the iPhone 5 chipped and scuffed easily — to which exec Phil Schiller responded that "any aluminum product may scratch or chip with use, exposing its natural silver color. That is normal." Some iPhone 7 owners have resorted to DIY solutions to the issue. One says they "remedied it with black acrylic paint that costs $5 at Michael's. It's not perfect, but made the chipped paint spots on my 7+ matte black less of an eye sore." Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

By Agamoni Ghosh February 10, 2017 10:54 GMT Apple CEO Tim Cook said after Brexit there will be new regulatory challenges but all of that can be overcome with time.Getty Images Apple chief executive Tim Cook has expressed optimism over UK's decision to split from the European Union and thinks the country will do 'just fine' outside the bloc. "We're a big believer in the UK - we think you'll be just fine. Yes, there will be bumps in the road along the way but the UK's going to be fine," said Cook who met Prime Minister Theresa May while on a visit to the country. Cook said after Brexit there will be new regulatory challenges, but all of that can be overcome with time. He further announced that Apple's expansion plans were proof of its commitment to the UK despite some big companies who have decided to pull out of London and UK to bolster their presence in the EU. This includes an intention to build a new UK headquarters for Apple at the redeveloped Batter sea Power Station in south London expected to house at least 1,600 staff. "We are proud that Apple's innovation and growth now supports nearly 300,000 jobs across the UK," Cook said reassuring that the company will maintain its considerable base in the UK after Brexit. Many technology companies particularly start-ups post the Brexit vote has expressed concern over UK deciding to leave the EU. Several Asian electronic companies including Samsung have also expressed desire to shift their base from London and make some other city the headquarters for the European market.

The Apple Watch generated more than US$2.6 billion in revenues for Apple in the fourth quarter of 2016, making up nearly 80% of total global smartwatch revenues, Canalys noted. Driven by Apple's strong performance, global smartwatch shipments reached nine million units in the fourth quarter of 2016, increasing 12% from a year earlier. Canalys also estimated that Apple shipped 11.9 million smartwatches in 2016, holding a 50% market share globally for the year. Xiaomi also enjoyed a record quarter shipping a total of 5.5 million Mi Band bracelets in the quarter. In the coming quarters, Samsung Electronics is expected to push shipments of its Gear S3 Classic and Frontier. Also, Android Wear shipment volumes will bounce back significantly, as new products that were postponed due to the delay of Android Wear 2.0 will be launched soon, Canalys commented.

They will be available in black and white models and come with a built-in Apple W1 chip. While both of Apple’s flagship earphones, the AirPods and the BeatsX, are designed to work primarily with iPhones, have a W1 Chip, a dedicated Siri button and connect via Bluetooth, there are some key differences between the two. Design While Apple has gone for a peculiar design for the AirPods that leaves them hanging from the customer’s earlobes and makes them susceptible to being lost, the BeatsX are designed like regular in-earphones. While both AirPods buds are different units in themselves, the BeatsX earphones are connected together with a wire, which the company calls a “flex-form” cable. Unlike the AirPods, which need to be placed inside their case or the user risks losing them, the BeatsX earphones can simply rest around your neck like regular earphones when not in use. They can also attach to each to each other magnetically, which will lessen the likelihood of them getting lost since the user will be able to easily locate the whole body of the earphones. Form Factor Unlike the AirPods, which come with a pre-determined form factor for all ear sizes and once the user has purchased them, he/she needs to adjust to them, the BeatsX earphones have a customizability aspect — they come with changeable wingtips, so you can actually use wingtips according to your comfort. Battery and Music Playback The BeatsX earphones come with a fast fuel feature for quick charging. Beats claims that the earphones are capable of playing music for eight hours at one go and will provide users with two hours of playback when charged for five minutes. The AirPods come with a six-hour battery life on a full charge. However, users have been regularly complaining about the AirPods’ battery issues — in some cases, the charging case actually sucked out charge from the earphones instead of charging them. Related Stories Apple-Beats Wireless BeatsX Headphones Coming This Week Apple Stores Have Beats X Earbuds In Stock Price The BeatsX earphones are $9 cheaper than Apple AirPods. While the AirPods retail for $159, the BeatsX earphones are available for $149.95 Verdict When placed in comparison to the AirPods, the BeatsX earphones do seem like a better deal in terms of price, battery life and design, unless you want a different form factor than the tried and tested regular in-ear one.

Robert Kondrk – who, together with Cue, was responsible for building iTunes into “the biggest music retailer in the United States” according to the music publication, also made this year’s Power 100 list for serving as an instrumental part in making Apple Music a success. Apple’s trio of audio executives specifically managed to rank 4th on this year’s list of the most-powerful names in music today, as Billboard highlights that Apple’s plans to introduce original video content into its $9.99/mo Apple Music offering could be “critical” in 2017, as other services such as Amazon, Pandora and iHeartRadio continue to gain pace. Larry Jackson, Apple’s Head of Original Content, iTunes and Apple Music, and Bozoma Saint John – Head of Global Consumer Marketing, iTunes and Apple Music each also earned a place on the list – ranking 67th and putting the executives just under that of Shazam CEO, Rich Riley. Despite the publication’s optimism regarding Apple Music’s future citing that the service has seemingly “only scratched the surface,” and the Apple executives placing within the Top 5 of this year’s Power 100, though, Billboard notes that Cue, Kondrk and Iovine have each dropped a position compared to last year were they managed to rank #3. Meanwhile Daniel Ek -CEO of rival streaming service Spotify– jumped 9 spots on the list to be named the most important person in music today, placing at #1. / Image Credit: Fast Company / AppleInsider (h/t) Version: 7.5.0 iPhone + iPad Spotify Music FREE Continue Reading You may also like... 5 Tracks You Need To Hear This Weekend Apple To Launch 3 New iPhones This Year?

Cook made the comments during an interview with Good Morning Britain at a classroom at Woodbury Down primary school in North London as part of his recent European tour of schools, universities and Apple Stores. He said that he had told prime minister Theresa May that Apple remains committed to the UK and cited a new headquarters being built in London as proof of this. "I told prime minister we are very optimistic about the UK's future. We are double downing on a huge headquarters in the Battersea area, and we are leaving significant space there to expand and so we are a big believer in UK. The UK will be just fine," he said. Cook also touched on the resident controversy of president Donald Trump's immigration ban, saying that business in the US like Apple benefit by allowing talent from all over the world to find a home in America. "He's our president but on the issue of immigration we support sort of a broad immigration, particularly high-skilled folks, and I think this is so important for the world. We are better because we are a diverse company." During his visit to the school in North London Cook was involved in a lesson that saw children using iPads and learning coding skills, and he said he believes this is something all schools worldwide need to work towards. "We think coding should be required in every classroom in the world, it gets kids a lot more engaged because they are living in a digital world - we are all living in a digital world," he said. He underlined though that it was important that teachers are at the heart of this: "The kids are engaged like never before, the teacher is still the centre of the classroom."

But if you try them on, you’re going to enjoy some widespread attention. And be left impressed. I, for one, have turned from a critic to a fan. And it’s amusing to see critics praise it once they experience it. Unless of course, ear canal isn’t in the average window. If you’ve had a problem with the EarPods fitting, you’d have a problem with the AirPods as well. On the contrary, if you’re fine with standard EarPods, the AirPods take your music and wireless audio experience to the next level. I initially got the pair of Apple AirPods around New Year’s. Talking about the unboxing and pairing of the device with the iPhone, all you need to do is open the AirPod case. This also serves as its charging dock. Assuming that Bluetooth on your iPhone is turned on, it detects your pair of AirPods. Your iPhone will then display battery percentage on the charging case as well as each AirPod. To pair the AirPods, all you need to do is open the lid of the case and tap a few times. Tap, sync, tap. And you’re done. A few indicators through the LED flashing on the case, and you have your moment of truth. Simply pick up the AirPod and place it in your ear. You’ll hear an audio notification that the AirPod is active. I did have a fan moment when I did that. I was saddened the first time around. The initial pair of AirPods that I got had a bug. Somehow, only one of the AirPod to connect to my iPhone. I got a replacement in a few days, and this pair has been working well ever since. It’s been a month already. Yes, you can run down the stairs with your AirPods as well! What do I use it for? My daily schedule isn’t too conducive to sit back and enjoy some music. Yesterday, was supposed to be among my lightest day, and I’d received 43 calls. This is despite the fact that a lot of conversation happens over email, and messaging. Now as much as I’d like to, I simply don’t get to sit back and experience some nice music. I’d rather listen to music on my laptop rather than on my phone. Connecting the Apple AirPods to the MacBook Air The Apple AirPods connect with my MacBook Air as well. But the process of connecting could’ve been better. I wish the process is as simple as it is with the iPhone, but that’s not the case. You need to go to settings, Bluetooth and manually connect the AirPods. I’m interrupted each time I get a phone call. I have some critical calls around the time I begin my day. I get started around 9AM and the barrage of calls goes on till the end of the day. I’ve been holding on to my phone all through these calls. After a certain point, you end up holding the phone away from your ear. Doesn’t matter how important people are, for a significant duration of the call, it’s just useless unnecessary chatter between others that you don’t need to pay attention to. As the phone begins to warm up close to half an hour into the call, you want it to end sooner. But life usually has different plans. The first remedy is to use a handsfree set or earphones with a mic. But while I walk with a laptop bag in a crowded street, there’s always the hassle of wires, which I hate. That’s when I got my hands on a pair of Apple AirPods. Image: Reuters My concerns with the Apple AirPods Just like many others, even I had my concerns. They sure do come at a price. And what happens if they fall off? As much as I was compelled to show them off in public, my mind kept stopping me. What if it rolls off into an open drain, or some such phobia would dampen my excitement. I was more comfortable trying it out in open spaces, in office, or while on a short walk around home. That’s how I spent the initial couple weeks with the Apple AirPods. Soon, the AirPods grew on me. I’ve had to deal with some degree of envy from all those around me who know me as well. And that’s exactly what I mean by widespread attention. What truly impresses me… Given that my use case is primarily for long calls, what has distinctly stood for me are the mics in the AirPods. I’ve been part of several calls using the AirPods, and none of the called parties ever suspected I was using these AirPods. When I told a few, they acknowledged it felt I was speaking from my iPhone. I’ve spoken at a normal conversational volume level, and at times even discussed at inaudible levels close to a whisper and the person on the other end has been able to hear me. It’s only when I revealed to them that I was infact using the AirPods that they knew. I nearly believed that I can’t connect my AirPods with the MacBook Air, but since I can, using Siri and receiving and placing calls wirelessly is a delight, all thanks to continuity. What I wish from the AirPods I use a MacBook Air, and as much as I wished, I hoped to use it with my MacBook Air. But it simply wouldn’t. It’d be so convenient if I could answer my phone calls or respond to Siri on the MacBook Air by a double tap on my pair of AirPods instead. Seems more practical. But alas, Apple had different plans. I’m hopeful, though, that in the next macOS update, Apple would incorporate the AirPods more closely. The Apple AirPods come at a price, and once you’ve overcome the heartburn of shedding that kind of money, you’re left impressed. It makes life a whole lot convenient. Underscoring Apple’s popular approach to design, the Apple AirPods are truly minimalist. In fact, once you have overcome your worries of losing the AirPods, you would just get immersed in audio.

In all those months, only the iPhone 8 is rumored to get what many Apple fans have been waiting for, wireless charging. However, a new report seems to suggest that it is not only the iPhone 8 who will get the feature. Instead, all iPhone 2017 models will get the feature on release. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple could be featuring wireless charging in all of the iPhone releasing this year. This new report if contrary to earlier claims that the wireless charging feature is limited to the iPhone 8 only. However, this is probably good news for anyone who fancies a new way of charging their phone. In addition to the wireless charging feature, the report also mentioned that Apple will use an extra graphite shield to protect the 3D Touch sensor. With the addition of wireless charging, residual heat can penetrate all the way to the display. And due to the increased sensitivity of the new 3D Touch sensor, the heat might affect its performance. This is why a kind of heat shield mist be put in place to protect the sensor. iPhone 8 wireless charging concept (via iphone8blog.com) If all of these speculations hold some truth in them, then this could be the reason why the iPhone 8 is will be expensive. According to Fast Company, the iPhone 8 will cost more than $1000 on its release. Although at the time the report was made, the comparison was made between it and the current top-tier iPhone 7 Plus. In addition to the price and new features, there have been reports that the production for the iPhone 8 is going well. In fact, the trial production is said to be going ahead of its schedule. However, this does not mean that Apple intends to release the iPhone 8 earlier than expected. Instead, the tech company is still aiming for the usual September release just like the iPhones before it. Right now, there are no means on knowing what Apple’s plans are for the iPhone 8. All these reports are mere speculations or educated guesses based on extensive studies and trends. Nevertheless, it seems that this year’s lineup of iPhone will include a considerable amount of technology inputs. For more updates on the iPhone 8, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India Elections World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Budget 2017 Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones iPhone 8: 5 features that we expect to see on Apple's latest flagship What we know about the new iPhone 8, iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus so far. Sami Khan   February 10, 2017 15:56 IST Apple, iPhone 8, iPhone X, iPhone 7S, Galaxy X, anniversary iPhoneApple Press Kit Apple is not even remotely close to announcing its 2017 iPhone flagship, but that doesn't make rumours about the upcoming device any less exciting. New details about the new iPhones are emerging every now and then. So we thought of putting them together based on their credibility. Read: Make in India: Apple iPhone production in Bengaluru to commence soon Apple is celebrating the tenth year anniversary of iPhones in 2017, making it a special year for the company. From what we've heard so far, the new 2017 iPhones are going to bring changes like never before. As the tradition goes, Apple will announce the new iPhone series in September. Let's take a look at the sure-shot features that will make the new iPhones extraordinary. Three iPhone variants It is widely being reported that Apple will celebrate the tenth year anniversary of iPhone with an additional variant, reportedly being called the iPhone 8 or iPhone X. There will be two regular variants of the iPhone, the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, which will succeed the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus respectively with upgraded features and specs. The screen sizes of the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus will be same as their predecessors. Wireless charging Most Apple rivals such as Samsung have already incorporated the advanced wireless charging technology to its phones. But Apple is yet to follow the suit. It is likely to change this year with the new iPhone 8/X.  However, the standard iPhone models will not get the technology , KGI Securities analyst claims. New design The new iPhones, and yes they include the 7S and 7S Plus models, are in for a massive makeover. The Cupertino-based tech titan is likely to ditch the aluminium design for a glass sandwich design, the latest reports confirmed. You may need to be careful with the glass on the back though. But from the way it looks, exercising a little caution while handling the phone will be a small price to pay. iPhone X and its charisma The star of the show this September is definitely going to be the iPhone X, and the name has a nice ring to it. Going by the rumours, everything about the iPhone X will be nothing short of spectacular. The new iPhone X will have an OLED wraparound display, dual camera setup and no physical buttons. The Home button is likely to be integrated within the display and the volume and lock controls will be fused in the metal frame with capacitive touch.  The shocking price The most recent report on the iPhone 8 has revealed its price, and you either need to start saving up or really plan selling one of your organs (don't do that!). A report from earlier this week claims the high-end iPhone X will set you back at more than $1,000. But if the rumoured specs are true, you will get your money's worth. And we won't be surprised to see a rising demand for the iPhone X – just like the Jet Black iPhone 7 and 7 Plus despite the scratch prone build.

If latest findings and rumours are to be considered, Apple is finally planning to bring wireless charging to all the variants of its upcoming iPhones. As per the latest forecast by Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at KGI Securities, Apple is already working to implement wireless charging to its iPhone ecosystem.   Mac Rumours report that Apple will reportedly put a new 3D Touch module along with an additional graphite sheet to prevent the device from heating. If you are not aware, wireless charging generally hikes up the internal temperature of the device and iPhone 8 rumoured to come with glass casing can take in a lot more heat than required. So putting a 3D Touch module inside the device does make sense.   The research note from Kuo read - “While we don’t expect general users to notice any difference, lamination of an additional graphite sheet is needed for better thermal control and, thus, steady operation; this is because FPCB is replaced with film, which is more sensitive to temperature change of the 3D touch sensor in OLED iPhone,”   However, putting a 3D Touch module with graphite sheet will come with some cost which will be automatically passed on to iPhone’s overall cost. To add to this, a recent report also suggested that iPhone 8 is all set to make records for the most expensive iPhone ever and might be priced at around $1000 mark.   This year, Apple is expected to unveil three iPhones - a 4.7-inch variant and a 5.5-inch variant sporting LCD panels as before and a 5.8-inch variant boasting a curved OLED panel. Of this one will be the iPhone 8 and the other two will be an upgraded version of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. We don’t really know about the RAM and battery specifications yet but that has never got people’s attention given iOS’s degree of compatibility with the hardware Apple puts in the iPhones. Moreover, Apple is expected to ditch the traditional Home Button and implement a fingerprint scanner underneath the display. Apple is also working on 3D photography which might debut in the next iPhone. Further, we might see a Dual SIM iPhone this year, if rumours are to be believed. While all this might sound interesting, it is still too early to dig into the expected specifications about the new upcoming iPhone 8. Nevertheless, wireless charging is a welcome addition but will the price jump be too harsh for consumers? Let’s hope for the best.

Tim Cook, Apple CEO. The Apple CEO spoke to ITV’s Good Morning Britain and said Apple is “double downing” on the country. “What I told the Prime Minister was we are very optimistic about the UK’s future. And we are all in. We’re double downing on a huge headquarters in the Battersea area that you’ve probably heard about. We’re leaving significant space there to expand. And so we’re a big believer in the UK. The UK will be just fine,” he said. A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said that the meeting between Cook and May was “a very positive and useful discussion.” “It was a meeting with the prime minister.

Apple have made a recent announcement about their investment in the UK and they had a conversation around that and the importance of government and business on digital skills which going forward will clearly be a huge part of the future industry. “It was a chance for the prime minister to outline her plans for negotiating our EU exit.

Andreas Dombret, who is an executive board member for the Bundesbank—Germany’s central bank—told a private meeting of German businesses and banks earlier this week in Frankfurt that even if banking rules were “equivalent” between the UK and the rest of the EU, that was still “miles away from [Britain having] access to the single market”, the BBC reports.

It’s safe to say that Ming-Chi Kuo is the most reliable source of information on Apple’s products. His predictions in the past have been uncannily accurate. While he doesn’t actually have a 100 percent record with his predictions, he’s been right so often that when he predicts something, everyone pricks up their ears. In his report, Kuo predicts that the upcoming iPhone 8 and updated iPhone 7s and 7s Plus will all feature wireless charging support, reports 9to5Mac. He goes on to say that wireless charging will heat up the phone and that a new, protective graphite layer will be added under the 3D Touch sensor. This layer alone, adds Kuo, will raise the cost of the sensor by as much as 30-50 percent. Coupling this with rumors that the iPhone 8 will be the most expensive phone from Apple, one can see why. The price of the iPhone 7s models is expected to be in line with current prices. Another thing to note is that the expected all-glass design of the iPhone 8 is more of an insulator than a conductor and will lead to more internal heat. All these factors are responsible for raising the price of the iPhone 8, believes Kuo.

This major upgrade could also increase the iPhone 8 price dramatically — even when you spread it out on monthly payments. Advertisement Consumers are ready for a change, and it’s one that we can get behind, but one of the biggest changes is coming inside the iPhone 8 and it could leave you without the need for a case or even for a charging cable. The iPhone 8 design is a mystery, but there are a ton of beautiful iPhone 8 concepts that hope to show you what it will look like. The most reliable man in Apple leaks just shared the news that three 2017 iPhones will all come with wireless charging built-in. If you’re counting that could be the iPhone 8 with an OLED display, an iPhone 7s and the iPhone 7s Plus. The iPhone 8 may gain wireless charging, but it could cost consumers more. Whether Apple calls it the iPhone 8 or the iPhone X, this is as close as you can get to reading about wireless charging on in iPhone 8 specs listing. Advertisement Ming-Chi Kou’s track record for Apple rumors is second to none. Kou uses sources inside the Apple supply chain and across the world to paint the best picture of the new iPhone every year. He primarily informs investors looking to make money on the new iPhone by purchasing stock in Apple and other companies, but he also shares notes that help potential buyers learn about new features. In a note published on 9to5Mac, Kou asserts that we will see three new iPhones in 2017 and all three will include wireless charging. Kou states that Apple will need to change the internal design of the iPhone to deliver better heat dissipation because wireless charging creates more heat than plugging in. According to Kou, the heat will not be felt by consumers, but Apple will need to pay more for a redesigned 3D Touch sensor and there is a new graphite layer that will be inside the iPhone 8. It’s not clear if the iPhone 8 wireless charging will come in the form of Energous WattUp as shown in the video below, or in a more traditional form. This report comes right after Fast Company reports that the iPhone 8 price could arrive at over $1,000 for the premium model. A source familiar with Apple’s plans tells the publication that the cost of a new OLED display that spans the front of the phone, a new 3D touch sensor and other changes that will thrill consumers will cost quite a bit. Advertisement The leak also outlines the potential for a bigger iPhone 8 battery. Combined with wireless charging, this could mean less need to carry a Lightning cable with you and less need to invest in a battery case if Apple is able to deliver significantly better iPhone battery life. Apple’s iPhone 8 release date is expected in September with multiple new iPhone models arriving around the same time. Expect iOS 11 on board, which Apple should announce in June at WWDC 2017. 8 iPhone 8 Features We Want in 2017 New iPhone 8 Design to Enable Features   1 / 8 Everyone wants a new iPhone 8 design, but most people don't know what changes they actually want. We're leading off our iPhone 8 feature wishlist with a new iPhone 8 design because it is a key part of enabling new iPhone 8 features. After sticking with a very similar design for three years there is an expectation of major changes for the 2017 iPhone and here are the things we would love to see Apple do with a new design. Shrink the overall size of the iPhone 8 Plus without lowering the screen size. Apple could do this by shrinking the bezels on the sides and bottom of the iPhone some to offer a smaller overall package. Apple could choose to change where you use Touch ID and how the home button works in new ways to make this happen. We definitely don't want a phone that is slim just to be slim, especially not at the price of battery life, but there is something to be said about an iPhone 8 design that trims some fat. The Jet Black iPhone 7 feels different than all the other colors. While it is more susceptible to scratches it is easier to grip, which is something we can definitely see Apple add to the new iPhone 8. KGI Securities Analyst Ming-Chi Kou predicts the iPhone 8 design will look include an all glass front and back with stainless steel metal on the edges of premium models. This could come together for an iPhone 8 design that looks like a cross between the iPhone 4s and the Jet Black iPhone 7.   1 / 8 One Response 02/10/2017 thomasammy749 Reply Stay at home mom Kelly Richards from New York after resigning from her full time job managed to average from $6000-$8000 a month from freelancing at home… This is how she done \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ <<<<<<<!!!!!!!!!!!!!http://jobbuzz7.com Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Advertisement Invites haven’t gone out yet but it appears Apple could use a March launch event to promote several new products. The iOS 10.3 update is confirmed and it’s set to deliver new features, bug fixes and tweaks for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. The company is also rumored to have a new iPad Air 3 up its sleeve for 2017. iPad Air 2 stock is drying up, a sign that a new model is on the way. And now, Apple’s 12-inch iPad Pro is having the very same problem. 12.9-inch iPad Pro inventory is also starting to shrink which could mean an iPad Pro 2 release is inching closer. Advertisement Many 12.9-inch iPad Pro variants are starting to sell out at popular retailers like Best Buy. We’re also starting to see shortages at AT&T, Verizon and at Apple itself. Apple’s website is now listing the 12.9-inch iPad Pro variant with an estimated ship date of two to three weeks. The device was recently listed with a one to two week estimated shipping date. In-store pickup is also showing delays at some Apple Stores. Stores in San Francisco currently list in-store pickup dates in early March. These changes don’t confirm an imminent iPad Pro 2 release but delays like these are typical ahead of a major product announcement. Advertisement Apple is said to be planning several new iPad Pro 2 variants including updates to its 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro stock is seemingly unaffected at the moment with most stores showing ample inventory. A 10.5-inch iPad Pro with slimmer bezels is also rumored to be in development with a release pegged for this year. The company is reportedly bringing its True Tone display to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2. This feature, which is currently found on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, automatically adjusts the color and brightness of the display to match the environment. Apple’s new iPad Pro 2 is rumored to have a brand new 12-megapixel rear-facing iSight camera, another feature found on the current 9.7-inch iPad. The new iPad Pro 2 models will also reportedly feature quad microphones and a 3.5mm headphone jack. According to multiple reports, Apple is also developing new iPad software which could include wider support for the Apple Pencil accessory. The Apple Pencil debuted alongside the original iPad Pro back in 2015. Bloomberg claims “Apple may roll out the new iPad software features as part of an upgrade to the iOS 10 operating system in the first half of 2017.” Apple currently has an iOS 10.3 update in beta though none of these iPad features are available in the current beta. As for the launch date, Apple typically hosts an early media event to bridge the gap between its iPhone launch and WWDC. Last year, the company confirmed the iPhone SE and a smaller 9.7-inch iPad Pro after months of rumor and speculation.

Advertisement Last year, Apple took the stage and confirmed two brand new iPhone models to replace the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus as its flagships. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus feature numerous upgrades including improved designs, cameras, processors, battery life, and more. Apple’s also changed how it handles storage. The 16GB iPhone is finally gone and in its place is a 32GB iPhone 7. The 32GB iPhone 7 is the cheapest option and its accompanied by the 128GB iPhone 7 and a much larger 256GB iPhone 7. The storage bump and the cheap price make the 32GB versions of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus attractive options. Advertisement That said, there are a few reasons to avoid Apple’s base model. Chew on these reasons as you try and decide which iPhone 7 model to pickup.   If you can afford the 128GB iPhone 7 or the 256GB iPhone 7, you should opt for one of those instead. Here’s why. 32GB simply isn’t going to be enough storage for many of you. Many apps require hundreds of megabytes of space. Individually, that doesn’t seem like much. Collectively, it’s a ton. And apps are just the beginning of the potential nightmare. Advertisement Want to shoot a bunch of 4K video? You’d better have a ton of space because they’ll fill up your storage quick. We’ve constantly had to delete photos, videos and other files to make room for new photos, videos, and other files on our aging 64GB iPhone models. It’s not just 4K video either. Regular video will take its toll on your iPhone’s storage space. So will the photos you’ll inevitably want to shoot with the iPhone 7’s fantastic camera. So will Live Photos, if you’re into those. So will the selfies you shoot with the iPhone 7’s 7MP front-facing camera. On top of that, a standard iPhone “configuration uses approximately 4GB to 6GB of space (including iOS and built-in apps) depending on the model and settings.” So when you buy a 32GB iPhone 7 you’re essentially buying a 28GB iPhone 7. When you pay extra for the 128GB you’re buying quadruple the storage, sure. But you’re also buying peace of mind and freedom. You can snap photos and video at will. You can download apps and music and any other files without feeling the pressure of your device’s threshold. And unlike some Android phones, you cannot easily add storage to the iPhone 7 later. This advice rings even more true for users who plan to keep the iPhone 7 for three or more years, as that means more photos, videos and apps to keep on the phone. You get peace of mind with 128GB of storage. We’ve been using a 128GB iPhone 7 since September and we haven’t had to worry about internal storage space or paying extra for iCloud storage. The device currently boasts 50GB of free space. So we can shoot videos, save music locally, and download apps and games without giving it much thought. Friends and family have been asking us which iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus to. And without hesitation we tell them to buy the 128GB iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. They provide the most value, and enough space for most users. We don’t know how you’ll use your iPhone 7 but we’re willing to wager you’ll use apps, shoot photos and video, and download music and other files. We’re also willing to bet that 32GB of iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus storage will fill up a whole lot faster than you think it does. If you can afford the 128GB iPhone 7, pull the trigger. It will save you from numerous headaches and it could ultimately save you some money. Additional iCloud storage space doesn’t come free. And if you don’t get enough storage, prepare to spend money every month on the service. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.2.1 & 6 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.2.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 10 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.2.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  The iOS 10.2 update brings 13 known patches for potential exploits. That's one more than its predecessor (iOS 10.2). These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2 update and/or the iOS 10.1.1 update, know that iOS 10.2.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2 update had 12 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.2.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.2.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 10 6 Responses 09/09/2016 Mark S. Reply Mixed emotions: I have the 64GB 6+ and was disappointed there was no 64 option with the 7+. I was going to go to 128 – but I did my homework and discovered I have only used 21GB. And I’m sure I could spend 30 minutes and upload (then delete) many pictures to my MacBook Pro. So I would recommend doing some homework before giving Apple money for storage you’ll never use. 10/08/2016 Karl R. Reply So, 32 gig is enough? Since i’ve only used up 21 gb all in all in my Galaxy S5 (10 gb on internal) (11.5 on sd) 10/14/2016 Pavan Reply 32 gb is enough as we do everything in cloud. so really i doesn’t matter which size. The size matters if only when it comes to gaming as along as you’re not a mobile gamer you go with 32 GB. 10/17/2016 Szilagyi Robert Reply If you are a mobile gamer i don’t think it is a problem to use a 32GB version. Most of the games are under 200 MB and to save space Google photos, onedrive, Spotify helps a lot. After i take a couple of videos the phone sync with the google photos or i put it on youtube and i can delete all of them. I just I had a Note 5 before i bought my iPhone 7 Plus and until one year whith more than 3000 photos and 20 vids i still had 7 Gb free space. 10/25/2016 jlb Reply I don’t understand why there is no 64GB model. 02/10/2017 thomasammy749 Reply Stay at home mom Kelly Richards from New York after resigning from her full time job managed to average from $6000-$8000 a month from freelancing at home… This is how she done iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiijjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj >>>>>>>>>!!!!!!!!!!!!!http://jobbuzz7.com Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

 Apple CEO Tim Cook: 'The UK will be just fine' after Brexit James Cook and Reuters Feb. 10, 2017, 2:43 AM 715 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple chief executive Tim Cook interacts with Year 2 pupils in a classroom, during a visit to Woodberry Down Community Primary School in Harringay, north LondonYui Mok PA Wire/PA Images Apple CEO Tim Cook told Prime Minister Theresa May the company was optimistic about Britain's future after it leaves the European Union, the BBC reported on Thursday. Cook met May at Downing Street on Thursday and said he thought the UK would be "just fine" outside the European Union. Apple's CEO spoke to ITV's Good Morning Britain and said his company is "double downing" on the country. Last year, Apple said it was moving its London headquarters to the landmark Battersea Power Station, a move that was hailed by the government as a sign that major firms are still investing after the Brexit vote. Here's Cook's full comments to Good Morning Britain about Brexit: "What I told the Prime Minister was we are very optimistic about the UK's future. And we are all in. We're double downing on a huge headquarters in the Battersea area that you've probably heard about. We're leaving significant space there to expand. And so we're a big believer in the UK. The UK will be just fine." A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said yesterday that the meeting was "a very positive and useful discussion."  Here's the full statement: "It was a meeting with the prime minister. It was a very positive and useful discussion. Apple have made a recent announcement about their investment in the UK and they had a conversation around that and the importance of government and business on digital skills which going forward will clearly be a huge part of the future industry. It was a chance for the prime minister to outline her plans for negotiating our EU exit. It was also a chance for her to reiterate and welcome Apple's investment in the UK."

Image: Image: LevanteMedia/Shutterstock This year is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone and Apple has some surprises up its sleeve, including three new devices with wireless charging. The rumour mill surrounding the launch of new iPhone devices is kicking into gear and tongues are flapping over the latest claims by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Kuo, in a research note, said that the new iPhone generation will come with an OLED display and glass casing. The new devices may come under the iPhone 8 brand, or perhaps Apple will do a Microsoft on it and call them the iPhone 10 generation to celebrate the decade since the smartphone launched in 2007. Ming the wireless According to MacRumours, Kuo said that the new family of devices are expected to debut around September or October. Kuo, who has an uncanny knack of being on the pulse of Apple rumours, said that it will come with a new 3D Touch module that will have additional graphite sheet lamination to prevent the device from overheating. This is something that Apple will want to get totally right if it wants to avoid the costly debacle that befell Samsung as a result of its faulty Note7 devices. As a result, it will also be $5 more expensive for Apple to make each device, adding fuel to rumours that the most high-end generation of iPhone devices could retail at more than $1,000 in the US. It is understood that the smartphones, which are also rumoured to come without bezels, will have all-glass casing, which again is less efficient than aluminium for cooling the devices, contributing to a rise in internal temperature. The back of the device is also expected to be made of glass. “While we don’t expect general users to notice any difference, lamination of an additional graphite sheet is needed for better thermal control and thus, steady operation. This is because FPCB is replaced with film, which is more sensitive to temperature change of the 3D Touch sensor in OLED iPhone,” Kuo said. Apple iPhone device.

Still Has More Cash Than Ever Before Apple ‘s(NASDAQ: AAPL)  overseas cash position continues to grow at an incredible rate, and the possibility of some type of repatriation holiday is the highest it has been in years, thanks to the new Trump administration. In this segment from Industry Focus: Tech , Motley Fool analyst Dylan Lewis and senior technology specialist Evan Niu discuss Apple’s cash position and financial structure. A full transcript follows the video. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Apple wasn’t one of them! That’s right — they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. Click here to learn about these picks! *Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017 This podcast was recorded on Feb. 3, 2017. Dylan Lewis: Speaking of their international segments, I think it might make sense to check in on their cash hoard a little bit. As of their recent report, Apple is sitting on $246 billion in cash. Because they do so much business outside of the U.S. and because of certain current tax regulations, $230 billion of that total, or roughly 94%, is held outside the U.S. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty asked [CEO] Tim Cook on the call about what the company might be thinking with the current administration, and the possibility of repatriating some of that cash. I think that was a question a lot of people wanted an answer to. Evan Niu:  Yeah. That’s one of the big things that the Trump administration is pushing, is this tax reform, including a potential repatriation holiday. If they could bring back a lot of that cash, there are certainly a couple things they could do with it. Cook didn’t really give a lot of clear guidance on what he’s thinking. But, you could buy some companies. He keep saying that Apple is open to really big acquisitions if they fit, if they make sense, all these things. But he’s basically not concerned about pricing anymore. You could buy some companies, you could invest in the U.S., you could potentially bring production back. Obviously, that’s another big thing that Trump is pushing. Another thing I would actually like to see is strengthen the balance sheet. The whole reason they have the $70 billion-plus in debt is because it’s always been a way to avoid the repatriation taxes. So, if they can repatriate at appealing rates, it might also make sense to pay down some of that debt, because that way, you can avoid some of the interest expense, and it strengthens your balance sheet a little. Not that the balance sheet is weak, by any stretch of the imagination. It all nets out in the end. But, logistically, it would be nice to bring that money back, pay down some debt. Because, if this is a one-time deal that they can bring back a ton of money, I would expect them to keep generating ridiculous amounts of cash overseas, and then they would want to raise more debt, again, to be able to tap that, in the same way they have been doing, but if they could pay down that debt, that basically gives them even more time to keep pursuing the same strategy. And if they’re taking advantage of a one-time tax holiday, I think that would make sense, from a corporate finance standpoint. Lewis:  Yeah. Even with $70 billion in debt, where they had to repatriate a lot of that cash that’s held overseas, they still have quite a bit to work with. I think on the call, Huberty specifically asked about what merger and acquisition activity to expect, or if they might continue to invest in original content and programming that would make the Apple ecosystem seem a little bit more appealing. I think because she led with that question and had some specific examples of where cash might go, Cook’s response followed along with that. But, I was hoping we might get some color about an increase in the dividend, or an update on what the company was thinking with share repurchase where they’d have that extra capital on hand. But, nothing there at the moment. Cook was notoriously cagey, as always, in his response. Niu:  Yeah. He didn’t really give a lot away there. They usually update their capital return program every April. So, next quarter, we will get some insight. They did buy back $11 billion in shares this quarter. Which partially helps juice the earnings-per-share number, which is another record, because they are able to retire so many shares. They retired something like 62 million shares last quarter. That’s really highly accretive to that earnings-per-share figure, even though net income was actually down slightly relative to a year ago, in part because of foreign exchange headwinds and things of that nature. So, right now, they are up to about $144 billion in cumulative repurchases, and the current authorization is $175 billion. So they still have plenty of room. They only have one more quarter before they update it again. But I would expect them to give another update and increase it again in a couple months, because this business creates so much cash that they literally have no idea what to do with it. [laughs] I mean, think about how much money they have given back, and the fact that they still have more money now than they’ve ever had before. So, it’s like, they’re trying to give this cash back at this ridiculous rate, but they generate so much of it that it still adds on a net basis to their total cash position, even after giving back so much over the years. It’s mind-boggling. Lewis:  And that’s with them continuing to invest in the future, as well. You hear about some of the different projects that they may or may not be funding, and some of the initiatives they might be pushing. It’s not like they’re sitting on their heels here. They’re certainly throwing money into seeing where tech might be going. It’s just that, with this type of money available to them, you can only do so much of it with reinvesting in the business and with R&D. I mean, that’s the beauty of having a cash cow business like that. Niu:  It’s just insane how much they make. Dylan Lewis owns shares of Apple. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

It should be called either the iPhone 8 or iPhone X, and it will come with big changes in terms of design and specifications. This year's iPhone models are tipped to come with wireless charging, and the latest KGI analyst Ming Chi Kuo report reiterates this. Apple iPhone 8 Specifications, Release Date, and More - Leaks and Rumours So Far MacRumors got hold of this report and it states that all the three iPhone models releasing this year, not just iPhone 8 as was previously rumoured, are expected to sport wireless charging. It further states that this will cause the phone to heat up a little more, and Apple looks to "add a new 3D Touch module with 'additional graphite sheet lamination' to prevent the device from malfunctioning due to overheating." An excerpt from the iPhone 8 wireless charging report reads, "While we don't expect general users to notice any difference, lamination of an additional graphite sheet is needed for better thermal control and, thus, steady operation; this is because FPCB is replaced with film, which is more sensitive to temperature change of the 3D touch sensor in OLED iPhone." The new 3D Touch module will reportedly cost $5 (roughly Rs. 300) more per phone to Apple, partly explaining why the expected price of the iPhone 8 is to be north of $1,000. Also, OLED displays are much more expensive than LCD displays, something that is heavily rumoured to be integrated in the iPhone 8 exclusively - and not available in the other two rumoured models, the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. The iPhone 8 wireless charging technology will be dramatically different from the current existing ones. An early leak claims that the new wireless charging feature will let the upcoming iPhones get charged from a distance of about 15 feet which means that users won't need to place the iPhone on a wireless charging plate, like we've seen with wireless charging technology so far. The current wireless plates do not allow free movement of the phone, and even though you do not plug the device to the cord, you have to leave it on the plate for it to charge. This means you cannot use the phone while charging it. If the iPhone 8 rumour is true, wireless charging could be a big USP of the device on launch.

Apple.com is quoting short shipping times for the black and white BeatsX, with delivery for Valentine’s Day. Apple’s website is also selling the newly-announced gray and blue colors with longer 2-3 week wait times. BeatsX earphones are not considered “truly wireless” like AirPods, however, as they rely on a cord between each earphone like Apple’s other W1 earphones, Powerbeats3. BeatsX is unique in Apple’s audio lineup as it features a new design with an adjustable neckband. Unlike Powerbeats3, BeatsX charges over Lightning (the same cable as the iPhone) rather than micro USB. And unlike AirPods, BeatsX are available in both white and black from today. Blue and grey colors are also available to order from Apple’s website, although you’ll have to wait a few days longer for those to deliver. Battery life is rated at 8 hours compared to 5 hours from AirPods and 12 hours from Powerbeats3, and 5 minutes of charging equals 2 hours of additional playback (a full charge takes 45 minutes). BeatsX earphones were originally set to launch in Fall 2016 but were delayed until February following unexpected issues that affected launching AirPods. BeatsX are available for $149.95 (compared to $159 for AirPods) from Apple.com.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Apple could be working on ‘exceedingly… Apple could be working on ‘exceedingly flexible’ phone screen, patent suggests By Lulu Chang — February 9, 2017 10:19 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Rumors of foldable phones and wearables have been all the rage as of late, and Apple's patent for a bendable screen could indicate it wants to be part of this new trend. The future looks flexible from Apple’s perspective. Literally. According to a patent originally discovered by Apple Insider, it appears as though the tech giant is looking to build a mobile device “with an exceedingly flexible display.” The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Thursday published a filing for “Electronic Devices With Soft Input-Output Components,” which delves into the idea of fitting LCD or OLED panels into products featuring a bendable design. As Apple Insider explains, Apple’s proposal includes a flexible input-output display featuring integrated sensors and haptic feedback mechanisms, which would be comprised of a mesh-esque elastomeric substrate layer. Traditionally, these displays have been made from a sheet of plastic. But Apple wants to place the light-emitting components like LEDs, micro-LEDs, and OLEDs, as well as the input mechanisms and conductive traces, in a grid shape that will allow for more flexibility. More: Apple iPhone 8 rumors and news To make it truly bendable, Apple will need to thin out or completely eliminate the underlying polymer substrate layer, and instead keep only the mesh-like structure with individual “electrical units” or “islands.” Sensors such as “touch sensors, force sensors, temperature sensors, accelerometers, and other sensors, and vibrators or other devices for providing haptic feedback” could be added to the stretchable screen, which undermines the need for any sort of top bezels. So the future is not only flexible, but flat as well. So what would the advantages of a bending screen be? For one, the flip phones of days past could make a resurgence, but with a full-sized screen. Alternatively, we might one day be able to wear our phones around our wrist. Of course, it’s still unclear as to whether or not Apple will move forward with this design, but it’s certainly some interesting food for thought for us to chew on in the meantime.

The company teamed up with Apple to create these displays and they essentially replace the latter’s own Thunderbolt Display series. LG recently acknowledged that the monitor doesn’t play nice when routers are in the immediate vicinity which is probably what compelled Apple to delay shipments of this product. Apple has reportedly delayed the shipments of the LG UltraFine 5K Display by up to six weeks on its online store. This was previously at two weeks but has now clearly been extended to give LG more time to come up with the fix for this issue. LG is working on a shielding fix that will arrive with future models which is going to cut down on electromagnetic interference that’s causing these issues. This issue is exclusive to the company’s UltraFine 5K Display and any other router, the same product family also includes a 4K version and that has been working well since the first day. This problem only surfaced in the most expensive version that’s meant to serve as a companion to the new MacBooks from Apple. LG is yet to confirm when it’s going to start sending out new units of the UltraFine 5K display that features enhanced shielding to ensure that users don’t have to put up with the same problem again.

Love it or hate it, Apple’s iconic smartphone single-handedly changed the course of modern computing and catapulted Apple into the stratosphere. It’s no surprise, then, that the company is reportedly preparing to go all-out with its next release. Sources tell Fast Company that Apple’s premium 10th anniversary handset, commonly referred to as the iPhone 8 (or perhaps even the iPhone X), will carry a price tag of more than a grand. The additional cost will be necessitated by an all-new 5.8-inch OLED display and upgrades in the memory department, one source claims. Most anticipate the high-end offering will also ditch the traditional Home “button” by integrating the Touch ID fingerprint reader into the display’s glass covering. Even the phone’s physical side buttons could be going away, replaced by touch-sensitive variants, sources say. Speaking of, will we finally see the long-rumored sapphire crystal screen cover or has Apple given up on that idea? Only this larger iPhone is expected to have the OLED display – it is rumored that the smaller 4.7-inch variant and 5.5-incher will use LCD panels. Even still, Apple is reportedly tying up a large portion of the OLED supply chain as it must expect heavy demand. This, Fast Company says, comes at the expense of smaller phone makers. Something else new to expect is forged stainless steel on the sides of the iPhone 8 versus the aluminum currently in use by Apple and others. That’s a cheaper metal and seems like a step back but I digress. Look for Apple to unveil the new iPhone 8 and possible iPhone X this fall.

Cook met the PM at Downing Street on Thursday and referenced the company’s plans to build a new UK headquarters at the redeveloped Battersea Power Station as proof of the company’s support of the UK. “We’re doubling down on a huge headquarters in the Battersea area and we’re leaving significant space there to expand,” Cook said. “We’re a big believer in the UK – we think you’ll be just fine. Yes, there will be bumps in the road along the way but the UK’s going to be fine.” (Matt Dunham/AP/PA) Last year the iPhone maker revealed it would move 1,600 employees to the new campus in south London in 2021. In a statement about the meeting, Apple said: “Tim had a positive meeting with the Prime Minister today, discussing Apple’s continued investment in the United Kingdom. “We are proud that Apple’s innovation and growth now supports nearly 300,000 jobs across the UK.” Delighted to welcome @Tim_Cook to City Hall to discuss access to talent, digital skills & Apple’s investment in London #LondonIsOpen pic.twitter.com/DsSnwiSRfd — Mayor of London (@MayorofLondon) February 9, 2017 Cook also met Mayor of London Sadiq Khan during his time in the capital, with Khan tweeting he was “delighted” to welcome the Apple boss to “discuss talent, digital skills and Apple’s investment in London”. Upon receiving an honorary degree from the University of Glasgow on Wednesday night, Cook also voiced his opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration ban, saying: “If we stand and say nothing it’s as if we’re agreeing”. Apple has been among a host of technology giants who have voiced their concerns over the travel ban, which focuses on those with links to seven predominately Muslim countries. Cook has been chief executive of Apple since 2011, when he succeeded the company’s late founder Steve Jobs. Since then Apple has gone on to break profit and company sales records by introducing the Apple Watch, iPad Pro and several generations of the iPhone. Follow @CorkEveningEcho Comments are closed.

The CEO was at Woodberry Down Community Primary School in Harringay, which is part of the New Wave Federation group of schools that have incorporated Apple’s iPad and related software into lesson plans. (Yui Mok/PA) The school is also a certified Apple Distinguished School, a marker the technology giant reserves for schools “that meet criteria for innovation, leadership, and educational excellence, and demonstrate Apple’s vision of exemplary learning environments”. Students learn basic coding through Apple’s Swift Playgrounds software, while Cook also saw students working with the company’s GarageBand music app as part of their lessons. (Yui Mok/PA) “Technology has moved on considerably,” Cook said. “It gets kids a lot more engaged because they’re living in a digital world. We’re all living in a digital world. “This school has done an unbelievable job of integrating it.” Cook said Apple was thrilled by the introduction of computer coding to the curriculum, suggesting that for future generations it would be a crucial tool for communication. “We think coding should be required in every school because it’s as important as any kind of second language,” he said. (Yui Mok/PA) Pupils at Woodberry Down come from a diverse background, with 29 languages spoken by students from 39 different countries. More than half (57%) of the pupils are considered to be “deprived” – with the number eligible for free school meals well above the national average of 16.5%. The school’s executive headteacher Michelle Thomas, who oversees all three schools in the New Wave Federation, said the introduction of iPads and wider technology into the classroom had helped students in their ability to communicate as well as learn. “In our federation, iPad gives our children ‘the power of choice’,” she said. “We integrate technology into teaching and learning because it empowers children to collaborate, communicate, develop confidence, become a responsible global citizen, be creative and become critical thinkers.” Follow @CorkEveningEcho Comments are closed.

(Reuters/Kim Kyung Hoon) Share Written by Josh Horwitz Obsession Batteries February 10, 2017 An Apple representative traveled to Beijing this week to discuss iPhone battery malfunctions with a consumer watchdog organization affiliated with the government. The meeting, held yesterday, shows that as Beijing ramps up scrutiny of Apple, the tech company continues to try and appease the government. According to a statement (link in Chinese) from the China Consumer Association (CCA), a corporate-level executive arrived at the organization’s office to provide an update on the company’s findings regarding iPhone 6s devices that abruptly shut down at approximately 30% battery life. The group wrote that Apple does not suspect any safety issues resulted from the malfunction, and affirmed that the company would guarantee battery replacements. CCA added that Apple stated it had “progressed” in discovering the origin of the malfunction, though the statement did not mention any definitive origin. Apple did not respond to questions from Quartz about the meeting. The specific problem the CCA referred to is not confined to China—in fact, consumers all over the world have complained about their iPhone 6 and 6s devices mysteriously turning off well before the battery monitor reaches 0%. But the Chinese government has been unusually vocal about the technical glitch. In November, the CCA issued a strongly worded letter to the hardware company demanding it explain the cause of the malfunction within 10 business days. When Apple issued an English-language statement acknowledging the issue, the CCA sent out a second letter saying the company had to take more proactive measures to fix the problem. The company later attributed the glitch to a battery component that was exposed to too much “ambient air” before final assembly, without elaborating further. It added that the problem was confined to a “small number of iPhone 6s devices made in September and October 2015.” All the while, Chinese social media erupted with iPhone owners complaining about faulty devices. It’s not unusual for Chinese regulators or state media outlets to shine the spotlight on foreign companies for alleged wrongdoing. In this case, however, it’s not clear if the CCA’s censure of Apple was motivated by politics or a genuine concern for consumers—after all, the phones indeed were malfunctioning. Either way, government scrutiny towards Apple will likely increase in the coming years, as China attempts to foster its own domestic tech giants at the expense of foreign rivals. Apple has taken a beating over the past year from Beijing, which forced it to cut access to the iTunes movie store, iBooks, and the NYTimes app in China. Meanwhile, the company suffered a major sales slump in China last year—iPhone shipments in the country dropped nearly 25%.
