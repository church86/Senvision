 A $20 billion investment firm dumped its huge trade in Apple ‚Äî and bet on Alphabet and Microsoft Rachael Levy Feb. 14, 2017, 4:02 PM 11,093 facebook linkedin twitter email print Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Getty Images/Stephen Brashear Billionaire Chase Coleman's Tiger Global exited its big Apple bet last quarter while making¬†a $148 million bet on Alphabet and investing¬†$132 million in Microsoft. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the firm made a $1.1 billion bet on Apple, and over the course of 2016 started shedding the shares, regulatory filings show. Tiger dropped $407 million in remaining shares of Apple in the fourth quarter of last year, filings show. According to the 13F, Tiger made the following moves during the fourth quarter: It increased its stake in Priceline by 36%, holding a $1.84 billion stake at the end of the quarter It increased its stake in JD.com by 37%, holding a stake worth $1.16 billion It took a new position in Fiat valued at $481 million It took a new position in Alphabet valued at $147.5 million It took a new position in Microsoft valued at $131.6 million Bloomberg analyzed the data based off of a regulatory filing that the $20 billion investment firm filed February 14. The quarterly filing, called a 13F, lists the long stock positions¬†of investment firms. The positions are current as of 45 days prior, so it is possible that Tiger Global¬†has since changed its positions.¬† Tiger Global Management invests in private and public markets¬†and manages about $20 billion firmwide.¬†The firm managed $5.9 billion in hedge fund assets as of mid-year 2016, according to the Hedge Fund Intelligence Billion Dollar Club ranking.¬† SEE ALSO: A partner at $20 billion investment firm Tiger Global has left NOW WATCH: This behavior could kill your chances in a Goldman Sachs interview Loading video...

 Apple fans and employees are 'ashamed' of Apple's new reality show, 'Planet of the Apps' Kif Leswing Feb. 14, 2017, 12:38 PM 29,230 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple Music Apple¬†is breaking into original TV content, and the trailer for one of its first shows, "Planet of the Apps," was released Monday evening. And by a large margin, Apple fans ‚Äî and even some employees ‚Äî seem to hate it. The concept for the reality-TV show is something like "Shark Tank" meets "The Voice." App developers come up with ideas for apps, choose a celebrity mentor such as Will.i.am or Jessica Alba, and eventually win $10 million in funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners as well as premium placement on the front page of Apple's App Store. "Developers, they're the rock stars of right now," Will.i.am says in the trailer while wearing gold boots. One contestant gives the one-liner, "We're eBay for the Snapchat generation." The show will air exclusively on Apple Music. You can watch the trailer at the bottom of the page. Here's what the Apple world is saying about it: Paul Haddad, the developer of popular iOS apps including Tweetbot: I can‚Äôt wait to see https://t.co/50qeVJsNkW doing code review. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got an unsatisfiable layout constraint, look at my gold shoes!‚Äù ‚Äî Paul Haddad (@tapbot_paul) February 14, 2017 Sam Soffes, who previously developed popular apps including the top Bible app: Got an email from Apple asking me to apply for this. So glad I passed. https://t.co/pOU0QTMMvB ‚Äî Sam Soffes (@soffes) February 14, 2017 Realmac Software founder Dan Counsell: Apple should be producing amazing content like Netflix Originals does. Not this garbage. I am disappointed. ‚Äî Dan Counsell (@dancounsell) February 14, 2017 Renaud Lienhart, the Home app developer at Apple: Today, I am ashamed to work for Apple. This is embarrassing, and not what we work hard for.https://t.co/9O5mjEGElm ‚Äî Renaud Lienhart (@RenaudLienhart) February 14, 2017 Apple blogger and Instapaper founder Marco Arment: I‚Äôm sure Planet of the Apps will be a great show for all of those people who bug developers with their awful ideas. https://t.co/PORl3y4t1Y ‚Äî Marco Arment (@marcoarment) February 14, 2017 Jake Frey, an app designer at Frey Labs: Devs: Hey the App Store has a few problems and its hard to be discovered. Can you take a look? Apple: Uh nope but that would make great TV! https://t.co/IjYAc58XLF ‚Äî Jake Frey (@frey) February 14, 2017 Dermot Daly, the founder of Tapadoo, an iPhone app studio (Daly also wrote a Medium post): ‚ÄúPlanet of the Apps. No. Just No‚Äù. https://t.co/Z67aaLH5xu (Typos, etc on a postcard to me please). ‚Äî Dermot Daly (@dermdaly) February 14, 2017 But some are defending the show, pointing out that perhaps Apple fans and developers are not its target audience. Apple blogger Rene Ritchie: Planet of the Apps: Not intended for ‚Äúus‚Äù but for the mainstream. Or, now ‚Äúwe‚Äù know how cooks have felt about Hell‚Äôs Kitchen for a decade. ‚Äî Rene Ritchie üñá (@reneritchie) February 14, 2017 Watch the full trailer below: ¬† ¬† SEE ALSO: Apple is at an all-time high More: Apple Apple Music Planet of the Apps Marco Arment Rene Ritchie Will.i.am Jessica Alba Lightspeed Ventures Lightspeed Venture Partners facebook linkedin twitter email print √ó Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru Apple fans and employees are 'ashamed' of Apple's new reality show, 'Planet of the Apps' Apple fans and employees are 'ashamed' of Apple's new reality show, 'Planet of the Apps' Apple¬†is breaking into original TV...

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Behance The next iPhone‚Äôs fingerprint sensor could be like nothing you‚Äôve ever seen Chris Smith @chris_writes February 14th, 2017 at 6:21 PM Share Tweet The iPhone might get a display like no other smartphone out there, and it‚Äôs all starting with the iPhone 8. The device is rumored to have an all-screen front-side featuring minimal bezels and no home button. The fingerprint sensor should be embedded in the screen, and there‚Äôs indirect evidence that Apple might also include other front-facing sensors in the display. That‚Äôs something that nobody has pulled off so far, not even the upcoming Galaxy S8. Due in mid-April, the Galaxy S8‚Äôs top bezel is supposed to house various sensors, including the front camera and iris scanner. Even if Apple doesn‚Äôt ditch iPhone bezels completely this year, the iPhone will still have amazing display technology in the not too distant future. The company is looking at ways that would allow it to integrate sensors, fingerprint scanner included, without increasing the display‚Äôs size or energy consumption. Don't Miss: These eyeglasses automatically adjust focus no matter where you look First seen by Apple Insider, USPTO patent no. 9,570,002 was awarded to Apple on Tuesday. Titled Interactive display panel with IR diodes, the document describes technology that would let Apple ship a screen that could scan a person‚Äôs fingerprints without requiring a Touch ID sensor to be placed within or under the screen itself. Image Source: Apple via USPTO The technology ‚Äúuse a micro light emitting diode (LED) in an active matrix display to emit light and a sensing IR diode to sense light.‚Äù That means the screen would display information, but it‚Äôll also react to a person‚Äôs fingerprints. In addition to that, the tech could be used to replace other front-facing sensors, including ambient light sensors and proximity sensors. That would let Apple dispense of other sensors that occupy the front side of the phone, and take up internal space, in favor of a screen that would pack all these features. Image Source: Apple via USPTO Apple‚Äôs new micro LED touchscreens could incorporate a different pixel arrangement than what you‚Äôd used to seeing in a phone. An interactive pixels subpixel arrangement would consist of red, green, blue, IR emitting, and IR sensing LEDs, or RGBIRSIR. The result would be a high-resolution display capable of performing tasks that do not require showing images. The patent describing the technology also suggests that features like scanning a fingerprint might take place even when the screen is off, which would make the iPhone even more energy-efficient. As exciting as it may sound, the patent wasn‚Äôt filed by Apple initially. Instead, it‚Äôs LuxVue the company that studied this particular micro-LED type of displays. Apple bought the company back in 2014, and it looks like its technology will be put to good use. Image Source: Apple via USPTO If you think micro-LED sounds familiar, but you can‚Äôt quite put your finger on it, that‚Äôs because we‚Äôve heard about Apple‚Äôs interest in such screen tech before. In late 2015, reports indicated that Apple is working on micro-LED technology at a secret laboratory in Taiwan. Those reports noted that Apple is looking to create thinner and more energy-efficient products that would feature better, higher-resolution displays. Furthermore, a secondary report suggested that Apple might use these micro-LED displays to create 3D holographic iPhone screens in the future. Apple has patents detailing such screen technology as well.

Computers by Stephen Shankland February 14, 2017 5:00 AM PST @stshank Enlarge Image Apple's Touch Bar-equipped 15-inch MacBook Pro debuted in 2016. Stephen Shankland/CNET It took six weeks of tech support calls, power usage monitoring and Genius Bar diagnostics, but I'm finally convinced my new MacBook Pro isn't an expensive mistake. And what I've learned along the way can help you, too -- regardless of what laptop you're using. I bought a 15-inch Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro sight unseen late last year, confident that performance improvements, Apple's superior trackpads and better portability would justify the upgrade from its 2012-era predecessor. But my pleasure at the speed-up evaporated when I noticed within the first week how fast the machine drained its battery. My heart sank when the revamped Mac design lasted only 3 hours, 7 minutes on battery in my first formal test just doing routine work -- chores in Google's Chrome browser, chiefly, but also a few minutes on power-hungry photo editing. This was not supposed to be what happened when one of the biggest reasons I upgraded was to replace the feeble, worn-out battery in the old machine. I feared my Apple was a lemon. It wasn't just me, though, as evidenced by forum fretting and some cases of customer returns. But with help from Apple techies and a lot of testing, I reached a different conclusion: The MacBook's terrific new screen, which maxes out at a significantly brighter level, was gobbling watts despite a more energy-efficient design. There are other factors, but dialing down the brightness helped me once again work all day on a single charge. For full details, check CNET's tips on how to get your MacBook Pro battery to last all day. Overall, I'm satisfied. Still, the experience made it clear that even top tech companies like Apple, Google and Adobe Systems still have lots of work to do delivering products that minimize power consumption. And it's disappointing how often power-saving techniques mean micromanaging your machine or doing without useful features. A decade after the iPhone launch, it's time to assume your customers will be unplugged from the power socket more often than not. Hopes dashed Apple boasts of battery life "up to 10 hours" on two tests -- "wireless web" and "iTunes movie playback." When my Mac fell far short, I started investigating. Apple's Activity Monitor utility initially showed disappointing battery-life scores. Screenshot by Stephen Shankland/CNET I was not encouraged by posts like the explanation from developer Jeff Geerling on why he returned his MacBook Pro or the dozens of pages of commentary on Apple's support site. I spoke to others, too. Duarte Cunha Rosa, a lawyer in Portugal, was distressed when his new 13-inch MacBook Pro wouldn't last more than 5 hours, and Apple tech support couldn't help. "When asked if I wanted to return it, I did," he said, pulling his 6-year-old Mac back into service. "I'm seriously blanking on what my next move is." I ran daily tests for weeks to try to understand what was happening. They weren't the most rigorous, since my daily work habits fluctuate, but most days I use the same thing: one or two dozen browser tabs for Google Docs, Gmail, Google Calendar, Twitter, Facebook, blog posts and other information sources; Slack for work chitchat; and Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop for short bursts of photo editing. Apple's Safari browser fared a little better than Chrome, which did better than Brave, which did better than Firefox, but none did well. I edit lots of photos outside work, which is why I bought such an expensive machine in the first place, but Lightroom lasted only three hours on the battery. Things were bad enough that I started carrying a Microsoft Surface Book when I knew I'd be working out of the office. It's slower at photo editing than the Mac, but it lasted all day on battery. The MacOS 10.12.3 update that fixed Consumer Reports' complaint didn't help. But Apple did. My initial interactions with Apple, including hours on the phone with tech support and two trips to stores to get my hardware evaluated, yielded only comic relief: One Apple-authorized repair store asked if I had a USB-C dongle so it could run a test, and Apple's own Genius Bar had to hook two dongles together to connect my Mac to their network cable. Eventually, though, we got to the heart of the problem. Hopes restored Screen brightness turned out to be the biggest factor in getting my battery back -- much more than I'd expected. The new 2016 MacBook Pro screen is 67 percent brighter than its predecessor's, and I'd been running it bright. Sure enough, dialing it down made a world of difference. I get 10 hours most days at a brightness setting of 8 to 10 out of 16. When using Safari and an uncomfortably dim setting of 5 or 6, I got 12 hours. The 2016 MacBook Pro Touch Bar lets you dim the laptop's screen to save power. James Martin/CNET Screen dimming isn't a new idea. But it may make more of a difference here. Although the new MacBook Pro's screen is 30 percent more efficient, it can run brighter, and the new model has a smaller 76 watt-hour battery, compared with 99.5 watt-hours on the 2015 model and 95 watt-hours for my 2012 predecessor. I learned more from Apple -- like avoiding USB devices when possible. For me, the guilty parties were my Ethernet dongle, memory card reader and external hard drives -- even though the drives had their own power supplies. The problem is that any of these devices wake up the parts of the computer's communication system that otherwise snooze in a low-power state. Stick with Wi-Fi when you can. Also on the list is the keyboard backlight -- dim it or shut it off -- and dongles with built-in chips, for example to convert video signals to HDMI. They might not consume much, but it all adds up. After all, the glowing Apple logo on earlier Mac laptop lids didn't consume much power either, but efficiency is one one reason Apple scrapped it. Also, when possible, avoid software that uses the separate but more power-hungry high-performance graphics chip that's now standard in 15-inch MacBook Pros. Adobe's Lightroom, Photoshop and Acrobat each demand this high-performance GPU (I monitored with the handy gfxCardStatus utility) even when they're idling in the background, and non-Safari browsers are more likely to fire it up. Some sites, like Google Maps, keep it on and leave it on, while others only flip it on for a few seconds. So close browser tabs and software you're not using. Apple doesn't let Safari use the high-performance GPU, a battery-saving restriction. That can cause problems with graphics-intense sites -- a rougher time moving around in Google Maps' 3D view, for example, or slower frame rates on the ShaderToy site. But it's easy to see why Apple made the decision it did. Chrome is working to deliver the best of both worlds, with updates to be gentler on the GPU, for example by using the lower-power GPU more often and switching tabs to it when they're in the background. Reducing power usage is a "top priority for Chrome in 2017," said Chrome product manager Rachel Popkin. "We have a bunch of people working on it." And Adobe expects improvements that will optimize how its software uses graphics chips to improve battery life on Macs, the company said. That's great news. For me, the improvements can't come soon enough. Because I may be happier than a month ago, but I'm still not leaving my laptop charger at home. Does the Mac still matter? Apple execs tell why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care. It's Complicated: This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet?

Berkshire Hathaway is, of course, the holding company operated by investor Warren Buffet that has been skeptical of AAPL in the past. According to the SEC filing, first noted by Reuters, Berkshire Hathaway increased its holdings in AAPL from 15.2 million shares to 57.4 million shares during the fourth quarter of 2016. This additional purchased¬†raised the value of Berkshire‚Äôs stake in Apple from around $1.7 billion to $6.64 billion in December. Now, with AAPL trading near the $135 mark at the close of business today, Berkshire‚Äôs AAPL stock is worth some $7.74 billion if it still holds the stock. In addition to the increase in AAPL holdings, Berkshire Hathaway also cut its stake in Verizon significantly, down from 15 million shares to 928 shares. Berkshire also cut its Walmart holdings by 89.3 percent, dissolved its share stake in Now Inc, and increased its holdings of Delta Air Lines to 60 million shares from 6.3 million. Buffet‚Äôs continued increase in AAPL stock is notable as prior to last May, Berkshire held few AAPL shares. Last May, the conglomerate purchased around 9.8 million shares in the company, worth a total of $1.069 billion at the time of purchase. Buffet has been a skeptic of AAPL for¬†a while, explaining in 2011¬†that, in terms of AAPL shares, Berkshire¬†‚Äúheld very few in the past and we‚Äôre likely to hold very few in the future‚Äù due to how difficult it was to predict Appel‚Äôs long-term prospects. Nevertheless, Buffet seems to have move past that thinking if recent investments are any indication. Earlier today, AAPL hit a new all-time high stock price of $134.67, which continued to climb. Yesterday, we noted that the stock opened at all-time record high of $133 thanks to Goldman Sachs raising its¬†target price. News of Berkshire‚Äôs increase will likely continue to push the stock up.

And buybacks? They help too. [Photo: Flickr user Adnan Ghosheh] More from The Sensor Revolution Apple Reports A Record Holiday Quarter On Surprisingly Strong iPhone Sales Apple Earnings Preview: Will iPhone Sales Finally Return To Growth? We're All Being Recorded. Who Reaps The Rewards? Mark Sullivan 02.14.17 6:15 PM What a difference a few months make. After hitting a low point in May of last year, Apple‚Äôs stock has rallied back 47%, and it just hit an all-time high today. Shares catapulted past $134.54 a few hours ago, beating a previous high in April 2015. So what's going on? Part of the answer lies in the fact that Apple has been buying back stock‚Äî6% of the total since September 2015, as CNBC's Eric Chemi pointed out. So there are simply fewer (read: more sought-after) shares on the market today. But there's more to it than that. The real answers likely have more to do with Apple's future than its past. If anything, the company's fundamentals have gotten worse since 2015, and yet it‚Äôs not hard to find analysts saying that Apple stock is still a good buy. Some expect the price to keep moving up this year, perhaps into the $160 range. Tim Cook and company have been saying that Apple has "exciting products" in the pipeline, but today's confidence in Apple probably has little to do with such vague assurances. Rather, investors are feeling good about Apple‚Äôs bread and butter‚Äîthe iPhone‚Äîand possibly its growing "services" business, which includes Apple Music, cloud services, and the App Store. Investors want to believe that Apple can inject a big shot of innovation and inspiration into the forthcoming iPhone 8. As news of the device has begun to trickle out, the belief has grown that Apple will deliver. This year is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and Apple is expected to reimagine the device in a big way. Meanwhile, Apple‚Äôs services business is gaining steam. Apple has a billion iOS devices in the wild, and each of them is a vending machine for Apple services, like music, video, apps, and cloud service. The services business brought in $7.2 billion in revenue in last year's December-ending quarter. That represents a growth of 18% from the same quarter the year before. Cook said the services business contributed $20 billion in revenues in 2016, and Apple is trying to double its services business in the next four years. It's worth noting that in order to reach $48 billion in services revenues, some believe Apple will have to make an acquisition, possibly of a content company. Disney has been floated as a possibility, but so far Apple hasn‚Äôt tipped its hand. This year is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and Apple is expected to reimagine the device in a big way. Returning To Form Back in 2014, the iPhone 6 was a huge hit for Apple because of its new larger screen sizes and new design. That device ushered in a new era in Apple‚Äôs history. Phone sales surged, and so did Apple's market cap. The iPhone still contributes roughly two-thirds of Apple's revenues. But after the iPhone 6, investors saw a series of new phones that were variations on the same theme. The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, and the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7s Plus, upgraded the iPhone 6‚Äôs core components, but they also came in the same sizes, and used the same design and materials. In general, iPhone sales have tapered off since the iPhone 6. (There was a $400 iPhone 5 revival in there somewhere, too.) Investors are clearly hopeful that the iPhone 8 will reverse this trend, but of course the vibrancy of Apple's iPhone business is closely connected to the success of its services business. In order for Apple to sell more services, the number of iOS users must keep growing. And that depends on Apple continuing to wow tech buyers with inspiring devices‚Äîmainly iPhones. The Street is feeling good about this one-two punch of devices and services right now. The storyline will continue until the release of the 10th anniversary phone this September. Barring any unforeseen disasters (like a 35% tariff levied on iPhones built in China), it‚Äôs easy to imagine Apple‚Äôs stock continuing to gain steam at least until then. Never miss a story.

Now the popular messaging app is branching out by i ntroducing video chat ‚Äîthough there are questions about whether the new method of connecting is as secure as the rest of the app. The video capabilities of Signal will makes use of CallKit, an application program interface (API) introduced by Apple in iOS 10 that aims to standardize communications on the operating system. It provides an app like Signal conveniences like allowing calls to be answered from the lock screen and listing calls in a user‚Äôs ‚Äúrecent calls‚Äù list. However in introducing the feature through Apple‚Äôs API, Signal has opened up new questions about the security of communications on its platform. The encryption of text and voice conversations through Signal is generally considered to be airtight‚Äîthe Signal Protocol from app creator Open Whisper Systems is endorsed by whistleblower Edward Snowden and is used by Facebook-owned WhatsApp. By using CallKit, video conversations are not necessarily as secure. Open Whisper Systems is reportedly still assessing CallKit to make sure it‚Äôs not putting any user data at risk, but the feature from Apple may collect more information than users of Signal are used to or comfortable with. CallKit may sync some user data to iCloud, Apple‚Äôs cloud-based storage system, including details like who a user was talking to and how long they spoke for. For some users this may be too much data to surrender to a third-party source like Apple. How To Make Video Calls On Signal For now, video calling and CallKit support are entirely optional in Signal. Users will have to opt in to the features to make use of them. To do so, users should fire up Signal and head to the settings menu by tapping the gear shape in the upper lefthand corner of the app. From there, tap the Advanced menu. This will display a number of options that can be turned on and off, including video calling. Related Stories WhatsApp Reportedly Has Security Backdoor, But There‚Äôs Nothing To Fear Popular Encrypted Messaging App Telegram Was Cracked By Russia According To Trump Dossier Turn on the option labeled Enable Video Calling. This will make it possible for users to have encrypted video conversations with other users who have turned on the feature. CallKit will also be active for users on devices running iOS 10. An option to enable or disable this feature will also be made available, and users who don‚Äôt wish to risk the chance of sending user information to iCloud should choose not to enable it. CallKit won‚Äôt function unless both users on a call have it enabled so even if you‚Äôre chatting with someone who uses CallKit, your information won‚Äôt be stored. Users may wish to disable iCloud backups to make sure their information isn‚Äôt stored on Apple‚Äôs servers. To do so, open the iOS Settings app, go to the General menu, and select Storage and iCloud Usage. From here, tap the Manage Storage option under the iCloud header, then check the device that Signal is installed on under Backups. This will display all apps that are backed up on iCloud. Find Signal and disable the backup. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Batman's computer works in much the same way as Siri, responding to his voice requests whenever he says "Hey 'puter." As it turns out, there's a secret tie-in hidden in the iPhone, too. Whenever you say "Hey 'puter" (or "Hey Computer") to Siri, she responds to you as if you're LEGO Batman. "I am at your service, Lego Batman sir," and "Welcome home, sir. I have your rom coms queued up, sorted by decade," are just two of the multiple humorous phrases Siri shares whenever the personal assistant hears "Hey 'puter." Apple updates Siri on a regular basis, and this isn't the first time the personal assistant has gained humorous responses ahead of an upcoming event, but it may be the first serious movie tie-in. Siri was previously updated in August 2016 to offer funny responses to questions about Pok√©mon Go, and again in September to respond to questions ahead of the iPhone 7's debut. In addition to the Siri easter egg, there's also a free iOS app that accompanies The LEGO Batman Movie, which was released back in January.

The patent, published today by the US Patent and Trademark office, details an ‚Äúinteractive display with IR diodes.‚Äù This would allow Apple devices to read fingerprints directly through the screen, instead of by relying on a dedicated fingerprint reader built into the home button. Apple hasn‚Äôt said if the next iPhone will feature this tech Originally filed by micro-LED display company LuxVue in 2014, the patent was reassigned in April after Apple acquired the company, according to AppleInsider. The patent says, ‚ÄúExemplary methods and systems use a micro light emitting diode (LED) in an active matrix display to emit light and a sensing IR diode to sense light,‚Äù with the sensing IR diode detecting and reading fingerprints. This design differs from the active display matrix and interactive screen hardware often found on other mobile devices, which ‚Äúrequire two separate devices to be layered together,‚Äù according to the patent. As AppleInsider reports, Apple may be looking to ‚Äúditch Touch ID altogether as it moves to a new, more advanced system,‚Äù because ‚Äúa touchscreen capable of acting as an input device and fingerprint scanner would save space and grant greater design flexibility.‚Äù Patented tech would change design of iPhone Rumors regarding TouchID and the iPhone 8, sometimes referred to as the iPhone X (for 10th anniversary), have been circulating for quite a while, but Apple has yet to shed any light on what the device will contain, let alone if we‚Äôll see any of this patented tech surface. Apple, however, is not alone in devising new fingerprint readers. Synoptics has also been breaking ground with a new optical fingerprint sensor and fingerprint readers with built in facial recognition.

Monsanto and Sirius shares rose after the disclosure.Though Buffett has long advocated investing for the long-haul, the plunge into Apple appears particularly well-timed. Shares of Apple closed on Tuesday up $1.73 at $135.02, a record closing high. Assuming Berkshire has not sold Apple, the iPhone maker's 16.6 percent gain this year would leave Berkshire with a $1.1 billion paper profit in 2017 alone.Berkshire also revealed a more than $9.3 billion year-end bet on airlines, up from $1.3 billion three months earlier, with stakes topping more than $2 billion in each of American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N).The investment suggests that Buffett has overcome his nearly two-decade aversion to the sector, following an unhappy - though, he has said, profitable - investment in US Air Group. Buffett told talk show host Charlie Rose in an interview last month that it was "in large part" his decision to dive back into airlines.Tuesday's filing appears to reflect much of the $12 billion of stock that Buffett said he had bought between the Nov. 8 Presidential election and the end of January, helping whittle down Berkshire's reported $84.8 billion cash stake. It is unclear how much of the overall buying was conducted by Buffett, or by his deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.Larger Berkshire investments are normally Buffett's, but the 86-year-old billionaire has given Combs and Weschler more money to invest over the years. They are the leading candidates to eventually succeed him as Berkshire's chief investment officer.

Golder Achievement Leadership Award. Courtesy of Crystal Lake Elementary District 47 ¬† Madhu Krishnamurthy Follow @dh_madhuk ¬† ¬† Principals from Bartlett and Crystal Lake are among 10 finalists for the Golden Apple Foundation's Stanley C. Golder Achievement Leadership Award. Mike Demovsky, principal of Bartlett High School, and Jeffry D. Prickett, principal of Richard Bernotas Middle School in Crystal Lake, will be honored March 4 during the 2017 Golden Apple Celebration of Excellence in Teaching and Leadership event in Rosemont. Demovsky, an Elgin Area School District U-46 educator for 18 years, leads 230 staff members and nearly 2,500 students. He began his career as a Spanish teacher, served as principal of Kenyon Woods Middle School in South Elgin for four years and assistant principal at Streamwood High School for two years, and then took the helm at Bartlett this school year. "A principal can effect change with every student in the building and change the lives of teachers and the community," Demovsky said. "Being back at Bartlett means everything as I get to give back to the community that raised me as a teacher. It's an honor to be nominated for this award." At Kenyon Woods, Demovsky oversaw implementation of the Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports program, for which the school was recognized nationally in 2014. He also has led multiple philanthropic campaigns, raising more than $100,000 for students and community members in need. To watch a tribute to Demovsky, visit the district's YouTube page. Prickett joined Crystal Lake Elementary District 47 in 2014 as Bernotas' principal. He previously served as principal for a Round Lake elementary and middle school, and an assistant principal in McHenry. During the 2015-16 school year, he was named Kishwaukee region's Middle School Principal of the Year by the Illinois Principals Association. This year, Prickett has represented the association by leading talks statewide on restorative justice. He recently completed his doctoral degree in educational leadership from National Louis University and serves on the board at the National Alliance for Mental Illness McHenry County. "I am extremely humbled by the nomination for this prestigious award," he said. "We go through our days making decisions about the future of our students' lives, about the ways in which they will spend their days with us, about what they will learn and how. But the most important thing that we do -- the one thing that really matters -- is creating relationships with the people with whom we spend our time." The award winner will receive $10,000, with $5,000 going toward the administrator's professional development and $5,000 to the school for a project of the recipient's choosing. Golden Apple also will recognize 34 teacher finalists, including 12 suburban teachers, at 10 a.m. March 4 at the Hilton in Rosemont. For details, visit goldenapple.org/celebration. Award recipients also will be honored at the Golden Apple Awards gala May 20, which will be live-streamed and taped for later production by WTTW Channel 11.

All the rumors suggest the iPhone 8 will be a very different smartphone to the iPhone 7 and what has come before. We're already expecting a handset encased in glass, and with that the integration of wireless charging. Now it seems as though, yet again, Samsung will be an integral part of delivering the next iPhone thanks to a huge order for OLED panels. According to The Korean Herald, last year Apple ordered 100 million OLED panels from Samsung Display for use in the iPhone 8. However, it is now thought that order has been increased to 160 million, which is worth an additional $4.3 billion to Samsung. Related Rumor: iPhone 8 to Feature Laser-Powered Facial Recognition Rumor: iPhone 8 to Feature Laser-Powered Facial Recognition Although iPhone sales dipped in 2016, they still remained above 200 million a year. If this Samsung order is to be believed, the Korean company will be relied upon for the bulk of the panels used in the iPhone 8. As to why Apple decided to increase the order, it could be down to a supply issue. Apple likes to source components from a number of companies for its products. That way risk is lowered if one of those suppliers experiences a supply issue. In this case, it could be that one of the companies Apple selected to supply OLED panels isn't viable and Samsung agreed to pick up the slack. Either that, or Apple reviewed its sales forecast for the iPhone 8 and decided it needed to make more of them. As for who will handle the rest of Apple's OLED panel orders, LG is thought to be the other main supplier. Samsung used OLED panels in many of its smartphones and can therefore be relied upon to produce them in large quantities and to the standards Apple requires. This also demonstrates Samsung's production capacity, which must cope with its own needs as well as this massive new order from Apple.

Sarah Tew/CNET Phones by Gordon Gottsegen February 14, 2017 12:50 PM PST @ggottsegen Apple is rumored to be releasing three new iPhones this year, the premium 10-year anniversary iPhone 8, and the more modestly upgraded iPhone 7S and 7S Plus. One big difference between the 8 and 7S models may be the phone's body. Industry sources say that the iPhone 8 may get the new glass and steel chassis that have been rumored, while the iPhone 7S may stick to an aluminum alloy chassis, reports DigiTimes. Some renderings have imagined what a glass and steel iPhone 8 would look like. Imran Taylor The iPhone 8 has been said to see big changes like curved OLED screens and an iris scanner and other "wow" features that will set the device apart. But it's also been reported that Apple will be following the usual "S" upgrade that comes every other year by releasing minor upgrades to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models. By releasing three phones, Apple could flood the market with their iPhone devices and also upsell longtime fans to buy the iPhone 8, which is rumored to cost over $1,000 in the US (converting roughly ¬£800 in the UK or AU$1,300 in Australia) partially thanks to its expensive OLED screen. That would put it in a position to battle Samsung's rumored (and hopefully nonexploding) Note 8, which is often comes in mid-to-late August. Apple could release the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus as cheaper flagship models. The chassis' build materials would be one way to differentiate the models. The three iPhone devices are said to come in 4.7-inch, 5.5-inch, and 5.8-inch sizes, according to the report. The 5.8-inch iPhone 8 is believed to get an all-new glass and steel body design, as DigiTimes reported earlier. The 4.7-inch 7S is reported to have an aluminum alloy body, similar to what was used for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 6S. The 5.5-inch iPhone 7S Plus has yet to be confirmed by DigiTimes' sources. Although a glass and steel body iPhone isn't as revolutionary as curved OLED screens -- the iPhone 4 was made out of glass and steel, too, remember -- it does pave the way for some more interesting features like wireless charging. We're still far away from the usual iPhone announcement season (September), though rumors are furiously flying. Stay tuned to CNET for all the upcoming iPhone 8 rumors here. Apple did not immediately respond to CNET's request for comment. Evidence emerges that iPhone 8 could charge wirelessly Apple reignites rumors of wireless charging capabilities in its next iPhone after joining the Wireless Power Consortium. by Vanessa Hand Orellana 1:18 Close Drag Tech Culture: From film and television to social media and games, here's your place for the lighter side of tech.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton 1/2 left right Berkshire Hathaway shareholders walk by a video screen at the company's annual meeting in Omaha May 4, 2013. REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo 2/2 By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK NEW YORK Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) was an aggressive buyer of stocks in last year's fourth quarter, nearly quadrupling its stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and increasing its stake sevenfold in the four biggest U.S. airlines. In a regulatory filing, Berkshire reported owning 57.4 million shares of Apple as of Dec. 31, which would now be worth $7.74 billion, up from just from 15.2 million shares in the iPhone maker three months earlier. Berkshire also reported a $9.3 billion airline stake, with investments topping $2.1 billion in each of American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N). It also disclosed new stakes in satellite radio company Sirius XM Holdings Inc (SIRI.O) and seed company Monsanto Co (MON.N), which is being bought by Germany's Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE). Though it is unclear who make which investments, the filing appears to reflect much of the $12 billion of stock that Buffett said he had bought between the Nov. 8 Presidential election and the end of January. Larger Berkshire investments such as Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) are normally Buffett's, but the 86-year-old billionaire has given his deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler more to invest over the years. Berkshire's initial investment in Apple got attention last year, given Buffett's usual aversion to technology companies - apart from IBM - which he considers outside his zone of competence. The new, larger stake makes Berkshire one of Apple's 10 biggest investors. "I'm stunned to see the size of that Apple position," said Thomas Russo, who oversees $11 billion of assets, including 12 percent in Berkshire, at Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Berkshire did not respond to a request for comment. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns roughly 90 companies such as the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream. Its Class A shares closed on Tuesday up $2,078.95 at $250,419, a record high closing price and less than 0.2 percentage points below its all-time high on Dec. 14. APPLE BECOMES CORE HOLDING The plunge into Apple appears particularly well-timed. Shares of Apple closed on Tuesday up $1.73 at $135.02, also a record closing high. Assuming Berkshire has not sold its stake, Apple's 16.6 percent gain this year would leave it with a $1.1 billion paper profit in 2017 alone. It had been widely believed that Berkshire's initial investment came from Combs or Weschler. But their decisions have sometimes influenced Buffett, as when Berkshire last year paid $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, once a Combs investment. "It's quite possible that Warren woke up and began to understand the virtues of Apple that he had been neglecting or, like with Precision Castparts, Todd or Ted had an affinity for Apple that sparked interest from Warren," Russo said. Combs and Weschler are the leading candidates to eventually succeed Buffett as Berkshire's chief investment officer. The airline investments, meanwhile, suggest that Buffett has overcome his two-decade aversion to the sector after an unhappy - though, he has said, profitable - investment in US Air Group. Buffett told talk show host Charlie Rose in an interview last month that it was "in large part" his decision to dive back into airlines. "The industry was once balkanized, but now it is bulking up, and has come to realize that an empty seat is a perishable asset," Russo said. "More planes are traveling more full." Shares of American, Delta, Southwest and United, as well as Apple, Monsanto and Sirius, rose in after-hours trading. Such increases often occur when investors perceive that Berkshire has given a company its imprimatur. Monsanto and Sirius did not immediately respond to requests for comment. To make room for new investments, Berkshire appeared to have shed a $1.8 billion stake in agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co (DE.N) and nearly all of what remained from a more than decade-old stake in retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).

NEW YORK¬†‚Äî¬†Reuters Published Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2017 4:35PM EST Last updated Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017 5:20AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway Inc was an aggressive buyer of stocks in last year‚Äôs fourth quarter, nearly quadrupling its stake in Apple Inc and reporting significantly larger holdings in the four biggest U.S. airlines. In a regulatory filing, Berkshire said it boosted its stake in Apple as of Dec. 31 to about 57.4 million shares worth roughly $6.64 billion, from just 15.2 million shares three months earlier. Berkshire also disclosed new stakes in seed company Monsanto Co, which is being bought by Germany‚Äôs Bayer AG , and satellite radio company Sirius XM Holdings Inc . Monsanto and Sirius shares rose after the disclosure. Though Buffett has long advocated investing for the long-haul, the plunge into Apple appears particularly well-timed. Shares of Apple closed on Tuesday up $1.73 at $135.02, a record closing high. Assuming Berkshire has not sold Apple, the iPhone maker‚Äôs 16.6 percent gain this year would leave Berkshire with a $1.1 billion paper profit in 2017 alone. Berkshire also revealed a more than $9.3 billion year-end bet on airlines, up from $1.3 billion three months earlier, with stakes topping more than $2 billion in each of American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc. The investment suggests that Buffett has overcome his nearly two-decade aversion to the sector, following an unhappy - though, he has said, profitable - investment in US Air Group. Buffett told talk show host Charlie Rose in an interview last month that it was ‚Äúin large part‚Äù his decision to dive back into airlines. Tuesday‚Äôs filing appears to reflect much of the $12 billion of stock that Buffett said he had bought between the Nov. 8 Presidential election and the end of January, helping whittle down Berkshire‚Äôs reported $84.8 billion cash stake. It is unclear how much of the overall buying was conducted by Buffett, or by his deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Larger Berkshire investments are normally Buffett‚Äôs, but the 86-year-old billionaire has given Combs and Weschler more money to invest over the years. They are the leading candidates to eventually succeed him as Berkshire‚Äôs chief investment officer.

The GarageBand 10.1.6 update is being pushed out to all Macs running OS¬†X Yosemite and later. Because GarageBand is installed by default on OS¬†X systems, all Mac owners should install the patch, but those who regularly use the music composing software should pay particular attention. The lone flaw addressed in the update, CVE-2017-2374, allows an attack to remotely execute simply by running a malformed .band file. Apple uses the .band format for all GarageBand project files. In theory, a crook could exploit the bug by convincing the user to run the specially crafted .band file that would target the bug. CVE-2017-2374 was one of two GarageBand flaws discovered by Cisco Talos researcher Tyler Bohan. Apple addressed the other vulnerability, CVE-2017-2372, with an earlier update. "This particular vulnerability is the result of the way the application parses the proprietary file format used for GarageBand files, .band," explains Talos. "The format is broken into chunks with a specific length field for each. This length is controlled by the user and can be leveraged to expose an exploitable condition." Neither Apple nor Talos reported any attacks on the vulnerability in the wild. Apple users should already be looking to update their Macs today, thanks to this morning's monthly patch release by Adobe for Flash Player on OS¬†X. That update addresses a total of 13 security holes in the internet's screen door, all of which can be exploited for remote code execution. ¬Æ Tips and corrections 8 Comments More from The Register US Congress asks FCC to snuff out Google's TV landgrab It's dead already, Congresscritters argue 16 Comments DirecTV Now to give Apple TV free for those who take 3-month deal Gee, thanks.

This move testifies to Apple's rumoured plans of introducing wireless charging with the iPhone 8 - a feature that has been rumoured several times in the past. Business Insider reports that Apple joined WPC last week, becoming a part of the 213 member group. WPC develops the Qi wireless charging standard that is adopted by many OEMs - seen on gadgets like the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge smartphones last year. "Apple is an active member of many standards development organisations, as both a leader and contributor. Apple is joining the Wireless Power Consortium to be able to participate and contribute ideas to the open, collaborative development of future wireless charging standards. We look forward to working together with the WPC and its members," the company said in a statement, Apple confirmed. Apple could not hold off introducing wireless charging tech for its iPhone models any longer, with its competitors long having adopted the tech in their smartphones. It looks to adopt wireless charging in all three iPhone models releasing this year. Past reports state that it could adopt long-range wireless charging which is more advanced than the current offerings in the market. The new wireless charging feature is tipped to let the upcoming iPhone models get charged from a distance of about 15 feet which means that users won't need to place the iPhone on a wireless charging plate, like we've seen with wireless charging technology so far. However, a recent report tips Apple will stick with regular inductive wireless charging, and joining the WPC is another hint. Other recent reports state that the rumours about the long-range wireless charging powered by Energous could be slightly overrated. Apple will introduce wireless charging, but in the same manner as its competitors, with a charging plate serving the purpose. The wireless adapter will be of the same design structure as the inductive pad used for charging the Apple Watch currently. Also, the company won't bundle the plate along with the smartphone, but will sell it as an optional accessory separately. Whatever the case may be, this is the largest hint from Apple about the adoption of wireless charging on the iPhone 8 (and the other two models) this year. The iPhone 8 is tipped to sport a large battery, a wraparound OLED display, no Home Button, and an improved 3D Tech feature.

Berkshire‚Äôs investments in American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Continental Holdings Inc. climbed to more than $2 billion each, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday from Buffett‚Äôs Omaha, Nebraska-based company. It also disclosed a stake in Southwest Airlines Co. valued at about $2.2 billion as of Dec. 31. Taken together, the holdings represent one of the largest common stock investments for Buffett‚Äôs company in years. Berkshire first disclosed that it had invested in airlines in November, which came as a surprise to some, because the billionaire previously criticized the business. ‚ÄúThere has been massive consolidation in that industry," said Tony Scherrer, director of research at Smead Capital Management, which oversees about $2.1 billion including Berkshire shares. Buffett likes investing in businesses that have a durable competitive advantage, Scherrer said, and ‚Äúit seems like airlines now offer that.‚Äù American climbed 2.5 percent in extended trading at 6:04 p.m. in New York, while Delta rose 1.8 percent. United advanced 1.6 percent, while Southwest increased 1.3 percent. Apple shares were little changed. Parker‚Äôs Presentation Berkshire‚Äôs airline purchases were influenced, in part, by a presentation from American Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker, according to people familiar with the matter¬†who asked not to be identified discussing Berkshire‚Äôs strategy. Buffett said in November that Berkshire added Southwest shares after Sept. 30, without specifying how many. Tuesday‚Äôs filing also showed that Berkshire more than tripled its Apple holding to about 57 million shares. The stake is now valued at more than $7 billion, making Berkshire among the top 10 holders of the Cupertino, California-based company. The Monsanto stake was about 8 million shares and valued at more than $800 million. Bayer AG struck a $66 billion deal last year to take over the seed maker. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm assuming he sees the same thing we do, which is that there‚Äôs a good likelihood the deal with Bayer will go through,‚Äù Chris Shaw, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. in New York, said by phone. Cash Hoard Buffett, 86, said last month that he‚Äôd been accelerating stock purchases at Berkshire, which he‚Äôs run for more than five decades. On Sept. 30, the company‚Äôs cash hoard hit a record $84.8 billion. It had been climbing in recent quarters because of profit from Berkshire‚Äôs dozens of subsidiaries and the redemption of securities that Buffett bought to fund deals.

A year later, the billionaire hired another money manager, Ted Weschler. The filing doesn‚Äôt show which person is responsible for each investment. In general, the deputies tend to make smaller investments than their boss. Buffett declined to discuss the rationale for the airline investments during an interview with Charlie Rose on Jan. 27, but he did say that the decision to buy was ‚Äúin large part‚Äù his. Wal-Mart, Deere The billionaire further reduced his holding in Wal-Mart Stores Inc., cutting it to less than 2 million shares as of Dec. 31. That compares with more than 60 million in 2014. Buffett has said online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. present an increasing threat to the big-box retailer. Berkshire exited stakes in Kinder Morgan Inc., NOW Inc. and Deere & Co. A rout in crop prices has left some farmers too cash-strapped to buy new tractors from the company. Deere slipped 0.7 percent in extended trading. Berkshire also reported owning about 167 million shares of Sirius XM Holdings Inc., valued at about $740 million at the end of 2016. The satellite radio provider is controlled by billionaire John Malone. Shares of Sirius jumped about 3 percent in extended trading, while climbed 1 percent. Even as Berkshire‚Äôs stock picks are closely watched by investors, they‚Äôve become less important to the company‚Äôs overall performance. During the past two decades, Buffett has focused more on acquisitions than picking stocks. Berkshire‚Äôs dozens of subsidiaries include auto insurer Geico, Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom and railroad BNSF. Early last year, Buffett completed one of his biggest acquisitions, the $37 billion buyout of Precision Castparts Corp., a supplier to the aerospace industry.

The recent investment that Warren Buffett's holding company Berkshire Hathaway made in Apple has paid off to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars in value. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ‚ñ≤ 135.51 +0.49 +0.36% Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRK.B ‚ñ≤ 167.28 +0.33 +0.20% Shares of Apple have reached a record high, nearing $135 in afternoon trading Tuesday. The company has been on a tear since announcing better-than-expected quarterly earnings on January 31; its stock price has shot up more than 10% in the last two weeks. In August, Berkshire disclosed it held 15.22 million shares of Apple, which amounted to around a $1.6 billion stake at the time. Given Apple's recent surge, the stake is worth about $2.04 billion, a gain of roughly $400 million. Berkshire, which has traditionally avoided technology stocks, started to amass a holding in Apple in the first quarter of 2016, when it bought just over 9.8 million shares. Berkshire then added 5.4 million more to its portfolio in the second quarter. At that time, taking on a bigger stake in Apple seemed like a potential misstep: The company's stock had been swooning amid three straight quarters of profit and revenue declines due to decreases in iPhone sales. Shares dropped to $90.25 in the middle of May, which caused big-name investors like George Soros and David Einhorn to sell off some or all of their holdings. But with the benefit of hindsight, it seems that Buffett - who has credited two of his deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, with selling him on Apple - saw a good deal and took advantage. Apple's stock rebounded within a couple months, once again surpassing the $100 mark in late July, and has been off to the races ever since. Buffett, who is one of the richest men in the world and worth $74.3 billion, according to Forbes, traditionally has an investing strategy centered on stable companies that sell consumer staples and will be around for many years. Berkshire's A-class stock has a gargantuan valuation, coming in at $249,150 per share. The fact that Buffett is betting on Apple is most likely a good sign for the iPhone maker, not that it needs the help. Apple is a behemoth in the stock market, with a market cap of around $700 billion. That makes it the most valuable company listed, more than $120 billion ahead of the second-place company, Google parent Alphabet.

It worked for Amazon Prime. By Emily Bary Feb. 14, 2017 3:21 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple is moving forward, albeit slowly, with plans for its own original TV content. Photo: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg As Apple makes plans to create its own content, don‚Äôt expect a big splash from the country‚Äôs largest company. Apple is starting small. At a Recode event Monday night, the company shared details about two upcoming series that will be available to Apple Music subscribers in the spring. They‚Äôre not exactly the kinds of programming you‚Äôre seeing from other tech companies, and Apple probably isn‚Äôt spending as much money as its rivals. More from Barron‚Äôs Next A T-Mobile Merger with Sprint Could End Wireless Brawl When to Buy Airline Tickets to Get The Cheapest Fare Expedia Has a Google Problem Why You Want to Own Tesla Now The first, called ‚ÄúPlanet of the Apps,‚Äù comes off as a parody of both modern TV and Apple fandom. On the show, app developers compete for mentorship from celebrities, like Will.i.am and Jessica Alba, who have some business experience. The celebs swipe their fingers on iPads -- Tinder like -- to express their feelings on each app. The initial winners gets move on to compete for venture capital backing. It sounds like Shark Tank for iOS developers, and Shark Tank has done well for ABC. But Apple is significantly narrowing the audience with its app focus but that might not matter, if the show generates enough buzz among Apple fans. The other show is a spinoff of ‚ÄúCarpool Karaoke,‚Äù the popular segment that started on ‚ÄúThe Late Late Show with James Corden.‚Äù Clips from Corden‚Äôs show have been popular on YouTube, but Apple hopes to claim the audience for itself, as a perk for Apple Music subscribers. Of course, people aren‚Äôt going to pay $10 a month -- the cost of an Apple Music membership -- for just two shows, but that‚Äôs not really the point. For the foreseeable future, Apple‚Äôs original content is intended to be a nice add-on that makes Apple Music a bit more appealing in a sea of streaming-music services from the likes of Spotify and Amazon. Apple seems to be taking a page from Amazon, which continues to layer on new services for its Prime subscribers. Investors don‚Äôt hate the news. Apple shares are up 1.2% today, pushing the stock toward a new all-time high. Big Picture: Apple‚Äôs forthcoming original shows are nothing special, but they don‚Äôt really need to be.

It might have gotten its feet wet with the 808 documentary that it picked up for Apple Music, but new upcoming shows will be its first real step into original content with two series that should have much more mainstream appeal. Planet of the Apps is Apple‚Äôs upcoming reality series that is essentially an American Idol meets Shark Tank-style contest for app developers, and Carpool Karaoke is a spin-off of the popular segment of the same name from James Corden‚Äôs Late Late Show. Both have big name celebrity guests and for now will debut for Apple Music subscribers exclusively, at least while we wait for the long rumored video streaming service from Apple. Planet of the Apps will come sometime this spring and Carpool Karaoke is set to premiere in April. Apple yesterday released the first trailer for Planet of the Apps as its senior vice president of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue discussed the company‚Äôs original content plans during an interview. Here‚Äôs your first look at the upcoming show: Apple‚Äôs Eddy Cue said the show will be exclusive to Apple Music subscribers and be ad-free.

In a regulatory filing, Berkshire reported owning 57.4 million shares of Apple as of Dec. 31, which would now be worth $7.74 billion, up from just from 15.2 million shares in the iPhone maker three months earlier. Berkshire also reported a $9.3 billion airline stake, with investments topping $2.1 billion in each of American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc. It also disclosed new stakes in satellite radio company Sirius XM Holdings Inc and seed company Monsanto Co , which is being bought by Germany's Bayer AG. Though it is unclear who make which investments, the filing appears to reflect much of the $12 billion of stock that Buffett said he had bought between the Nov. 8 Presidential election and the end of January. Larger Berkshire investments such as Wells Fargo & Co , Coca-Cola Co and International Business Machines Corp are normally Buffett's, but the 86-year-old billionaire has given his deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler more to invest over the years. Berkshire's initial investment in Apple got attention last year, given Buffett's usual aversion to technology companies - apart from IBM - which he considers outside his zone of competence. The new, larger stake makes Berkshire one of Apple's 10 biggest investors. "I'm stunned to see the size of that Apple position," said Thomas Russo, who oversees $11 billion of assets, including 12 percent in Berkshire, at Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Berkshire did not respond to a request for comment. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns roughly 90 companies such as the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream. Its Class A shares closed on Tuesday up $2,078.95 at $250,419, a record high closing price and less than 0.2 percentage points below its all-time high on Dec. 14. APPLE BECOMES CORE HOLDING The plunge into Apple appears particularly well-timed. Shares of Apple closed on Tuesday up $1.73 at $135.02, also a record closing high. Assuming Berkshire has not sold its stake, Apple's 16.6 percent gain this year would leave it with a $1.1 billion paper profit in 2017 alone. It had been widely believed that Berkshire's initial investment came from Combs or Weschler. But their decisions have sometimes influenced Buffett, as when Berkshire last year paid $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, once a Combs investment. "It's quite possible that Warren woke up and began to understand the virtues of Apple that he had been neglecting or, like with Precision Castparts, Todd or Ted had an affinity for Apple that sparked interest from Warren," Russo said. Combs and Weschler are the leading candidates to eventually succeed Buffett as Berkshire's chief investment officer. The airline investments, meanwhile, suggest that Buffett has overcome his two-decade aversion to the sector after an unhappy - though, he has said, profitable - investment in US Air Group. Buffett told talk show host Charlie Rose in an interview last month that it was "in large part" his decision to dive back into airlines. "The industry was once balkanized, but now it is bulking up, and has come to realize that an empty seat is a perishable asset," Russo said. "More planes are traveling more full." Shares of American, Delta, Southwest and United, as well as Apple, Monsanto and Sirius, rose in after-hours trading. Such increases often occur when investors perceive that Berkshire has given a company its imprimatur. Monsanto and Sirius did not immediately respond to requests for comment. To make room for new investments, Berkshire appeared to have shed a $1.8 billion stake in agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co and nearly all of what remained from a more than decade-old stake in retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Its stake in Apple was worth nearly $6.7 billion as of December 31, and over $7.7 billion today if the shares are still held. Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a nearly $1 billion stake in Apple last May, which led the iPhone maker's stock to soar 9% once the investment became public knowledge. Apple stock has been on the rise since then, closing at an all-time high of $135.02 today just nine months after setting a 52-week low of $89.47 in May 2016. Apple and Berkshire Hathaway are the world's most and fourth-most valuable companies respectively based on their market capitalizations.

Impressive. Rating: 12 Votes rybitron 1 day ago at 02:20 pm Over and over again, he teaches how to follow in his footsteps, but it's so hard for so many of us to do it like him. Impressive. It's almost self fulfilling. Warren Buffett announces he thinks apple stock prices will go up. He invests lots of money, the price goes up. If I announce that "company x" stock will go up and I invest in its stock, it seems to always go down. Rating: 9 Votes jgdeschamps 1 day ago at 02:43 pm Didn't the bloke a while back cry that the sky was falling for Apple, then everyone got scared and said that Warren said so it has to be true when he dumped shares? That was Carl Icahn. Rating: 8 Votes djcerla 1 day ago at 02:45 pm And yet, the MR bros are assuring us that the firm is somehow in trouble and Tim Cook must be fired. Just start an hedge fund, guys!

I suspect one of his underlings is pushing for it... I do not think it is surprising at all, because I think AAPL is the safest stock investment you can make, and it is also undervalued. It should be a $200.00 stock - just like Carl Icahn said. Everything Carl Icahn said about AAPL 18 months or so ago was correct. How far can AAPL go down? Liquid asset value is very high for AAPL - maybe something like $50+ per share - so if all business halted or failed, the shares would/should still be worth more than $50.00. That's your downside, and try to imagine what it would take for Apple's business for that to become a reality. Very unlikely. P/E ratio - compare to others. It's ridiculous that AAPL had such a low P/E ratio (of like 11 or 13 for a long time), while all the others grouped with it have P/E's of 18. This alone should make anyone buy the stock! Earnings per share - again - AAPL does very well. Every share pulls in something close to $9 per year earnings. What is not to like about AAPL? Fear of not selling iPhone's? I mean really? "Stock Analysts" have been so negative about AAPL stock for years and years - and the stock has gone up 1000% all the while, and they STILL keep saying negative things about AAPL. It's a big joke, almost as stupid as some of the false propaganda we see daily on CNN - all slanted made up stories - they start off with some assumptions and lies and build on the lies with more misinformation over and over until there is nothing left but a very incorrect world view. The old joke around MacRumours is that Apple is "going broke" - with CNN their thing is "Russia did it" - or "Putin did it". It's the same sort of joke. If you can see through the lies, you can profit. Warren Buffet probably realized it and put his money down knowing that AAPL is the easiest and safest investment in the entire world - there may be other good opportunities, but Warren Buffet would probably do best if he liquidated the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway and put all his eggs in one basket - AAPL. The idea of "Are you Diversified" is garbage - you only need to pick a winner. Easy to do with AAPL. Has been easy and still is easy. Rating: 2 Votes code-m 1 day ago at 03:05 pm I know he owns a stand-alone jewelry store in Omaha called Borsheims. He probably at least owns stock in one of the big chains. We live in Omaha and bought a couple of shares of 'B' stock (around $100.00 at the time) In Berkshire Hathaway, his company. Once a year there is a stock holders meeting and most of the brands and stores he owns have discounts for stockholders, even the ones with the cheap stock. Borsheims and Nebraska Furniture Mart are the 2 big draws, but there are others. [doublepost=1487113329][/doublepost]And he used to avoid electronic and software companies, since he didn't understand them, but he and Bill Gates have become pretty good friends. They meet in Omaha about once a month and Mr. Gates has been advising him on tech stocks. I can't see Bill Gates advising him to buy Apple, however. Money is money to an investor there is no playing hero versus villain when it comes to money, just more or less of it. :) Rating: 1 Votes FightTheFuture 15 hours ago at 10:34 am Good thing you are here to point out negativity. Your comment will do nothing to change that so please continue to enjoy it. From the tone of the post, I don't think he's enjoying your comments at all. Even the most successful investors make poor decisions some of the time. His portfolio has losers in it, I can guarantee that. News flash - forum guy thinks he's a better investor than Warren Buffet.

Angela Watercutter Culture Date of Publication: 02.14.17. 02.14.17 Time of Publication: 5:02 pm. 5:02 pm Apple‚Äôs Original TV Shows Suggest It Doesn‚Äôt Need to Lure New Subscribers James Corden has had a successful run as late-night host since he took over CBS‚Äô¬†Late Late Show nearly two years ago, but his biggest impact hasn‚Äôt been on television‚Äîit‚Äôs been on YouTube,¬†where videos of his show‚Äôs¬†signature segment, ‚ÄúCarpool Karaoke,‚Äù have racked up nearly half a billion views. The segment‚Äôs appeal is undeniable:¬†recognizable people singing recognizable songs in a recognizable situation. And now Apple is turning it into a series. To launch its foray into original programming. Related Stories Apple Music‚Äôs New Look Is Clean and Karaoke-Friendly Apple Doesn‚Äôt Need Apple Music to Win, Which Is Why It Will Apple Music Is Releasing Frank Ocean‚Äôs New Album on Friday Yes, starting in April, Carpool Karaoke: The Series will be coming to an Apple Music subscription near you. After months of being tight-lipped about its plans for original content, Apple‚Äôs head of internet software and services Eddy Cue unveiled the first trailer for the show last night at Recode‚Äôs Code Media conference. He also announced that Apple will release another show this spring called Planet of the Apps. It stars Gwyneth Paltrow and will.i.am and kinda looks like Shark Tank‚Äîbut for apps. (It also just looks bad.) Again, they‚Äôre calling it original content. This isn‚Äôt Apple making a big play for original programming; this is Apple seasoning the steak you‚Äôre already enjoying to see if you might like it. (The company did a similar dance when it partnered with Vice for The Score.) Cue admitted to this when he told the conference ‚Äúfour years from now, I don‚Äôt know where we‚Äôre going to be in relation to this. We‚Äôre trying different things. How fast it grows or where it goes remains to be seen.‚Äù The goal of having original content may be to lure consumers to Apple Music, but the service already attracted 20 million users in 15 months. It doesn‚Äôt have to race to grow its base. And with a show like Carpool Karaoke, it likely won‚Äôt. The entire¬†schtick of HOV-lane sing-alongs is perfect¬†for YouTube. Outside of people who write about viral videos and insomniacs, though, very few people consider The Late Late Show appointment television (confession: I‚Äôm one of those people).¬†Worse, they know that¬†everything they‚Äôll need to see will be all over the internet the next morning. The chances that someone will plunk down $10 a month just to watch it are slim. The odds that they‚Äôll throw it on occasionally because they already have Apple Music, however, are much higher. (Can‚Äôt say the same for Planet of the Apps, though, unless people accidentally click on it looking for Charlton Heston.) It‚Äôs not really that much different than the playbook of other streaming services. Netflix built a base delivering content from Hollywood studios until it had an audience ready to devour House of Cards. Hulu did the same, albeit doing it on TV networks‚Äô dime. Now Apple is hitting that playbook, capitalizing on¬†the base it built through¬†exclusivity windows from artists like Frank Ocean and Chance the Rapper in order to own content. The¬†surprising part about it is that Apple isn‚Äôt making a splash, it‚Äôs dipping a toe. If you‚Äôre Apple and you want content, why not just buy a studio? Cue disregarded that question at the Code Media conference, as well as comparisons to Netflix saying, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not out trying to buy a bunch of shows. ‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre trying things that are creative, that move culture.‚Äù Whether putting Will Smith in a helicopter to sing R. Kelly‚Äôs seminal ‚ÄúI Believe I Can Fly‚Äù qualifies as either is up for debate. Belting out shower songs with with Corden and friends is fun, but if Apple wants to attract new subscribers, the company is going to have to sing a different tune. Go Back to Top.

The company just released the first teaser trailer for its new show, "Planet of the Apps", and the experience of watching it is similar to what I'd imagine being slowly lowered into a vat of acid feels like. Apple The trailer was unveiled last light at Recode's Code Media conference by Eddy Cue, the Apple executive with questionable music taste, and Ben Silverman, a former NBC executive. The concept for the show is uniquely awful ‚Äî it's almost as if the folks at Apple dreamed up the most unoriginal and potentially nauseating show just to see if people would watch it anyway. It combines noted tech geniuses like Gwyneth Paltrow, will.i.am (creator of many successful and useful technology products), Vayner Media CEO Gary Vaynerchuck and Jessica Alba, whose brand of organic baby powder was recently recalled. Apple calls them the world's "most culturally influential entrepreneurs", because sure, why not? The contestants, however, probably have it the worst. They're forced through the humiliating experience of pitching their app ‚Äî one is described as the "eBay for the Snapchat generation" ‚Äî while literally riding down an escalator, like some sort of second-rate Donald Trump. The esteemed tech geniuses then decide if they want to hear more. It remains to be seen whether a "no" causes a pit at the bottom of the escalator to suddenly open, sending the failed contestants into the fiery pits of Hell. Apple is launching its first TV show, "Planet of the Apps." Here's the trailer. More in our live blog: https://t.co/wK3Nn4xjuv #CodeMedia pic.twitter.com/AbdhyxRvJ8 ‚Äî Recode (@Recode) February 14, 2017 Following the premier of the trailer, Recode's Peter Kafka turned to Silverman and asked: "How come no one has made a show about apps until now? It seems like there's a good reason there hasn't been an app reality show." Silverman explained the real "game changer" with this show is that the people who watch it will be able to instantly download the apps and "connect with the product that night". Sure, sounds like fun. Anyway, this show looks pretty bad, and it's a pretty safe bet to say it will flop, particularly given that it will live on Apple Music. If for some reason your vision isn't going and you're still able to comprehend reality, the full interview is here.

The ‚ÄúApple Music is more than just music‚Äù message is one he‚Äôs already expressed, and it‚Äôs a sign Apple‚Äôs competition in the streaming music market is growing beyond Spotify and Tidal to more inclusive services like Amazon Prime. Get ready for lots of original TV shows on Apple Music Speaking at the Recode Code Media conference Mr. Cue said original shows will be a big part of Apple‚Äôs streaming music service. He said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the differentiating factors we can add to Apple Music.‚Äù Apple wants to bring intriguing original content to subscribers. That includes reality shows like Planet of the Apps, and original scripted shows like Vital Signs and Carpool Karaoke. Apple Music Wants Your TV Screen Despite Spotify‚Äôs larger subscriber base‚Äîabout double Apple Music‚Äôs 20 million‚Äîthat‚Äôs not a market where the company is prepared to compete today. Right now, that‚Äôs where Netflix and Amazon Prime shine, and where Apple wants to be. Mr. Cue‚Äôs comments back up what Jimmy Iovine said earlier this year when he told Hollywood reporter, ‚ÄúAt Apple Music, what we‚Äôre trying to create is an entire cultural, pop cultural experience, and that happens to include audio and video.‚Äù For now, that means scouting for interesting original shows. Apple could look at buying a media company at some point, but for now that doesn‚Äôt fit with the company‚Äôs plans. Mr Cue told Recode, To the extent if we wanted to do what everybody else is doing, then you‚Äôre right, we might be better off buying somebody or doing that. But that‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre trying to do. We are trying to do something that‚Äôs unique, takes advantage of our platforms and that really brings culture to it. Ben Silverman from Propagate, the company co-producing Planet of the Apps with Apple, said they‚Äôre trying to tap into the cultural landscape. He sees apps, along with music and television, as part of that, which helps explain part of why Apple was interested in the show. In other words, Apple Music‚Äôs upcoming shows are just the beginning. More will be coming, and odds are they‚Äôll be quality shows designed to hook us on spending US$9.99 a month on the streaming music service. The model is already working for Netflix and Amazon Prime, and if Apple plays its cards right, it‚Äôll work for Apple Music, too.

NEWSFLASH: those of us that genuinely care about music and have kept the industry afloat with our real $$$ and participation do not watch effing MTV. Eddie Clue(less) perhaps? Silicon Valley is just embarrassing itself at this point with its cultural misappropriation (i.e. becoming the ‚Äònew‚Äô cable TV and faux culture circa the 1990s). I would sure love a new Mac that works good, though. Microsoft has always been embarrassing and out of touch, but they are starting to make some good stuff because *they are actually making things*. :/ February 14, 2017 at 9:29 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2017 4:18PM EST Last updated Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2017 4:19PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn PrintLicense article The best read for investors I‚Äôve seen in the past few months is actually not ostensibly about markets, it‚Äôs about mistakes in medical diagnosis. Online magazine Nautilus published an excerpt from Michael 'The Big Short‚Äô Lewis‚Äô new book which recounted a car crash victim in the emergency department of Toronto‚Äôs Sunnybrook hospital, ‚Äú[The patient] remained alert enough to tell them that she had a past history of an overactive thyroid. An overactive thyroid can cause an irregular heartbeat. And so, when the hospital‚Äôs resident medical detective, Don Redelmeier, arrived, the staff believed that they no longer needed him to investigate the source of the irregular heartbeat but only to treat it‚Ä¶ Instead, Redelmeier asked everyone to slow down‚Ä¶Just check their thinking ‚Äî and to make sure they were not trying to force the facts into an easy, coherent, but ultimately false story." The irregular heart beat was actually caused by a collapsed lung that may have killed the victim. "Eighty percent of doctors don‚Äôt think probabilities apply to their patients," [Reidelmeir] said. "Just like 95 per cent of married couples don‚Äôt believe the 50-per-cent divorce rate applies to them, and 95 per cent of drunk drivers don‚Äôt think the statistics that show that you are more likely to be killed if you are driving drunk than if you are driving sober applies to them." Most investors don‚Äôt believe statistics showing passive investing outperforms active stock picking, and that chasing rallies individual market sectors will hurt performance, apply to them either. But they do.¬†¬† -- Scott Barlow ¬† Stocks to ponder ECN Capital Corp. This stock has failed to join the stock market rally. The share price is in a holding pattern, trading sideways, writes Jennifer Dowty. However, explosive gains are anticipated for the stock over the next 12 months. The average target price implies the share price may rally over 40 per cent over the next year. Toronto-based ECN Capital provides financing across three core business segments: rail, commercial aviation, and commercial and vendor. A potential catalyst for the stock would be the announcement of a middle market finance deal, a growth opportunity seen by management. Its dividend is four cents per share per year, for a yield of 1.3 per cent. Aphria Inc. This company's stock remains in an uptrend and may appear on the positive breakouts list in the upcoming months. The shares appear to be under accumulation with more than double the historical daily average trading volume trading on Monday, writes Jennifer Dowty. Given controversy surrounding the topic of legalized recreational marijuana, this security may be best suited for consideration by growth investors with a high risk tolerance. The company has received conditional approval to move up to the TSX from the venture exchange. Home Capital Group Inc. Is a potential Ontario Securities Commission enforcement action for things that took place nearly two years ago old news? If a stock falls on the announcement, does it become even more of a buy? asks David Milstead. Perhaps the answers for the company‚Äôs boosters are ‚Äúyes,‚Äù in the case of Home Capital Group Inc. The company revealed Friday the OSC sent it an enforcement notice related to its continuous disclosure obligations in 2014 and 2015 about false loan applications and the brokers involved in them. The stock fell on the news and is about 30 per cent off its 52-week high. It is quite the comedown for what has been a long-term top performer in the S&P/TSX Composite and makes many lists of top dividend stocks for raising its payout year after year. David says investors should stay clear. Apple Inc. The company's 10th anniversary smartphone will be the ultimate in cool when it launches this fall. But is cool really worth $70-billion (U.S.), asks Ian McGugan. That is how much Apple‚Äôs market value has surged in less than two weeks. The immediate catalyst was an earnings report on Jan. 31 that revealed the company had ended a three-quarter streak of declining revenue, but the broader rationale has been growing optimism about the gadget maker‚Äôs ability to return to sustainable growth. Apple shares closed Monday at a record high after Goldman Sachs boosted its stock price target and gushed about the potential of the upcoming phone, which is expected to go by the funky name of iPhone X and arrive slightly more than a decade after the original device was introduced. Manulife Financial Corp. The company handed investors a complex accounting lesson when it reported its fourth-quarter results last week, and the subsequent head-scratching will likely weigh on the stock‚Äôs valuation, writes David Berman. On Thursday, the insurance company announced a profit of just $63-million, or a mere 1 cent per share, in the fourth quarter, which sounded dismal to anyone who relies on reported results to analyze stocks. But wait a minute: After making a few adjustments, Manulife said that its adjusted or ‚Äúcore‚Äù profit was much better, at nearly $1.3-billion, or 63 cents a share. That‚Äôs a massive gap between the two quarterly figures. And given the stock‚Äôs muted response over the past three trading days ‚Äì the price fell slightly two days before rising a little on Monday ‚Äì many investors may be taking a wait-and-see approach. ¬† The Rundown Why mutual fund managers aren't celebrating the record high in the TSX Canada‚Äôs main stock market index is trading at record highs. Banks, airlines and railways have contributed to the rebound over the past 12 months, but commodity producers have stood out with eye-popping gains as high as 700 per cent ‚Äì giving index investors a particular thrill. The reason: Many professional stock pickers avoided beaten-up commodity producers when they were unloved. However, index investors ‚Äì who prefer to passively track the market rather than rely on clever stock picking to outperform it ‚Äì have enjoyed the full rally. The un-Canadian path to great returns With North American equities priced to deliver only piddling paybacks, look to emerging markets, writes Ian McGugan. The best advice for Canadian investors over the past few years has been to stick close to¬†home. Canadian stocks have produced decent, if patchy, results, while U.S. equities have soared into the stratosphere. In contrast, the rest of the world has turned into a graveyard for investors‚Äô¬†hopes. The next few years, however, are likely to present a far different picture. Based on current valuations, Canadians will have to venture further afield and become far more adventurous in pursuit of¬†gains. Some of the most tempting payoffs are likely to lie in the world‚Äôs grittier locales ‚Äì places such as Poland, Russia and Turkey. In an age of near-zero bond yields and frothy stock markets in the United States and Canada, it‚Äôs the globe‚Äôs emerging economies that offer the best chance of making your retirement dreams come¬†true. Canadians have been surprisingly slow to adopt low-cost index investing The shift to low-cost indexing in Canada has proven to be less of a great shakeup than a mild quiver, writes Tim Shufelt. While U.S. investors continue to sink enormous sums into passive alternatives, in Canada, the stock pickers still rule the market. The pace of change could soon pick up, however. A shifting regulatory backdrop and rising fee awareness could quicken the adoption of index funds, according to a Morningstar report. It‚Äôs time for investors to shift into defensive mode These days, there are a lot of people trying to read the tea leaves, trying to understand how far the current rally will last, and what might happen when it ends, writes Thane Stenner. In these ‚Äúinteresting times,‚Äù the most important thing for investors is to determine what‚Äôs worth focusing on and what‚Äôs worth tuning out. Some of the data he looks at is margin debt and the market-price-to-revenue ratio, which tracks the per-share stock price of index-component companies against their annual reported revenue. Contra Guys: Finding attractive beaten-down stocks are hard to find right now What should investors do when market conditions are such that the system they use is less valid? That is what the Contra Guys are facing to some degree now as markets have skyrocketed to record levels. That makes the value investors' ability to purchase out-of-favour stocks at enticing valuations much more difficult, writes Benj Gallander and Ben Stadelmann. In response to reader queries, a tutorial on total returns John Heinzl often refers to the total return of a stock, fund or an index, so here's a tutorial on what that means and why it matters. Ottawa may eye tax measures that hit higher earners The odds of a federal budget that targets investors with higher taxes on capital gains or even dividends are rising, writes Rob Carrick. Don‚Äôt be too relieved if such measures aren‚Äôt contained in the budget expected later this month because they could be revisited in a year or two. The government needs tax revenue to keep the deficit in check and has been studying all the various tax measures that cost it money. Two of the biggest are the 50-per-cent inclusion rate on capital gains and a preferential tax rate on dividends. It‚Äôs not just the forgone tax revenue that will keep these two tax measures under scrutiny. According to research by economist David Macdonald of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, they also benefit well-off people far more than the middle class or low-income people. A novel way to react to adviser fee shock Here‚Äôs a novel solution to the fee shock some investors are feeling when they open their latest account statements: Ask for more advice from your adviser, writes Rob Carrick. New investment industry disclosure rules mean investors are for the first time being shown the dollar amount of fees they pay for advice and other services, as well as their personalized returns over at least the past year. Seeing fees in dollar terms is a revelation for many. ¬† Number Crunchers Fifteen U.S. mid-caps with strong potential ¬† Ask Globe Investor Do you have a question for Globe Investor?

What‚Äôs up in the days ahead Canadian Tire may not have the customer service of Home Depot or the impulse-purchase appeal of Costco, but its convenient locations and broad selection of sporting goods, automotive products and household items have helped it carve out an enduring niche in Canadian retail.

REUTERS/Shannon StapletonMore By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc <BRKa.N> was an aggressive buyer of stocks in last year's fourth quarter, nearly quadrupling its stake in Apple Inc <AAPL.O> and reporting significantly larger holdings in the four biggest U.S. airlines. In a regulatory filing, Berkshire said it boosted its stake in Apple as of Dec. 31 to about 57.4 million shares worth roughly $6.64 billion, from just 15.2 million shares three months earlier. Berkshire also disclosed new stakes in seed company Monsanto Co <MON.N>, which is being bought by Germany's Bayer AG <BAYGn.DE>, and satellite radio company Sirius XM Holdings Inc <SIRI.O>. Monsanto and Sirius shares rose after the disclosure. Though Buffett has long advocated investing for the long-haul, the plunge into Apple appears particularly well-timed. Shares of Apple closed on Tuesday up $1.73 at $135.02, a record closing high. Assuming Berkshire has not sold Apple, the iPhone maker's 16.6 percent gain this year would leave Berkshire with a $1.1 billion paper profit in 2017 alone. Berkshire also revealed a more than $9.3 billion year-end bet on airlines, up from $1.3 billion three months earlier, with stakes topping more than $2 billion in each of American Airlines Group Inc <AAL.O>, Delta Air Lines Inc <DAL.N>, Southwest Airlines Co <LUV.N> and United Continental Holdings Inc <UAL.N>. The investment suggests that Buffett has overcome his nearly two-decade aversion to the sector, following an unhappy - though, he has said, profitable - investment in US Air Group. Buffett told talk show host Charlie Rose in an interview last month that it was "in large part" his decision to dive back into airlines. Tuesday's filing appears to reflect much of the $12 billion of stock that Buffett said he had bought between the Nov. 8 Presidential election and the end of January, helping whittle down Berkshire's reported $84.8 billion cash stake. It is unclear how much of the overall buying was conducted by Buffett, or by his deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Larger Berkshire investments are normally Buffett's, but the 86-year-old billionaire has given Combs and Weschler more money to invest over the years. They are the leading candidates to eventually succeed him as Berkshire's chief investment officer.

Josh Smith10/11/2011 iCloud is one of the biggest parts of iOS 5. Advertisement While we are excited about iCloud, we keep hearing, ‚ÄúWhat is iCloud?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhy is it called a cloud?‚Äù Have no fear, we have everything you need to know about iCloud right here, so that you‚Äôre ready for iOS 5 on October 12th. Unlike many of the new iOS 5 features, iCloud brings most of the functionality to both Windows and Mac users, including the Photo Stream functionality that many users will get the most use out of. (Read: Should I Buy the iPhone 4S?) Advertisement What is iCloud? iCloud is a new service from Apple that keeps your devices in sync. Instead of manually transferring your iTunes purchases, photos and documents to your iPhone 4S, iPad 2, iPod and MacBook Air, iCloud will use your Apple ID to wirelessly sync your files and even your place in books between your many Apple devices. In addition to keeping your content in sync, you can also back up your iPhone or iPad to the cloud when you plug it in and connect to WiFi. This means that you‚Äôll have a current backup almost every time you plug in for a recharge. Apple chose to call this service iCloud, a play on the traditional ‚Äúcloud‚Äù services. The ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù in tech terms is basically referring to keeping your data on a remote server that is available anywhere. We like to say it lives in the cloud, as in it‚Äôs right there, you just have to reach out and grab it. There are a number of other great iCloud features that are exclusive to iOS 5. Check out these features below. http://youtu.be/DCjeSNomXrU Advertisement What Will iCloud Do? iCloud combines a number of features designed to provided a more complete Apple experience in iOS 5. You can find your iPhone, find friends, sync data, reunite with old iTunes purchases, keep photos on all of your devices and even bring your entire music catalog with you. Here‚Äôs a closer look at the iCloud features which will arrive with iOS 5. iTunes in the Cloud ‚Äì Remember when it was a paint to get your old iTunes music and TV show purchases on new devices or after you had a hard drive failure? Complain no more. With iTunes in the Cloud, you can download your new purchases to all your iOS devices over 3G or Wifi. You can also re-download your previously purchased iTunes music and TV shows. This feature has already reunited me with hundreds of dollars of music I had written off as lost. Contacts, Calendar and Email ‚Äì You get a free me.com email address which can be used to keep your contacts, email and calendar in sync. If you already have a Gmail or other popular webmail account, you may not want to make the switch, but if you need an email account that stays in sync, and keeps your contacts and events in sync, iCloud delivers. Find My Phone ‚Äì If you have a iPhone 4S warranty without loss or theft coverage, you can rest easy knowing that Find My Phone can track down your lost or stolen phone. You can send a message, lock the device, sound an alarm or erase your iPhone or iPad. Advertisement Photo Stream Keeps Pictures in Sync Between Devices. Photo Stream ‚Äì If you‚Äô re sick of trying to show off your photos on the small 3.5‚Ä≥ display on your iPhone, you‚Äôll love this feature. Photo Stream keeps your photos in sync across your iOS 5 devices and on to your Mac or PC. If you import photos from our DSLR or other camera to your Mac or PC, they will also be available on your iOS 5 devices. I plan to use this to share the photos I take on my Nikon D5100 on my iPad without transferring and syncing every day. Book Progress ‚Äì Just like the Kindle can keep your book progress in sync across devices, iBooks will now be able to share your book progress between devices. Apps On All Devices ‚Äì No longer will you have confusing messages when you try to download an app a second time. All your apps are¬†available¬†to download to your devices without any additional charges. Advertisement Wireless Backup ‚Äì When you plug in your iOS 5 device at night and it is connected to WiFi, it will backup your device. The Backup service backs up a collection of important information. Find My Friends Locates Friends and Family. Find My Friends ‚Äì If you want to see which friends are nearby, open up the Find My Friends App. You control who can see where you are, and there is an option to temporarily share your location with a group, perfect for traveling to a new city or attending a conference. Documents in the Cloud -Any documents you store in the cloud are kept up to date across all of your devices. Right now, this is limited to iWorks apps like Pages and Numbers, but third party developers can also build in support. We expect that many developers will add in this option in iOS 5 App upgrades. iCloud Storage ‚Äì You get 5GB of free storage, which will be enough for many users, but if you need more, you can purchase it from Apple. 10Gb will cost $20, 20GB is $40 and 50Gb is $100 for a year. ¬† iTunes Match Mens Better Quality Music for Most Listeners iTunes Match ‚Äì Another feature that many users will enjoy is iTunes Match. If you have purchased music from other sources or¬†acquired¬†by other means, you can pay $25 a year and have iTunes match your music to the music on Apple‚Äôs servers. This will not only bring the music to your devices quickly, but also might make it sound better since you will be able to listen to high quality iTunes copies of the music. If Apple can‚Äôt¬†match¬†your¬†music, it will upload a copy to keep¬†available¬†on your devices. More on iTunes Match. What can iCloud Backup While it would be great if you could back up everything on your 64GB iPhone to iCloud, Apple has a different use case in mind. Here are the things that iCloud will backup. Purchased music, TV shows, apps and books Photos and video in the Photo Roll Device settings App data Home screen and app organization Messages (Text, iMessage and MMS) Ringtones You get 5GB of free storage, which purchased media and your photos do not count against. You can purchase more storage if need be. This does not backup your personal music or videos, for that, you‚Äôll need iTunes Match. iCloud, iOS 5, iPhone 4S and iPhone 4 The good news is that iCloud will deliver the same experience across your iOS 5 devices. Unlike Siri, which is only available on the iPhone 4S,¬†the¬†iCloud features will work on all¬†existing¬†iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad devices that work with iOS 5. Be sure that you read, 5 Things to Do Before iOS 5, and download iTunes 10.5 to make sure you are ready for iOS 5 and iCloud.

So that means all your private information is stored elsewhere. Not a good thing. Soon the iCloud will be absolutely required to store everything, and you will not be able to keep your files to yourself. Think about it. Big Brother is watching.

¬† Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad US STOCKS-Apple, banks push Wall Street to all-time high By Reuters Published: 16:24 EST, 14 February 2017 | Updated: 16:24 EST, 14 February 2017 e-mail By Noel Randewich Feb 14 (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes established record highs on Tuesday, led by bank stocks after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said it would be unwise to wait too long to raise interest rates. Apple racked up a record high close for the second straight session, contributing to gains in the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite indexes. Yellen said delaying rate hikes could force the U.S. central bank to tighten monetary policy quicker down the line, which could risk a recession. She also expressed uncertainty over economic policy under the Trump administration. Banks, expected to gain from higher interest rates, led the market higher. Goldman Sachs rose 1.29 percent and Bank of America added 2.82 percent. The S&P 500 financial index jumped 1.24 percent. So far in 2017, the KBW banking index has increased 4.5 percent. President Donald Trump's pro-business stance sparked a record-setting rally in stocks following his November election. However, he has given scant detail on his policies, leaving the Fed with limited visibility about the economy's future direction. Speaking to the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, Yellen did not indicate whether the Fed still planned to raise rates three times this year, nor did she indicate whether a hike might come in March or in June, as most analysts expect. "With the new president, there is still the uncertainty of the economic policy," said Jeff Carbone, co-founder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina. "How much growth we get out of the market will affect policymaking and how quickly they need to react." The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.45 percent to end at 20,504.41 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.40 percent to 2,337.58. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.32 percent to 5,782.57. Yellen's comments lifted the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors rose, with healthcare adding 0.73 percent. Apple rose as high as $135.09, an intraday record high, before ending with a gain of 1.30 percent at $135.02, its highest-ever closing price. General Motors added 4.84 percent after Peugeot owner PSA Group said it is in talks to buy GM's European Opel business. The prospects of sector consolidation caused Fiat Chrysler to jump 4.39 percent, while Ford gained 0.72 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.31-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 60 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 124 new highs and 22 new lows. About 6.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, in line with its daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Apple (AAPL.O) racked up a record high close for the second straight session, contributing to gains in the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite indexes. Yellen said delaying rate hikes could force the U.S. central bank to tighten monetary policy quicker down the line, which could risk a recession. She also expressed uncertainty over economic policy under the Trump administration. Banks, expected to gain from higher interest rates, led the market higher. Goldman Sachs (GS.N) rose 1.29 percent and Bank of America (BAC.N) added 2.82 percent. The S&P 500 financial index .SPSY jumped 1.24 percent. So far in 2017, the KBW banking index .BKX has increased 4.5 percent. President Donald Trump's pro-business stance sparked a record-setting rally in stocks following his November election. However, he has given scant detail on his policies, leaving the Fed with limited visibility about the economy's future direction. Speaking to the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, Yellen did not indicate whether the Fed still planned to raise rates three times this year, nor did she indicate whether a hike might come in March or in June, as most analysts expect. "With the new president, there is still the uncertainty of the economic policy," said Jeff Carbone, co-founder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina. "How much growth we get out of the market will affect policymaking and how quickly they need to react." The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI climbed 0.45 percent to end at 20,504.41 points, while the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.40 percent to 2,337.58. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.32 percent to 5,782.57. Yellen's comments lifted the dollar .DXY and U.S. Treasury yields US10YT=RR. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors rose, with healthcare .SPXHC adding 0.73 percent. Apple rose as high as $135.09, an intraday record high, before ending with a gain of 1.30 percent at $135.02, its highest-ever closing price. General Motors (GM.N) added 4.84 percent after Peugeot owner PSA Group (PEUP.PA) said it is in talks to buy GM's European Opel business. The prospects of sector consolidation caused Fiat Chrysler (FCAU.N) to jump 4.39 percent, while Ford (F.N) gained 0.72 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.31-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 60 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 124 new highs and 22 new lows. About 6.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, in line with its daily average over the last 20 sessions.

It is general player of the I want I want you Tryon play the first one left out the flick in the thing Ashland oil slick of the thing that's been Hewitt was she your fiancee a girlfriend she was and I should the federal a lot of viewers and we're engaged now allotted set themselves on attitudes will do just that. So there you inspirational Merrill guys if you think it about going to see fifty shades darker when. Is rigorous review. I've had been living descendant. Consensus. Two thumbs down I'm sorry but it was hot. And I. I mean it's pretty sexy and hot to actually get an irony of the movie and horrible acting ain't bad is atrocities. Yeah I feel mostly hanging there. It's it's I. This is the actor actually Apple's done a way to get your portfolio Academy Award and is the dual led easily well it's a bit bland Brady. She she refused to drink.

Fifty I don't see intervals. So the girls talked about whether they would go and see the third. It ends its day but you can see third. And stop this I mean I am can they need to see it rounds. I DJ and Andy acting sounds big when you know these extent this is more of us need to Prejean and south. That's my opinion. Yeah my wife wanted to get after each one thinking Acton was greatly from a partisan attack on game. Slowly it worse. It's like one of the worst reviewed movies of the year earlier in the year that those in the eye so what do you think they needed an OK they answered that bush. Compared with pars on this Texas tame they need to make it very parent I have a problem between me and that's just history. It did in parallels are probably I don't know. Yeah hundred partner Merrill and yet the sixties or that's the kind of team. You're you're you're you reach you know all you hear about this book is like all the crazy stuff that goes on and slight.

Smoking not. If something happens T. I had a space. Yeah Michael Strahan GAAP Ahmadinejad I'm leaving but I think his body. Home that day you have to paperback paper bags in the back. Some women here Burnett had Christian right I know women did that really stick I think. Felt that no guy would do that also when I'm done yeah you know. I'd do it from far but far from good idea metal thing and I think it's all of the educational for all the men listening to work out of a movie theater actually part of this. As again. But what the pendulum movie we talk muscle car wars and about you know we'll vote the equivalent for men. Will be it will be the fifty shades nine and a half weeks and I was like fifty years ago now. And what was the other room the movie that women had the the mite movie the I didn't like magic might nearest thing we have snowballed and you know I've actually had I threw. And a micro I get guys open. The girls came up with a quiz that they TV tells you more that didn't like whoever won the quiz divest the with a quiz got that whole gift box that fifty shades of gray start him all the bloody gloves but. The first place plants this guy rabbit so you name it you guys they have ever flood time yellow yeah. I don't know quite an hour later the recovery could take a quiz you guys gonna take the quiz question read by the girls. You guys do yours answers. It's okay to not why have the feeling the girls answers from the field a lot more intriguing than an hour or violent that I'm in a still go. What percentage of manner relationships always. Have a heart and during that cost 75%. 95%. Or 55%. Amendment. That man yeah that's Virginia well. Guys are considered a hundred. Seattle is the huddle.

As I'd like to journey I don't like I don't like the Andy I don't like a destination Alex Gurney I don't like the destiny and he's always done I think in laws except this movie apparently put the next my second question. What is the average length of the he sighed and six inches or three more talk. I think Chris Cochrane. Three to four and says the three of warm blood. The average man on the budget guys don't watch says countries so some countries apparently don't have the same nutrition debate.

Shower bath and batch of showers next to keep reading about this national machine thing is that why you shouldn't two on the Yucatan through your little short length. How that. A digital or what happens you're probably a lot of different really in the longer out you. Always say the other than the better America couch I don't think I think it's all account.

Against them it's really. No not know him never they never what does Gillette Stadium hearts and our athletes are worried about it I was in the digital what is the cars are into. Reward partly as I'm just can't wait to get home as governor didn't. The biggest appeared depends right I mean the younger than thirty. Ironic seems like it's a car yet here yet but just if you look if you eliminate all of living at home with my car in debt right yeah car car would be AT&T you can pick up truck and that let him go is not we're grown adult instantly to that either. Of the stuff like washing machines they have nowhere to go final question that who made things more relaxed happy exactly went ahead of our net. Willow earlier did. Now an honest women when it's kind of rusty what kind of piles out little bits or your your doing the deed and you know she now you know she's speaking to somebody else. Thanks again besides putting more wild doing excellent and of course those surprise. Really there you have it. Strep RO CF fifty shades darker the in purchase debt don't go see it in the movie that someone to negotiate the third one. New pissed off of acting. And then of course you heard the and you can't play the conflict and you have forgotten how to play and the stunning we can't place. Yeah. And so next guy and oh. When did you not like that. It's life does go and walk on who went. Don't like it. Kid conditions so it wasn't that Rodriguez in the garbage. He's the unopposed what is the conversation went home over the dinner table I don't know. A lot of we'd be keeping Leno really let's get go to bed and wanna hear that again that was pretty bonds was important scene here at the first top. I. And we are all in agreement that the guy we're talking with attention in the and just the tone and rather and he did you know. More like master mold. And talented and so. We NASCAR has no you don't god we don't do stuff I they would the Olympic oblique doubt I'd never heard reports. Never them. I don't know of value to me so when I got in his unit usually does that either publicly title held Tuesday yeah Butler Bulldogs beat that the it they have the I don't think we can even play what they probably -- and they are trying to explain what it is how it would it would be like for guys it's a fiction that we can't it's a good yeah out there would. Three hours to edit what we play it took forever we couldn't play the best we. Hopefully we typically it is tough to replace the best of fund online and I'm like what are along and I don't put out. And ultimately I don't know I. Activities until the music in at all. And it that I had the good way to look at it I know look at the states are. You guys will sit there we'll talk okay which rocky movies is they closed at bats and and comment when I watch what I got its laser the last good movie I was pretty sweet greens good and that was a move cows like I want talk about it freeze.

Are. Let's. In red hot or not and not. Smoking and not see. This T. How likely is that a space. Given a Michael Strahan cap and I think I'm leaving but I think his body. Home I think that you have to paper bag and it paid. What we've learned that you what are your whole package is like paperback at all we have to put on camera but a happy with the fact that we do that. There's little eyes and know him. This couple holes that mr. Chernin does have a wide gap and Kevin he's breezed through southern Italy university law they announced that he would never get a sense and judgment. Show that years ago jewel. Said that she would never get it fixed because she yeah she grew up and homeless and call or whatever she wanted to. That's again it's like Anthony Davis.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Apple stock hits new all-time high by Seth Fiegerman ¬† @sfiegerman February 14, 2017: 4:15 PM ET Tech firms take travel ban opposition to court Apple's love affair with Wall Street is back. The iPhone maker's stock rose to $135.09 in trading Tuesday afternoon, passing its previous intraday trading high of $134.54, reached in April 2015. The stock closed at $135.01. Apple's stock flirted with its all-time high on Monday, but ended the day at $133.29. That set a new record closing price for the first time since February 2015. The stock surge, pushing Apple (AAPL, Tech30) above a $700 billion market cap again, comes amid renewed optimism for the iPhone. Goldman Sachs raised its price target for the stock on Monday, citing the likelihood of "major new features" like "3D sensing" being added to the next iPhone model, according to an investor note provided to CNNMoney. Apple's previous high was set six months after it released the redesigned iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, kicking off what CEO Tim Cook described as the "mother of all upgrades." Since then, however, Apple has bucked its tradition of overhauling the iPhone every other year. The newest models on the market today look nearly identical to the iPhones available in late 2014. The long wait, combined with this year marking the iPhone's tenth anniversary, has only raised expectations that Apple is about to significantly overhaul its smartphone and reignite demand. Related: Tim Cook: 'Apple would not exist without immigration' Apple's annual sales fell in the 2016 fiscal year for the first time since 2001 as iPhone sales, still the majority of its business, declined in three consecutive quarters. Apple even cut its CEO's pay by 15% due to the company's failure to meet its performance goals for both sales and profits. But that losing streak just ended. Apple sales started growing again in the December quarter, driven by stronger demand for the iPhone -- particularly for the larger and more expensive iPhone 7 Plus. The company sold 78.3 million iPhones for the quarter, setting a new record. At least some of that may be due to the Samsung's smartphone recall woes. Mark Moskowitz, an analyst with William Blair, wrote in an investor note this month, "Samsung's Note 7 struggles likely helped." The iPhone isn't the only reason Wall Street is excited about Apple. There's also President Trump. Despite Trump clashing with Apple during the campaign, investors are now optimistic Apple will benefit from at least one Trump proposal: cutting taxes on cash that U.S. businesses bring back from their overseas accounts. Apple currently has $230 billion in cash held in foreign accounts. If Trump and Congress make it cheaper for Apple to bring that money back, it could be used for acquisitions and buybacks.

How do they work? Shares "[Expletive] magnets, how do they work?", famously asked the Insane Clown Posse, a move which would have forever ruled them out of a job at Apple, if the iPhone company's latest patent plans are anything to go by. The company has just been awarded 48 new patents according to Patently Apple, one of which details an interesting potential audio upgrade for future iPhones. It details a system that increases the magnetic field within the speaker, which in turn increases a mechanical force on the speaker's voice coil to improve its acoustics. Up to 11 As with all patents, it uses relatively dense language to describe what it sets out to achieve. But essentially, it aims to deliver a more bombastic audio performance within the confines of increasingly slim devices. It also outlines how Apple would prevent any device equipped with the magnet system from ruining other items that require on magnets, such as hotel key cards or gift cards. Apple has a reasonably good track record with loudspeakers - the stereo array on its iPad Pro was particularly good. However, at least in comparison to HTC's BoomSound tech, its phones have had rather average speakers.¬† With the iPhone line only set to get slimmer, it'll be interesting to see whether future iPhone models get a boost from this patent, should it ever be employed.¬† iPhone 8 release date, rumors and news Tags iPhone iPad ABOUT THE AUTHOR Gerald Lynch Gerald is Associate Editor of TechRadar, taking care of the site's news and features output.

Image: DUSTIN DRANKOSKI/MASHABLE By Raymond Wong2017-02-14 20:30:00 UTC Brace yourself, because Apple might really kill the iconic home button with built-in Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 8. A newly granted patent, discovered by AppleInsider, reveals Apple is at least exploring the idea of integrating the fingerprint sensor into the display, making Touch ID's existing "capacitive drive ring" around the home button (and the button itself) unnecessary for future iPhones. SEE ALSO: Future iPhones and iPads could have stretchy screens The patent outlines the use of a new type of display technology that uses embedded micro LEDs and an IR diode to essentially scan and detect the position of a finger on the screen. LuxVue, a company Apple acquired in 2014 that specializes in low-power micro LED displays, is reportedly behind the technology. A bitmap made up of light intensity data generated by "bouncing IR light off of a user's finger and back to sensing diodes" could then be used to authenticate the fingerprint. In some ways, Apple's patent is very similar to Synaptics' FS9100 optical fingerprint sensing technology, which also is designed to move sensors to underneath the display and allow for fingerprint detection through up to 1mm of glass. The patent illustration below shows how the IR diode could be used to "see" the position of a finger and potentially authenticate it: Image: screenshot: USPTO Another patent illustration (below), shows how IR diodes embedded within the screen can be used to detect fingerprints. Image: Screenshot: USPTO As with all patents, the technology may or may not make it into new products. The patent, suggestive as it is, also isn an indicator of whether the technology is ready or not. And even if the concept is technically feasible, Apple only ever incorporates new technologies when it can produce them at volume. The timing of the patent, however, is nothing if not coincidental as rumors suggest the iPhone 8 will sport an OLED display that stretches from edge-to-edge with minimal bezels. The latest research note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims the iPhone 8 will have a 5-inch screen that fits into a body with roughly the dimensions of the 4.7-inch iPhone 7. The only way for that to be true is for Apple to remove the home button which hogs up a good chunk of the bottom bezel. Removing the home button (or as this patent suggests, relocating it and the Touch ID sensor within the display) could be another step closer to a monolithic iPhone without any buttons.¬† If Apple sticks to its early fall release cycle, we'll know for sure whether any of this stuff is true in about seven months.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: ‚ÄúHow did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!‚Äù WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‚Äò annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with¬†music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008.¬†The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company‚Äôs iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple‚Äôs revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year ‚Äî late because of former CEO Steve Jobs‚Äô reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon.¬†Purchasing Beats would mark Apple‚Äôs largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as ‚Äúextraordinarily bad,‚Äù the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats‚Äô success is due in large part to its wide profit margins ‚Äì despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Yes, that‚Äôs Jessica Alba acting like a Shark, Gwyneth Paltrow feigning interest in an app, and Gary Vaynerchuk chewing out a developer about a business model. Watching the trailer today made me gag a little. I‚Äôm a big fan of everything Apple makes, except for the Apple Watch, that weird iPhone case with the obnoxious bump, and now this series that looks like an infomercial that‚Äôs disguising itself as actual entertainment. When you watch the trailer, you realize that this is a company that already dominates the mobile app landscape along with Google. Making a show about developers coming up with app ideas and then getting investment money seems a little odd. Here‚Äôs what it would be like if another company did that. Let‚Äôs say Ford decided to make a TV show. Maybe the contestants get to choose a new paint color for an upcoming vehicle like the Expedition. OK, sure. You can imagine what that would be like. Multiple shots of the new car. People looking at the new car. The new car driving up the red carpet. The new car hanging out at the bar. You get the idea. It‚Äôs all about the new car. Or what about a Microsoft Surface show? Designers, tasked with making a new logo for an upcoming hardware product, are locked away in a room with the Surface Studio, all with the one goal of...making sure there are multiple shots of the Studio in dim lighting as they work hard on their new designs and try really hard to act serious and concerned. When someone told me Apple was going to make a show, my first thought was -- OK, it will be an actual show ala Netflix or Hulu. I thought, the worst it could possibly get would be the Apple logo coming up before the show starts. The trailer for the new show makes it all look cheesy and inauthentic. Are they trying to appeal to Millennials by having every one of the app developers look like they are fresh out of college? You might want to try not making an infomercial. If anything doesn't work for Millennials, it's cheesy. I‚Äôm also a little surprised these celebs agreed to be hosts. At any point during the making of the show, do you think any of them started wondering if perhaps the company behind the show (that would be Apple) was trying to get people to think more about apps? Did it occur to them that they were not in a real show with actual drama, but more of a fake show with fake drama? HP at least made an infomercial with Christian Slater that looks like a commercial, even if the entire segment has the feel of an NBC drama. I‚Äôm not saying I watched the entire series (it‚Äôs in four parts for a total of around six minutes) but it looks like it‚Äôs trying to be cheeky. And, it looks like it‚Äôs also trying to sell some printers, and I get that. It‚Äôs an infomercial. Apple, the entire concept of making original shows or movies is suspect. You‚Äôre not Universal. You‚Äôre not HBO. You're not even Hulu. We‚Äôre fine watching entertainment on our phones and tablets, but being an amazing tech company and gadget innovator does not mean you are Steven Spielberg.

The iPhone-maker released a trailer for "Planet of the Apps" this week, a show where app-makers pitch ideas to a panel of judges, including celebrities-turned-entrepreneurs Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow and Will.i.am. The reality show seeks to portray app developers as modern-day rock stars. But Eli Schiff, a technology design consultant, tweeted that the show was a "huge slap in the face" to the "near-death" independent developer community. Tweet: Everything wrong with Apple. Celebrity worship, cheesiness and being total out of touch with reality. Tweet: this is everything that's wrong with Apple right now. Unoriginal, pretentious and forgetting who their real audience is. Schiff wasn't alone ‚Äî social media lit up with reactions to the trailer, posted on YouTube. Steven Peterson, founder of transit app Routesy, said he auditioned for the show but wasn't ultimately selected ‚Äî and now, he doesn't feel too bad about it. "The 'mentors,' while they are successful, don't seem at first glance to have much app experience. I don't want to dismiss them outright," Peterson said. "I'd much rather get mentorship from experts in the field. Apple should certainly have enough credibility to have access to those people, but this is about television." Peterson told CNBC that like the similar show, "Shark Tank," the core audience of "Planet of the Apps" doesn't seem to be entrepreneurs. Authenticity is key for Apple to make the show's premise exciting, Product Hunt founder Ryan Hoover wrote last year. "I think that everyone has apps on their phone, so that's something people can easily relate to, and this is trying to put a sexy shine on the 'sausage-making,'" Peterson said. "Also, I know from doing this for so long that every single person has an app idea." Genady Okrain, the founder of GIF-sharing app Momento, said the show "makes a joke" of the hard work of founding an app. In a post, Facebook engineer Lee Byron compared the show to HBO's parody on the tech community, "Silicon Valley." Not everyone was sour on the show, with many noting they'd be tuning in to Apple Music. CNBC reached out to Apple for comment. Tweet: Great show to watch @ Applefor designer developers and entrepreneurs Still, the show comes at a time when both original content and software developers are more important than ever to the company's future. Apple CEO Tim Cook told investors in January that he hopes to double Apple's services revenue over the next four years, helped in part by selling and distributing content. He highlighted that the developer community has earned a total of $60 billion, as the company has provided new ways for developers to make money there. But with 2 million apps and limited screen space, developers have told CNBC it can be hard for small developers to make a dent in the App Store. Giant publishers like Tencent, Google, Facebook and Alibaba dominated worldwide downloads on iOS in the first quarter, according to research by Sensor Tower. "It's sad," Okrain said. Disclosure: CNBC owns the exclusive off-network cable rights to "Shark Tank."

David A. Graham Feb 15, 2017 Ian Bogost Feb 9, 2017 Technology Share Tweet ‚Ä¶ LinkedIn Email Print Text Size Apple has great design is the biggest myth in technology today. The latest victim of this ideology comes in the form a remarkable report on the late Steve Jobs‚Äôs final project, still in production: a new, $5 billion Cupertino headquarters for Apple Inc. Writing for Reuters, Julia Love outlines the campus‚Äôs ‚Äúastonishing attention to detail.‚Äù Vents and pipes remain obscured from reflection in the structure‚Äôs massive, curved-glass fa√ßade. Thick guidebooks regulate the usage of wood. Structural seams are held to a standards measuring a fraction of normal construction tolerances. Individual ceiling panels require multi-step approval. A door handle‚Äîthe project‚Äôs first deliverable‚Äîis rejected for sub-nanometer imperfections. Even the empty spaces of thresholds are subjected to meticulous attention: One of the most vexing features was the doorways, which Apple wanted to be perfectly flat, with no threshold. The construction team pushed back, but Apple held firm. The rationale? If engineers had to adjust their gait while entering the building, they risked distraction from their work, according to a former construction manager. Love compares Apple‚Äôs construction design process to that of its product design. The building is meant to be ‚Äúas flawless as a hand-held device,‚Äù she writes, a process supposedly brought about by ‚Äútreating the construction of the vast complex the same way they approach the design of pocket-sized electronics.‚Äù The only problem with this conclusion: Apple has never accomplished sufficiently great design in its electronics to justify lionizing the pedantry of design at the new Apple campus. * * * At base, such a claim seems preposterous. In 1977, the Apple II made the microcomputer useful and affordable. In 1984, the Macintosh made the computer more usable by the everyperson thanks to the graphical user interface. In 2001, the iPod fit a music library in a pocket. In 2007, the iPhone made computing portable (and obsessive). Steve Jobs‚Äôs design philosophy was fascist more than it was exacting. But if Apple designs at its best when attending closely to details like those revealed in the construction of its spaceship headquarters, then presumably the details of its products would stand out as worthy precedents. Yet, when this premise is tested, it comes up wanting. In truth, Apple‚Äôs products hide a shambles of bad design under the perfection of sleek exteriors. Take Apple‚Äôs late-2016 MacBook Pro, its latest flagship laptop. The new model ships only with USB-C ports. But all of Apple‚Äôs current devices, including the iPhone 7 and a rechargeable Bluetooth keyboard and mouse come with USB-A cables, which cannot connect to the new laptop. A replacement cable can be had‚Äî for $20. Over time, this problem will work itself out as USB-C replaces USB-A entirely. But if good design is in the details, why should anyone spending thousands of dollars on a supposedly well-designed machine have to wait on the details? The iPhone is no better off. Starting with the iPhone 5S, first released in 2014, Apple adopted a software-controlled fingerprint sensor mounted on the home button. Known as Touch ID, the feature allows users to authenticate to unlock the phone, download products from the App Store, and make payments at participating retailers with Apple Pay. But even the slightest disturbance on a finger makes Touch ID unreliable. Washed your hands recently? Ate a banana? Dug in the dirt of the garden? Touched something too warm, or too cold, for too long? Good luck authenticating with your fingerprint. A mere inconvenience when unlocking the phone, but Apple Pay won‚Äôt work at all without Touch ID. So fat chance using that new digital wallet on a rainy day, or after tactilely interacting with worldly substances. And what about autocorrect? As funny as it once was to guffaw over its foibles, the feature hasn‚Äôt become smarter, so much as its users have become more acclimated to managing its errors when writing and reading smartphone-composed messages. How much typing has become retyping, correcting corrections. One of Apple‚Äôs solutions to the problem, revealed in a 2016 patent filing: just to punt, highlighting corrected words and inviting an interlocutor to ‚Äúrequest clarification.‚Äù Likewise, the larger, 4.7-inch screens offered since the 2014 iPhone 6 made reaching the edges of the screen with one palm difficult, even for users with large hands. Apple‚Äôs solution, dubbed Reachability, was an awkward one: double-tapping the home button would lurch the whole screen down for easier address. Some Apple fanatics will blame these more recent misfortunes of design on the vacuum created by Steve Jobs‚Äôs death. After all, his tight control over the company‚Äôs products was legendary. But this explanation isn‚Äôt sufficient. After all, Apple‚Äôs design chief Jony Ive, who is considered to have taken over Jobs‚Äôs design dogmatism, has remained in charge of the company‚Äôs design efforts throughout Tim Cook‚Äôs tenure as CEO. And moreover, Apple products‚Äô inattention to detail in design was already easy to see during the Jobs era anyway. Take the iPod. It made listening to a whole music library easy, but iTunes always made managing that library difficult and confusing‚Äîeven destructive. In fact, most Apple software fails to meet the design standard set by the devices on which they run. Mail still can‚Äôt search for emails effectively or accurately. On the desktop, iMessage frequently stops working; on the iPhone, it successfully sends less reliably than text messages once did, particularly when reception is poor. Keynote, Apple‚Äôs PowerPoint alternative, randomly changes the formatting of text in presentation notes‚Äîa charming surprise to discover during an actual keynote. iWork, the Apple office app suite of which Keynote is a part, never came close to competing with Microsoft and Google‚Äôs commensurate products, horrid though both of them are, nor even in achieving the elegant simplicity of its ancestors like AppleWorks. The same invisible doorways lead to and from the authorized chambers of work and gardens of leisure. So exacting!¬†¬† Apple‚Äôs Jobs-era hardware also failed to meet the scrupulousness for which it is nevertheless worshipped. In 2010, when the iPhone 4‚Äôs antenna design produced reception issues, Jobs famously told impacted users to just to ‚Äúhold the phone differently.‚Äù In 2008, he revealed the first run of the impossibly-thin MacBook Air by sliding it dramatically out of a manila envelope. Amazing! Less so, but not shown: the inch-thick power adapter needed to charge the device. Apple still hasn‚Äôt even attempted to reduce the size‚Äîand particularly the bulky thickness‚Äîof its power supplies, even as it has systematically reduced the girth of its computers. * * * Steve Jobs‚Äôs design philosophy was fascist more than it was exacting. The man was a not a demigod of design, but its dictator. He made things get made the way he wanted them made, and his users appreciated his definitiveness and lack of compromise. They mistook those conceits for virtues in the objects themselves. And enjoyed it. At a time when every company bows to even the most absurd demands of the consumer, Apple never cared what its customers thought, or wanted. Instead it told them what to like, and how to like it. What a relief! The corporate design autocracy obviates the need for decision-making. Computer users won‚Äôt use floppy disks because there is no floppy drive. Later, likewise optical drives. Later, likewise mini-stereo headphone jacks. To ascribe such choices to design‚Äîor to courage‚Äîis a mistake. As I have argued before, Apple is expert at getting people to commit to Apple‚Äôs future without pondering how technology could have evolved differently. In the process, Apple standardized excellence in design at the surface level, while failing to achieve that distinction holistically. Apple‚Äôs products are beautiful objects, no doubt. But beautiful objects whose operation never matched their appearance. Beautiful objects that lied about the depths of that beauty. And in that lie lies an important, if accidental lesson of Apple‚Äôs obsessions in the new spaceship officeplex. The attention to detail around door handles and thresholds might feel like a design methodology so pedantic at the micro-level that it could only ever produce greatness at the macro. But one could also compare the zombified reality of Apple workers plodding to work over the carefully unperturbed thresholds in their new spaceship headquarters to the sleepy drone of an army built to abide rather than to think, let alone think different. The same invisible doorways lead to and from the authorized chambers of work and gardens of leisure. So exacting!¬†¬† Ironically, such design amounts to an inversion of the company‚Äôs famous 1984 Super Bowl ad for the original Macintosh. In the ad, Apple‚Äôs exuberant individualism destroys the tedious uniformity of an unnamed foe, implied to be IBM. But as time has worn on, Apple‚Äôs wares have become increasingly collectivist and uniform, not to mention inoperative‚Äîeven as the company has somehow gotten credit only for innovation and performance. It has inspired that uniformity in competing products too. Every vagrant entrepreneur in the local coffee house has the same gray (or rose gold) laptop and the same black (or rose gold) phone, no matter their makes or models. Like every Apple product, the company‚Äôs new headquarters is a monolith meant to be worshiped at sight and by touch. Just don‚Äôt ask too many questions about how it works in practice. And work it surely will. Borg-like, the black, glass Apple mothership, with its perfect ceiling panels and regulated wood veneers, will shroud its engineers in the safe comfort of an unperturbed gait, such that they might yet craft the identical, future devices that shall still inspire the indistinguishable software that will yet run on them, so you and I might rejoice in their splendor.

Donald Trump‚Äôs 2016 campaign was a work of virtuoso improvisation: Even though it seemed to be in permanent chaos, with frequent changes of leadership, perpetual gaffes, and a strategy devised on the fly, the Republican managed to defeat the elaborate, best-and-brightest, data-wonk team of Hillary Clinton. If the early indications hold, it doesn‚Äôt look like Trump is going to fly on a wing and a prayer again in 2020.

Nothing Donald Trump has done since becoming President is particularly surprising. The attacks on judges and the press, the clash of civilizations worldview, the ignorance of public policy, the blurring of government service and private gain, the endless lying, the incompetence, the chaos‚Äîall were vividly foreshadowed during the campaign. The Republican-led ¬†Congress‚Äô refusal to challenge Trump was foreseeable too. The number of Republicans willing to oppose Trump‚Äôs agenda pretty much equals the number who refused to endorse him once he became the GOP nominee. Less predictable has been the response of other elements of the American political system: The bureaucracy, the press, the judiciary and the public. Here, the news is good.

The 45th president has visibly aged over the past four years. He rests heavily on his daughter Ivanka‚Äôs arm during his infrequent public appearances. Fortunately for him, he did not need to campaign hard for reelection. His has been a popular presidency: Big tax cuts, big spending, and big deficits have worked their familiar expansive magic. Wages have grown strongly in the Trump years, especially for men without a college degree, even if rising inflation is beginning to bite into the gains.

Graham Is the gusher of leaks about the White House the work of bureaucrats who want to undermine the president? And if so, is that a good or bad thing? To paraphrase presidential candidate Donald Trump, somebody‚Äôs doing the leaking. But who, and why, and does it represent a defense of American democratic norms or a death knell for them? There‚Äôs no shortage of theories. Some of the damaging leaks are emerging from the White House, as part of internecine warfare between rival factions. But the more consequential ones, including the revelations that forced the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn Monday night, have hinged on information from the intelligence community. Trump has tried to change the focus away from the substance of the leaks and to their provenance. On Tuesday, he tweeted this: The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc? ‚Äî Donald J.

The immediate question raised by the latest information published by The New York Times is: What next? Will Congress investigate? Will it subpoena records, including the tax records that may clarify the financial obligations‚Äîif any‚ÄîDonald Trump has to Russia? And since Congress is so dominated by one party, that first question raises a follow-up and more specific question: What will the leaders of the Republican Party in Congress do? In the first shock of the news about the Trump team‚Äôs communications with Russian spies, Republican leaders are expressing revulsion and resolve. They expressed similar emotions after the shock of the ‚Äúgrab them by the pussy‚Äù recording. Then they collapsed. Remember, the Republican rank-and-file remain much more intensely committed to Trump and the presidency than to their leaders in Congress. Fox News and talk radio are busily concocting rationalizations and distractions. Donald Trump will still be president a week from now‚Äîand he has many tools by which to retaliate against his perceived opponents in the intelligence services. Unless Congress revolts against him, he could well prevail, destroying the integrity and independence of law enforcement and counter-intelligence in the process.

Tuesday evening, The New York Times reported that associates of then-candidate Donald Trump, including within his presidential campaign, had had ‚Äúrepeated‚Äù contact with Russian intelligence officials, and that American intelligence and law-enforcement officials had records of intercepted communications to prove it. The news came a day after Michael Flynn resigned as Trump‚Äôs national security adviser after having misled the vice president about the substance of his own conversations with the Russian ambassador prior to Trump‚Äôs inauguration. The nature of the contacts the Times disclosed Tuesday were murky; the four current and former officials who described them to the paper declined to specify what, exactly, those contacts entailed; how many people were involved and who all of them were; and what their aims might have been. American intelligence had been investigating the possibility of collusion between Trump aides and Russian intelligence, but the Times report noted that the officials interviewed had ‚Äúseen no evidence of such cooperation.‚Äù Continue Reading Kevin Lemarque / Reuters These 23 Republicans Passed on a Chance to Get Trump's Tax Returns Conor Friedersdorf Congress has a duty to make sure President Trump isn‚Äôt selling out the United States.

Targeting Priebus, who leads the faction of Trump aides that is composed of experienced establishment political hands, is really just a stand-in for a larger conflict about the future of Trumpism in the White House. Breitbart News is treating Flynn‚Äôs ouster as the first salvo in a war against those in the administration they deem insufficiently loyal to Trump.

Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies TV Politics Business MWC 2017 ¬† ¬† Apple Joins Wireless Power Consortium Posted: Feb 14 2017, 11:33am CST | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple ¬† ¬† Apple gave its enthusiasts a valentine present, a news of a very recent proceeding of events. iPhone lovers rejoiced as the news of Apple Inc becoming a part of Wireless Power Consortium were published. Yes, what was only known as a baseless rumor is now turning into a hope, the unannounced Apple iPhone 8 may very well be featuring the wireless charging feature. Don't Miss:¬†Latest Science and Medical Discoveries Apple, along with 212 other members of the consortium, is now going to add their two-cents about Qi wireless charging standards. We also received an update from the officials that Apple mentioned the use of an augmented version of Qi when it applied to patent the inductive charging concept for their Apple Watch. Increased activity in the field suggests that Apple is looking to dip the iPhone in the same waters in future. Though standard Qi-implemented chargers will be useless on a device using this tweaked version that Apple has developed. As usual, Apple did not release any word on why the company decided to take the step. However, an official from Apple Inc did confirm the news in an interview for the ‚ÄúBusiness Insider‚Äù magazine. Apple has been taking part in several standard development committees so there is a slight chance that this might be a regular field-day for the company.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Feb 14, 2017 at 2:12PM Investors have known for quite some time that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is pushing into original content, primarily as a way to differentiate its Apple Music service from rival music streamers. Apple has been investing in a handful of new TV shows that will be exclusive to Apple Music, and the first two are almost here. The first is a reality TV series that focuses on apps and app developers, called Planet of the Apps. Celebrity advisors Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow, Gary Vaynerchuk, and¬†will.i.am will offer to guide new developers in an effort to win funding from prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners, which incidentally is about to make a fortune on an app it funded years ago:¬†Snap. Apple started casting for the show last summer, which is kind of like The Voice mixed with Shark Tank but for apps. Speaking at the Code Media conference last night, Apple services chief Eddy Cue said the show would debut in the spring on Apple Music as well as through a dedicated app. Episodes will be released in a linear fashion, one at a time (sorry, binge watchers). The second is Carpool Karaoke, which is based on the popular segment of the same name from The Late Late Show with James Corden. This one was already publicized, as no one can forget CEO Tim Cook singing "Sweet Home Alabama" at WWDC last year before confirming that the series was coming to Apple Music. The show will feature 16 celebrity hosts, and will likewise be released weekly instead of all at once. Personally, neither show looks particularly compelling to me. But that's precisely the challenge that Apple now faces. If the strategy fails, it will fail (relatively) cheaply Given the extremely diverse spectrum of consumer preferences when it comes to video content, Apple will need to create content across a wide range of genres that appeal to a wide range of consumers if the company truly wants to position original content as a differentiator and selling feature in a meaningful way. As Apple Music expands around the world, Apple will also need to localize content and cater to local preferences in geographical regions all around the world. That's expensive, and a tough balance even for pure-play media companies that specialize in and have deep experience with content. Apple has neither, even if it has deep pockets. Furthermore, the company has made it quite clear that it its content strategy is intended to bolster Apple Music, and has no intention to launch a stand-alone video streaming service (although not for a lack of trying). Besides, who subscribes to a music service specifically in order to get video content? Apple Music. Image source: Apple. However, there is some potential for Planet of the Apps to inspire a new generation of developers, which would be a secondary benefit. Apple relies heavily on its army of third-party developers to keep its digital repositories flush with app content, and culturally reinforcing its pipeline of developers is a good thing. The show may serve in part as a giant episodic marketing campaign to come develop for iOS. This is likely just the beginning for Apple, and presumably the company will diversify its content strategy further going forward. Fortunately for investors, the risks are fairly modest for a company of this size. While shows are expensive -- a season can easily cost tens of millions of dollars -- they're much less than if Apple were to pursue some sort of theoretical blockbuster acquisition around video streaming. On top of that, Apple Music's revenue run rate is in excess of $2.4 billion right now, based on the 20 million subscribers it disclosed in December. I still think the original content strategy is misguided, but at least the financial risks are small if it fails. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

At a Glance Apple has a major iPhone redesign planned for 2017, with a glass body and edge-to-edge OLED display that includes an integrated Touch ID fingerprint sensor and front-facing camera. The new iPhone may be sold alongside upgraded (but standard) 4.7 and 5.5-inch iPhones. Expected Features OLED display Faster A11 processor Glass body Edge-to-edge display Camera and Touch ID integrated in display No Home button Wireless charging Three models - One OLED, two standard Updated 8 hours ago Highlight Recent Changes Yes No Subscribe for regular MacRumors news and future iPhone 8 (2017) info. Apple's iPhone 8 - Coming in 2017 Contents Apple's iPhone 8 - Coming in 2017 Naming Design Water Resistance Mockups and Concepts Display Processor Wireless Charging Other Features Biometrics Storage Taptic Engine 3D Touch Battery Life Cameras Siri Release Date Beyond the iPhone 8 iPhone 8 (2017) Timeline 2017 will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone and Apple has something major planned to celebrate the occasion. We've got several months to go until the launch of the iPhone 8, but because of Apple's ambitious plans for the device, there are already an abundance of rumors hinting at the impressive features coming in the 2017 iPhone. Apple is rumored to be testing more than 10 prototype iPhone models, so it's not entirely clear what we're going to see, and because there are so many test devices in play, rumors are also conflicting and murky at this time. Rumors suggest it's going to be a radical redesign, with an edge-to-edge display that does away with the top and bottom bezels where features like the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and the front-facing camera are housed. Instead, Touch ID and the camera may be built directly into the display, meaning there will be no Home button. Jony Ive has wanted to introduce an iPhone that looks like a single sheet of glass for several years, and glass is also necessary if Apple wants to introduce wireless charging. With an edge-to-edge design, the iPhone 8 may be similar in size to the 4.7-inch iPhone, but with a display the size of the 5.5-inch iPhone. Rumors suggest it will feature a 5.8-inch display with 5.15 inches of usable area, with the rest dedicated to virtual buttons that will replace the existing Home button. The display itself is said to be flexible plastic OLED rather than an LCD, allowing Apple to introduce a thinner device that consumes less power and offers a better display with higher contrast ratio and more true to life colors. It may also feature edges that are curved on both sides like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, but rumors are unclear on this point. Should the display have curved edges, the edges could respond to touch gestures. As for the body, rumors suggest Apple is finally going to move away from the aluminum used in the iPhone 5, 5s, 6, 6s, 7, and SE, instead re-adopting a glass body that's similar to the body that was used in the iPhone 4. At least one iPhone model coming in 2017 will use a glass body, according to Apple supplier Catcher Technology, and according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the glass will be built around an aluminum or stainless steel frame. Edge-to-edge iPhone concept image via ConceptsiPhone Like the iPhone 7, the iPhone 8 is expected to be water resistant, but it may have an improved IP68 water resistance rating. It will continue to be able to hold up to rain, splashes, and brief submersion in water. Inside, the iPhone 8 is expected to have a 10-nanometer A11 chip that will be both faster and more efficient, plus rumors suggest it could also include features like wireless charging and biometric additions like iris, facial, or gesture recognition. In higher-end models with a dual-lens camera, both lenses are expected to feature optical image stabilization. Apple is said to be planning to position the OLED iPhone 8 as a ~5-inch "premium" model that will perhaps be sold alongside standard 4.7 and 5.5-inch iPhone models with traditional LCD screens. All three models may include glass bodies and wireless charging (though rumors disagree on this point), but it is unclear if the two LCD models will feature the same curved edge-to-edge display rumored for the higher-end device and what differentiating features will be included. Rumors suggest the OLED iPhone is going to be pricy, with multiple rumors referring to it as "premium" and one rumor suggesting it could sell for upwards of $1,000, which is a good deal more expensive than previous iPhones. The iPhone 8 is still under development and will likely launch in the fall of 2017, and in the months ahead of its launch, we'll undoubtedly learn more about the specs of the device. Naming Following Apple's standard naming scheme, with a numeric increase during even years to mark external design changes and an "S" increase during odd years to denote internal feature updates only, the 2017 iPhone would be called the "iPhone 7s." Given the major changes Apple plans to introduce to the iPhone in 2017, it seems unlikely the device will receive an "S" name, so there's a good chance Apple may decide to skip directly to the next full number, naming the 2017 iPhone the iPhone 8. 2007 - iPhone 2008 - iPhone 3G 2009 - iPhone 3GS 2010 - iPhone 4 (new design) 2011 - iPhone 4s 2012 - iPhone 5 (new design) 2013 - iPhone 5s 2014 - iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus (new design) 2015 - iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus 2016 - iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus 2017 - iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus iPhone 8 is a tentative name for the device -- it has not yet been confirmed by Apple -- but it seems to be the most logical choice for a major update. There's always the possibility Apple will call it something else or make 2017 the year it moves away from a numbered iPhone naming scheme. Work on the 2017 iPhone is said to be taking place in Israel, and one report suggests employees at the facility are calling the device "iPhone 8," but it continues to be unclear as to whether that's the official name Apple will go with. Apple is also rumored to be planning to produce a total of three iPhone models in 2017, further confusing the potential naming scheme. As two these devices could perhaps be similar in style to the existing iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, sold alongside the flagship OLED model, some rumors suggest they could be called the "iPhone 7s" and an "iPhone 7s Plus." In that case, we'd have an iPhone 7s, and iPhone 7s Plus, and an iPhone 8 or some other name like iPhone X or iPhone Pro. Design For the iPhone 8, Apple is rumored to be planning to move away from the aluminum body that it's been using since 2012 in an effort to differentiate the iPhone from the devices that have come before it. Apple is expected to instead re-adopt the glass-backed body last used for the iPhone 4s. Glass is more fragile and heavier than aluminum, but many advances have been made in glass technology and materials like Gorilla Glass are sturdier than ever, which may help prevent breakage. Multiple rumors have suggested there will be three versions of the iPhone: a "premium" OLED model and two standard LCD devices, with sizes that may include 4.7, 5 (OLED), and 5.5 inches. While one model (the high-end OLED device) will feature a glass body, rumors disagree on what the other two models will be made from. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has shared several accurate rumors about Apple's design plans in the past, all three iPhones will feature the same glass-bodied design, with glass instead of aluminum used for the body of the device. Kuo also believes a stainless steel frame will be used in the higher-end iPhone, while less expensive models may get an aluminum frame, but he believes all three models will use glass. DigiTimes, citing sources within the Taiwanese supply chain, has also predicted Apple will adopt a glass body with a stainless steel frame for improved sturdiness in the iPhone 8. The iPhone 4 and 4s, made with a glass back, also used a stainless steel frame. The iPhone 4, introduced in 2010 Japanese site Nikkei also believes Apple will use glass for all three of the iPhones that are in development, but other sources have suggested only one -- the OLED model -- will have a glass body, while others continue to use an aluminum body. The CEO of Apple supplier Catcher Technology, Allen Horng, has said "only one model" will adopt a glass casing in 2017, suggesting other non-glass iPhones are in the works. Japanese site Mac Otakara has suggested Apple will sell a 4.7 and 5.5-inch aluminum "iPhone 7s" and "iPhone 7 Plus" with a design that's largely unchanged from the iPhone 7 with the exception of a new red color option, and DigiTimes predicts a 4.7-inch "iPhone 7s" with an aluminum body to be sold alongside a 5.8-inch OLED iPhone with a glass body and a 5.5-inch model of an unspecified material. There are two possible outcomes based on the rumors we're hearing: Either we get three iPhones with glass bodies and wireless charging, with extra features to set the OLED model apart from the standard models, or we get a single OLED model with a glass body sold alongside two standard aluminum devices. Size wise, while the OLED iPhone will use a larger display panel because it includes no bezels, it may be similar in size to the 4.7-inch iPhone. Apple is also said to be planning to sell a standard 4.7-inch iPhone and a larger 5.5-inch iPhone. Water Resistance The iPhone 8 may feature an IP68 water resistance rating, an improvement over the IP67 certification earned by the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. Like the Galaxy S7, which is also IP68 certified, the iPhone 8 might be able to withstand 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes while also offering full dust protection. That means it will continue to hold up to splashes and brief immersion in water, but customers should still make an effort to avoid water as Apple's iPhone 7 warranty does not cover water damage and it's likely the iPhone 8 warranty will also exclude water damage. Mockups and Concepts It's too early for iPhone 8 part leaks, but many designers have made mockups and concepts imagining what the iPhone 8 might look like based on current rumors. While many of the concepts include fanciful ideas that Apple is unlikely to introduce in an iPhone 8, the images and videos give us an idea of what an edge-to-edge display with an integrated Home button might look like. We've included a few of the best concepts here in the roundup, but make sure to check out our dedicated post for a more comprehensive look at what designers are dreaming up. Display At least one iPhone 8 model is expected to include a flexible OLED display and Apple has already signed a deal with Samsung to produce OLED displays for devices set to debut in 2017. Samsung will provide Apple with an estimated 160 million OLED panels to be used for the rumored ~5-inch OLED iPhone. That will account for approximately 80 percent of all the panels used for the device, and while other companies like AU Optronics, Sharp, Japan Display are working on OLED displays, they won't be ready for production until 2018, meaning Apple will need to rely heavily on Samsung in 2017. An OLED display eliminates the need for the backlighting that's used in traditional LCDs, which would allow Apple to cut down on the thickness and weight of the display used in the device. OLED displays can also be flexible, perhaps allowing Apple to create a device with a more curved or wraparound display. OLED displays offer better contrast ratio, truer colors, improved viewing angles, better power efficiency to maximize battery life, and a faster response time than an LCD for faster refresh rates. On the downside, OLED displays don't have the lifespan of an LCD display and they're more prone to water damage, two issues Apple will need to overcome. Apple already uses OLED displays in the Apple Watch. The Apple Watch has an AMOLED display There are multiple rumors about the size and type of the panels Apple will be using, and rumors indicate Apple is testing more than 10 iPhone prototypes. One rumor suggests Samsung is supplying Apple with 5.5-inch OLED panels, while another says Apple is seeking a 5.8-inch OLED display to be used in one of the iPhone 8 models. In addition to conflicting information on the display size of the iPhone, there's also mixed information available on the design of the display. On the whole, it's sounding like the display will perhaps be somewhat curved and edge-to-edge with no bezel, but rumors have been all over the place. We'll need to wait for additional information to get a clear picture of what to expect from the device, but some possibilities are listed below. Multiple rumors suggest Apple will implement an edge-to-edge display, which means the iPhone will have no top, bottom, or side bezels, with the display taking up the entire front of the device. It will look like a single piece of glass. Sensors like Touch ID and the front-facing camera will be embedded in the display, invisible to the naked eye, and there will be no iconic Home button on the device. Apple has been working on developing touch and display driver (TDDI) chips since 2015, so it's definitely possible that the iPhone 8 will have no Home button, and Apple has also patented a method for embedding Touch ID and an ambient light sensor in the display. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the OLED iPhone 8 will feature a 5.8-inch display, but with no bezels, that 5.8-inch display will fit a device that's similar in size to the 4.7-inch iPhone 7. Kuo believes the iPhone 8 will have 5.15 inches of active screen space, with the additional space taken up by virtual buttons that replace the current physical Home button and other features. He lays out his size predictions in the diagram below: Based on Kuo's description, the iPhone 8 can be thought of as having a screen the size of the 5.5-inch iPhone in a form factor that's the size of the 4.7-inch iPhone. Imagining an iPhone 7 Plus that features just a display and no bezels is a good way of conceptualizing what the iPhone 8 might look like. With the edge-to-edge display, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes Apple will continue to use a 2.5D curved display, like the existing display in the iPhone 7. Kuo does not believe we will see a curved display, but other rumors have predicted dramatic curves that cover the sides of the device. Based on information sourced from the Asian supply chain, IHS analyst Kevin Wang, for example, believes the 2017 iPhone will include a "dual-curve" OLED display that covers the left and right edges of the device. It is not clear from Wang's statement how far the display will extend to the edges of the device or whether it will be a subtle curve for design purposes or a functional wraparound display as Samsung uses in its Galaxy Edge devices. Should Apple use a display with curved edges, it may also implement new touchscreen technology that would allow the edges of the device to respond to touch gestures. As previously mentioned, Apple is rumored to be planning on debuting three devices, one premium model with an OLED display and two standard models that use traditional LCD panels. While there is confusion over the size of the OLED panel, the LCD iPhones are expected to be 4.7 and 5.5 inches, the same sizes as the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. All of the information above largely applies to the iPhone with an OLED display -- it's not entirely clear if the standard LCD models that are rumored will share the same display design or will use a traditional 2.5D flat display like the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Processor TSMC has begun to tape out the design for the A11 chip built on a 10-nanometer process, completing the first stages of the design that is likely destined for the 2017 iPhone. Certification for the 10-nanometer process is expected to be achieved in late 2016, with the first 10-nanometer chips sent to Apple for validation during the first quarter of 2017. TSMC has reportedly secured all orders for the A11 chip. An A11 chip, like all of Apple's chip upgrades, will be both faster and more energy efficient, in addition to being smaller. Wireless Charging Early iPhone 8 rumors suggested Apple was working on long-range wireless charging technology that could be implemented as soon as 2017, but more recent information and speculation suggests that instead of long-range wireless charging techniques, Apple will instead use an inductive-style wireless charging solution (similar to the Apple Watch) for the device. Apple recently joined the Wireless Power Consortium, which is committed to the open development of the Qi wireless charging standard that's widely used in devices like the Samsung Galaxy line, and Apple has filed dozens of patents for inductive charging. Dozens of hires with expertise in wireless charging have also joined the company in recent months. The company's plan to use a glass body hints that inductive charging will be used, as glass would be required to allow charging through a magnetic coil. With an aluminum body, inductive charging would not work as well. There's also evidence that Apple is seeking components that point towards an inductive charging solution. Lite-On Semiconductor is rumored to be providing integrated chip components for the wireless charging module in the iPhone 8. The manufacturer will reportedly supply bridge rectifiers needed to reduce thermal issues and maintain efficiency in wireless power transmission, and Apple is also perhaps sourcing components from MediaTek, Foxconn, Pegatron, and Luxshare. In addition to confusion over the charging method Apple will use, there are also questions about how it will be implemented. It's been assumed that it will be built into the iPhone, but we've heard a few rumors that suggest the wireless charging capabilities will be enabled through a separate accessory that needs to be purchased separately. Most recently, Japanese site Mac Otakara said Apple would use a wireless charging accessory designed using technology sourced from Luxshare, a company that has reportedly provided components for the Apple Watch in the past. It's possible Apple considered long-range wireless charging techniques but has not yet been able to perfect the solution, which would explain the mixed rumors. Long-range wireless charging technology offers the benefit of not requiring a charging source, but there are obstacles to overcome such as the loss of power transfer efficiency that occurs when the distance between the transmitter and the receiver is increased. This causes batteries further away from a charging source to charge more slowly. There was speculation suggesting Apple is working with a partner, possibly Energous, a company that's developed a long-range wireless charging solution called WattUp, but there's been no hard evidence. Energous CEO Steve Rizzone has encouraged such rumors claiming the company has inked a deal with "one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world," but it continues to be unclear if that partner is Apple. Regardless of the wireless charging method used, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that all new iPhones are likely to support wireless charging next year, including the 4.7-inch model, the larger 5.5-inch model, and the high-end OLED model. Japanese site Mac Otakara disagrees, however, and says wireless charging will only be available in the higher-end OLED iPhone. Other Features Biometrics According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who often accurately predicts Apple's plans, the iPhone 8 could include more advanced biometric features such as facial recognition or iris scanning. Kuo has not elaborated on what additional biometric features would be used for, but presumably these would be alternate methods for accessing the iPhone or adding additional layers of protection. Kuo also believes Apple will introduce new Touch ID technology for the iPhone 8, which will be built under the glass of the display and will "enhance transactions security." He predicts Apple will switch from a capacitive Touch ID system to an optical system. Citing unnamed "industry sources" Taiwanese site DigiTimes claims the iPhone 8 will include iris scanning technology, allowing users to unlock their devices with an eye scan. DigiTimes originally said the iris scanning function would not be ready until 2018, but later updated that prediction to 2017. The site does not have the most solid track record when it comes to Apple rumors, so it remains unclear if iris scanning is something we can expect this year. Apple is rumored to be sourcing iris scanning chips from Taiwan-based supplier Xintec, with Xintec planning to begin mass production on the component in 2017. According to Fast Company, Apple is working with Lumentum to develop 3D sensing technology that will be included in the iPhone 8, but it is not clear how the feature will be used. It could be used for facial recognition, augmented reality, or camera improvements. Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri believes the iPhone 8 could include facial and gesture recognition capabilities, which could be powered by a laser and infrared sensor located near the front-facing camera. Storage The iPhone 8 is expected to include NAND flash memory from Samsung, but it is not clear what improvements it might bring. With the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Apple introduced a 256GB storage option, and it's possible additional increases could be included in the iPhone 8. One rumor has suggested the iPhone 8 will include increased storage space, which could make the device more expensive than previous-generation iPhone models. Taptic Engine An enhanced Taptic engine is one of the features that could be included in the 2017 iPhone, according to a report from Japanese site Nikkei. Apple is said to be working on a "high-performance motor" that's able to "create more complex tactile vibrations." Such an engine would perhaps be necessary if Apple is indeed eliminating the Home button in the iPhone 8, as has been rumored. Haptic feedback could offer vibrations to denote triggers like the unlocking of the iPhone and the confirmation of a Touch ID payment, two features currently tied to the physical iPhone Home button. 3D Touch With Apple implementing glass bodies for the iPhone and introducing at least one OLED display, new 3D Touch technology may be required. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple will need to use a new 3D Touch module with "additional graphite sheet lamination" for heat reduction. Battery Life We've heard few rumors on the prospective battery life of the iPhone 8, but one rumor from Fast Company says the device will include a "far bigger battery," which could result in improved battery life. A larger battery could also be implemented to power features like an OLED display or new biometric features that are rumored, though, so longer battery life is not a guarantee. Apple is said to be planning to use a stacked logic board design that will support longer battery life. With the improved logic board, the iPhone 8 will be able to offer the same battery life traditionally available in the 5.5-inch iPhone in a device the size of the 4.7-inch iPhone. An L-shaped two-cell battery pack with a capacity around 2,700 mAh could be included. Battery life could be further improved through the use of a more energy efficient OLED panel. Cameras KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that the dual-lens camera introduced in the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus will continue to be a feature exclusive to "high-end" iPhone models in 2017. Kuo predicts a 4.7-inch iPhone with a single camera, a 5.5-inch model with a dual-lens camera, and an OLED model in an unspecified size with a dual-lens camera. He believes that future models will include optical image stabilization (OIS) for both the wide-angle and telephoto lenses. In the iPhone 7 Plus, only the wide-angle lens features OIS. The camera in the 2017 iPhone could also support 3D photography effects if Apple opts to use an LG camera module. According to Japanese site Mac Otakara, the high-end 5-inch iPhone Apple plans on introducing could adopt a new vertical dual camera arrangement instead of a horizontal dual camera system. Mac Otakara's information is sourced from a Taiwanese supplier and has not yet been corroborated by a second source. It's not clear why Apple would switch from a horizontal arrangement to a vertical arrangement, but the need to fit two cameras into a smaller body could be a factor. Siri The iPhone 8 may feature enhanced Siri functionality according to a rumor from DigiTimes. It's not clear what an enhanced version of Siri would be able to do, but it could include an overall refinement to the personal assistant's ability to respond to contextual requests and other dialogue. Apple is said to be taking advantage of technology it acquired when it purchased AI startup Turi in August of 2016. It's not clear if improved Siri capabilities will be introduced in iOS 11 and available for multiple devices or tied specifically to the iPhone 8 Release Date For the last several years, Apple has released its iPhone updates in September, so we expect to see the iPhone 8 in September of 2017. Apple suppliers are already gearing up to start producing components for the iPhone 8. Foxconn is developing both glass casings and OLED displays in an effort to secure orders from apple. Beyond the iPhone 8 In future iPhones, coming in 2018 and beyond, Apple could adopt foldable displays produced by LG. LG is planning to start mass-producing foldable displays for smartphones in 2018 and Apple is rumored to be a partner. Apple is also rumored to be mulling a partnership with Japan Display. Japan Display is developing flexible LCD panels that will be ready in 2018 and could be used in future iPhone models. In 2018, Apple may add iris scanning capabilities to the iPhone, which could be used alongside of or in place of Touch ID. Like a fingerprint, each person's iris is unique and so iris scanning can be used for identification purposes. Iris scanning is also a feature that has been rumored for the 2017 iPhone, so it's not clear when the iPhone could potentially gain these capabilities, if ever. Iris scanning rumors have come from two sources, but with the 2017 and 2018 iPhones still far off, Apple's plans could change. iPhone 8 (2017) Timeline February2017 Feb 15 iPhone 8 to Feature 5.8-Inch OLED Display With 5.15-Inch Main Screen and Virtual Buttons Below Feb 15 Apple Considering Adding China's BOE as OLED Supplier for 2018 iPhone Feb 14 iPhone 7s Said to Keep Aluminum Design as iPhone 8 Gets Glass With Stainless Steel Frame Feb 14 Apple Exploring Fingerprint Sensing MicroLED Displays Sans Touch ID Feb 13 iPhone 8 Said to Pack Battery Capacity of Current 5.5-Inch Model Into 4.7-Inch Form Factor Feb 13 Samsung Will Supply Apple With a Total 160 Million OLED Panels for iPhone 8 Feb 13 Apple Joins Wireless Power Consortium Behind 'Qi' Standard Ahead of iPhone 8 Feb 11 iPhone 8 Said to Have Separate Wireless Charger, No Headphone Jack Adapter or USB-C Cable in Box Feb 10 iPhone 8 Said to Feature Iris Scanner to Authenticate With Your Eyes Feb 9 All Three New 2017 iPhones to Feature Wireless Charging Feb 8 The 2017 iPhone Could Cost Upwards of $1,000 Feb 6 iPhone 8 Production May Start Earlier Than Usual Feb 2 Roundup: A Look at Various iPhone 8 Concepts and Mockups January2017 Jan 24 Apple Working on 'Enhanced Siri' Capabilities for Next-Generation iPhones Jan 23 iPhone 8 May Use Apple's In-House Inductive Wireless Charging Rather Than Technology From Energous Jan 23 Apple Selects Wistron as First India-Based Supplier of the 2017 iPhone Jan 21 Apple Exploring Two-Step Touch ID and Facial Recognition System for iPhone 8 Jan 19 Lite-On Semiconductor to Provide Wireless Charging Components for iPhone 8 Jan 18 iPhone 8 May Include Facial and Gesture Recognition Jan 13 Next iPhone Said to Have Even Better IP68-Rated Water Resistance ¬† MacRumors attracts a broad audience of both consumers and professionals interested in the latest technologies and products.

The Shop Local program, which showcases ‚Äúthe entrepreneurial stories behind the storefronts,‚Äù was presented with CALED‚Äôs ‚ÄúAward of Merit for Economic Development Programs‚Äù for supporting the local economy and business community by encouraging residents and visitors to spend their hard-earned dollars in Apple Valley, the statement shows. Mayor Scott Nassif said the town‚Äôs numerous and diverse businesses ‚Äúare the inspiration behind the Shop Apple Valley campaign." ‚ÄúThe program aims at strengthening the relationships that residents share with their local businesses and further highlights what Apple Valley has to offer,‚Äù Nassif said. The Shop Local program includes a Business Spotlight Series, which consists of a photography blog and videos created by Marketing Assistant Kenny Sousa. In each piece, the featured business owner or manager details their background story and highlights the products or services they provide. According to the statement, the series has been praised for its unique glimpse into the people and entrepreneurs that live and work locally, as well as for its increased awareness of businesses in Apple Valley. Through the program, businesses are also encouraged to start or increase their social media presence, with many seeing significant increases in followers after being featured. One of Life‚Äôs Perks Coffee Shop was recently featured in the Business Spotlight Series, and Manager Adele Mowbray said the town‚Äôs showcasing of small businesses helped her discover more of what the High Desert has to offer. ‚ÄúSince the release of our spotlight, we have noticed an insane increase in sales and many new and smiling faces,‚Äù Mowbray said. As part of the Awards of Excellence Program, CALED will recognize the town at its annual conference in San Diego in March, according to the statement.

¬† Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Apple breaks intraday record high for first time since 2015 By Reuters Published: 17:12 EST, 14 February 2017 | Updated: 17:12 EST, 14 February 2017 e-mail By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's share price hit an intraday record high on Tuesday for the first time in almost two years as investors raised bets that a 10th anniversary iPhone will boost lackluster sales. The stock touched an intraday all-time high of $135.09, beating its previous intraday high of $134.54 set on April 28, 2015. Its final level of $135.02, a gain of 1.30 percent, was Apple's second consecutive record closing price. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said in a filing it more than tripled its stake in Apple during the December quarter to 57.4 million shares from 15.2 million shares. It is unclear what Berkshire paid for its Apple shares, but so far in 2017 their value has increased by $1.1 billion, and legendary investor Buffett's increased interest in Apple could boost already positive sentiment on Wall Street. The S&P 500's largest component has climbed 50 percent from its low in the first half of last year and is up almost 17 percent so far in 2017, with many investors betting that Apple will mark the iPhone's 10th anniversary with a dramatically improved model. Many on Wall Street also believe that strong sales of the iPhone 6S two years ago have left a larger-than-normal base of customers ready to upgrade. "We're holding it, we look for opportunities to buy," said Jeff Carbone, co-founder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina. "Consumers feel better, people spend more money. There's still a lot of good to come from Apple." The Cupertino, California, company reported strong December-quarter results on Jan. 31. Although it gave a cautious outlook for the current quarter, Wall Street expects revenue to grow this year after sinking nearly 8 percent in fiscal 2016. Apple's stock recently traded at 14.3 times expected earnings, the highest level since April 2015 and significantly higher than the average price-earnings ratio of 12 over the past five years, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Apple ranks ahead of 87 percent of its peers in the StarMine Price Momentum stock picking model, which assumes long-term price trends tend to continue and that short-term trends tend to revert.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Apple Could Apple Be the First Trillion-Dollar Tech Company? Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Apple Could Apple Be the First Trillion-Dollar Tech Company? After a lackluster 2016, newly optimistic investors are pushing Apple stock to all-time highs. by Maya KosoffFebruary 14, 2017 2:56 pm Email Facebook Twitter By Zhang Peng/LightRocket/Getty Images. Last year was not Apple‚Äôs best. High-profile investors like Carl Icahn jumped ship amid concerns that Apple had lost its ability to grow and innovate, and the company briefly lost its title as the world‚Äôs most valuable company to Alphabet. While its biggest rival‚Äôs flagship smartphone literally went down in flames, Apple failed to capitalize, missing its own internal revenue targets in 2016 as iPhone sales lagged. The Apple Watch, which the Cupertino, California‚Äìbased company had once promoted as its next big device category, never really took off, while one of Apple‚Äôs most whispered-about moonshots‚Äîthe so-called Apple Car‚Äîfailed to get off the ground. But despite slowing iPhone sales and lingering questions about its ability to innovate, investors seem to have a renewed sense of confidence in Apple. On Monday, the tech giant closed at $133.29, ahead of its previous record-closing price of $133 in February 2015. Apple‚Äôs market cap now tops $714 billion, safely ahead of its next biggest competitor, Alphabet, at $577 billion, after its stock jumped more than 40 percent in the past 12 month. Major investors like Warren Buffett have been cheered by both better-than-anticipated holiday iPhone sales and continuing efforts to shore up additional revenue streams, including services and original content. While the iPhone has looked more or less the same since 2014, industry experts expect the next model to be a more substantial upgrade, which should further increase sales. While analysts have predicted for years that Apple could become the first trillion-dollar tech company, that milestone is now closer than ever. Still, Apple won‚Äôt be able to continue satisfying investors with phone sales alone. Instead, the company increasingly has been focusing on its services, including things like the App Store, Apple Maps, iTunes, iCloud, and Apple Pay, which C.E.O. Tim Cook has said will be the ‚Äúsize of a Fortune 100 company by next year.‚Äù Apple Music is beefing up its repertoire with exclusives, like CBS‚Äôs ‚ÄúCarpool Karaoke,‚Äù which the company bought in 2016, to appeal to subscribers. Apple is also exploring its own original content, including Apple Music‚Äìexclusive television series like the Shark Tank‚Äìinspired Planet of the Apps starring Gwyneth Paltrow and noted technologist and Black Eyed Peas member Will.i.am. The company saw profits from its services go from $3.2 billion, in 2010, to $14.5 billion, in 2015, driven by downloads and installations. In the most recent quarter, Bloomberg reports, Apple‚Äôs services revenue grew 18 percent, to $7.2 billion. And there‚Äôs still room to grow: according to Credit Suisse analysts, revenue from Apple services will generate $53 billion in revenue by 2020. Apple announced during its most recent earnings call in January that it has a billion active devices in the world. Apple‚Äôs sales numbers speak for themselves‚Äînow it just needs to keep its customers paying.

Apple, the world‚Äôs most valuable company, gave back just 7 cents after creating a new top, closing at $135.02 per share, up 1.3 percent. The previous high was $134.54 ‚Äî which it hit in April 2015. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average tacked on another 92.25, to close at 20,504. The S&P 500 gained 9.33, to 2,338, and the Nasdaq increased 18.62, to 5,783. The S&P is up a very healthy 25 percent over the past 12 months. The continued Trump rally also helped Goldman Sachs, whose stock picked up 1.7 percent on Tuesday, to close at an all-time high of $249.46. With a promise of peeled-back regulation from President Trump and as many as three rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, Goldman shares have spiked 37 percent since Election Day. The Trump rally has added 9.3 percent to the S&P in just over three months. Shares of JPMorgan Chase also achieved a new closing high ‚Äî at $89.56 ‚Äî and are up 28 percent since Nov. 8. Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Tuesday noted that average job gains of 190,000 per month over the second half of 2016 have increased employment by 16 million since its trough in 2010. The job gains have cut the unemployment rate, which stood at 4.8 percent in January, by more than 5 percentage points since its peak, Yellen said.

Josh Smith02/14/2017 Apple AirPods are amazing headphones that solve the hassles of most Bluetooth headphones. Advertisement I‚Äôve used the AirPods for the last two months with the¬†iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, MacBook Pro and Mac Pro ‚Äî and I only paired them once. With the AirPods I am rarely without headphones, and there is no need to worry about tangled wires. I just open the case, pop out one or two AirPods and start listening. Are the AirPods worth buying? The AirPods aren‚Äôt the best sounding headphones I‚Äôve used and they aren‚Äôt noise canceling like the Bose QC 35 headphones I use when on an airplane, but they are the best sounding convenient headphones¬†I own. You can use the AirPods as all around headphones, just like you could use the EarPods. They work for calls, movies, music and games. You can use them at home, at the gym, while walking and even while biking. Yes, there are specialized headphones for working out that offer some advantages, like the Plantronics BackBeat Fit, but if you want one pair of wireless headphones that fit all these roles the AirPods deliver. Advertisement AirPods Review Great design and comfortable fit. Impressive sound for the size. Long range for a small package. Great battery life and convenient charging case. Don't block all exterior noise. Must use Siri for most controls. Amazing wireless headphones The AirPods are convenient, sounds great and offer impressive battery life. Buy at Apple Buy at Best Buy My favorite AirPods feature isn‚Äôt how easy it is to switch between devices, it‚Äôs that you can choose to use just one AirPod at a time if you want. Using one AirPod makes taking a call or listening to an audiobook easier while you are in a store or need to be aware of your environment. It‚Äôs an awesome way to use the AirPods that many people overlook. If you normally carry a dedicated headset for taking calls and another for listening to music or movies this could allow you to slim down what you carry. When it comes to switching sources, the AirPods are better at this than any other Bluetooth headphone I‚Äôve used. This is thanks to a special W1 chip inside the headphones that eliminates some of the issues you see with other Bluetooth headphones. With many Bluetooth headphones that are paired to two devices, it can be difficult to switch from one device to another. Most often I have trouble switching from a Mac Pro to an iPad. Sometimes I have to reset the Bluetooth devices or turn off Bluetooth on one of the devices to make other headphones switch. It‚Äôs a pain. Advertisement Apple AirPods simplify this, by switching to the device you want in the Control Center on iPhone or iPad or in the sound settings on a Mac. Just choose AirPods and you are good to go. The AirPods sound good and fit well. The only time I‚Äôve had trouble connecting¬†the AirPods to one of my devices is while using an iOS beta, which isn‚Äôt an issue most people will have. You can pair the AirPods to an Android phone or to the Apple TV, but you‚Äôll need to do it the old-fashioned way and you don‚Äôt get all the benefits of the new W1 chip. Phone calls sound great on the AirPods and FaceTime Audio calls sound even better. The caller on the other end says I sound about as good as on the Plantronics Voyager 5200, but the caller sounds just like they do when I plug-in with wired headphones. Music and movies sound great. If you are looking for a wireless audiophile grade experience, keep looking. For most users, the AirPods hit the sweet spot between price, portability, and sound. The AirPods sound very good across a wide range of genres, deliver good audio for movies or TV shows and make enjoying mobile games¬†as simple as popping one or two earbuds in. Unlike other small wireless earbuds, we‚Äôve tested the AirPods range is top notch. I can walk across my house without losing connectivity or losing audio quality. When¬†the phone is in my pocket there are no cutouts as I move around, bend over or complete a simple workout. We don‚Äôt worry about losing the AirPods thanks to the charging case. AirPods battery life is rated at 5 hours on a single charge, but you can use¬†the included charging case to get up to 24 hours of battery life. Apple‚Äôs ratings are spot on and plugging the headphones in for just 15 minutes will get you through another 2-3 hours of listening. The case is the logical place to store the AirPods. With¬†the AirPods in the case losing them is not a problem most users will need to worry about. The AirPods fit in my ears very well, as did the EarPods. I can shake, run, bounce and even dance around the house without the AirPods flying out. Your ears may be different,¬†but if EarPods fit and stay there is a good chance that¬†AirPods will fit. If not, you can try adding Earhoox 2.0 to your AirPods, but it will complicate charging and carrying them as you will need to remove the hook. Each of the AirPods includes sensors that respond to touch and that know when they are in your ears. When wearing both AirPods, removing one pauses the music and resumes when you put it in. Taking both out automatically stops the track or movie. You can use these to control the volume with your voice and to use Siri by double tapping either AirPod. The AirPods battery life is good thanks to the ability to charge in the case. You can use these to control the volume with your voice and to use Siri by double tapping either AirPod. You can play music, make a call, get directions and many other Siri features without taking your iPhone out of your pocket. If you don‚Äôt have an Internet connection you cannot use Siri and you will need to turn the volume up on your phone or skip tracks on your phone. I normally rely on my iPhone for volume and track control since I don‚Äôt need to step out of the music to use those controls. Siri is as accurate on the AirPods as on the iPhone, which so you‚Äôll experience the same amount of failed voice controls. The AirPods are $159 from Apple and at Best Buy. Best Wireless Headphones & Earbuds Bose QC35 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones ¬† 1 / 7 Bose sets the standard for noise cancelling headphones, delivering an instant reprieve from the noise and distractions at home, in the office and on an airplane. Now, the Bose QC35 bluetooth headphones offer this all without the need to plug a wire into your iPhone or Android smartphone.¬†Sound quality is impressive and the range is great. The Bose QC35 headphones are comfortable, block out distracting noises better than any other headset on the market, deliver 20 hour battery life and an option to use wired after the battery dies. Excellent call quality even in windy or noisy environments. $349 at Amazon in Black and Silver ¬† 1 / 7 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

(Photo: Paul Sakuma, AP file) 12 CONNECTTWEET 5 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Q: Steve, I think I am done with the self-employment thing. You talk about it like it is so great and all, but I just lost $10,000 and now I probably have to go back to work for a boss I really don‚Äôt like. I wish I didn‚Äôt, but what choice do I have? -¬† Olivia A: I have a question for you: Have you ever heard of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit? Unless you are a cartoon historian, the answer is probably no. Long before he ever started the Disney Company, Walt Disney was just another illustrator trying to break into the business. Long before Micky Mouse, Oswald was Disney‚Äôs first attempt at creating an iconic character. The thing was however, especially back then, Walt Disney was a heck of an artist and an equally bad businessman. So bad in fact that at one point he had to file for bankruptcy and in the process, lost the rights to Oswald. Fortunately for us all of course, Disney learned a lesson or two, remained committed to the vision, and became, well, Walt Disney. As he later said, ‚ÄúYou may not realize it when it happens, but a kick in the teeth may be the best thing in the world for you.‚Äù I have started four businesses, but it was the one I started that didn‚Äôt work out as planned that taught me the most. Look, the fact is, if you are going to be an entrepreneur, at some point you are going to fail. That‚Äôs the nature of the gig. It is, as they say, what you do after that that matters. Bill Gates famously dropped out of Harvard to start Microsoft, right? Wrong. His first business, with co-founder Paul Allen, was intended to analyze traffic flow. ‚ÄúTraf-O-Data‚Äù was a flop before Microsoft was a hit. As Gates says, ‚ÄúSuccess is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can‚Äôt lose.‚Äù As we all know, In the 1970s, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak invented the Apple Computer in Jobs‚Äô parent‚Äôs garage. Apple is Apple now of course, but along the way, Jobs had some spectacular failures, including The Lisa, a $10,000 personal computer that was the precursor to the Macintosh. Such a flop was this expensive, heavy (50 lbs.!), unloved beast that they ended up burying most of them in the Utah desert.

Andy Greenberg Security Date of Publication: 02.14.17. 02.14.17 Time of Publication: 1:55 pm. 1:55 pm The Best Encrypted Chat App Now Does Video Calls Too Open Whisper Systems Even as the encryption app Signal became the go-to private communications channel for activists, journalists, politicians, and more, its encrypted calling feature remained less than perfect. It lacks video, often drops calls, and doesn‚Äôt always integrate with your phone‚Äôs existing features. A Signal update gradually rolling out now upgrades the calling features and adds video, too‚Äîbut might require its most privacy-sensitive users to take an extra step to protect themselves. On Tuesday, Signal‚Äôs creators at the non-profit Open Whisper Systems announced a beta version of the update that, in addition to video calling, adds the ability to answer calls from a locked screen, and what they promise will be better call quality. For now, anyone who receives the update can choose activate those new features in the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù menu under Signal‚Äôs settings. ‚ÄúWe want Signal to be a joy to use,‚Äù says Moxie Marlinspike, Open Whisper Systems‚Äô founder. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre constantly focused on continuing to refine it and add features and functionality that we think people will love.‚Äù Open Whisper Systems But anyone testing the beta who links their iPhone to iCloud and wants the same level of privacy Signal has always offered should consider an extra step, too: Disabling a setting that uploads a call‚Äôs metadata to Apple. The beta upgrade to Signal will use CallKit, Apple‚Äôs framework for allowing VoIP calls like Signal‚Äôs, to be integrated more completely into the calling functionality of the phone. But that also means calls will be recorded in the iPhone‚Äôs call log and, for iCloud users, shared with Apple‚Äôs server. ‚ÄúiOS treats CallKit calls like any other call, however that also means some information will be synced to iCloud if enabled,‚Äù Open Whisper Systems warns. ‚ÄúThis information includes who you called and how long you talked.‚Äù For anyone who cringes at the thought of leaking that metadata, however, the new Signal beta will let you turn CallKit integration off on the same ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù menu in the app‚Äôs settings. CallKit integration will only be used if it‚Äôs enabled on both ends of the call‚Äîif you disable it, your metadata won‚Äôt be leaked by your contact‚Äôs phone, either. And Open Whisper Systems is still considering whether the version of Signal it pushes out after this beta will integrate CallKit by default, or as an opt-in feature. ‚ÄúHow we handle CallKit once this is the default experience isn‚Äôt entirely resolved,‚Äù Marlinspike says. He suggests that the app could mere display ‚ÄúSignal users‚Äù in the iPhone‚Äôs call log to protect users‚Äô identities, or Signal may walk users through its settings when once installed, to help people choose their privacy preferences. ‚ÄúThere are a bunch of things we can do other than just having it on by default.‚Äù Signal News Andy Greenberg Meet Moxie Marlinspike, the Anarchist Bringing Encryption to All of Us Andy Greenberg Encryption App ‚ÄòSignal‚Äô Fights Censorship With a Clever Workaround Andy Greenberg Signal, a Dead-Easy Phone Crypto App, Comes to the Desktop Signal‚Äôs popularity grew in part because it has long made certain privacy tradeoffs to make the app more usable. It integrates a phone‚Äôs existing contacts for convenience, for instance, but requires that a number be added to a phone‚Äôs contact list before it can be called. That means if the phone backs its contacts up to the cloud, some sensitive details could be leaked. And Signal has avoided a ‚Äúfederation‚Äù feature that would allow Signal users to set up their own server to communicate over, rather than use Signal‚Äôs more centralized system. Aside from the CallKit change, Signal has also fully redesigned its VoIP protocol and reworked how it authenticates that bad actors aren‚Äôt surreptitiously impersonating users during calls. In the past, Signal has offered two unique words generated on the callers‚Äô screens from their encryption keys. The callers each read out a word, and if they match, they can be sure no man-in-the-middle is eavesdropping on their call. In the new version, Signal‚Äôs voice and video calling will drop those word pairs and instead use the same authentication system as its text messaging feature, which depends instead on simply warning users if their contact‚Äôs encryption key has suspiciously changed. All of that means Signal is making the process of an encrypted call feel far more like making a normal one. The next time you‚Äôre foiling the eavesdroppers trying to listen in on your secret conversations, in other words, you may not even notice. Go Back to Top.

Analysts and investors are practically salivating over the yet-to-be revealed iPhone 8/ iPhone X, and they lapped up Apple management‚Äôs comments about services revenue doubling over the next four years. Meanwhile, short interest in Apple stock rises along with the share price as bears bide their time and try to wait out the growing pain. Apple stock target to $150 In a research note dated Feb. 13, Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski said she boosted her price target on Apple stock from $133 to $150 per share. She noted that it‚Äôs looking more and more like 3D sensing technology will be in the iPhone 8 this year, based on data points from Lumentum. This technology paves the way for the inclusion of augmented reality features on the device, marking a ‚Äúsignificant step-up in innovation‚Äù for this year. Her supply chain checks back up the other reports pointing to a third iPhone model with a massive 5.8-inch display being released this year. She sees starting prices of $649 and $769 for the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone models for this year, which other analysts are calling the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. Also like other reports from other sources, Jankowski‚Äôs checks suggest that the third model, called the iPhone 8 or iPhone X, will be priced higher than the other two models. Some reports have pegged the starting price at or above $1,000, although she didn‚Äôt specify a starting price tag. The Goldman analyst‚Äôs price target boost for Apple stock is based on a higher multiple of 16 times (versus 14 times previously) due to an expected acceleration in earnings growth over the next couple of years. Short-sellers burned by Apple stock After touching a new record high on Monday, Apple stock hit another high on Tuesday and continued to climb, approaching $135 per share in the wake of Goldman‚Äôs price target lift. Apple stock is now up by more than 16% year to date, and short-sellers are down more than $71 million, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners. As is typical of short interest, the firm said interest in Apple stock was rising along with the stock price between 2009 and 2014 for risk management and hedging purposes in addition to simple short bets. However, over the last three years, short interest in Apple stock has been falling as the shares kept hitting new record highs, says S3. Last year, short interest averaged $6.04 billion and traded between $4.4 billion and $6.9 billion, although it spiked to $10 billion in late March amid the stock‚Äôs lowest level in two years at $90.34. Short-sellers lost $432 million in total last year as Apple stock rose 9.93%. Short-sellers are losing even bigger this year Short interest in the name is down this year, but S3 Partners says portfolio managers‚Äô losses on their $5.6 billion short or hedging position are much bigger. The firm said financing costs surpassed $2.1 million in the first six weeks of this year, but the mark to market P/L is a loss of $794.5 million. The shorts are down 14.26% year to date in total, net of financing. With all the pain, it‚Äôs no surprise that few are just betting outright that Apple stock will fall. S3 said most current short interest in Apple stock is market-related portfolio heads or hedges for derivative securities. The firm added that core short interest in the name ranges from $4.5 billion to $7 billion, so in order to say there‚Äôs ‚Äúan appreciable‚Äù number of short-sellers betting on a share price decline, interest would have to trend past $7 billion.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | February 14, 2017 -- 18:04 GMT (10:04 PST) | Topic: Apple High-end cameras, such as those found on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, would be crucial to bringing AR to the iPhone. A recent interview with Apple CEO Tim Cook has offered up some interesting tidbits on how Apple will approach the subject of AR (Augmented Reality). Must read: OLED iPhone 8 may finally have the feature that owners have been craving The Internet of Things 10 types of enterprise deployments As businesses continue to experiment with the Internet of Things, interesting use cases are emerging. Here are some of the most common ways IoT is deployed in the enterprise. Read More In an interview with The Independent, Cook at this to say on the subject of AR: I'm excited about Augmented Reality because unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world but hopefully allows an improvement on what's happening presently. Most people don't want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can't do that because you get sick from it. With AR you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance. I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone, we don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it's for everyone. I think AR is that big, it's huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives. And be entertaining. I view AR like I view the silicon here in my iPhone, it's not a product per se, it's a core technology. But there are things to discover before that technology is good enough for the mainstream. I do think there can be a lot of things that really help people out in daily life, real-life things, that's why I get so excited about it. There's quite a bit to unpack here. First and foremost is that Cook sees AR as a better technology than VR. Whereas VR required the user to wear goggles or glasses of some description, an AR overlay can be applied to the world using, say, a smartphone's camera and display (think Pok√©mon Go). Cook is quick to trash VR, claiming that people don't want to be isolated from the world in headsets, and that the technology can make people sick. These are the two biggest complaints related to VR and it's clear Apple sees them as showstoppers. Another interesting tidbit here is that Cook sees AR as being for everyone, not part of a niche market such as gaming. His claims that AR is not a product are interesting, and seem to suggest strongly that AR would be part of something bigger rather than being something standalone. If Apple is going to roll AR into anything, it's the iPhone, because this is the ecosystem that Apple is most keen to expand. The "I view AR like I view the silicon here in my iPhone" line is incredibly telling. It suggests that for Apple, the goal is to make AR as invisible to the end user as the processor and RAM in an iPhone. It's another tool for people to use, not an end result. It's important to realize that AR doesn't have to mean glasses or goggles. A heads-up display in a car or holding up a smartphone and having the display show information on your surroundings are both valid examples of AR. On top of that, factor in how big the overall market for AR and VR currently is. There are a lot of companies making a lot of noise in these areas, but mainstream products are thin on the ground. Apple's ecosystem currently revolves around the iPhone (yes, iPhone, not Mac). A new class of product that sits outside of this would be a distraction unless Apple were almost guaranteed of its success. Strategically, it doesn't make much sense for Apple to crowd the marketplace with a new product. It makes far more sense for Apple to bolt AR onto the iPhone as a new feature than try to carve out a new product line. It's easy to think that Apple needs a new product to take the edge off the iPhone sales slump, and AR wearables are what the cool kids are all talking about, so it seems like a logical pick. But the flipside is that new products move the focus away from existing products, and this might not be such a clever move given that Apple wants people to be buying iPhones, since that's where the company's biggest chunk of dollars still comes from. AR on the iPhone would also pave the way for a whole new line of apps and accessories. How soon could AR appear as part of the iPhone? Given how much Apple has been talking about the technology lately, I wouldn't be surprised to see it unveiled as the flagship feature of the OLED iPhone 8.

It was announced today that Big Top Works, an affiliate of Compass Partners LLC, are the new owners of the Big Apple Circus and will continue the grand tradition of presenting the beloved New York institution - and its established community outreach programs including the Circus of the Senses, Autism performances and Circus for All - in New York City and on tour in the 2017-18 Season. Founded in 1977, Big Apple Circus will make its triumphant return during the holiday season in time for the landmark cultural institution's 40th Anniversary. Specific details about the production's development, including headliners, dates, and locations, will be announced this spring. In July 2016, Big Apple Circus announced that it would be shutting down ahead of its 2016-17 season, after a last-minute fundraising attempt failed to alleviate the organization's significant financial hardships. The news spurred Compass Partners, a Sarasota-based investment firm led by managing partner Richard Perlman, and his partners Jim Price and Barry Salzman, to assemble an eclectic team of businessmen - who share a passion for, and history with, the circus arts - to build a sustainable business plan to save and revitalize the Big Apple Circus. The new partnership, Big Top Works, includes industry veteran Larry Solheim, who has a 30-plus year career working on and general managing circuses, including Big Apple Circus' 2015-16 season, and Neil Kahanovitz, a renowned spine surgeon, theatrical producer, and former circus performer. "This is a dream come true for us," says Neil Kahanovitz, Partner, Big Top Works. "Big Apple Circus is a cultural gem in New York City and we couldn't let this beloved American pastime just disappear. We have been working for months to assemble the finest team to ensure that the circus tent rises again this 40thAnniversary season, and for many years to come. We look forward to presenting the circus everyone knows and loves, and honoring the legacy that has been built over the past several decades, while crafting a thrilling experience for today's audiences." Last week, Big Apple Circus' Board of Directors unanimously voted to accept the $1.3 million bid from Big Top Works - made during the live auction handled by Stampler Auctions on Tuesday, February 7 - and today, the court approved the Board's decision. The sale includes THE BIG APPLES CIRCUS' tents, equipment, and intellectual property (including the name and brand.) The board's decision was not only motivated by the highest bid, but by Compass Partners' most compelling case to maintain both the organization's excellent level of performance and its mission to serve the community - the Big Apple Circus programs "Circus of the Senses" and "Circus for All!" will continue to serve New Yorkers and communities beyond the Big Apple. Alison Bauer of Tory's LLC was the attorney on record for Compass Partners. Preliminary conversations are underway with Lincoln Center to keep Big Apple Circus at Damrosch Park, which the Big Top Tent has called home since the 1980's. The Big Apple Circus was founded in the summer of 1977 by circus performers Paul Binder and Michael Christensen, with a mission to present authentic and thrilling circus arts, in the intimacy of the one-ring Big Top, for audiences of all incomes. By 1979 the Circus was generating enough money to fund two Circus Arts Schools and in 1983, launched its first tour. Throughout its 40-year run, Big Apple Circus distinguished themselves by offering many community outreach programs including providing free tickets to underprivileged children and underserved schools.

ABOUT COMPASS PARTNERS LLC AND BIG TOP WORKS, LLC Compass Partners LLC ("Compass Partners"), is a Sarasota-based merchant banking and advisory firm that specializes in middle market companies and corporate restructuring. Founded by Richard Perlman in 1995, Compass Partners has had a successful track record revitalizing and growing a number of businesses across a wide range of sectors, from food equipment to healthcare services. In addition to Perlman, Compass Partners includes Jim Price and Barry Salzman, who is the lead partner on the Big Apple Circus venture. Big Top Works, LLC ("Big Top"), is the latest affiliate of Compass Partners and is the official owner of the Big Apple Circus. In addition to Compass, Big Top is comprised of a team of investors who share a common passion for the circus arts including Neil Kahanovitz, an orthopedic surgeon, theatrical producer and former circus performer, and Larry Solheim, a 30-year circus veteran. ABOUT NEIL KAHANOVITZ As a child, when asked what he wanted to be when he grew up, the answer never changed, "an orthopedic surgeon and a circus performer." He achieved both dreams. While attending medical school, Kahanovitz took a leave of absence to perform in the comedy trampoline act and later as an aerialist in a large circus in the Midwest. Once he graduated, Kahanovitz went on to a distinguished career in the medical field. He has been published in over 50 articles in scientific journals, written about spinal disorders in eleven medical textbooks and published a book on the care and treatment of low back pain. He has served as President of the North American Spine Society and has received the prestigious Volvo Award for Low Back Pain Research, as well as a Commendation from The United States House Physician's Office for his care and surgery performed on members of the United States Supreme Court and Congress. He was also awarded one of the Soviet Union's most prestigious civilian honors, The Order of The Supreme Soviet Medal of Personal Courage, for organizing relief efforts following a devastating earthquake in Armenia. Despite the success of his medical career, his show business interests resurfaced in the late 1990's. He has since produced plays and musicals on Broadway, in London's West End, Chicago, Los Angeles and Off-Broadway. He is thrilled to bring the Big Apple Circus to its rightful place among the most cherished New York City cultural icons. And for a chance to run away with the circus. Not once, but twice! ABOUT LARRY SOLHEIM A proud veteran, Solheim has worked in the travelling entertainment field - as a performing artist, composer/arranger, conductor, educator and, most notably, a production manager - for over 35 years. Most recently, he was the Vice President and General Manager for Big Apple Circus, brought in to oversee the touring unit and identify the issues responsible for its declining financial situation. As General Manager, Solheim oversaw the circus' 17-million-dollar operational budget, managed and optimized all elements of the touring operations, including its 150+ team members, and coordinated research and communications with all corporate departments and directors. Prior to the Big Apple Circus, Solheim worked for TZ Productions as Musical Director and General Manager for 26 years, where he coordinated and managed performances in up to 70 cities per year (45 building venues and 25 tent venues).

Baig 1 day ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL 27 things you probably didn't know about Netflix The most expensive trailer parks in the US ¬© Getty Images A visitor tries out an Apple iPhone 7 on the first day of sales of the new phone at the Berlin Apple store on September 16, 2016 in Berlin, Germany. NEW YORK‚ÄîThere‚Äôs an awfully powerful chance that the 10th anniversary iPhone is going to include wireless charging. ¬†Adding to recent speculation about the next iPhone's features, Apple late last week joined the Wireless Power Consortium, an industry group that has been pushing a wireless charging standard known as Qi. Popular Searches Ralph Lauren Corp RL ‚ñº 79.17 -0.32 -0.40% Michael Kors Holdings Ltd KORS ‚ñº 38.05 -0.05 -0.13% Sanderson Farms Inc SAFM ‚ñ≤ 93.83 +0.82 +0.88% Tyson Foods Inc TSN ‚ñ≤ 65.33 +0.33 +0.51% While Samsung, among other rivals to Apple, has had wireless charging in its premium handsets for some time now, all iPhones lack this convenience feature. ‚ÄúThe success of wireless charging adoption from Apple‚Äôs competitors is something that Apple can no longer ignore,‚Äù says IHS Technology analyst Vicky Yussuff, who adds that 90 percent of the consumers that IHS has surveyed said they want wireless charging on their next device. The Qi standard encompasses both inductive and resonant charging technologies. Apple wouldn‚Äôt comment on any of the features that might make it into the next iPhone. But the company did issue a statement: "Apple is an active member of many standards development¬†organizations, as both a leader and contributor. Apple is joining the Wireless Power Consortium to be able to participate and contribute ideas to the open, collaborative development of future wireless charging standards. We look forward to¬†working together¬†with¬†the WPC¬†and its members.‚Äù Samsung, Lenovo, LG, HTC, Huawei, Sony and Nokia are among the 200-plus member companies in the WPC. With Apple joining them, the companies with the largest market share in mobile phones are now members of the organization.¬† Apple does offer wireless charging through the Apple Watch. And with some third-party cases iPhone owners charge the phones wirelessly. One wireless charging company Powermat says it welcomes the news. "It means that consumers (who don't care about standards) will be able to seamlessly charge their iPhones at places like Starbucks," says Powermat vice president for communications Scott Eisenstein. Powermat describes itself as¬†standards-agnostic. IHS expects more than 350 million wireless-charging-capable receiver units to ship in 2017 worldwide, with most of the volume driven through the backing of wireless charging by Samsung. ‚ÄúHowever, many in the industry have been cautious to move forward until they knew the direction for any wireless charging on iPhone devices,‚Äù Yussuff says.¬†‚ÄúAlthough shipments of wireless charging devices grew by 40% in 2016, the continued absence of the iPhone and the continued wait for the launch of magnetically resonant devices meant shipments were lower than expected for 2016 overall.‚Äù Yussuff expects at least one other major phone manufacturer to embrace wireless charging later this month during the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona. With these announcements, she says, the prospect that wireless charging receiver shipments could reach 2 billion units by 2025 have just gotten a lot stronger.

¬† Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad US STOCKS-Apple and banks propel Wall Street to record high By Reuters Published: 14:24 EST, 14 February 2017 | Updated: 14:24 EST, 14 February 2017 e-mail By Noel Randewich Feb 14 (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes hit record highs on Tuesday, led by bank stocks after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said it would be unwise to wait too long to raise interest rates. Apple rose as much as 1.25 percent to an all-time high of $134.95, contributing to gains in the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite indexes. Yellen said delaying rate hikes could force the U.S. central bank to raise rates quicker down the line, which could risk a recession. She also expressed uncertainty over economic policy under the Trump administration. Banks, expected to gain from higher interest rates, led the market higher. Goldman Sachs rose 1.49 percent and Bank of America added 2.97 percent. The S&P 500 financial index rose 1.3 percent. President Donald Trump's pro-business stance sparked a record-setting rally in stocks following his November election. However, he has given scant detail on his policies, leaving the Fed with limited visibility about the economy's future direction. Speaking to the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, Yellen did not indicate whether the Fed still planned to raise rates three times this year, nor did she indicate whether a hike might come in March or in June, as most analysts expect. "With the new president, there is still the uncertainty of the economic policy," said Jeff Carbone, co-founder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina. "How much growth we get out of the market will affect policymaking and how quickly they need to react." At 2:04 p.m. (1904 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.32 percent at 20,477.2, while the S&P 500 had gained 0.30 percent to 2,335.32, both reversing losses from earlier in the day. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.26 percent to 5,778.93. Yellen's comments lifted the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields. Six of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, led by the utilities and real estate sectors, which tend to fall when Treasury yields rise. General Motors added 4.64 percent after Peugeot owner PSA Group said it is in talks to buy GM's European Opel business. The prospects of sector consolidation caused Fiat to jump 4.84 percent, while Ford gained 0.84 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.12-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 57 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 113 new highs and 16 new lows.

The company is planning to start with just two shows exclusive to the Apple Music service: "Carpool Karaoke" -- a spinoff of a segment on CBS' "Late, Late Show" that has become a viral sensation -- will debut in April. Apple later will add "Planet of the Apps," a contest-reality show, in which would-be entrepreneurs pitch their concepts for new mobile apps with the hope of winning funding. Many in the TV industry were expecting the Cupertino company to use its clout to immediately take on the titans of premium TV -- including Netflix, Amazon.com, HBO and Showtime. But Apple plans to begin with small bites. "Look, we are just starting out," Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, said Monday night at the Code Media conference in Dana Point, trying to downplay expectations. "These shows bring something to customers that they haven't been seen before," Cue said. "We are trying to do things that are unique and cultural." Apple has flirted with the notion of playing a starring role in television several times before, only to retreat in the face of roadblocks or opt for smaller and more surgical moves. The tech company plans to use the original productions as a way to attract and retain users to its Apple Music service. The TV shows will help differentiate the service from Spotify, Google Music Play and other subscription services. "We think video can be a very important part of Apple Music," Cue said. Apple, he said, is hoping to field to shows that are relevant to pop culture. The two new shows that will debut this spring are loaded with celebrities: will.i.am, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Alba will serve as the mentor judges on "Planet of the Apps." "Carpool Karaoke" will bring together unlikely celebrities to spend time together and sing karaoke. CBS' "Late, Late Show" host James Corden, who turned the sketch into a popular feature on his TV show and YouTube, will appear in only a handful of the episodes for the Apple series. Still, at the Orange County conference sponsored by Vox Media, some members of the audience seemed skeptical about Apple's strategy. Cue was asked why Apple didn't just go out and buy an entertainment company or blow up the TV industry by offering existing TV channels a la carte rather than in a big bundle. But Cue didn't take the bait, and instead promoted the two shows. "This is new for us. We've never done anything like it before," Cue said, at one point adding, "We know what we don't know." He said the two shows likely would be the first of many original shows for Apple. "But how fast, and how much, remains to be seen," he said. "Planet of the Apps" comes from Propagate Content, the TV studio managed by former NBC Entertainment chairman Ben Silverman and his longtime business partner, Howard Owens. About two years ago, the two executives, along with will.i.am, were pitching the show to the big broadcast networks. The unscripted show takes a Silicon Valley twist on ABC's "Shark Tank," in which would-be inventors pitch their projects to potential investors. Before making a deal with one of the networks, will.i.am brought the concept to the Apple executives, who also were intrigued and eventually bought the show. It is expected to be different from a TV series because it will have interactive components. For example, viewers can pause the program to learn more about the contestants or various elements of the app development process. Silverman, at the conference, said he was happy with the way things worked out. "A show about apps doesn't work unless you are partnering with Apple," Silverman said. "And it will also be an app, which is very meta and cool." Image credit: iStock. ¬© 2017 Los Angeles Times under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Qualcomm Hit with More Apple Suits Next Article > Apple May Replace iPhone Home Button with Fingerprint-Scanning Screen By Samuel Gibbs PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 15 2017 Apple is working on fitting fingerprint scanners beneath the screen of its iPhone, removing the need for a separate home button, a newly published patent has revealed. The patent, purchased by Apple as part of its acquisition of a display company called LuxVue in 2014, details a system of using LEDs mounted underneath a display to both detect finger‚Äôs position and scan its surface to be able to read a fingerprint. Apple said in the newly reassigned patent : ‚ÄúWhen the fingerprint is placed upon the transparent substrate, the sensing IR diodes within the display panel sense patterned IR light reflected off grooves of the fingerprint surface. ‚ÄúThis patterned IR light is relayed to the output processor as a bitmap where it is processed to determine the fingerprint surface‚Äôs unique pattern. Because the display panel can sense IR light, the display panel is able to perform surface profile determination when the display panel is not emitting visible light.‚Äù The LuxVue-developed technology concentrates on using tiny LEDs under the display to replicate the ability to detect the presence of a finger or other interacting element against the glass of a screen. The majority of mobile devices use capacitive touchscreen layers, which detect a change in capacitance when a finger or other conductive element touches the screen. The technology is also used in many fingerprint sensors and other devices, but has drawbacks particularly in cold weather -- they do not work very well when a finger is covered in a glove unless that glove has conductive surface. The patent describes the use of the array of LED sensors under the display to replicate the functions of both a traditional capacitive touchscreen and a fingerprint scanner, replicating the function of Apple‚Äôs Touch ID home button. Apple states: ‚ÄúThe ability to detect an object‚Äôs surface profile while the display panel is not emitting visible light enables the display panel to detect a user‚Äôs fingerprint to unlock a mobile device such as a cellphone when the display panel appears to be off. ‚ÄúAccordingly, the display panel need not emit visible light to detect a surface profile of an object, nor does the display panel require a separate sensor to detect the surface profile of an object.‚Äù Apple is not the only company working on new technologies to allow components necessary to the function of a modern smartphone to be moved under the display. Sensors such as ambient light detectors, which provide information to adjust the display‚Äôs brightness in line with current light levels, presence sensors that turn off the screen when you put the phone to your ear, the earpiece speaker and the selfie camera are all currently mounted above or around the screen in separate panels. The placement of those components is one of the biggest hurdles standing in the way of all-screen smartphones, where the unnecessary bezels around the screen are removed in favour of a display that reaches to the very edges and top and bottom of the phone. Progress is being made to reduce the need for bezels around the display. Some smartphone manufacturers, including Huawei, Google and LG have moved the fingerprint scanner to the back of the device. LG‚Äôs latest Android Wear smartwatches have a new ambient light sensor that can operate from beneath a screen, while Sharp and Xiaomi have both released smartphones that use bone-conduction systems built into the screens to remove the need for a separate earpiece speaker at the top of the device. At the same time, Apple‚Äôs iPhones have continued to have large symmetrical bezels at the top and bottom of the their screens, with the home button and integrated Touch ID fingerprint scanner mounted within the bottom bezel and the speaker grille, sensors and selfie camera in the top bezel. These large bezels have made the body of company‚Äôs smartphones relatively large compared to competitors, despite having smaller display areas. Samsung‚Äôs highly anticipated Galaxy S8 smartphone is expected to have an edge-to-edge ‚Äúinfinity display‚Äù with thin top and bottom bezels that do not even have room for the company‚Äôs logo. It should give the Galaxy S8 one of the highest screen-to-body ratios of any smartphone, but even then it will not be truly all-screen.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics¬† Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Apple patents bezel-less iPhone tech to put Touch ID in display Eric Abent - Feb 14, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit There‚Äôs no shortage of rumors about the next iPhone, but one of the more compelling rumors we‚Äôve heard involves the iPhone 8 ‚Äì if that‚Äôs what it‚Äôll be called ‚Äì sporting an edge-to-edge display. In order to accomplish this, Apple would need to remove a number of components from the face of the device ‚Äì namely, the fingerprint scanner and the light sensor. Those are two fairly crucial components to the operation of the iPhone, but if a freshly awarded Apple patent ever sees the light of day, they may no longer be necessary. As uncovered by by Apple Insider, this new patent takes the technology necessary for fingerprint reading and light detection and implements it within the display itself. This is done by including IR emitting LEDs alongside the typical RGB LEDs that provide the visuals you see on-screen. Those IR LEDs serve a rather important purpose, because when combined with RGB LEDs, they create subpixel displays that can be calibrated to perform a lot of different tasks. Apple calls these subpixel arrangements ‚Äúinteractive pixels,‚Äù and mentions in the description of its patent that they can be used to determine ambient light (prompting the CPU to adjust screen brightness). Therefore, Apple can eliminate the need for a light sensor on the face of the iPhone, giving it more space to expand the display itself. If Apple is going to make an iPhone with an edge-to-edge display, however, it also needs to get rid of the home button and the capacitive touch array that‚Äôs built into it. With this patent, Apple envisions a future where that array isn‚Äôt needed to scan fingerprints ‚Äì instead, interactive pixels can be used. The process for this is kind of complicated, but very cool. With interactive pixels measuring the ambient light, your phone‚Äôs display will be able to tell when something like your finger comes within scanning range. Once you press your finger to the display, the interactive pixels determine its location and create a bitmap that plots everything out. By measuring the intensity of the light, that bitmap can determine something as fine as the grooves in your fingerprint, therefore allowing you to keep your phone as secure as when you were using TouchID, only without the need for a dedicated scanner. It‚Äôs worth noting that LuxVue was working on this IP when Apple purchased the company back in 2014, so this kind of technology has been in the works for quite some time already. While it may still be too early to expect to see it in something like 2017‚Äôs iPhone, this patent could potentially be the catalyst for an iPhone with an edge-to-edge display. We‚Äôll have to wait on Apple to see how this technology is ultimately implemented, but for now, click the source link below to view this intriguing patent filing.

Now, Apple.com has a few notable stock shortages of Series 2 bundles and -- to a lesser extent -- single band options for the Apple Watch, likely indicating an incoming spring collection of Apple Watch bands. New Apple Watch hardware is expected for later in 2017. The same shortage phenomenon occurred last summer, ahead of the new bands that launched in September. While hardware updates have been less frequent, Apple has kept new band lineups on a seasonal release cycle approximately every six months, solidifying the Apple Watch as an ever-changing fashion accessory in the company's eye. Since the original Apple Watch launched, there have been four seasonal collections: Spring 2015, Fall 2015, Spring 2016, and Fall 2016. New bands potentially arriving in the next few weeks would mark the first band collection of 2017. Tracked on the U.S. Apple.com store, the largest shortages for Apple Watch Series 2 bundles are mainly for models with Woven Nylon bands. Of the six Series 2 models that include Woven Nylon bands, five have models that are listed as "Sold Out" on Apple.com and in the Apple Store iOS app. Conversely, all aluminum Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2 models with Sport Bands were available to buy at the time of writing. Out-of-Stock Apple Watch Bundles Apple Watch with Aluminum Case - 38mm Silver Aluminum Case with Pearl Woven Nylon - 38mm Gold Aluminum Case with Yellow/Light Gray Woven Nylon - 42mm Gold Aluminum Case with Toasted Coffee/Caramel Woven Nylon - 42mm Rose Gold Aluminum Case with Space Orange/Anthracite Woven Nylon - 38mm and 42mm Space Gray Aluminum Case with Black Woven Nylon Apple Watch with Stainless Steel Case - 38mm and 42mm Stainless Steel Case with Saddle Brown Classic Buckle - 38mm Stainless Steel Case with Midnight Blue Modern Buckle (all band sizes) - 42mm Stainless Steel Case with Midnight Blue Leather Loop (both band sizes) - 38mm Stainless Steel Case with Link Bracelet - 38mm Space Black Stainless Steel Case with Space Black Link Bracelet The only in-stock Woven Nylon model is the Rose Gold Aluminum Case with Light Pink/Midnight Blue Woven Nylon, and a couple of Stainless Steel bundles are also readily available to purchase, including the basic White Sport Band, Black Sport Band, and Milanese Loop options. Every model of the Apple Watch + Nike is in stock, while every Herm√®s model is in stock save two: Stainless Steel Case with Rose Jaipur Epsom Leather Single Tour and Stainless Steel Case with Fauve Barenia Leather Single Tour Deployment Buckle. Out-of-stock Apple Watch Bands are far less numerous than they were last summer, ahead of the Series 2's introduction in the fall. In June, MacRumors reported upwards of 35 different Apple Watch bands marked as "Sold Out" on Apple.com; today, just five bands are unavailable. In both 38mm and 42mm Classic Buckle, the Sea Blue, Midnight Blue, and Red colorways are sold out, while in the 38mm Modern Buckle, the Midnight Blue and Black options are currently unavailable. That leaves a plethora of other Apple Watch bands on the store for users to purchase, including every Sport Band and Woven Nylon Band. Some bands available have lengthy shipping estimates, like the Midnight Blue Leather Loop's 6-8 week delivery window, but most will arrive in the mail with Apple's usual 1 day speedy delivery, and up to 2 days for free shipping. Apple Watch stock shortages aren't terribly uncommon, with some bundles and bands occasionally selling out months ahead of a refresh, but given Apple's commitment to timely band releases and the number of models currently out of stock it's likely that the company will introduce a similar refresh of Apple Watch bundles and bands in the coming weeks. The Spring 2017 collection could also see the launch of an all-new band material, similar to the debut of Woven Nylon a year ago next month, although no specific rumors about new materials have surfaced. A full hardware refresh isn't expected until later in the year, perhaps alongside the iPhone 8 in the fall, but it's not yet clear if it will mark the Apple Watch's first major design overhaul or another evolution of the basic design profile that debuted in 2015. Rumors have suggested the third-generation Apple Watch will put a focus on improving battery life and performance and may not feature other major changes.

Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple and serves on its Board of Directors. Before being named CEO in August 2011, Tim was Apple's Chief Operating Officer and was responsible for all of the company's worldwide sales and operations. By Seth Fiegerman NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Apple's love affair with Wall Street is back. The iPhone maker's stock rose to $135.09 in trading Tuesday afternoon, passing its previous intraday trading high of $134.54, reached in April 2015. The stock closed at $135.01. Apple's stock flirted with its all-time high on Monday, but ended the day at $133.29. That set a new record closing price for the first time since February 2015. The stock surge, pushing Apple above a $700 billion market cap again, comes amid renewed optimism for the iPhone. Goldman Sachs raised its price target for the stock on Monday, citing the likelihood of "major new features" like "3D sensing" being added to the next iPhone model, according to an investor note provided to CNNMoney. Apple's previous high was set six months after it released the redesigned iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, kicking off what CEO Tim Cook described as the "mother of all upgrades." Since then, however, Apple has bucked its tradition of overhauling the iPhone every other year. The newest models on the market today look nearly identical to the iPhones available in late 2014. The long wait, combined with this year marking the iPhone's tenth anniversary, has only raised expectations that Apple is about to significantly overhaul its smartphone and reignite demand. Apple's annual sales fell in the 2016 fiscal year for the first time since 2001 as iPhone sales, still the majority of its business, declined in three consecutive quarters. Apple even cut its CEO's pay by 15% due to the company's failure to meet its performance goals for both sales and profits. But that losing streak just ended. Apple sales started growing again in the December quarter, driven by stronger demand for the iPhone -- particularly for the larger and more expensive iPhone 7 Plus. The company sold 78.3 million iPhones for the quarter, setting a new record. At least some of that may be due to the Samsung's smartphone recall woes. Mark Moskowitz, an analyst with William Blair, wrote in an investor note this month, "Samsung's Note 7 struggles likely helped." The iPhone isn't the only reason Wall Street is excited about Apple. There's also President Trump. Despite Trump clashing with Apple during the campaign, investors are now optimistic Apple will benefit from at least one Trump proposal: cutting taxes on cash that U.S. businesses bring back from their overseas accounts. Apple currently has $230 billion in cash held in foreign accounts. If Trump and Congress make it cheaper for Apple to bring that money back, it could be used for acquisitions and buybacks.

By CiaraLinnane Corporate news editor Fifty-two percent ‚Äî that‚Äôs the proportion of S&P companies that have fielded questions about President Donald Trump or his administration in their fourth-quarter earnings calls, according to data provider FactSet. FactSet searched call transcripts for the 317 companies among the S&P 500 SPX, +0.50% that had reported earnings as of Feb. 10 and found that uncertainty surrounding Trump‚Äôs policies or proposed policies featured prominently. ‚ÄúRarely has the corporate outlook in America been so influenced by politics,‚Äù is how the Economist described it. The most mentioned topic is tax policy, followed by regulation and trade, according to FactSet. Executives are mostly optimistic about potential corporate tax reform, as the U.S. currently has the highest rate in the world at 35%. That has encouraged companies to exploit all possible loopholes to lower their bill, and prevented many from bringing home cash piles held overseas, as MarketWatch has reported.

Trump has called out many companies, particularly car makers, for producing in countries including Mexico and then shipping their products back into the U.S., arguing they should be taxed for behavior that is keeping well-paid jobs out of the country.

WSJ's Tripp Mickle explains on Lunch Break with Tanya Rivero. Photo: AP Companies that import a great deal of their goods or materials, such as retailers, are opposed to such a tax, while big exporters view it more favorably. But the devil is in the details, and some experts are cautioning a wait-and-see approach until there is more clarity. See: Target, Gap, Best Buy and other retailers going to DC to oppose border tax: report See also: No, your avocados (probably) won‚Äôt cost 20% more ‚ÄúLower corporate taxes represents a potential tailwind to corporate earnings, but our U.S. Economics team expects comprehensive tax reform may be delayed until late 2017 or early 2018,‚Äù Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a Tuesday note. Goldman cited executives from a range of companies, including Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.04% , Pfizer Inc. PFE, +2.32% , United Technologies Corp. UTX, +0.90% and Caterpillar Inc. CAT, +0.95% , who were welcoming toward the notion of corporate tax reform on their conference calls. ‚ÄúI think if there‚Äôs upside, it‚Äôll probably come later in the year, particularly if we start seeing better economic growth, we get tax reform kind of nailed down so people actually know what‚Äôs coming,‚Äù Michael Lynn DeWalt, vice president of finance services at Caterpillar told analysts on his company‚Äôs call. ‚ÄúThe more that happens, the sooner the better.‚Äù The border-tax proposal for now appears mostly confusing as management teams wrestle with the few details under discussion. ‚ÄúThe big question around this whole border adjustment is how are the markets going to react to it,‚Äù said Joseph Gorder, chief executive of oil services company Valero Energy Corp. VLO, +0.21% ¬†. ‚ÄúAnd frankly, we‚Äôve read every one of the sell-side reports on this and then consulting reports ... and it‚Äôs got a lot of moving parts.‚Äù Executives were also mostly positive about the proposal for some kind of tax holiday to allow companies to repatriate cash from overseas at a reduced tax rate. Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.36% Chief Executive Tim Cook, who has long favored such a holiday, said it would good for the U.S. and good for Apple. Cook said the company would look at using that cash for acquisitions, after buying up 15 to 20 companies a year for the last four years. Apple has the most cash overseas of any U.S. company, estimated at about $230 billion by Standard & Poor‚Äôs. It has also repeatedly borrowed in the bond market to fund shareholder returns, adding debt to its balance sheet rather than pay taxes to use overseas cash for that purpose. See also: Don‚Äôt believe the hype: Apple added more debt than cash Don‚Äôt miss: Share buybacks will rise 30% to $780 billion next year, says Goldman Sachs S&P questioned the impact of a tax holiday on credit quality, as it expects many companies would use the money to reward shareholders, either in the form of dividends or share buybacks. That was the case during a 2004 tax holiday, despite rules that sought to force companies to use the money for growth initiatives and to create jobs. ‚ÄúWe would generally view repatriation as a potential credit risk if borrowers were to become more aggressive in their shareholder returns than what we currently assume in our financial forecasts and financial policy assessment,‚Äù S&P analysts wrote on Monday. ‚ÄúAbsent more stringent rules about how companies can deploy cash, we can‚Äôt see a scenario in which U.S. companies overall would wind up with more cash than they have today once repatriation is allowed.‚Äù Management teams are optimistic that regulatory reform would be a positive and would stimulate growth. Trump has signed an executive order pledging to scrap two regulations for every new one imposed and has promised to dismantle Dodd-Frank, the legislation put in place to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. ‚ÄúI think regulatory certainty for investors is the same as it is for management,‚Äù said Comcast Corp. CMCSA, +0.66% CEO Brian Roberts. ‚ÄúIt helps you have the confidence to make long-term plans.‚Äù However, some cautioned that it‚Äôs still too soon to predict the full impact of a loosened regulatory regime. ‚ÄúWhile we see financial tenants more confident, as a result of the strong stock market in the fourth quarter, and legal and lobbying activity has increased in Washington, D.C., we believe it is too early to expect to experience broad positive leasing activity as a result of the speculated plans of the executive branch in Congress,‚Äù said Owen Thomas, CEO of Boston Properties Inc. BXP, +0.14% ¬† . S&P 500 companies are upbeat on the prospect of a more government spending, especially if an infrastructure spending package is pushed through ‚Äî as the president has promised. Goldman said it expects any spending package to be closer to $25 billion a year than the $1 trillion that Trump proposed during his campaign, as Congress is unlikely to allow the deficit to balloon. Defense companies quite naturally welcomed the talk of eliminating the defense sequester to free up military spending, and the budget caps associated with it. ‚ÄúWe have not been investing like we need to in recapitalization and in readiness and then a lot of things that you hear directly from our customers, our services telling Congress and telling the new administration that they need,‚Äù said Marilyn Hewson, CEO of Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, +0.34% ¬† . Airlines welcomed talk of upgrading the air-traffic-control system, which falls under the infrastructure umbrella. Utilities applauded talk of overhauling the electric grid. Perhaps the most controversial topic of all was trade, with some companies welcoming the president‚Äôs intention to make American exports more competitive, and others worried about the potential for a damaging trade war. ‚ÄúYou have to be worried about a trade war. If it gets to that point, it‚Äôs not going to be bad just for trade but it‚Äôs going to be bad economically. It‚Äôs kind of tough to be an economic island now, especially if you‚Äôre the No. 1 economy in the world,‚Äù said David Cote, CEO of Honeywell International Inc. HON, +0.53% ¬†. Pfizer Inc. CEO Ian Read said he views the issue in the pharmaceutical sector as more one of other countries riding on the coattails of the U.S. and its investment in research and development. ‚ÄùStopping free riding is the way I‚Äôd put it,‚Äù Read told analysts on his call. ‚ÄúThe economy‚Äôs free ride on innovation paid for by Americans, clearly it‚Äôs trade policy.‚Äù Pfizer shares have gained 11% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.50% ¬†has gained 25% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.52% ¬† has gained 28%.

The company's market cap broke $700 billion, but it is still about $70 billion short of where it was the last time Apple's individual share price approached $133 two years ago. And despite the tech giant's high stock price, the actual performance of the company is worse than it was in 2015, with 16 percent lower net income and earnings per share down 9 percent. In terms of reaching the elusive trillion-dollar market cap, the company is further away now than it was at other points in the last few years. That's how stock buybacks can change people's perspective of performance. A company's earnings per share can be increased by merely eliminating shares. Apple's $70 billion worth of buybacks in the last two years have accomplished that. Over the last five years, buybacks have wiped out more than a billion shares. Since September 2015, 6 percent of the company's shares have been eliminated. That action alone would help EPS rise by 6 percent, but the 15 percent decline in actual earnings doesn't help. In rough terms, when "E" drops 15 percent and "S" drops 6 percent, you get about a 9 percent drop in EPS. That's where Apple is now compared to two years ago. The last four quarters have garnered Apple $45.2 billion in net income ‚Äî a huge drop from the $53.4 billion it earned in the four quarters ending September 2015. Consider those numbers in context with this so-called record high price. Record stock prices don't mean record performances. Stock buybacks can drive up EPS, but they don't change the fundamentals of a company. In summary, Apple is worth about 10 percent less today compared with two years ago because its actual business seems to be worth at least that much less, despite the higher stock price. To get back to where the company was in 2015, each share would have to jump up about $14 more. Not every record is a meaningful one.

More videos Lower growth, less revenue Leading Australian economists are more pessimistic about the Australian economy than the official Treasury position. Peter Martin explains. Their median forecast of 2.4 per cent matches exactly the average forecast of the 27 experts who took part in this month's BusinessDay¬†Scope Survey. "The committee expects the Australian economy in 2017 to grow at a pace that is similar to that of 2016," chairman Stephen Halmarick said in a statement. "Economic growth is expected to be moderate and driven by strength in net exports and growth in household consumption. Dwelling investment will also add modestly to growth, but business investment is expected to contract again." Related Content Reserve Bank, Treasury, IMF at odds over growth, in accord over company tax Australia a one-trick pony or unicorn? 27 economists weigh in None of the committee expects a recession in 2017 with the most pessimistic assigning it a probability of 25 per cent. Many quoted probabilities of less than 10 per cent. Longer term, by 2020 the committee expects GDP growth of 2.8 per cent, an unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent and a cash rate of 2.5 per cent. On balance, the committee expects the Reserve Bank to leave the cash rate steady for an extended period. "A few committee members continue to expect the Reserve Bank to cut the cash rate further, but the committee agrees that the bank is close to the end of its easing cycle," Mr Halmarick said. Advertisement Like the Reserve Bank, the committee expects iron ore and other commodity prices to slip from their recent highs but does not expect a return to the lows reached in 2016. Opinion was divided about the effectiveness of monetary stimulus in China and the impact of President Donald Trump in the United States. Most expect two more hikes in the Fed's federal funds rate in 2017, each of 25 points.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Accessories Beats X review: Apple made the perfect running headphones Chris Mills @chrisfmills February 14th, 2017 at 12:03 PM Share Tweet Since it killed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, it‚Äôs Apple‚Äôs job to prove that we don‚Äôt need a physical connection to our ears. That means proving wireless headphones can be good, so over the last few months, Apple has been releasing wireless earphones that are supposed to do exactly that. The Airpods, now that they‚Äôre finally on sale, are supposed to be the epitome of everyday headphones for people who don‚Äôt shake their head too much. But for those of use who don‚Äôt have the money (or just weirdly-shaped ears), Apple has the Beats X. Don't Miss: Mesh is the hottest trend in home Wi-Fi, so we tested every top system to find the best They¬†run $150, which isn‚Äôt cheap as far as headphones go. But for quality Bluetooth earbuds, it‚Äôs actually inexpensive, especially considering they share the internals with Apple‚Äôs newly iconic AirPods. They‚Äôre also the cheapest wireless Beats headphones and available in white, black, blue, and grey, if that matters to you. Beats X design is a compromise compared to some other wireless earbuds. There is a wire linking the two buds to each other, but that‚Äôs not all. Rather than some other styles of Bluetooth earbud, the Beats X have a flexible wire with two tiny pods on the end that runs around the back of your neck. You‚Äôll need to look at the picture to understand what this looks like in practice, but the end result is that you‚Äôre wearing a secmicircular wire that sits around your neck, and then has two wires that sneak up to your earbuds. The advantage is that there‚Äôs more space for batteries in the wire, which means the earbuds themselves are light and sit easily in your ears. The disadvantage is that you advertise that your a Beats-wearing, sports-doing person to the rest of the subway. Your call. In practice, I‚Äôve found the design to be the most comfortable and secure wireless headphones I‚Äôve ever used. Because the buds are so light and the wire around your neck doesn‚Äôt move, the earbuds never feel in danger of falling out when I‚Äôm running. The earbuds themselves are well thought out, with optional wings sitting inside your ear to hold the silicone earbud more securely. It‚Äôs the same design that Bose has been using for a while with all of its earbuds, and the result is and earbud that isolates outside noise well and doesn‚Äôt fall out. The backs of the earbuds are also magnetized, so if you drop both buds out of your ears and let them dangle, they lock together so the headphones can‚Äôt fall off your neck. Speaking of sound: the Beats X good, but not exceptional. They provide clean, accurate sound without bias towards bass, and the only real complaint is that cymbals or high vocals can sound a little harsh and undefined. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker by any means, but audiophiles be warned. Still, for the intended purpose ‚Äî which I mostly imagine being exercise, commuting, or anything where you‚Äôre on the go with your phone in your pocket, the Beats X are perfectly adequate. The small details are really where these headphones shine, though. My favorite feature, by far, is the quick-charge capability. When the headphones are dead, you can plug them in via the Lightning port (no micro-USB here!) to get a 25% charge in about five minutes. That‚Äôs ideal for when you want to go for a run and forgot to plug your headphones in, something that normally happens to me a couple times per week. In normal use, I‚Äôm seeing about 8-10 hours of battery life, enough to get me through a working day with a commute. Pairing with an iPhone is as sleek as you could ever wish for, too. The first time you switch the headphones on, hold them next to your iPhone, and a big box will pop up on screen prompting you to connect. You don‚Äôt have to put anything into pairing mode or go digging in the Bluetooth menu, providing you‚Äôre using an Apple device. Once you‚Äôve connected to your iPhone, the Beats X are automatically paired to every other iCloud device you have, so you can switch over to an Apple Watch or MacBook relatively seamlessly. Even once you‚Äôre paired, I find the Beats X to be a little easier to use than other wireless headphones. Pressing the single power button turns them on and pairs them with my iPhone faster than I can open the lockscreen, which makes picking them up to watch a single YouTube video far less painful than with other wireless headphones. Apple‚Äôs wireless engineering is also on show for the range. In a 2,000 square foot apartment, I can walk from one end to the other and only have the headphones cut out when I‚Äôm in the furthest possible range. It‚Äôs a little better than other expensive Bluetooth headphones, and means that in regular use when your phone is in your pocket or a bag, you‚Äôre never going to see connectivity issues. There are a few quibbles: the Beats X aren‚Äôt rated as being waterproof or even sweatproof, which raises some longevity questions. I used the headphones for a few snowy (but sweaty!) runs over the weekend without anything breaking, but six months of daily use could be a different story. The buttons on the in-line remote are also tiny and fiddly, which sounds like a minor quibble until you‚Äôve tried skipping tracks with gloves on. Overall, though, the Beats X are the closest thing I‚Äôve ever seen to the perfect exercise headphones. Comfort and fit is exceptional, audio quality is more than good enough, and tiny details like the quick-charge make me more likely to reach for them on a daily basis. If you‚Äôre an AirPods sceptic who wants to get in on Apple headphones that do legitimately ‚Äújust work,‚Äù they‚Äôre perfect.

And by a large margin, Apple fans ‚Äî and even some employees ‚Äî hate it. The concept for the reality TV show is something like "Shark Tank" meets "The Voice." App developers come up with ideas for apps, choose a celebrity mentor like will.i.am or Jessica Alba, and eventually win $10 million in funding from Lightspeed Partners as well as premium placement on the front page of Apple's app store. "Developers, they're the rock stars of right now," will.i.am says in the trailer, while wearing gold boots. One contestant gives the one-liner, "We're Ebay for the Snapchat generation." The show will air exclusively on Apple Music. You can watch the trailer at the bottom of the page. Here's what the Apple world is saying about it: Paul Haddad, developer of popular iOS apps including Tweetbot: It‚Äôs like a super cringe worthy version of Shark Tank.

The iPhone 7S, which is expected to measure 4.7 inches, will continue using an aluminum-alloy chassis supplied by Catcher Technology, sources from the ‚Äúupstream supply chain‚Äù told DigiTimes . The highly-anticipated 5.8-inch iPhone 8 will come with glass casing reinforced by a stainless steel frame supplied by Foxconn Technology and Jabil Circuit. Apple is also expected to release a 5.5-inch iPhone. That device‚Äôs casing has not been confirmed yet. iPhone 8 (iPhone X) Feature Rumors The iPhone 8 is rumored to come with an OLED panel which could stretch across the entire front of the device, meaning the iPhone might be price at more than $1,000. ¬† Related Stories Battery Capacity in Smaller iPhone 8 Could Be As Much As iPhone 7 Plus iPhone 8 Rumors: Apple's 10th Anniversary iPhone May Cost More Than $1K Apple might also ditch the physical home button from the new device by placing it underneath the display surface and will be a button to touch not press. The new iPhone could also come without physical buttons on the side of the device and instead have touch-sensitive inlays in the metal, according to a recent Fast Company report. Other rumored features include face recognition, improved 3D Touch, and dual lens cameras on the 5.5-inch and 5.8-inch models. Meanwhile, the smaller version of the iPhone 8, which could be called the iPhone 7S, could pack as much battery capacity as the iPhone 7 Plus, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently said.

By Ross Rubin | February 14, 2017 -- 17:54 GMT (09:54 PST) | Topic: iPhone Apple has a long history of hanging back and embracing standards with a big splash. One example was USB, the now-ubiquitous connector that got off to a slow start before Apple began supporting it in the iMac. Another was Wi-Fi, a prevalent standard that once competed for consumer adoption with a vanquished rival called HomeRF. Does the iPhone still matter? Huawei, not Apple, now drives the mobile conversation Cupertino is a victim of its own success and is fully responsible for creating the Chinese Android monster. Read More Now, news that Apple has joined of the Wireless Power Consortium comes amidst rumors that the company will finally add inductive charging to the iPhone, becoming one of the last major manufacturers to do so, either directly or via a first-party accessory. Of course, there is no guarantee that Apple will so act. It was, for example, a board member of the Blu-ray Disc Association and never shipped a product with a Blu-ray drive. It's also possible that Apple could reserve wireless charging, as it does now, for select products such as the Apple Watch. However, were the company to bring Qi to the iPhone, it would have a broad range of implications. Also: As iPhone 8 rumors swirl, Apple takes big step toward wireless charging | OLED iPhone 8 will be an expensive gamble for Apple | No need to wait for the iPhone 8: You can have wireless iPhone charging today Game over. For years, at least two incompatible charging systems systems have been vying for adoption among among handset makers, accessory suppliers, and venues such as Starbucks and airport lounges. They have been Qi, supported by the Wireless Power Consortium, and Airfuel, the latest name of a roll-up of standards supported by the Airfuel Alliance. The Qi standard that Apple would support has had a significant lead in smartphone adoption. While the Airfuel Alliance has had some powerful backers such as Intel, Starbucks, and Samsung, the latter has supported Qi alongside Airfuel in a nod toward the rival standard's prevalence. Apple's embrace of Qi would be a major blow to Airfuel, which could die on the vine or retreat to focus on wireless PC charging as Intel has positioned it. Better compatibility. In addition to coronating Qi as the One True Induction Charging Standard, Apple's embrace of Qi could benefit the performance of the standard in a few ways. First, it wouldn't be surprising to see Apple's arrival coincide with a new version of the Qi standard that offered faster charging, greater range or other benefits. Also, with a huge new potential market, makers of Qi chargers would likely step up to ensure compatibility with the iPhone and other phone vendors would ensure that they conformed to this implementation as well. A sealed iPhone. I wrote about the potential of a sealed iPhone in advance of Apple dropping the iPhone's headphone jack. Adopting wireless power wouldn't necessarily mean that the company would kill the Lightning port in the next iPhone. However, there would be several reasons that might give Apple the "courage" to do so . These include freeing up ever-precious real estate and easier waterproofing. Lighting has been living on borrowed time anyway since Apple embraced USB-C. As many frustrated new MacBook Pro owners has observed, it's pretty ridiculous that the power cable for their computer can't charge an iPhone when it can charge Android phones from brands such as Motorola, HTC, and LeEco. The evolution of iPhone through the year... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 14 NEXT PREV A chorus of yawns. Supporting Qi is far from leading edge. LG shipped the first Qi-compatible phone in the US in 2011. Even BlackBerry checked it off its bucket list with the Priv. Of course, if Qi were just an incremental feature in the new phone, there may be cause for a golf clap. After all, the lack of Qi support hasn't done much to keep people away from iPhones up to this point. But if this "catch-up" functionality is positioned as a major new feature, the next iPhone likely doesn't have a great story to tell. Contactless wireless charging push-back. And there might be further bad news associated with Apple adopting Qi. Many speculated that Apple was bypassing charging pads to embrace a room-based system that passively provides wireless electricity through the air much as Wi-Fi provides connectivity. There are already a few companies in this space, including WiTricity, Energous, and UBeam. Microsoft also recently filed a patent for a room-based wireless charging system using light. Of course, Apple could support both pad-based and room-based of charging technologies, but adopting Qi signals that such advances are further in the future for the iPhone. Once the pads are in place, inductive wireless charging is a cool convenience. It would make topping off the iPhone easier and Apple's support would make Qi more prevalent and more robust. But support for wireless charging on its own would hardly be the kind of game changer that Apple needs for its flagship device.

Former EMI and Apple executive Alex Luke has been hired as Amazon Music's global head of programming and content strategy, a newly created position that comes as the retail/tech giant goes toe-to-toe-to-toe with Spotify and Apple Music in the ever-competitive music streaming space. Luke will be based in Seattle, reporting to Amazon Music head Steve Boom. Luke was most recently a partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm The Valley Fund, which has invested in health and tech companies. From 2011 until 2013, however, he was executive vp of A&R at EMI Music, where he worked with artists including Capital Cities, Katy Perry and David Guetta, among others. Prior to that, he spent eight years as director of music programming and label relations at Apple, where his many duties included hosting his own iTunes-driven radio show. The Texas A&M grad arrives as the company is feeling positively "bullish" about the music space, thanks to the popularity of its Echo smart speaker line and the promise seen in Amazon Music Unlimited, a subscription-based streaming service launched in October 2016. There's also the apparently booming Prime Music, its entry level streaming service bundled with Prime memberships. "We're pretty optimistic about the future," said Boom in a recent Billboard interview. "I think we‚Äôre at the cusp of what I would call the Golden Age here. We're not saying tomorrow it‚Äôs going to magically shoot up, but when we look at the long-term prospects of the music industry, we're incredibly bullish."

That's a lot of smartphone for Rs 15,999. If that wasn't enough, there's also a cheaper option available -- for Rs 12,999 -- that ships with 3GB RAM and 32GB memory. Buying a smartphone has never been more exciting. The Honor 6X follows in the footsteps of the Honor 5X. Just like its predecessor, the Honor 6X is also a jack of all trades. Only, it has a couple of more tricks up its sleeve. The Honor 6X is very utilitarian but it is also very boring The Honor 6X is a lot like its predecessor phone, the Honor 5X. And yet, it's more than just another paint job. While the Honor 5X was gunning for premium build, the Honor 6X wants to be utilitarian as well. The result is a phone that looks good and (also) feels good. Being metal and all, you'd expect it to be slippery. But, it isn't. Unlike a phone like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, the Honor 6X comes with more dramatic curves on the rear and a front panel that sticks out as flat as a pancake. The phone, as a result, feels sharp(er) in the hands when you hold it for the first time. The design then grows on you, so much so that you start to appreciate it. No other smartphone at its price point offers better ergonomics, after all. The same cannot be said about its build quality though. The Honor 6X maybe an all-metal phone -- with top and bottom ends being plastic with brushed metal finish to accommodate the antennas -- but it doesn't actually feel like one. It feels plastic in the hands, something which is accentuated (even) further when you apply a little bit of pressure on its backside. The back panel makes this odd creaking sound every time you press it with your fingers, which I am sure, would irk many. The power button and the volume rocker on the right are, however, well-built and offer good tactile feedback. The phone's physical dimensions are in line with most rival phones, which means, it is (almost) as thin and as light as phones like the Redmi Note 4, the Lenovo K6 Note and Coolpad's Cool 1 . The same cannot be said about its screen-to-body ratio though. In fact, Honor's new phone has some of the chunkiest bezels that I've seen in (and around) its price point. Also, my review unit came with a rather oddly placed tempered glass protector that did not even cover the entire screen. Well it did, sort of, but not to my liking. Phones like the ones I mentioned above have left me feeling pampered. If Xiaomi, Lenovo and Coolpad can take care of (even) the smallest details while designing their lower mid-range phones, I don't see why Honor can't do something similar. The Honor 6X has a 1080p screen but colours appear washed out The 5.5-inch 1080p display on-board the Honor 6X is a big improvement over the 720p screen of the Honor 5X. It gets pleasantly bright and viewing angles are also quite good. The two when put together ensure the phone is perfectly usable under direct sunlight. At the same time, because the phone uses an LTPS panel, it runs cooler than standard LCD-toting phones (for instance, the Redmi Note 4).¬†Sadly, colour accuracy leaves a lot to be desired. They appear washed out, or more precisely, lacking in contrast when compared to a phone like the Redmi Note 4, or for that matter, even the Moto G4 Plus. There is an option to correct colour temperature manually, which helps a bit, but not as much as I would have liked. The phone also comes with a built-in blue light filter -- Eye Comfort mode -- akin to Apple's Night Shift that automatically turns colours to the warmer end of the spectrum when enabled. There is also an option to select a start and end point for this functionality like it is in Apple's iPhones. The Honor 6X performs quite well but there's room for improvement The Honor 6X is powered by a 2.1GHz octa-core HiSilicon Kirin 655 processor clubbed with Mali-T830MP2 GPU. The phone comes with up to 4GB of RAM and up to 64GB of internal memory. Expandable storage -- of up to 256GB -- is supported via a hybrid micro-SD card slot. While the Honor 5X was gunning for premium build, the Honor 6X wants to be utilitarian as well. The result is a phone that looks good and (also) feels good Unlike a phone like the Redmi Note 4 (Qualcomm Snapdragon 625) which uses a chipset built on the power-efficient 14nm finfet process, the custom-built Kirin 655 which is inside the Honor 6X is based on a 16nm finfet process. Both the chipsets are however guided by the same principle, which is, attaining higher clock speeds without overheating and draining the battery quickly. There are (of course) differences but for most users it would all narrow down to this: you're more likely to get (much) better battery life and little (or no) overheating in phones powered by a chipset on the lines of a Snapdragon 625 or a Kirin 655. Honor holds an edge (over Xiaomi, Lenovo and Moto) however, in that -- just like Apple -- it has complete control over both its hardware and software which invariably should entail in better all-round optimisation. Better all-round optimisation means Honor's phone should ideally be the smoothest of the lot. It is, but, only marginally. The Honor 6X is quick and responsive in every sense of the word. There were no visible lags or stutter while navigating between home screens and/or multitasking in my review unit. Just so you know, I have been using the top-tier 4 gig RAM and 64 gig memory version. Not everything is hunky dory though. Although the Honor 6X handles basic games well, GPU-intensive games leave you asking for more, a problem that plagues even the Redmi Note 4. Xiaomi's phone holds a slight edge, however, because the Adreno 506 GPU inside it is slightly more potent than the Mali GPU inside the Honor 6X. The Honor 6X is, as a result, prone to some occasional lags while playing graphical games at maxed out settings for longer periods.¬†Additionally, because Honor is in complete control of its hardware it can afford to cram in a low-power i5 co-processor inside its Kirin 655 chipset which is then able to take over more specific tasks that do not require hard-grinding, such as counting steps and speech recognition. By doing this, the Kirin 655 chipset inside the Honor 6X can squeeze out even more juice out of its fairly respectable 3,340mAh battery. Also Read: Lenovo K6 Note review: Another Note in the wall Speaking of which, the 3,340mAh battery inside the Honor 6X may not last you as long as the massive 4,100mAh battery inside the Redmi Note 4. But it is no slouch either. Moderate to extreme usage saw us cross the one whole day barrier with ease, while toning down further should get most users one and a half days out of the phone. Extreme usage scenarios got us close to 11 hours on the Honor 6X, which is not bad at all. Sadly, the Honor 6X does not support fast charging. The bottom-firing mono speaker on-board the Honor 6X -- which also supports DTS audio -- gets very loud, with minimum or no distortion at peak volume. Phone calls made with the phone are of excellent quality and I did not encounter any odd call drop issues with my review unit. The dual-SIM phone runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow-based EMUI 4.1 and supports 4G LTE and USB OTG. As expected, you get a user interface with lots of fancy colour schemes and animations, and no app drawer. An update to Android Nougat (EMUI 5) is on its way and should land sometime in Q2 2017. It will allow you to access an app drawer for one, among other things. Huawei's Emotion UI may not be as visually appealing as Xiaomi's MIUI, or as simplistic as Moto's vanilla UI, but it is feature packed to the brim, and is very, very slick provided you're the kind of person who's as curious as a cat and likes to dig into things. The Emotion UI has a number of useful Easter eggs scattered all across its length and breadth. You can get quick access to apps like voice recorder, calculator, torch and camera (depending on the theme, there could be more) right from the lock screen by swiping up from the bottom edge. This saves you the trouble of unlocking and sifting through your apps when you're in a hurry. The home screen meanwhile gives you a quick search feature (taken from the iPhone of course and accessed similarly by swiping down) that can sift through apps, contacts and messages to help you quickly find what you're looking for. Features like one-hand UI and dual window are also worth mentioning. The gallery app is such that it allows you to access the camera app directly from inside it by swiping down. Picture this: you're browsing your photos and something picturesque comes along. All you have to do is swipe down, and voila, the camera app is up and running instantly. It's as if it was sitting there all this time, waiting for you to make the move. A very handy Wi-Fi+ feature, meanwhile, allows you to switch seamlessly between Wi-Fi and mobile data depending on whether or not you're near your Wi-Fi hotspot.¬† One more thing...rather, make it two The Honor 6X comes with not one, but two cameras on the rear. Because well, why not? Now Huawei's Honor isn't new to dual-camera phones. The company previously launched the Honor 8, which is simply a toned-down version of Huawei's flagship P9 and retails for Rs 29,999. The Honor 6X, however, brings dual cameras to the masses. Also Read: Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 review: Raising the bar The dual camera setup, in case of the Honor 6X is (at the same time) different from the one on-board the Honor 8 or the Huawei P9. It consists of a 12-megapixel + 2-megapixel setup assisted with phase detection autofocus and LED flash. While the 12-megapixel lens is what you can a regular lens, the 2-megapixel lens is capable of depth sensing so users can attain software-enhanced background blur in photos post clicking a shot. It is, therefore, very important to understand what the dual camera setup can and can't do before going gaga about it. Let's start with the things that it can't do. The setup can't assist in clicking better day-light photos. The setup also can't assist in clicking better low-light photos. If you're looking for dual cameras and better picture quality, you're better off with a phone like the Coolpad Cool 1 which has two cameras on the rear -- dual 13-megapixel with phase detection autofocus and dualLED (dual tone) flash -- wherein one takes monochrome shots while the other takes photos in colour (RGB). The phone's software algorithm then merges both the images into one and creates the final photo. The dual rear camera system on-board the Honor 6X, in comparison, can assist (only) in achieving fancy bokeh effects in shots both before and after taking a shot. The second 2MP sensor springs into action only when you hit a dedicated wide aperture mode that sits up top in the camera app at all times. It works best when your subject is within 2 metres. It works even better when it's in isolation and the subjects in the background are at some distance. If not, be prepared for some wonky -- unrealistic -- bokeh effects that you would laugh at (and joke about) initially, only to delete them later. The dual rear camera system on-board the Honor 6X can assist (only) in achieving fancy bokeh effects in shots both before and after taking a shot. It works best when your subject is within 2 metres The wide aperture mode allows you to simulate an aperture from f/0.95 (most bokeh) all the way to f/16 (no bokeh). It works really well when everything's in place, which means you'll have to be absolutely committed to it if you're looking for good results. But the mode doesn't work in manual, and then reality hits you. Was it really worth all the effort? Now I am not saying that it's no fun, all I am saying is phones in and around the Honor 6X's price are giving me better results. The Cool 1, for instance, is giving me dual cameras and (much) better results. I am looking for results. X PreviousNext Which is where the Honor 6X fails to make a mark. The 12-megapixel primary lens clicks only above-average photos even in ideal lighting. Dynamic range leaves a lot to be desired and photos are often marred by metering (underexposure) issues. Although some of these photos look brilliant on the phone, when viewed on full-screen these tend to have noise, the level of which rises even further as the intensity of light decreases.¬† ¬†¬† The front-facing 8-megapixel selfie camera is also just about average and clicks selfies with some noise, even in good lighting. Should you buy it? The Honor 6X, like the Honor 5X is not a bad phone. In fact, it's quite good. But it is brought down by some tough competition. Honor's new phone has an all-metal body, a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, a 1080p screen, a very capable 8-core processor, plenty of storage (which is also expandable), a guaranteed update to Android Nougat, a dual-camera system on the rear, DTS audio support and a 3,340mAh battery powering the whole thing. And it starts at just Rs 12,999. It is a jack of all trades, the Honor 6X. But a master of none. Phones like the Redmi Note 4, the K6 Note, the Cool 1 and even the Moto G4 Plus (with its stupendously good camera) are also not perfect. But, they are just better as an overall package. If however, you've been using the Honor 5X (or the 4X), the Honor 6X is a good upgrade.

Shares of Apple are trading above their all-time high Monday, fueled in part by mounting speculation about the new iPhone - which many expect will get a substantial makeover. Most people who follow these rumours expect three models of the iPhone: presumably an iPhone 7s, an iPhone 7s Plus and an iPhone 8. What isn't so clear is whether those will be their actual names. After all, this is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, so some people are expecting the "iPhone 8" to be called the "iPhone X." Because X's, as we all know, are cool. Apple iPhone 8 Specifications, Release Date, and More - Leaks and Rumours So Far This high-end version of the iPhone is the one really generating the bulk of the excitement, as it's expected to be the one with the most design changes. Some more intriguing rumors about the actual specs of the phone have surfaced in the past couple of weeks. Here's a look at what experts expect to see. iPhone 10 Year Anniversary: Apple CEO Tim Cook Says 'Best Is Yet to Come‚Äô A sharper screen: Previous spins through the rumour mill have raised expectations that at least the most expensive version of the iPhone will have an OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) screen, rather than the LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) technology it packs now. Translated from alphabet soup, the biggest difference for consumers will be in the picture quality. OLED screens are known for having vivid colors and deep blacks. Apple competitors - including Samsung, LG, Google and Motorola - have all released phones with this type of screen in the past. But Apple hasn't, which means that there's a good chunk of the smartphone market that may not know what they're missing - which makes the rumour about this display on the new iPhone all the more exciting. Many analysts also think that the firm will use a curved screen, similar to what we've seen on the Samsung Galaxy Edge. (Samsung, after all, is a screen supplier for Apple.) A display that wraps around the edge of the phone gives you more screen to work with overall. That's a benefit for people who watch a lot of video on their phones. Late last year, there were also reports that the phone would have a "virtual button" instead of a physical home button, making for an even smoother display. A very high price tag: Now this is a doozy. Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities predicted the fanciest iPhone could bear a price tag of more than $1,000 (roughly Rs. 67,000). It's not quite as far-fetched as it may seem: a fully loaded iPhone 7 Plus, for example, already costs $969 (roughly Rs. 65,000). Still, it's a psychological price line that many people may balk at, particularly when Apple's least expensive laptop is $999. Why so pricey? Look no further than the rumor right above this one - that coveted OLED screen. Producing an OLED screen isn't easy, particularly when you're working on the kind of scale that Apple does. The question is whether the screen quality improvement will be enough to persuade people to dole out their cash. Set it down, charge it up: This has been a persistent item on the iPhone owner wishlist, particularly as Apple competitors such as Samsung have added it to their phones. This rumour went from wishful thinking late last year to likely, however, when Kuo said that the next generation of iPhones will have wireless charging capabilities. Although, as 9to5 Mac reported, it's not clear whether the wireless charger itself will be included with a new phone. Apple already uses wireless charging for the Apple Watch, so it's not a huge leap of faith to think they could adapt their technology for the phone. The company last week also joined the Wireless Power Consortium, a standards body devoted to - well, you can probably guess, right? In a statement to Business Insider, the company said it's looking "to participate and contribute ideas" to the future thinking around wireless charging. But it declined to comment on the report's speculation about future products. ¬© 2017 The Washington Post Tags: iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone X, Apple, Mobiles, iPhone 8 Specifications, iPhone 8 Features MapMyIndia's eLoc Wants to Be an Aadhaar for Your Physical Address iPhone 8's $1,000 Price Tag, and Other Rumours About Apple's Next Smartphone ¬† ¬† Advertisement ¬† In Mobiles and Tablets Latest Intex Ultra 4000i Intex Turbo Selfie+ Meizu M5s Nokia 3310 Intex Aqua Lions 4G Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X Zen Cinemax 4G Intex Aqua 4.0 Intex Aqua Supreme+ Intex Aqua Crystal Gionee F5 Lava 4G Connect M1 Huawei Honor 8 Lite Intex Aqua Amaze+ Asus ZenFone 3S Max ZTE Blade A2 Plus Swipe Elite Power Lava X41+ Intex Cloud Q11 4G Intex Cloud Style 4G Popular Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro Moto M Oppo A57 Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Nokia 6 OnePlus 3T Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Motorola Moto Z Moto Z Play Lenovo K5 Note Xiaomi Redmi 3s HTC 10 Xiaomi Mi5 Galaxy J7 2016 Micromax phones Samsung phones Android Phones Smartphones Google Phones Nokia Phones Honor 6X Gadgets 360 Hindi ‡§Æ‡•ã‡§ü‡•ã ‡§ú‡•Ä5 ‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡•á‡§∏‡§ø‡§´‡§ø‡§ï‡•á‡§∂‡§® ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡•Ä‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç ‡§≤‡•â‡§®‡•ç‡§ö ‡§∏‡•á ‡§™‡§π‡§≤‡•á ‡§≤‡•Ä‡§ï ‡§Ö‡§¨ ‡§´‡•á‡§∏‡§¨‡•Å‡§ï ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ú‡§∞‡§ø‡§è ‡§™‡§æ‡§è‡§Ç ‡§®‡•å‡§ï‡§∞‡•Ä, ‡§Ü‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§®‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§´‡§º‡•Ä‡§ö‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ‡§Ø‡§Ç‡§∏ ‡§ú‡§ø‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§®‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ï‡•Ä‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®, ‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡§ï‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ñ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ 10 ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ã‡§°‡§º ‡§™‡§æ‡§∞ Latest Videos 01:47 Coolpad Note 3S Review 02:29 Oppo A57 Review 02:55 360 Daily: India Puts Record 104 Satellites Into Orbit, Meizu M5s Launched, and More 01:34 Six WhatsApp Features You May Not Know About 03:00 360 Daily: Nokia 6 Is Selling Unofficially in India, Nokia 3310 May Make a Comeback, and More More Videos¬ª OPINIONS ALL AUTHORS Rohan Naravane Why Apple Is the Only Manufacturer That Actually Has a 'Flagship' Phone Gopal Sathe Nintendo's Mobile Games Are So Successful, It Can't Be Sure What Works Akhil Arora How Netflix Is Losing Ground to Amazon and Hotstar in India Advertisement Recent Pokemon Go Set to Receive Its Biggest Update Since Launch HTC Plans a Mobile VR Device That's 'Not a Phone Slapped Onto a Headset' Reliance Jio Has 23 Percent Market Share, Second to Airtel: Truecaller LG G6's FullVision Display and UX 6.0 Previewed Amazon, Google Said to Be Considering Turning Smart Speakers Into Phones Read Google CEO Pichai's Reply to 7-Year-Old Girl's Job Application Apple Said to Mull China Supplier for Next-Gen iPhone Screen Clash of Clans Maker Supercell Talks Strategy in a Post-Pokemon Go World H1B Visas Worries 'Hyped Up', Says TCS Boss N Chandrasekaran iPhone 8 Tipped to Ditch Home Button for 'Function Area' More News TRENDING Read Google CEO Pichai's Reply to 7-Year-Old Girl's Job Application Moto G5, Moto G5 Plus Specifications, Photos Leaked Again Ahead of Launch iPhone 8 Tipped to Ditch Home Button for 'Function Area' WhatsApp Appoints Facebook's Idema as COO to Boost Monetisation: Report Reliance Jio Has 23 Percent Market Share, Second to Airtel: Truecaller ISRO Launches PSLV-C37 Rocket: Here's the List of 104 Satellites on Board Jio Stands for Affordability in a World Where Data Is the New Oil: Ambani Nokia 6 Is Available in India but There's Nothing Official About It LG G6's FullVision Display and UX 6.0 Previewed League of Legends Creator Riot Games to Set Up Shop in India Sitemaps Archives Advertise About Us Feedback Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions Complaint Redressal Careers Contact Us RSS Ethics Gadgets Hindi ¬© Copyright Red Pixels Ventures Limited 2017.

The stock was up 1.2 percent at $134.90 at midday, beating its previous intraday high of $134.54 set on April 28, 2015. The S&P 500's largest component has climbed 50 percent from lows in the first half of last year and is up 16 percent so far in 2017, with many investors betting that Apple will mark the iPhone's 10th anniversary with a dramatically improved model. Many on Wall Street also believe that strong sales of the iPhone 6S two years ago have left a larger-than-normal base of customers ready to upgrade. The Cupertino, California, company reported strong December-quarter results on Jan. 31. Although it gave a cautious outlook for the current quarter, Wall Street expects revenue to grow this year after sinking nearly 8 percent in fiscal 2016. Apple's stock recently traded at 14.3 times expected earnings, the highest level since April 2015 and significantly higher than the average price-earnings ratio of 12 over the past five years, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Apple stock hits new all-time high by Seth Fiegerman ¬† @sfiegerman February 14, 2017: 4:15 PM ET Tech firms take travel ban opposition to court Apple's love affair with Wall Street is back. The iPhone maker's stock rose to $135.09 in trading Tuesday afternoon, passing its previous intraday trading high of $134.54, reached in April 2015. The stock closed at $135.01. Apple's stock flirted with its all-time high on Monday, but ended the day at $133.29. That set a new record closing price for the first time since February 2015. The stock surge, pushing Apple (AAPL, Tech30) above a $700 billion market cap again, comes amid renewed optimism for the iPhone. Goldman Sachs raised its price target for the stock on Monday, citing the likelihood of "major new features" like "3D sensing" being added to the next iPhone model, according to an investor note provided to CNNMoney. Apple's previous high was set six months after it released the redesigned iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, kicking off what CEO Tim Cook described as the "mother of all upgrades." Since then, however, Apple has bucked its tradition of overhauling the iPhone every other year. The newest models on the market today look nearly identical to the iPhones available in late 2014. The long wait, combined with this year marking the iPhone's tenth anniversary, has only raised expectations that Apple is about to significantly overhaul its smartphone and reignite demand. Related: Tim Cook: 'Apple would not exist without immigration' Apple's annual sales fell in the 2016 fiscal year for the first time since 2001 as iPhone sales, still the majority of its business, declined in three consecutive quarters. Apple even cut its CEO's pay by 15% due to the company's failure to meet its performance goals for both sales and profits. But that losing streak just ended. Apple sales started growing again in the December quarter, driven by stronger demand for the iPhone -- particularly for the larger and more expensive iPhone 7 Plus. The company sold 78.3 million iPhones for the quarter, setting a new record. At least some of that may be due to the Samsung's smartphone recall woes. Mark Moskowitz, an analyst with William Blair, wrote in an investor note this month, "Samsung's Note 7 struggles likely helped." The iPhone isn't the only reason Wall Street is excited about Apple. There's also President Trump. Despite Trump clashing with Apple during the campaign, investors are now optimistic Apple will benefit from at least one Trump proposal: cutting taxes on cash that U.S. businesses bring back from their overseas accounts. Apple currently has $230 billion in cash held in foreign accounts. If Trump and Congress make it cheaper for Apple to bring that money back, it could be used for acquisitions and buybacks.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP) 9815 CONNECTTWEET 27 LINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORE Meet Wall Street's new $20 trillion-dollar man: Mr. Market. Mr. Market is the¬†nickname¬†for the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 stock index. In Monday trading the large-company stock gauge¬†not only hit another fresh¬†high, but it also hit a record market value of $20.03 trillion, up from $5.9 trillion back at the market's last major low on March 9, 2009, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. The S&P 500 jumped 12.15 points to close Monday at 2328.25. The market value, or capitalization, of the S&P 500 is derived by adding up the market values¬†¬†of all 500 companies in the index. Heading into this week¬†Apple ranked No. 1 in S&P 500 market value at $710.7¬†billion, followed by software giant Microsoft at $503.2 billion. Monday's rally marked¬†a continuation of a sharp rise in stock prices since Donald Trump was elected president on Nov. 8. Wall Street has been in risk-taking mode as investors bet that Trump's promised moves to lower income taxes for corporations and other policies deemed positive for economic growth will warrant higher stock prices. The S&P 500's rise in value above $20 trillion for the first time ever comes on a day when every corner of the U.S. stock market was in rally mode.¬†The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average, the technology-packed Nasdaq composite, and small-company Russell 2000 indexes, notched record closing highs Monday. Loans are getting harder to come by for some consumers And Apple, the maker of iPhones and iPads and the world's largest company by market value, closed at an all-time high of $133.29, eclipsing its prior record of $133¬†per share on Feb. 23, 2015. (Apple once closed at¬†$702.10¬†but that was before its 7-for-1 stock split in June 2014 which at the time adjusted its stock price lower to $100.30.) The rally, one Wall Street pro says, is being driven by three things. "First, the earnings season is coming in with a slate of upside surprises, especially among growth stocks" like online retailer Amazon.com and Apple, says David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Canadian-based investment firm Gluskin Sheff. The S&P 500's fourth-quarter 2016 earnings growth rate is now 8.4%, on pace for its best quarter since the third quarter of 2014, according to earnings tracker Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Allergan makes $2.5B acquisition of 'body contouring' business Second, says Rosenberg, is news that the deal to cut oil-production agreed to by members of OPEC is holding, which is keeping the price of U.S.-produced crude in the mid-$50 per barrel range. Crude fell 1.8% Monday to around $53 per barrel. The final piece of the puzzle, according to Rosenberg, are signs that President Trump is dialing down some of his more controversial foreign policy views. "Trump has shown some impressive flexibility lately," Rosenberg told clients. Still, despite the market hitting new highs, there's a healthy mix of trepidation to go along with the optimism, says Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. "The tick (the market) is up, but so is nervousness," Silverblatt told USA TODAY. "The current saying is 'things could change on a tweet.'" 9815 CONNECTTWEET 27 LINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2l8dA7j NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

Luke is joining Amazon from The Valley Fund, a Silicon Valley VC shop. Before that, he worked for two years as EVP of A&R at EMI. The major had poached him in 2011 from Apple, where he had been working as Director of Music Programming & Label Relations for eight years. Previous stints also included jobs at radio stations, and some work at music streaming service Napster. Amazon launched it own paid streaming service to take on Apple Music and Spotify last October. Before that, Amazon was offering Prime subscribers a limited music streaming experience as part of their yearly membership fee. The company has also for some time offered paid MP3 downloads, and has long been one of the largest music retailers in the world, thanks to its CD business. Amazon‚Äôs¬†secret weapon in the music streaming wars has been its Echo smart speaker, which has been selling like hotcakes.The company hasn‚Äôt released any official sales numbers for the device, but market researchers estimated that it had sold 5 million by last November. The Echo is closely integrated with Amazon Music, allowing consumers to request songs and playlists with simple voice commands. Amazon is also using the device as an upsell, offering¬†consumers to access a Echo-only tier of its streaming service for $4 a month.

More videos 'It will be more than $100,000...' Domino's Pizza franchisee discusses the price of securing a visa. Pizza giant Domino's is the latest company to wheel out the crisis management manual, amid allegations of widespread underpayment of workers and a business model that¬†pushes¬†some of its¬†franchisees to cut corners. Since the scandal broke, Domino's has issued statements that it has "zero tolerance" for wage fraud and says its model is profitable for franchisees. Related Content Investors put the heat on Domino's as profits miss the mark Domino's workers kept in the dark for almost two years It has come out with some strongly worded statements about its lack of tolerance for wrongdoing. "There is no reason, no excuse, and no tolerance for any Domino's franchise that chooses not to pay its employees correctly or fails to meet expectations around ethics and governance," it said in one statement. Advertisement In other words, there was no need to cut corners, such as underpaying workers. To make it abundantly clear¬†that its network is virtually squeaky clean, it said only four franchisees had been stripped of their franchise ‚Äì "terminated' in the company's language ‚Äì¬†for deliberately underpaying workers. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Heat is on: Dominos chief executive Don Meij has vowed zero tolerance.¬†Photo: Chris Hyde Out of 600 stores, that doesn't seem like a lot.¬† But dig a bit deeper and all isn't as it seems. Fairfax Media has evidence that a number of franchisees caught underpaying workers weren't terminated. External audits commissioned by Domino's, and obtained by Fairfax,¬†found evidence of possible "illegal" and "fraudulent" activity. If Domino's has zero tolerance for wrongdoing, why weren't these franchisees¬†terminated? Domino's draws a key distinction between "wilful" breaches of workplace law and "accidental" underpayment due to "simple misunderstandings". And it's ultimately Domino's who draws the line between the two. The company has dismissed some cases, where Fairfax has evidence underpayment was regular and substantial, as representing only a "limited number of discrepancies." Mmm. Domino's was asked just how many stores had been audited in the past few years and how many were found to be underpaying wages. It declined to answer that¬†question. It so far has also failed to divulge the total number of workers they had detected as being underpaid. The hope is that they will be more transparent after the release of their profit results on Wednesday. Fairfax Media has compiled its own database of underpaid workers and so far that stretches to hundreds of individuals for stores in Queensland, NSW, Victoria and South Australia. Given the number of emails and phone calls that have flooded in over the past few days, there seems to be a deep¬†problem of underpayment at Domino's. There also seems to be a number of franchisees hurting as they are required to pay more and more fees and charges, as well as rising food and labour costs. On Wednesday Domino's will outline a record profit and include a page on franchisees, including how the average profit has gone up to more than $145,000. But across such a big network, this number can be meaningless, particularly when some stores make hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit.¬† Domino's own national sales figures show the top performing store for the week ending January 22 made almost $5000 more than its nearest rival. January figures for stores across NSW and the ACT showed the top performing store made $18,000 more than its closest competitor. The Domino's juggernaut has had a stellar performance on the ASX since it listed in 2005, with investors piling into the stock ‚Äì and making a killing. Since a listing price of $2.20 it rose to $80 in August 2016 before sliding back to a $62 close on Tuesday. The attraction has been the pizza giant's ability to grow the network. It now has a target of 1200 stores across Australia and New Zealand by 2025, which is ambitious. To do that it needs a constant pipeline of prospective buyers, whether that comes in the form of convincing existing franchisees to buy new stores or enticing new franchisees to become part of the system. That means treating them well. Related Content Domino's scandal: franchisee selling visas Domino's needs to face up to itself 1 comment Log in to comment New User?

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Beats X review: Apple made the perfect running headphones Chris Mills BGR NewsFebruary 14, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Since it killed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, it‚Äôs Apple‚Äôs job to prove that we don‚Äôt need a physical connection to our ears. That means proving wireless headphones can be good, so over the last few months, Apple has been releasing wireless earphones that are supposed to do exactly that. The Airpods, now that they‚Äôre finally on sale, are supposed to be the epitome of everyday headphones for people who don‚Äôt shake their head too much. But for those of use who don‚Äôt have the money (or just weirdly-shaped ears), Apple has the Beats X. Don't Miss: Mesh is the hottest trend in home Wi-Fi, so we tested every top system to find the best They¬†run $150, which isn‚Äôt cheap as far as headphones go. But for quality Bluetooth earbuds, it‚Äôs actually inexpensive, especially considering they share the internals with Apple‚Äôs newly iconic AirPods. They‚Äôre also the cheapest wireless Beats headphones and available in white, black, blue, and grey, if that matters to you. Beats X design is a compromise compared to some other wireless earbuds. There is a wire linking the two buds to each other, but that‚Äôs not all. Rather than some other styles of Bluetooth earbud, the Beats X have a flexible wire with two tiny pods on the end that runs around the back of your neck. img_0567More You‚Äôll need to look at the picture to understand what this looks like in practice, but the end result is that you‚Äôre wearing a secmicircular wire that sits around your neck, and then has two wires that sneak up to your earbuds. The advantage is that there‚Äôs more space for batteries in the wire, which means the earbuds themselves are light and sit easily in your ears. The disadvantage is that you advertise that your a Beats-wearing, sports-doing person to the rest of the subway. Your call. In practice, I‚Äôve found the design to be the most comfortable and secure wireless headphones I‚Äôve ever used. Because the buds are so light and the wire around your neck doesn‚Äôt move, the earbuds never feel in danger of falling out when I‚Äôm running. The earbuds themselves are well thought out, with optional wings sitting inside your ear to hold the silicone earbud more securely. It‚Äôs the same design that Bose has been using for a while with all of its earbuds, and the result is and earbud that isolates outside noise well and doesn‚Äôt fall out. The backs of the earbuds are also magnetized, so if you drop both buds out of your ears and let them dangle, they lock together so the headphones can‚Äôt fall off your neck. Speaking of sound: the Beats X good, but not exceptional. They provide clean, accurate sound without bias towards bass, and the only real complaint is that cymbals or high vocals can sound a little harsh and undefined. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker by any means, but audiophiles be warned. Still, for the intended purpose ‚Äî which I mostly imagine being exercise, commuting, or anything where you‚Äôre on the go with your phone in your pocket, the Beats X are perfectly adequate. The small details are really where these headphones shine, though. My favorite feature, by far, is the quick-charge capability. When the headphones are dead, you can plug them in via the Lightning port (no micro-USB here!) to get a 25% charge in about five minutes. That‚Äôs ideal for when you want to go for a run and forgot to plug your headphones in, something that normally happens to me a couple times per week. In normal use, I‚Äôm seeing about 8-10 hours of battery life, enough to get me through a working day with a commute. Read More img_0570More Pairing with an iPhone is as sleek as you could ever wish for, too. The first time you switch the headphones on, hold them next to your iPhone, and a big box will pop up on screen prompting you to connect. You don‚Äôt have to put anything into pairing mode or go digging in the Bluetooth menu, providing you‚Äôre using an Apple device. Once you‚Äôve connected to your iPhone, the Beats X are automatically paired to every other iCloud device you have, so you can switch over to an Apple Watch or MacBook relatively seamlessly. Even once you‚Äôre paired, I find the Beats X to be a little easier to use than other wireless headphones. Pressing the single power button turns them on and pairs them with my iPhone faster than I can open the lockscreen, which makes picking them up to watch a single YouTube video far less painful than with other wireless headphones. Apple‚Äôs wireless engineering is also on show for the range. In a 2,000 square foot apartment, I can walk from one end to the other and only have the headphones cut out when I‚Äôm in the furthest possible range. It‚Äôs a little better than other expensive Bluetooth headphones, and means that in regular use when your phone is in your pocket or a bag, you‚Äôre never going to see connectivity issues. img_0568More There are a few quibbles: the Beats X aren‚Äôt rated as being waterproof or even sweatproof, which raises some longevity questions. I used the headphones for a few snowy (but sweaty!) runs over the weekend without anything breaking, but six months of daily use could be a different story. The buttons on the in-line remote are also tiny and fiddly, which sounds like a minor quibble until you‚Äôve tried skipping tracks with gloves on. Overall, though, the Beats X are the closest thing I‚Äôve ever seen to the perfect exercise headphones. Comfort and fit is exceptional, audio quality is more than good enough, and tiny details like the quick-charge make me more likely to reach for them on a daily basis. If you‚Äôre an AirPods sceptic who wants to get in on Apple headphones that do legitimately ‚Äújust work,‚Äù they‚Äôre perfect.

Apple's market value has now surpassed $700 billion, making it the world's most valuable company by a sizeable margin. Google parent company Alphabet is second largest with a market cap of around $575 billion, followed by Microsoft at around $500 billion and Berkshire Hathaway at around $412 billion. The milestone comes just one day after Apple's stock recorded its highest closing price ever of $133.29 on Monday. Following Apple's first annual revenue decline since 2001, its stock been steadily rising over the past four months, buoyed by record-breaking earnings results at the end of January. When adjusted for a 7-for-1 split in June 2014, Apple's stock is trading at roughly $942, approaching the $1,000 milestone that was considered wishful thinking when some analysts predicted it years ago. Apple is also slowly but surely on track to become the world's first trillion dollar company. Apple analysts Brian White of Drexel Hamilton and Steven Milunovich of UBS, and former analyst turned venture capitalist Gene Munster, are among a larger group of observers who believe Apple's stock remains undervalued and is likely to rise. AAPL is up over 50% compared to its 52-week low of $89.47 in May 2016. Update: Apple's stock price ultimately closed at a record $135.02 after hitting $135.09 a few minutes before the close. The stock has continued to rise slightly in after-hours trading. Update 2/15: Apple's stock price closed even higher at $135.51 after hitting $136.27 in intraday trading, a new all-time high.

More videos Seven clears CEO of wrongdoing Seven West Media clears CEO Tim Worner of wrongdoing after allegations of misconduct were raised last year by former employee Amber Harrison. The former employee is currently locked in a legal battle with Seven West over its handling of the matter ‚Äì which she claims is discriminatory ‚Äì and her subsequent decision to go public with company documents and receipts she says support her side of the story. In the past fortnight, Harrison has taken to social media to let rip with a set of explosive evidence and allegations regarding not just the intimate details of the pair's relationship, but also the conduct of the board towards both herself and the company's shareholders. Her Twitter bio simply reads, "Whistleblower". Related Content Twitter removes Amber Harrison tweets as legal battle with Seven escalates Seven takes legal action to stop Harrison releasing more information In the latest twist, Seven West has obtained a temporary injunction on Harrison to prevent her from publishing the details of her affair with Worner and other company matters on Twitter. She is now barred from making any comments about Seven or "otherwise bringing [the company] into disrepute" ‚Äì and a number of tweets have been removed. The parties will be in court again next Tuesday, and Fairfax Media understands proceedings for contempt of court will be initiated against Harrison after she flouted the order on Monday by continuing to post comments and text messages on Twitter.

Threatening me with jail if I continue to speak.What are they hiding? pic.twitter.com/BwYYDbWXDl‚Äî Amber Harrison (@_Amber_Harrison) February 13, 2017 To bring everyone up to speed, Harrison and Worner began their two-year affair in 2012 while Harrison worked as an executive assistant at Pacific Magazines (owned by Seven West Media), before Worner was appointed CEO. SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Link Mr Harrison, 39, was made redundant after having an affair with Mr Worner.¬†Photo: Twitter Harrison alleges the affair was initiated by Worner, and that in addition to having sex they also used recreational drugs, sometimes at work events. (In a statement, Seven has claimed Harrison's account is full of "wideranging inaccuracies" and that claims of drug use could not be substantiated.) Worner sent Harrison personal, intimate correspondence using company letterheads, a fact she claims makes it a company matter and not a private one. Harrison, meanwhile, was accused of using her own company credit card to pay for personal luxuries, and ultimately offered a redundancy package. She reportedly told friends Pacific Magazines had a "fast and loose credit card environment," but claims that she was the only person of 4000 employees at Seven West Media investigated over use of her credit card.¬† As a result of this credit card¬†investigation, Harrison had her contract terminated and was offered a $350,000 payout, of which $100,000 was compensation for alleged injury, including loss of professional standing and reputation, pain and suffering. And while some people might think this makes for a pretty nice payday, the long term costs of such reputation loss can be severe. Worner has meanwhile issued an apology to the company shareholders and ... well, that's about it, although Seven says he has paid compensation to the network to cover¬†costs arising out of the relationship. This is normally where the story would end. Women like Harrison tend to disappear quietly, immortalised forever in people's memories as troublemakers and home wreckers. Indeed, Charlotte Wood's acclaimed novel The Natural Way of Things hypothesised a scenario in which these women might be rounded up and duly punished for allowing their sexuality to "destroy" the lives and prospects of promising men. As in real life, the men in that depiction were allowed to carry on with their trajectory towards greater money and power, bolstered by the support of other men. Seven West organised an independent inquiry into Worner's behaviour, with its findings clearing him of misconduct and determining that no further disciplinary action was required. One has to wonder if the resignation of Sheila McGregor (one of Seven West's only two female board members), the day before the report's findings were made public, was in protest. It would be easy for someone like Harrison to be turned into a hateful figure by a public used to finding fault in the interloper when a marriage is involved (doubly true when that person is a woman), because what she's exposing isn't just cheap ‚Äì it's also cliched. But there's much to admire in her refusal to back down from pursuing an adequate response from Seven West over the actions of their CEO. Tim Worner might be "ashamed" and distraught over the disrepute he's brought to his position and the hurt he's caused his family; but if history is anything to go by, this will be a short lived mea culpa. Let's be honest, it's the "mistresses" (and good lord, can we retire that word and come up with a better one please?) who end up suffering the most when public scandals like this hit the headlines. Women like Harrison are labelled Jezebels and temptresses, harlots who pose a threat to the marriages of ordinary wives whose husbands are expected to be just sorry enough to weather a little embarrassment, but certainly not to lose their jobs or social standing. Look at the disastrous handling of Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. Lewinsky was an intern barely out of her teens and Clinton was literally the most powerful man in the world, yet revelations of their sexual relationship only resulted in long-term consequences for her, not him. In a powerful essay for Vanity Fair, Lewinsky wrote about the public humiliation she was forced to endure in the years following the affair's exposure. While reinforcing the point that the relationship was consensual, Lewinsky is clear where the blame lies for being treated like a pariah. She writes, "Any 'abuse' came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position... The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor's minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me. And that brand stuck, in part because it was imbued with power." Staring down the barrel of this power imbalance, most women would probably just choose to walk away. It feels almost impossible to fight the system, particularly when the system is so invested in defending the high profile, high powered men who sit at its helm. It is especially difficult for one individual to fight a legal battle against a corporation that can afford to tie cases up in courts for years, emotionally and financially draining the women who will rarely, if ever, be backed by the system. In refusing to go quietly, Harrison has made a daring move that will surely impact the outcome of her own ongoing battles with Seven West ‚Äì even if it's just to be an annoying, unpredictable and unprecedented thorn in their side. But she'll hopefully inspire other women to push back against the discriminatory way they're treated in the workplace in comparison to their male bosses. Seven West's temporary injunction may silence Harrison for now, but I hope we haven't heard the last from her. It isn't fair that women suffer¬†while men are coddled and protected. And it isn't right that the majority of the public's enthusiasm for shaming is heaped on them, either. Harrison might be experiencing both of those things right now, but she isn't going down without a fight. Seven West would do well to heed that.

Well-known fund manager Geoff Wilson is seeking to remove the company's existing directors and replace them with corporate lawyer Kym¬†Evans, journalist Glenn Burge and Emma¬†Davidson, a London-based¬†investment adviser. All three of Mr Wilson's nominees are independent of his group of listed investment companies as well as both Hunter Hall Global Value and Hunter Hall International. Related Content 'It's game on': Hunter Hall jostling intensifies Hunter Hall fund rebuffs Wilson's call for buy-out Mr Wilson is also seeking to slash directors' fees in half¬†as he pushes the board to offer all shareholders the ability to sell¬†their shares¬†in the company at their net tangible asset backing, a call that¬†Hunter Hall Global Value is resisting. Net tangible asset value after tax was $1.24 as at January 31.¬† Wilson Asset Management and other associated entities have an 11.5 per¬†cent stake in Hunter Hall Global Value. Advertisement Since Mr Wilson went public with his proposal, Washington H. Soul Pattinson and Co has emerged with a 6.5 per cent shareholding in Hunter Hall Global Value.¬†Valued in the sharemarket at about $300 million,¬†Hunter Hall Global Value is the largest single asset of¬†Hunter Hall International, of which Soul Pattinson is seeking to gain control. Late last year, Soul Pattinson snapped up a 19.9 per cent stake in Hunter Hall International from the company's founder, Peter Hall, paying $1 a share at a time when the shares were trading at more than $2.30. Mr Hall decided to sell out after he was wrong-footed by¬†the election of Donald Trump as US President late last year. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Geoff Wilson's call for an equal access buy-out has been rejected by Hunter Hall Global Value.¬†Photo: Daniel Munoz Soul Pattinson is now seeking to acquire Mr¬†Hall's remaining 24 per cent stake in Hunter Hall International, offering $2¬†after initially offering $1 a share. A rival bidder, Pinnacle Investment Management, is also offering $2 a share. Late on Tuesday, investor John Bridgeman Ltd, which already has a 5.8 per cent holding in Hunter Hall, said it had¬†instructed its broker to pay up to $2.40 a share in an attempt to build a 20 per cent holding in the company, which he has argued is undervalued. Hunter Hall International shares closed at $2.42, down¬†1¬¢¬†on the day. If Hunter Hall International loses control of Hunter Hall Global Value, however, this will have a significant impact on the value of the investment management company. "In our view, Mr Hall's sudden, unexpected resignation constitutes a corporate governance crisis, which has negative implications for [Hunter Hall Global Value]," Mr Wilson said on Tuesday in a letter to shareholders, which was also critical of a series of decisions made by the board that it said had led to the "long-term underperformance" of the shares. "We expect the new directors will hold the investment manager's performance to account."

There were those among the talented direct reports¬†like Bunnings former boss John Gillam and Target/Kmart chief Guy Russo who on paper looked like strong candidates. They both have serious operational credentials, stellar credentials at growing their respective businesses and of course loads of appropriate experience ‚Äì¬†given 80 per cent of Wesfarmers' earnings come from retail. But neither fits that Wesfarmers mould well enough ‚Äì¬†not the right personalities. Related Content 'Deeply grounded': Wesfarmers elevates Scott as Goyder successor The chief financial officer, Terry Bowen, was in the mould but, word has it, genuinely bowed out of the running for health reasons. Rob Scott was the bloke inside left standing. As Chaney put it on Tuesday, "Rob has a clear focus on The Wesfarmers Way". Advertisement While Scott says that in 10 years the conglomerate may look very different than it does today, its evolution will be managed in the same way. It will retain its focus on tradition on longer-term returns to shareholders even at the expense of short-to-medium-term returns on equity. To say that its management and board are not concerned when investments are not performing or the share price is under pressure, is nonsense. It is just that Wesfarmers has a belief that it is best placed to judge when and what assets to buy and sell and how to allocate capital to each of the businesses. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Corporate cult: Richard Goyder, Rob Scott and Michael Chaney.¬†Photo: Trevor Collens No better example is Target ‚Äì¬†which has been a basket case for years but one that Goyder has steadfastly refused to close or attempt to sell ‚Äì¬†despite calls from shareholders to do so. He had to white-knuckle the years following his acquisition of the Coles retail assets¬†after the global financial crisis¬†made that mammoth deal appear like a nuclear-size¬†explosion of shareholder funds. To his credit Goyder held firm, put the right people in place to turn around Coles. He also found an expected ally in its major competitor, Woolworths, which engaged in a series of strategic blunders on which Coles-Wesfarmers capitalised. It was a particularly lucky break for Goyder. Goyder now counts this acquisition as his major success, although notes that post-acquisition was a challenging period "because people were throwing things at us". Scott is walking into this role with a different set of challenges. Where Goyder needed to ‚Äì¬†and did ‚Äì¬†turn around retailers Coles and Kmart, Scott has to defend those wins. Woolworths ‚Äì¬†from five or more years of losing market share to Coles ‚Äì¬†is now in comeback mode. It has a new fightback strategy and next week when it reports its result, we will see the first real signs of its closing the gap on Coles in terms of growth. Scott will also have the challenge of making Wesfarmers' first foray abroad¬†‚Äì¬†its acquisition and expansion of hardware into Britain¬†‚Äì¬†work. It is a risk that many analysts are not particularly comfortable with. Goyder took the plunge but Scott will be judged on the execution and its success. The key message that the Wesfarmers board has sent by appointing Scott is that the company's conglomerate tag will remain ‚Äì¬†even if it proceeds with the sale of its coal business. Scott has served time outside as an investment banker and within Wesfarmers' head office strategy team, which is in effect its internal deal-finding division. Goyder wasn't a retailer either but when he took the role, the retail assets were a much smaller part of the overall business ‚Äì¬†not 84 per cent of the enterprise value that they are today. Scott has had a taste of the many segments of Wesfarmers, served as chief financial officer for Coles for a while and most recently has run the industrial division. He is not a retailer but he IS a Wesfarmer. 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS ¬† Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media ¬† ¬† Apple shares rocket to record high By George Avalos / February 13, 2017 at 9:32 AM Apple shares soared Monday above their previous record-high closing price, bolstered by sales of the iPhone 7 and investor optimism about prospects for the company‚Äôs iPhone 8. Apple‚Äôs stock topped the $133 mark, part of a surge that has stabilized Apple‚Äôs lofty perch as the world‚Äôs most valuable company. The previous record-high closing price for the company was $132.54, set in May 2015. The march¬†into record territory banished a steep decline over a one-year period that saw Apple shares tumble at one point to just above¬†$90. Earlier this month, Apple released a quarterly report that showed the company sold 78.3 million iPhones, which produced $54.38 billion in revenue, during the three months that ended Dec. 31. Revenue from iPhone sales rose 5 percent during the October-through-December holiday shopping period, compared with a year earlier. Sales of the iPhone also accounted for a larger share of total revenue.¬†During the quarter, iPhone sales generated 69.4 percent of Apple‚Äôs revenue. That was up from 68.1 percent during the final three months of 2015,¬†the company reported. From the May 2015 apex to the trough in May 2016, the company‚Äôs stock plunged 31.8 percent. Since last spring, however, the shares have zoomed about 48 percent higher. So far in 2017, the company‚Äôs stock has jumped 15 percent. Some analysts‚Äô reports, including two issued Monday, also have helped to boost the shares. ‚ÄúWe are increasingly confident in the outlook for Apple‚Äôs iPhone 8 cycle in the second half of the year, and as a result are raising both our forecasts and our target price,‚Äù Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski wrote in a research report Monday. Goldman Sachs raised its 12-month price target to $150 from $133 for Apple, accompanied with a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù rating. The investment firm believes the new iPhone 8 will have ‚Äúaugmented reality‚Äù features that would be a ‚Äúsignificant feature upgrade‚Äù from the iPhone 7, Jankowski‚Äôs note said. UBS stated its 12-month target for Apple shares is $138 as part of a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù rating. ‚ÄúWe expect a bulge of iPhone 6 owners to upgrade in 2018, creating a strong year if not a ‚Äòsupercycle‚Äô ‚Äù for sales, UBS analyst¬†Steven Milunovich¬†wrote in a note¬†Monday.

That suggested the iPhone 8, iPhone 7s, and iPhone 7s Plus will all feature a glass sandwich design to accommodate wireless charging. But a new report out of China now seems to indicate that the phones won‚Äôt share the same design at all, which could mean iPhone 7s and 7s Plus buyers won‚Äôt get one of Apple‚Äôs most hotly anticipated new features. Don't Miss: Mesh is the hottest trend in home Wi-Fi, so we tested every top system to find the best According to Digitimes‚Äô sources, only the 5.8-inch 2017 iPhone will feature a glass and stainless steel design, while the 4.7-inch iPhone¬†will¬†have an aluminum housing just like this year‚Äôs iPhones. The 5.8-inch iPhone is believed to be the iPhone 8, which is expected to feature a steel frame that will¬†hold the internal components, covered by glass¬†front and rear panels. Apple used similar designs in the past for the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S. The 4.7-inch iPhone would be Apple‚Äôs iPhone 7s, likely the successor of the iPhone 7. The report says the design for the 5.5-inch model‚Äôs chassis is yet to be confirmed. It‚Äôs likely that the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will share the same design, just as every other pair of new iPhones Apple has launched since 2014. Digitimes says that Foxconn and Jabil Circuit will provide stainless steel frames for the iPhone 8, while Catcher will make the aluminum cases for the iPhone 7s. Additionally, Pegatron Technology Casetek is also ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù looking to obtain orders from¬†Apple. Catcher did not comment on the story¬†but did say that its revenues will see significant year-on-year growth thanks to mobile device customers and an increase in adoption of metal chassis for notebooks.

Apple Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | February 14, 2017 20 shares 16 1 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Recently, Apple published a couple of new ads for the iPhone 7 Plus. Specifically, the 15-second videos are meant to showcase Portrait Mode, which is an exclusive feature for the 5.5-inch iPhone. Apple introduced it with last year's flagship iPhone thanks to the dual-camera setup on the larger model, and, since then, it has not been shy in promoting it. As far as Apple ads go, they are super straightforward. Then again, at only 15 seconds, that shouldn't be too surprising. But they have their typical flair to them, too. Moreover, they do show off the Depth Effect --what makes Portrait Mode worthwhile-- really well. For the right type of picture, Portrait Mode is certainly worthwhile. That dual-camera is the distinguishing feature for the iPhone 7 Plus (aside from its bigger display), so is it doing the trick? It's hard to argue that, despite the fact that the camera system on the back of the iPhone 7 Plus is quite different from the single-camera design on the iPhone 7, the use cases are similar more often than not. Even Apple makes it obvious that while the Depth Effect available to iPhone 7 Plus is great, it's only beneficial in very specific situations. Portraits. In my short time with the iPhone 7 Plus, I used the Portrait Mode quite a bit. Even in that small window, I thought I was definitely getting my money's worth with the feature. Do I wish that I could get it on the iPhone 7? Yes. Will it ever happen? Who knows. At this rate, I probably just have to hope that the iPhone 8 isn't $1,000, has a form factor that is comfortable to hold even with a big display, and also has the dual-camera setup on the back. I am curious, though. There are a lot of iPhone 7 Plus units out there, so I'm wondering how often owners in the real world use the Portrait Mode feature. Is it something you've grown to love? Or are you not a fan of it at all? Let me know!

We've highlighted some of the best wearable devices for making your hectic workday that much easier. Smartwatches There is no denying that the buzz around smartwatches has begun to subside, but to write them off completely would be a mistake. Whether it's for productivity, navigation, organisation, or fitness, watches provide a discrete tool for business users. Apple Watch 2 Apple remains the biggest name on the smart watch market, and with its latest iteration of the Apple Watch it continues to improve on a solid design. Built in GPS and a wider range of style and size options make the watch an even more attractive option for a companion device. It also features a host of supported productivity apps, including a remote version of PowerPoint, Evernote, Salesforce, and travel essentials such as App in the Air and Uber. It's also less obnoxious on your wrist, and will only 'light up' when the device registers that your arm is rotating to view the screen. While battery life remains fairly mediocre, lasting up to 18 hours between charges, this is certainly enough to survive a working day. Apple Watch 2 specs: Price ¬£269-¬£1049 (depending on styles) Weight 28.2g - 52.4g Who is it for? Wide range of users, iPhone only Key features Built in GPS, large app library, water resistant Samsung Gear S3 Changing consumer tastes in the smartwatch market are being reflected in a recent move away from devices that look alien on the wrist, toward a design that's more akin to a traditional timepiece. The Gear S3's rotating bezel is far more intuitive for navigation than the touchscreen it also features, and gives it that outdoor sports vibe. Built on the lightweight Tizen OS, battery life can last up to four days between charges; but the software has a relatively small app library compared to the amount available on WatchOS and Android Wear. If you're after something more like a traditional watch, with some added smart features, the Gear S3 is for you. Samsung Gear S3 specs Price ¬£349 Weight 59g Who is it for? Samsung users, traditional watch fans Key features Built in GPS, high quality display, long battery life Fitness trackers While the smartwatch market begins to slow, wearables in general continue to gain momentum, led primarily by the popularity of fitness trackers. Fitbit Charge 2 By no means the only choice when it comes to Fitbit, the Charge 2 is simply the best of the bunch. It sports a large OLED screen, a five-day battery life, interchangeable straps, superb accuracy and a solid build quality. The device relies on connecting to your phone for GPS connectivity, which may be a gripe for some users. Otherwise, at ¬£129 it's a solid pick. Price ¬£129-¬£149 Who is it for? Active users looking for accuracy Key features Accurate, long battery life, connected GPS, easy to use app Microsoft Band 2 If you're looking for something a little more powerful, the Microsoft Band 2 is one of the most robust fitness trackers on the market. It packs a whopping 11 sensors, including built in GPS, a barometer for measuring altitude, and UV and skin temperature sensors. Although a full charge will only last you two days, it is great for most activities and provides a comprehensive built in health dashboard. Naturally the price is at the top end, so expect to pay over ¬£160 for the pleasure. Price ¬£200 Who is it for? Data fanatics after a feature rich device Key features Touchscreen, 11 types of sensor VR/AR The most compelling applications of virtual and augment reality devices have been within industry, and continue to transform the way we visualise projects and perform tasks. Hololens Although first demoed alongside an AR version of Minecraft at 2015's E3, Hololens is first and foremost a business tool. Based on our own experiences of the product, it is safe to say that the Hololens is set to shake up the computing industry. Its apps are already compelling: for example SketchUp allows for the visualisation of fully customisable 3D buildings on a blank space. This space can even be arranged as a second screen to a monitor, with the ability to drag and drop objects as you would normally. It is tech like this that makes its business use immediately apparent, as any designer will be able to recreate their projects in the real world as they work. Although it is still in development, there are some niggling problems; chief among these is its tiny field of view. It is also a high end product with a premium price tag, and if you plan to pre-order it will set you back ¬£2,700. Price ¬£2,719 Weight 579g Who is it for? Designers / Users needing to visualise projects Key features First real AR headset, untethered, lightweight, Win 10 ready HTC Vive Business Edition In an attempt to expand its user base beyond the consumer market, HTC announced it would be releasing an enterprise-focused edition of its VR headset. The Vive BE provides a bespoke VR package for businesses wishing to incorporate the technology into the workplace, offering dedicated support lines, commercial licensing opportunities, and the option to bulk buy. HP has already demonstrated the power of the tech, by helping the Bank of England recreate an iconic former site that was demolished in 1925. Using the HTC Vive, centuries old architecture has been brought back to life through virtual guided tours. Still in its relative infancy, businesses are only beginning to realise the potential applications of the technology. ¬† Price ¬£920 Weight 555g Who is it for? Architects / businesses looking for VR solutions Key features First VR headset to offer a business package Stress Relief Unlike health devices that are focused on strenuous activity, some products are encouraging you to do less, all in the name of reducing stress. WellBe¬†bracelet The WellBe band uses a mobile app to analyse your heart rate alongside your calendar entries, and is able to tell you at what point of the day you were most stressed. It is a simple tool to help you identify when your stress levels are most elevated, and suggest ways in which they can be brought down. This includes a series of plans for meditation and breathing exercises, and general tips for living a more relaxed lifestyle. There is even a model made from cork that is lightweight and soft against your arm, although at $149 it's a little pricey. Price $149 Who is it for? Users is stressful work environments Key features 24/7 monitoring, analysis app, made of soft cork Bellabeat Leaf Urban The Bellabeat Leaf Urban is the perfect device for women who dislike wearing wristbands but want to keep track of their health. Although it can be placed on the wrist with a strap, its biggest selling point is that it can be worn around the neck like a piece of jewelry or affixed to a bra or belt. The pebble shaped sensor is able to learn your habits and provide insights into your daily routine, by tracking breathing, sleeping and activity. Price ¬£110 Weight 16.5g Who is it for? Stress management designed for women Key features Sleep & activity tracker, meditation guides, 6 month battery life See related¬† Enterprise smartwatch roundup - the top 5 business wearables How wearables are transforming business Read more about Mobile smartwatch wearable tech wearables Fitbit fitness tracker View the discussion thread.

The latest MacBook Pro models Apple released last year haven't been met with the same enthusiasm as previous generations of the laptop. The Touch Bar isn't very useful, the performance (and RAM) is lacking for power users, and the prices remain very high. However, Apple does seem to have made a breakthrough in one key area on the 2016 MacBook Pro: power efficiency. More specifically, the amount of power the latest MacBook Pro laptops draw when idling has been significantly reduced. That is the conclusion of one-man Mac software house MacDaddy, which among other things creates the popular free Mac Battery Guru application. Putting a 15-inch 2015 MBP and a 2016 MBP side-by-side for power comparisons found that the 2015 model idles at 619mA, where as the 2016 model only draws 430mA. That's a 44 percent reduction. Even with screen brightness set to full, the 2015 MBP idled at 1010mA, where as the 2016 MBP only draws 767mA. A reduction of 33 percent. It's unclear exactly how Apple managed to make such significant power savings, but a number of efficiency gains across more recent Intel processor use, a more efficient display, and better power saving across other components inside the laptop all are likely to play a part. And the power saving is important when you consider the 2016 MBP includes a battery 30 percent smaller (76-watt-hour) than the one in the 2015 model (99.5-watt-hour). While not a rigorous test, it certainly shows how efficiency has improved inside the latest MacBook Pro models. Imagine how long the battery would last if Apple hadn't decided to make the Pro thinner or decided against adding that energy sapping OLED Touch Bar...

Sources in the supply chain have previously indicated that Apple is planning on using wireless charging in its next generation iPhone and this news only strengthens the expectation. An IHS Technology consumer survey data shows over 90% of consumers want wireless charging on their next device and IHS believes that the success of wireless charging adoption from Apple's competitors is something that Apple can no longer ignore. The world market for wireless charging is expected to exceed 350 million enabled receiver units shipped in 2017, IHS indicated. To date, this volume has largely been driven through the backing of wireless charging by Samsung. However, many in the industry have been cautious to move forward until they knew the direction for any wireless charging on iPhone devices. Although shipments of wireless charging devices grew by 40% in 2016, the continued absence of the iPhone and the continued wait for the launch of magnetically resonant devices meant shipments were lower than expected for 2016 overall. The WPC is one of two major industry groups looking to set the standard for wireless charging, with the other being the AirFuel Alliance. WPC supports the Qi standard, which is based on an inductive charging technology. The AirFuel Alliance also supports Rezense, which is based on the principles of magnetic resonance, though this technology has not yet been used in any smartphone device. Interestingly enough, while gaining the membership of Apple is seen as a big win for the WPC, the group has remained silent on the issue, while the AirFuel Alliance delivered a message stating that it welcomes Apple to the wireless charging table and that it continues to support all wireless charging technologies, from inductive to resonant to RF.

And it‚Äôs something that could impact sports, news ‚Äî even polling. Apple‚Äôs senior vice president was in the hot seat at Recode‚Äôs Code Media event this evening, speaking mostly about Apple‚Äôs upcoming Planet of the Apps reality TV show, but also talking about ‚Äúfake news,‚Äù ads, and the state of the TV industry in general. In an interview with The Verge, Cue said that Apple isn‚Äôt against the idea of making more original TV, but emphasized that there would have to have some sort of interactive element for it to make sense for the tech giant right now. Interacting with a TV show: the future of TV or the antithesis of a ‚Äòlean back‚Äô experience? Cue said he could see a TV environment where content makers are creating a more interactive TV app, and where viewers watch the program on their Apple TV, iPad, or phone, using the remote or simply the touchscreen to interact with a show. It‚Äôs a vision that doesn‚Äôt exactly match with what Beats co-founder Jimmy Iovine told The New York Times yesterday; Iovine said that Apple is working to bring more scripted dramas to its platform and that they ‚Äújust take much longer.‚Äù But Iovine also told the Times that Apple is experimenting with ways for audiences to interact with musicians, pointing back to the idea of interactive entertainment. Apple is launching its first TV show, "Planet of the Apps." Here's the trailer. More in our live blog: https://t.co/wK3Nn4xjuv #CodeMedia pic.twitter.com/AbdhyxRvJ8‚Äî Recode (@Recode) February 14, 2017 ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not a lot of interactive [content] on TV today, which is the challenge,‚Äù Cue said. He mentioned the Masters golf tournament on DirectTV and the booming world of fantasy sports as two examples. ‚ÄúThink of all these FanDuel and DraftKings fantasy games; most people are doing them while they‚Äôre watching TV. Why wouldn‚Äôt someone embed the two of these together?‚Äù Cue said. Of course, FanDuel and DraftKings are a type of gambling, so integrating those into sports programming might be challenging; but interactive fantasy sports overlays have already found their way onto a variety of platforms, from the Xbox to Samsung smart TVs. And Xbox executives described American Idol‚Äôs text-based fan voting as ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs biggest video game‚Äù around the launch of the Xbox One, promising at the time to integrate gaming with television beyond simple text messages. Cue‚Äôs point is that few other platforms have the scale and power of the Apple TV and Apple iOS devices. Cue thinks news networks could run interactive polls through Apple TV Another good example of interactive TV, according to Cue, would be running live news polls on a cable network like CNN. ‚Äú‚ÄòHow does America feel about ‚ÄòX‚Äô? The survey is usually a thousand people, ten thousand people. It‚Äôs a tiny number,‚Äù Cue said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crazy that we‚Äôre not doing this in real time ... with hundreds of thousands of people voting, not five thousand or a thousand.‚Äù The question that naturally arises from this is whether this kind of TV polling would be biased, if it only included people with Apple products. It‚Äôs not a minor issue to consider in a time when half of the country feels polarized from the other half, and when techno-utopian views are coming under fire in an increasingly fraught political environment. And online polls of every kind can be gamed. To some extent, it could be skewed, Cue acknowledged. But today, polling is done with a tiny demographic, ‚Äúwhereas there are a billion Apple devices out there in the world, in half the homes in America ‚Äî maybe more. So we‚Äôre not that skewed.‚Äù Cue wouldn‚Äôt put a specific timeline on when he thought this interactive Apple TV world would become a reality. He said developers have all the tools available to them today, but that they‚Äôre still looking at building apps for cable boxes, too, which are less interactive. Still, he said, he‚Äôs confident ‚Äúthat will change.‚Äù Nilay Patel contributed to this article.

Gottesman February 13, 2017 08:00am EST 10 Comments PCs remain the cornerstone of computing Let's check in with you to see which are the best around. Thirty-five years ago this month, PC Magazine launched on newsstands. Over the years, we have dedicated ourselves to exhaustively testing and analyzing technology products to help you determine which one would best suit your needs. However, after five years we realized there were certain aspects of a product that we couldn't judge through labs-based testing. In order to determine if technology products could stand the test of time‚Äîand if the companies that made these products would stand behind the products‚Äîwe launched our reader surveys. Using them, we can consider the opinions of thousands of our readers. In the early days, we bound a copy of the blank survey questionnaire into the print magazine. These days, as we enter our 30th year of surveying readers, we're able to reach out by email and the Web to solicit feedback about the products and services you use. No matter the survey mechanism, the value of the feedback is still the same. The companies that receive the highest satisfaction ratings in the survey results earn PCMag Readers' Choice Award. Throughout 2017, we will launch Readers' Choice Award surveys on a wide array of product and service categories from smartphones to Internet Service Providers and streaming media devices. But it seems fitting that we start each year with the PC categories. Laptops and desktop computers may not have the sex appeal they once had‚Äîthough if you own a state-of-the-art ultraportable or gaming PC, you may beg to differ‚Äîbut they still are at the heart of most of our computing experiences. You can do amazing things with smartphones and tablets, but if you really want to get work done, it's hard to beat a good PC. In every Readers' Choice Award survey, we ask how satisfied you are overall with the product or service that you're rating, and how likely you would be to recommend the company that makes the product. These two questions provide the key assessment, but we dig deeper, asking about the whole product lifecycle from satisfaction with initial setup to satisfaction with reliability, technical support, and repairs. The answers to these questions will help you get a more complete picture of the experience readers are having with the products they use. The PCMag Readers' Choice survey for Laptops and Desktops was in the field from January 6, 2017 through January 31, 2017. For more information on how the survey is conducted, read the survey methodology. Each person who completed the survey was entered into a drawing to win an Amazon.com gift card valued at $350.

Read The Best Laptops of 2017 and The Best Desktop Computers of 2017. Laptops 2017 There's a wonderful range of laptop choices available to consumers today. You can find laptops that are ultralight, ultrafast, and ultracheap, though not surprisingly, you might have a hard time finding one that has all those characteristics. Many laptops are now convertible devices that can adapt to the situation, quickly switching between traditional clamshell design and tablet. Some, including Microsoft's very popular Surface Pro line, are tablet first with a detachable keyboard for when you need to use them like a laptop. Apple hasn't really embraced the new form factors. Despite steady upgrades to its product line, there are no convertible, touch-screen MacBooks, only clamshell-designed MacBooks that seem to get sleeker and faster with every release. This consistent, focused approach seems to be just fine with Apple laptop users in our survey, who give the company the highest satisfaction ratings, earning Apple the PCMag Readers' Choice Award for laptops for the tenth year in a row. On our scale from zero (extremely dissatisfied) to 10 (extremely satisfied), Apple received satisfaction ratings of 9.0 or better on overall satisfaction (9.1), overall reliability (9.3) and likelihood to recommend (9.0). In addition, Apple's rating of 8.8 for satisfaction with technical support is two points better than the next highest rated company, Dell (6.8), and an improvement over last year's excellent 8.3 rating. While you can run Windows on a MacBook, it's safe to say that most people use macOS as their primary operating system. If you want a Windows laptop, your best bet is MSI, according to our readers. You might not know MSI (known back home in Taiwan as Micro-Star International), but it's a big name among gamers. This year, MSI earns its second straight PCMag Readers' Choice Award. MSI's overall satisfaction rating of 8.8 is down from the 9.1 it received last year, but it's still the best among Windows laptops. In addition, the company's likelihood to recommend rating actually improved from 8.7 to 8.9. MSI received its highest satisfaction rating for its reliability (9.2), and the company tied Apple for the lowest percentage of units needed repairs within the last 12 months (6 percent). Approximately one in five of the laptops rated in the survey were either tablets or hybrid (a.k.a. 2-in-1 or convertible) PCs. Microsoft remains the standard-bearer in this group, winning its second straight Readers' Choice Award for tablets and hybrid PCs. Microsoft received the highest ratings in this category for overall satisfaction (8.6), satisfaction with reliability (8.7), and likelihood to recommend (8.7). In addition, Microsoft had the lowest percentage of machines needing repair in the category (7 percent). Lenovo and Dell had the lowest overall satisfaction ratings among tablets and hybrids last year, but this year they improved to second and third (8.3 and 8.2, respectively). Interestingly, Asus had a higher likelihood to recommend rating (8.3) than anyone but Microsoft in this category, but it had by far the highest percentage of units needing repairs (18 percent). When we looked at the laptops used primarily for personal or home use, Apple and Microsoft come out on top. (MSI didn't have enough responses to be considered on this chart.) Apple received a rating of 9.5 for satisfaction with ease of setup. (We only ask this question for laptops less than a year old.) Microsoft received a 9.0 on this measure, as did Asus. However, Microsoft's overall satisfaction rating for home laptops was 8.6, considerably better than Asus's 8.2. If you're open to getting a MacBook, Apple did even better with an overall satisfaction rating of 9.2. We continue to consider Chromebooks along with Windows and macOS laptops but these simple, reliable laptops haven't caught on among PCMag readers yet. Maybe that'll change this year when new Chromebooks support Android apps. For now, no brand of Chromebook received the minimum responses required to be included in our survey. Yet as a category, Chromebooks continue to deliver higher satisfaction ratings than Windows laptops (and both are well behind macOS, no surprise). ChromeOS is certainly worth considering if your computing needs are not too demanding. See all of our survey results for laptops. WINNERS: LAPTOPS Categories: Overall, Home Use Apple It's been Apple's decade, according to PCMag readers, whose ratings have earned Apple a Readers' Choice Award for an amazing 10 straight years. The company continues to set the standard for customer satisfaction in computing. Categories: Overall MSI MSI wins the Readers' Choice Award for the second straight year. This maker of high-end gaming laptops is the overall brand of choice among respondents who use Windows PCs. Categories: Home Use, Hybrids Microsoft Microsoft's foray into the hardware business continues to be a success as the company wins its second straight Readers' Choice Award. The company is dedicated to hybrid, touch-screen devices (both tablets with keyboards and laptops with detachable screens) and the focus has paid off. They're beloved for home use. Desktops 2017 The common wisdom remains true: If you don't need portability, you can get a lot more computer for a lot less if you choose a desktop over a laptop. You get faster machines, more storage, and larger displays. You're not going to lug it all over town with you...although the increasingly popular all-in-one PCs, which integrate the computer into the monitor, provide a modicum of portability. Apple seems to always win the Readers' Choice Award for desktops, and this year is no exception. It is the only company to receive satisfaction ratings of 9.0 or better and it does so on every measure in which it got enough responses: overall satisfaction (9.0), satisfaction with reliability (9.3), and likelihood of recommending (9.1). In general, computers seem to have become more reliable. In 2016, Asus had the lowest repair rate (7 percent). This year, Acer and Apple had repair rates of 4 percent and no company had more than 8 percent of their desktops needing repairs in the last year. Acer's low repair rate helps it share the Readers' Choice Award with Apple. Acer had the best overall satisfaction rating (8.4) for Windows-based desktops, as well as the highest satisfaction with reliability rating (8.7). These ratings were big improvements over last year when Acer received the lowest overall satisfaction rating in our survey: 7.8. We're hopeful the company will only continue to be able to deliver this higher level of gratification. Among desktops that our respondents said they specifically use for home or personal use, Apple again comes out on top with the highest satisfaction ratings across the board. If you prefer a Windows computer for home, consider Dell, which also won a Readers' Choice Award this year for home use PCs. While Dell tied with Asus for the best overall satisfaction rating among Windows desktops for the home (8.4), and indeed it tied for reliability and the amount of tech support and repairs needed by customers, respondents were more likely to recommend Dell (8.4) than Asus (8.2). All-in-one computers have been around since the earliest Macs (and arguably even before). While Apple has long believed in the idea of a desktop PC built into a monitor, other companies were slower to embrace the form factor. They're starting to come around, as are consumers. About 20 percent of respondents said their desktop PC was an all-in-one. Apple skews those numbers, however, since 70 percent of the Apple desktops rated were the all-in-one iMac; that number is even higher, at 87 percent, for Apple desktops less than a year old. By contrast, only 12 percent of the non-Apple desktops were all-in-ones. Given Apple's predilection for the all-in-one form factor, it's not a surprise that they're the Readers' Choice Award winner in this category as well. Dell and HP also had a significant number of all-in-one PCs rated, but they had mediocre overall satisfaction ratings of 7.9 compared to Apple's 9.0. See all of our survey results for Desktops. WINNERS: DESKTOPS Categories: Overall, Home Use, All-in-Ones Apple Apple remains the desktop PC of choice. Its all-in-one iMacs continue to define what an all-in-one computer should be according to our readers. It's easier than ever to run Windows on a Mac so don't feel like you can't make the switch. Categories: Overall Acer If you want a pure Windows desktop, Acer is the brand of choice this year among PCMag readers. We were very excited to see the company make big strides in customer satisfaction this year. Categories: Home Use Dell Our readers told us their desktop Windows PC brand preference at home is Dell. No Windows PC company was more likely to be recommended than Dell. It also scored very high for ease of setup and reliability. Back to top Previous : The Readers' Choice Survey 2011 Winners By Ben Z.

Apple halts sales of LG UltraFine 5K monitor over Wi-Fi snafu by Zak Killian ¬ó 1:06 PM on February 13, 2017 Last year when Apple declined to refresh its Thunderbolt display in favor of promoting LG's UltraFine displays, we all ooh-ed and aah-ed at the glorious 5K resolution and wide color gamut of the 27" model. As it turns out, 9to5mac found that those displays have a fairly serious flaw for a device intended to be used with laptops: they don't work near Wi-Fi access points and routers. LG confirmed the issue last week, and says it already has a fix prepared. Now, AppleInsider has gotten positive confirmation from sources inside Apple that the company has temporairly suspended sales of the monitor. Although the folks at 9to5mac were the first to report on the monitor's woes late last month, owners were leaving negative reviews about it at least a week¬†before. When an affected display is placed within 2 meters of a Wi-Fi access point, the on-screen image will flicker, become corrupted, or simply disappear. LG says the issue is down to insufficient shielding around the monitor's electronics, and that existing units can be retrofitted with additional shielding. New units will have the fix installed from the factory. For its part, Apple still has the UltraFine 5K on display in its stores. According to AppleInsider, Apple's retail locations have been told not to sell the monitor nor fill any pending orders until otherwise notified. Additionally, 9to5mac reports that Apple is actually removing salable displays from its stores until it can re-stock with the new revision. Apple's website has moved U.S. shippping date estimates for the UltraFine 5K from the usual 2-3 days all the way to 5-6 weeks, suggesting that it may take a bit for fixed units to find their way into customers' hands. LG encourages current owners of the Ultrafine 5K display to contact its support department. ¬† Tags: Displays Mac Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

We hit the headline numbers, key metrics, and dig through management's comments to catch all the info investors need to know. Sarah Priestley and Dylan Lewis (TMFSarahp) Feb 14, 2017 at 12:11PM Two big heavyweights of the tech industry, PayPal¬†(NASDAQ:PYPL) and Alphabet¬†(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), reported their fourth-quarter results earlier this month, and Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Sarah Priestley have dug through the reports. In this episode of Industry Focus: Tech, they share the most interesting points from both reports, from the most important earnings numbers to little Q&A gems that shed some light on each companies' long-term plans, and more.¬† A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Jan. 27, 2017. Dylan Lewis:¬†Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's¬†Friday, Jan. 27, and we're breaking them¬†quarterly results from¬†PayPal¬†and¬†Alphabet. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis,¬†and I'm joined in the studio by fool.com¬†tech editor Sarah Priestley. Sarah,¬†how's it going? Sarah Priestley:¬†It's good,¬†it's a pleasure to be here, thank you for having me. Lewis: Are¬†you excited for pizza day? Priestley:¬†I am very excited. It's¬†going to derail my New Year's resolutions,¬†but that's OK.¬†[laughs]¬† Lewis: That's a callback to your¬†episode with the Vincent Shen. Are you finding that the Apple Watch is being helpful? Priestley:¬†Yes. It's¬†definitely reminding me at 9 p.m. that I have done 0 steps,¬†so I just end up walking around my living room¬†like a crazy person. Lewis: I do that when I'm on the phone all the time. That's¬†how I get my exercise in. Priestley:¬†That's¬†probably a good idea, yeah. Lewis: So,¬†Sarah, a ton going on in tech¬†this week, the next couple weeks with earnings. Two pretty followed Fool¬†companies reported yesterday after the bell. We dug into the reports and¬†are ready to talk about them. You did¬†some of the heavy lifting with PayPal; I dug into Alphabet. Why don't we¬†talk about PayPal first. How did the results look? Priestley:¬†To give you an overview for the fourth quarter,¬†earnings came in at $0.42 per share. $2.9 billion in revenue. Operating revenue was a little¬†higher than expected at 21%. Transactions were $1.8 billion. But the volume was¬†below expected. Expected was $100 billion and they delivered $99.3 billion. And that is why share prices are down about 3.5% this morning. So,¬†it seems like a slight overreaction¬†when you dig into their numbers. But, yeah,¬†that's the reason for the share price falling. Lewis: And that's really one of the core metrics that investors tend to focus on for them as a company, right? Priestley:¬†Absolutely. They really are¬†measured on engagement, so¬†number of customers, and engagement of those customers,¬†and the key metrics for those. Lewis: Looking beyond some of the top line numbers,¬†what else popped up to you in the report? Priestley:¬†The¬†operating margin for the fourth quarter was down to 15.4%. The reason that we're¬†commenting on this is that that's a lot,¬†it takes up a lot of room¬†in the bullish theses,¬†that the new partnerships they've started with¬†a lot of the banks,¬†Visa,¬†Mastercard, they're going to really pressure their margins down. Lewis: Is the thought there that they're working with very big institutions and big players, and they just don't¬†have the negotiating room that they might with some smaller players?¬† Priestley:¬†Absolutely. That's part of it. And also,¬†it's just the standard transaction payment. It's¬†the same thing for¬†Square¬†and other payment processors; it's a standard transaction amount on card processing. So, that¬†15.4% compared to 16.1%¬†in the fourth quarter of last year -- you can see, that's quite a decline there. Management has talked about the fact that they are really doing everything they can to leverage their other income against this. And I feel like they've done a pretty good job. Their CEO, Dan¬†Schulman,¬†has said that they won't be a slave to quarter-to-quarter margin performance. Lewis: Which is¬†something we like to hear as Foolish investors. Priestley:¬†That's¬†very true. And,¬†I would also comment that¬†the management team is really¬†being driven for their compensation package on the¬†long-term performance of this stock,¬†and I think that really shows in their reporting. They're¬†focused on free cash flow in their¬†projects, and what they're delivering to their customers. Just to give you a couple of the year-over-year figures: Earnings per share for the year¬†increased 15% to $1.15. Non-GAAP was $1.50 on guidance of $1.45 to $1.50. That's pretty good. Revenue for the full year was up 17%, and 21% on a currency-neutral basis, and they guided for 19%, so they really beat that. Lewis: Like Alphabet, their¬†fiscal Q4 comes¬†with the calendar Q4, so¬†we were able to look at full year results here,¬†and not just the quarterly results. What's going on with total payment volume?¬†I know that's something that people really like to focus on with them. Priestley:¬†Yeah,¬†absolutely.¬†If we had seen total payment volume less than 25%,¬†I think we would have seen a bigger decline in the stock price. Luckily, for the fourth quarter,¬†payment volume was up 25%. As I said, the¬†actual processed amount was $99.3 billion, which missed the expectations. Interestingly, the majority of this was pushed by international. International¬†expanded 27%. The U.S. was 23%.¬† Lewis: And¬†for the¬†unacquainted, total payment volume is just¬†the gross amount that they are¬†helping to facilitate. Priestley:¬†Yes. The way to look at this is,¬†the total payment volume is the number of¬†payments that they process. Then, the transaction is the amount that they process. So, they're¬†averaging about $56 per transaction right now. That's¬†slightly down from $60 that they were averaging a couple quarters ago. But¬†it's still very good. Lewis: So, for the amount per transaction to be down, they¬†must be doing more total transactions¬†to be making it up in volume¬†and still be seeing growth, right? Priestley:¬†Yes,¬†you're exactly right.¬†I will also comment that, of their transactions in their Q4, $100 billion was mobile payments, which is an increase of 55%, and it's almost a third now of their transactions processed. Which is fantastic, and I think the management team has really isolated that as an opportunity for the company. That's where they're going to really demonstrate their industry leadership. The market is moving toward mobile, and they're really pioneering in the mobile industry. Lewis: So what can people expect looking forward, either first quarter¬†of 2017 or¬†further out, broadly in 2017? Priestley:¬†Absolutely. I'll look for 2017¬†quarter four revenue we're expecting to grow¬†on a currency neutral basis¬†16% to 18%. That gives you a range of $2.9 billion to $2.95 billion. That was¬†actually¬†slightly more conservative than¬†some analysts were expecting, which played into their share price¬†performance today. But full-year performance is strong, revenue growth 15% to 17% and 17% to 19% currency neutral, which gives you about $12.45 billion to $12.65 billion. Lewis: Is there¬†anything to worry about with¬†some of these numbers that we're looking at, that¬†management growth projections are different than¬†what the market is expecting? Because,¬†they are still very much in growth mode as a business, and I know that early on, those projections, if they start to decelerate at all, can start to scare people off a little bit. Priestley:¬†I think they have been fairly conservative¬†in some of their estimations,¬†because they really do have a huge potential with the mobile traffic. I think,¬†if you look at some of their projects that they're¬†working on now, Venmo has increased 100% year over year. It was¬†Time Magazine's¬†best app, it's processed $5.6 billion, which was up 126%. So,¬†I think they have a¬†huge potential with a lot of the projects they're working on; they've¬†experienced huge growth. The problem with these is that they are not monetized yet. And an¬†analyst actually raised the question in the earnings call: "Is your¬†projection in 2017 building in¬†some of the expectations for¬†monetizing this, and also Xoom?" which is their international money transfer program. They dismissed this. They said¬†it was pushing out to 2018, some of the¬†opportunities,¬†and that they will be focused on growth. So, I think,¬†for 2017, these might be conservative estimates. But for 2018,¬†we might actually start to see¬†the fruits of that labor. Lewis: Yeah, and you said, 55% of¬†what was being processed, broadly for the business, was¬†coming from mobile. When you look at Venmo specifically,¬†that is almost entirely mobile. It's more peer-to-peer. There are¬†some questions about whether or not they will be able to monetize that very well,¬†and what that might look like, because me giving you $5 because¬†you bought me lunch the other day, they don't really take anything on that. Priestley:¬†No,¬†they don't. And¬†something to say is,¬†it's becoming a hugely crowded market. I think¬†PayPal, to some degree, has a first-mover advantage, but they're¬†definitely not the biggest player in this industry. The banks have gotten together and created clearXchange, which is a peer-to-peer¬†payment which is also free right now. It's¬†owned by the banks, so it has a lot of clout. Whether or not people pick it up to the rate that they've picked up Venmo, which is¬†hugely popular with millennials, a lot of our friends use it all the time, we use it. Also,¬†Apple. Apple has grown hugely. Tim Cook in his last earnings call -- so,¬†this is a bit outdated -- said that¬†75% of¬†swiping transactions were from Apple Pay. Lewis: Wow. It's¬†hard to believe.¬†Anecdotally, though, when I'm out with my friends,¬†and maybe you can lend some color on this too, if someone covers the tab,¬†I'm paying them via Venmo. No one is ever like, "Do you have¬†Bank of America¬†mobile payment processing?" So, they do seem to have that first-mover¬†advantage, and I think they have that name recognition. When you have that huge installed base, as they do, it really comes down to whether they can flip the monetization switch on. I guess investors are¬†going to have to be patient on that, if¬†management is pushing that out to 2018. Priestley:¬†Absolutely. I will say,¬†they do have a lot of initiatives that are panning out for them right now. One Touch¬†basically enables you¬†to fill in your bank details, and you work through PayPal,¬†and you can just click one button at the checkout and it's transacted through¬†PayPal, which is hugely beneficial for mobile.¬†I don't know about you, but frequently, when I'm¬† looking at shoes online, as soon as I get to¬†the card payment, and you have to zoom in on those small boxes and put your card numbers in, they lose me. I think it's something like a¬†74% cart-abandonment rate on mobile. Lewis: So when¬†people reach that checkout phase and they¬†see that they need to drop in their credit card number, their security code, their address, shipping address, zip code, all that stuff,¬†they wind up ditching it? Priestley:¬†Absolutely. But, PayPal One Touch,¬†they have 87% conversion rate on mobile. That's incredible. They've had¬†a lot of people starting to use that. They have added a lot of One Touch users. And, I think, of their merchants, about one-third right now are on One Touch. And they just launched this last year. So there's a huge¬†potential here for them to really deliver on their promise. They've said they want to make customers' lives easier, and they're doing that, absolutely. Lewis: Anything else that¬†management provided color on with the business, and¬†strategically where they're looking, that¬†investors should know? Priestley:¬†I think the focus is absolutely on mobile. Dan Schulman has¬†definitely commented on the fact that mobile is the biggest¬†opportunity for them, and there are a lot of industry tailwinds that they're experiencing right now. And¬†I would completely agree. I think¬†Black Friday this year was the biggest online shopping day in history. In¬†quarter three last year -- we're still waiting for quarter four --¬†the Census Bureau said that¬†online retail made up 10% of all retail transactions. So you can see that if they are positioning themselves well to benefit from this, it should be a rising tide that lifts all boats. Lewis: I know they've¬†talked a little bit in the past about¬†continuing to be an asset-light business. Is that something that management recommitted to in¬†the most recent call? Priestley:¬†Yeah,¬†absolutely. This is something that analysts have been focusing on. I definitely noticed a couple of questions about this in the earnings call. Square offers capital, it offers loans, as part of its services. It's not a huge part of their business, but it is a risk area of the business. So, in the fourth quarter, they had $123 million loss on loans. As a service similar to the company Square, which deals mostly with small businesses, but obviously this is individuals, PayPal has access to a lot of people's information and their spending habits and how much money they have. So they want to really leverage that information, and offer it out to partners to facilitate the loans using their information, which takes the risk away from PayPal, but they're still generating a percentage of income from it. So, overall, Dan Schulman¬†commented that it's a really competitive environment for this. I think the payment space is¬†just getting more and more competitive, every angle of it. But¬†overall, I think this is definitely a good move¬†for the company. It's the right decision,¬†it's going to eliminate some risk. But¬†it's also potentially going to bring in a degree of¬†revenue too, if they can grow that segment. Lewis: So,¬†it seems like the general takeaway here is: Wait and see with a lot of the company's¬†mobile initiatives. The core business¬†seems to be humming along. There was a little bit of disappointment,¬†but nothing thesis-altering,¬†nothing crazy in the report. Priestley:¬†No,¬†absolutely not. And they didn't touch too much on¬†some of their partners. They've had some really high-profile¬†partnerships with¬†Alibaba, Vodafone¬†in the U.K. and Europe, and many others; Discover, that they recently¬†announced. They didn't touch on that too much, so we can't really give investors a good flavor for how that's going, only that it's in line with their¬†expectations. So,¬†yeah, I agree with what you said. I think¬†mobile is going to be a big area of focus, we'll continue to have a look at those transaction volumes and customer engagement. Lewis:¬†So¬†Sarah,¬†I said that you did the heavy lifting on PayPal. I did most of the homework with Alphabet's earnings.¬†I'm going to flip it over to you and let you host for the second half of the show. Priestley:¬†It's¬†really nice to not be in the hot seat.¬†[laughs]¬† Lewis: Yeah.¬†I'll stop firing questions at you. It's my turn. Priestley:¬†So, yeah, Alphabet¬†reported the same time, yesterday after the bell. What were the results? Lewis: Overall, Alphabet's¬†revenue came in at about $26.1 billion for Q4, up 22% year over year, which beat analysts' estimates of $25.3 billion. Earnings per share came in at $7.56, slightly lower than analysts' projections of $7.63 per share. I think the real story -- and what caused some of the¬†immediate reaction for the stock -- was that adjusted profit missed by much more. That came in at $9.36 a share, versus expectations of $9.64 a share. We saw, after hours, the stock was down about 2.5% to 3%. That's what most of the market seemed to really fixate on. Priestley:¬†And what was the cause of that? Lewis: Tax rate, basically, is the short of it. In Q4, Alphabet had an effective tax rate of 22%. They also highlighted their broad 2016 tax rate, because they're able to report whole fiscal year results as well. The company's effective tax rate for the year was 19%. That's a big bump. And you realize that average is also incorporating other quarters. You can get a sense of how much more they were paying out in taxes this quarter. Really, if you want to get down to the nitty-gritty,¬†MarketWatch¬†writer Jeremy Owen does¬†a really good job breaking down the specifics, but¬†the gist of the issue is,¬†the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued some changes a while back,¬†basically impacting¬†how companies can treat stock-based compensation for their adjusted earnings numbers. And that wound up impacting results for this quarter. Moving forward, the company will¬†no longer be excluding stock-based compensation expenses from their non-GAAP results, which should smooth things out. But they wound up dealing with a little bit of a hiccup this quarter to reconcile. Priestley:¬†Yeah, that's¬†really unusual, the change for GAAP there. Lewis: Yeah. Typically, you think of non-GAAP numbers as being¬†something where the Financial Accounting Standards Board gives people a¬†decent amount of latitude to operate how they want to. But¬†they like to rein things in every now and then,¬†specifically with stock-based compensation because it's something that a lot of firms use to make their non-GAAP numbers look quite a bit better than their GAAP¬†numbers, especially in the tech space. Looking at¬†a couple of the different segments, their Google¬†segment, which is search, ads,¬†Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube,¬†pretty much anything that falls under their internet properties, came in at $25.8 billion. So,¬†looking at a company with $26 billion in quarterly revenue, that's the meat of it right there. That is¬†generally performing pretty well. Their Google Sites segment, which is the¬†majority of that, was up 20% year over year. Network revenue up 7% year over year. Other revenue, which is a smaller portion¬†a little bit less related to the internet properties within that segment -- think¬†Hardware, Google Play, and their cloud segment -- was $3.4 billion, which was up 62% year over year. So,¬†that's a very fast-growing segment within¬†Sundar Pichai's Google area of the business. I think,¬†if you're looking for indicators for them, the two big ones that tell the story for the ad business and what's going on with some of the internet properties: Aggregate paid clicks, which is basically the¬†number of times that people are interacting with ads online, was up 36% year over year. Aggregate cost per click, or CPCs, as they're commonly known, was down 15% year over year. This is¬†not really a surprise. This is a story that's been¬†playing out for a long time. We¬†talked about the shift to mobile when we were¬†talking about PayPal. The same thing is happening with internet search. CPCs have been driven down¬†because the effectiveness of¬†mobile ads isn't necessarily quite the same as it is for desktop. But for the longest time, Google has been able to make it up on volume. There's¬†actually quite a parallel there with¬†what happened with PayPal and the¬†volume making up for the smaller transactions. We're¬†seeing the same effects here with Alphabet. Priestley:¬†Would you suggest that's¬†something that investors should include in their thesis going forward? Lewis: I think it's something that, at¬†this point, we shouldn't be too surprised by. This story has been playing out for a decent amount of time. If it really¬†accelerates, you might have to worry. But they have been very good at¬†making the volume make it work out. Eventually, mobile will need to find a floor somewhere, and enjoy that. But so long as we're still in that¬†transition to mobile,¬†I think we're going to continue to see this for a while, unfortunately. Priestley:¬†OK. What about the Other Bets¬†segment? I know there have been some interesting moves this year. Lewis: Yeah, this is¬†something that people love to ask about, because it's like, "Where is¬†Google wasting all of this money?" As a reminder, this is basically all the stuff they do that isn't tied to their¬†internet properties. Think of it as their moonshot projects. The big financial contributors for this segment are Nest, Fiber, and Verily. They tend to¬†focus on a full-year breakout¬†for the segment¬†because the numbers are so small¬†relative to the overall business. But revenue came in at $809 million for 2016, which was up¬†82% year over year. Operating loss¬†not including stock-based compensation was $2.9 billion, down slightly year over year. But, this¬†segment is still a money pit for Alphabet, and I think it will¬†continue to be. They have reined in costs¬†a little bit under CFO Ruth Porat. I think she has forced all of the Other Bets¬†initiatives to¬†at least be able to show a path to monetization, or a road map to¬†what that might look like. But I think there's a certain test-and-innovate¬†atmosphere that they want to maintain. And¬†investors have been OK with that, because their core internet business just prints money for them. Something that is¬†interesting with them and the Other Bets segment is, they spun out¬†Waymo, which is their autonomous driving¬†segment. For the longest time, that was the Google Self-Driving Car Project. A couple months ago, they said, "This is a stand-alone business unit, and it will be nested within the Alphabet holding structure. It will continue to be in Other Bets." And¬†we didn't get any financial insight into what's going on with that. But they talked about it in the call. Ruth Porat¬†provided some commentary on what they're¬†basically doing with Waymo as a blueprint for what they will continue to be doing with Other Bets. Not a ton to report there,¬†but this is something that Daniel Sparks and I¬†talked about in a podcast when they announced that a few months ago. As we, in the next couple quarters, over¬†the next year, continue to get more information about Waymo,¬†I think we can look at that specific business segment and see the path for¬†what's going to be going on for some of the Other Bets as they¬†continue to mature and eventually see monetization. So, not a ton to report with Other Bets stuff, but¬†at least we have something that we can start to track for what the company's ambitions might be. Priestley:¬†Absolutely. It¬†looks like they're moving forward with that. Was there¬†anything else in the numbers that stood out to you in the earnings call? Lewis:¬†I think¬†some of the things that people need to keep in mind¬†with this report,¬†because the stock was down after hours, I think¬†as of taping this morning, they were down 40 or 50 basis points,¬†so not a crazy reaction like 3% that we saw¬†after hours yesterday, but still down,¬†I think people might be scratching their heads a little bit with some of the tax stuff they saw. Prior to the report,¬†the company was trading at all-time highs. It's¬†traded up for a while. I think it's somewhere in the teens in the last year or so. So, there's that. And¬†also, Alphabet does not provide detailed¬†quarterly guidance. Most¬†companies do offer up that guidance, and analysts create their own¬†models based on those numbers, those line items, and they have their¬†puts and takes to¬†tweak it slightly. But because Alphabet doesn't give¬†those baseline expectations, the¬†likelihood of actual numbers being¬†different than analysts expectations is¬†slightly higher than it would be¬†for other companies. So, the market's reaction¬†is always, I think, generally going to be¬†a little bit sharper than what we might see¬†for a company that does offer standard guidance. Priestley:¬†Yeah,¬†because they have nothing ready¬†to peg their estimates to. Lewis: Yeah. They have¬†the general trend of things¬†and what they can glean from commentary. But¬†very often, you'll see¬†analysts' expectations more or less mirror guidance with¬†slight adjustments. Not having that as a crutch¬†can just add some unpredictability to things. I think that's the way you have to think about it. Priestley:¬†Any other little gems? Lewis: Outside of the¬†numbers, something that caught my eye that I think is a great point, and¬†really underscores the importance¬†of reading company conference calls, and¬†not just relying on the numbers that you see reported¬†and the quick earnings takes you'll see online: Mark Mahaney from¬†RBC Capital Markets¬†in the Q&A¬†section of the call asked this¬†really great question, and I think it points to a looming risk for¬†Alphabet, and I just want to highlight that for listeners. He said, "It¬†looks to me like Google devices are being outsold 10 to 1 or¬†something like that in most homes. It's immaterial now,¬†but you could see you in five years¬†there's a new voice search interaction interface¬†and it's not Google in the home. That¬†could be a real challenge for the company." And¬†he was basically positing, "What are you guys doing about all of the virtual-assistant and smart-home devices?" Priestley:¬†Yeah,¬†great question. Lewis: Yeah. And¬†Sundar Pichai,¬†Google CEO,¬†he gave that generally positive answer,¬†talking about the investments the company is making¬†and how they're working toward voice search, and how they're trying to meet consumers¬†in every situation that they might be using voice search,¬†whether it be phones, TV, homes, cars, whatever. But really, at its core, Mahaney's question is¬†getting at this idea of: Amazon's Echo¬†devices are selling like hotcakes. If the installed base for them,¬†or really any other virtual assistant, gets¬†massive, and consumers start using those devices¬†for the types of things and the purposes that¬†people are generally using Google mobile and¬†desktop search for,¬†what does that do for your business? I don't want to be alarmist with any of this. I am an Alphabet shareholder,¬†I really love the company. But I think he makes a good point. Earlier this month, actually, at an ad industry¬†conference, there was an Amazon¬†VP¬†talking about some of the capabilities¬†and some of the opportunities¬†that Amazon might explore. That led¬†some analysts to speculate that¬†the company might be interested in exploring paid search with its Alexa product. This is not something that is a next-quarter, next-year issue. But over the next five to 10 years,¬†we need to keep an eye on how people are using search, and¬†how people are using home assistants or¬†virtual assistants. Because,¬†if we see that slowly eat into¬†what would otherwise be desktop or mobile search,¬†you have to wonder about how that might¬†impact Google's core business, and really¬†what prints money for them and allows them to fund¬†all of these other projects. Priestley:¬†Yeah. And also, which products they're using. If¬†everybody starts adopting the Google Nest, then they're good. Lewis: Yeah. If people are using Nest or Google¬†Assistant, then yeah, not a huge problem,¬†that will keep them within that ecosystem. If they are using products that don't lean on¬†Google search, and you have platforms that are¬†able to monetize that search,¬†Google might get crowded out a little bit. Again, Google did $26 billion in revenue this quarter. The¬†vast majority of that was online ads. It's a huge market. I think people's more in-depth searching, or more research-based stuff, is¬†always going to be on desktop or mobile. You can only glean so much from audio. But¬†if you want the quick answer on something -- say¬†you want to know who was the fifth president of the United States --¬†you can find that out with a voice search,¬†and not really have to worry about being on mobile or desktop.

(Apple/YouTube screenshot) Share Written by Adam Epstein Obsession Glass February 14, 2017 Hip hop artist and entrepreneur will.i.am has something important to tell you in the trailer for Apple‚Äôs upcoming reality TV series, Planet of the Apps: ‚ÄúDevelopers!‚Äù he proclaims. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre the rock stars of right now.‚Äù That may be, but do we really need to watch a television show about them? The answer, Apple has decided, is yes. We‚Äôve known about Apple‚Äôs original series about apps for a while, but this is the first we‚Äôve seen of it. Apple content boss Eddy Cue and Ben Silverman, the show‚Äôs executive producer, debuted the clip at Recode‚Äôs Code media conference yesterday. If the premise sounds familiar, that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs an unabashed cross between the US primetime competition shows Shark Tank and The Voice. First, developers pitch their app ideas to a panel of four judges: will.i.am (who is also a judge on the British version of The Voice); actresses-turned-entrepreneurs Jessica Alba and Gwyneth Paltrow; and Vaynermedia founder Gary Vaynerchuk. ‚ÄúFour of the world‚Äôs most culturally influential entrepreneurs,‚Äù the voiceover intones. The contestants have 60 seconds to pitch their apps while descending an escalator. (Yes, really.) If they‚Äôre lucky, one of the judges will agree to partner with them. If they‚Äôre super lucky, multiple judges will want to partner with them and they‚Äôll get to pick which one they move forward with. Once they pick an advisor, the contestants consult with ‚Äútech luminaries‚Äù from companies such as Yelp, Uber, and Musical.ly (who say things like ‚Äúmake pivots‚Äù). The final pitch is to representatives from the venture capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners (who ask questions like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your burn rate right now?‚Äù). If LightSpeed agrees to fund the app, it will be featured on Apple‚Äôs app store. In addition to talk of pivots and burn rates, the trailer for Planet of the Apps conveys its tech insider bona fides with lines like: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the eBay for the Snapchat generation.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy brand is known all over the Earth.‚Äù (will.i.am‚Äôs, that is.) ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to revolutionize social media.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs consumers of news, we have a real trust issue.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is a branding game. I‚Äôm the branding person for you.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt the pitch anymore. This is real life.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe future of TV,‚Äù CEO Tim Cook said last year, ‚Äúis apps.‚Äù So naturally, Planet of the Apps will have its own dedicated app. The show will be available to Apple Music‚Äôs 20 million subscribers sometime this spring. Along with Carpool Karaoke, Planet of the Apps is part of a growing stockpile of video content produced by Apple to help sell memberships to its streaming music service. Cue has said that Apple‚Äôs interest in TV‚Äîfor now, at least‚Äîis only to enhance and promote the company‚Äôs existing platforms.

Apple Music to Host Planet of the Apps and Carpool Karaoke Spin-Off Shows GO The two shows will come soon to Apple Music Feb 14, 2017 09:39 GMT ¬†¬∑¬† By Alexandra Vaidos ¬†¬∑¬† Share:¬† Apple has just released a teaser for its upcoming reality show on Apple Music, which gives app developers some air-time and the possibility to get their ideas funded with up to $10 million. They will need to pitch their idea in under 60 seconds to four influential entrepreneurs, including Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow, Gary Vaynerchuk, and will.i.am. Developers need to get the show‚Äôs hosts interested in the idea, and those selected will partner with an advisor in business and get the opportunity to win millions of dollars. After working on their projects, app developers will be able to pitch their idea to a top venture capital firm. The show resembles The Voice, but for app developers. Successful apps earn featured placement on the App Store, making them available to millions of users. Planet of the Apps will be available exclusively on Apple Music and it seems that Apple has already finished filming the series in Hollywood. More than 100,000 apps were submitted to the show‚Äôs producers, but only about 100 were selected for filming. Apple‚Äôs teaser didn‚Äôt mention when the show would air, but it shouldn‚Äôt be long now. Play Video A Carpool Karaoke spin-off is also coming to Apple Music Planet of the Apps isn‚Äôt the only original show to make its way to Apple Music; apparently, a Carpool Karaoke spin-off will also be featured. You might have watched The Late Late Show with James Corden and his Carpool Karaoke section, which features famous celebrities riding in the car with James Corden, talking and signing famous songs. The spin-off will keep some of the main concepts of the initial show, but with a twist. James Corden will no longer drive the car, instead other celebrities will drive around, talk, sing and stop for other random activities. The two shows sound interesting and entertaining, but they hint to the fact that Apple Music will be expanded to offer Netflix-like content with original series, rather than remaining a service solely for streaming music. If the shows are successful, and we see no reason why they wouldn‚Äôt be, Apple will most likely produce other original shows for its Apple Music platform.

Credit: Watchiwit/Shutterstock "The problem is, Apple IDs are used with too many services," Xiao said as he showed a slide listing 20 different Apple services accessible with an Apple ID, including the App Store, Apple Music, the Apple Online Store, iCloud, Find My iPhone, iMessage and the Mac App Store. "Every feature can be abused to make a profit." He explained that Apple IDs can be exploited to squeeze money out of almost any aspect of the Apple ecosystem, from deceiving users with spam Apple Messages, to locking users out of their devices and demanding ransom, to artificially pumping up the user ratings of dodgy apps so that they rank in the Top 10 on the App Store. Important Tip: Xiao didn't point it out, but some of the Apple ID thefts and abuses could be prevented by users implementing the two-factor authentication offered by Apple. Worst of all are the scams in which a stolen Apple ID is used to lock the legitimate user out of his or her own device, by resetting the password and activating the Find My iPhone lock until the user pays a fee, usually $100 or so. The process holds the iPhone for ransom without the iPhone ever leaving the victim's possession. "These guys will often attack end users directly, when it's worth it," Xiao said. There are many ways to steal Apple IDs, Xiao said. He displayed a well-done phishing email that looked as if it had come from Apple, asking the user to verify his account by clicking a link in the message. Other phishing scams involve text messages, again telling the recipient that he or she needs to "confirm your Apple ID" by clicking on links to Apple-sounding websites, such as mysecureicloud.com or support-appleid.com. MORE: iPhone 8 Rumors - What to Expect from the 10th Anniversary iPhone Some phishing scams are used by iPhone thieves to defeat Activation Lock on stolen iPhones, deliberately targeting the legitimate users by telling them that their devices have been found and that they need to log in remotely using their Apple IDs. Most of these "spear phishing" attempts come via email or SMS, Xiao said. One owner of a stolen iPhone, Xiao said, ignored hundreds of such emails and text messages but finally fell for a phone call that displayed the number of a known Apple support line when it rang. The caller pretended to be from Apple, asked the user to answer the standard security questions, and then sent the user to a phishing site that tried to steal his password. Malware also tries to steal Apple IDs, Xiao said, listing three different iOS malware families of the past two years that stole Apple IDs en masse.¬† Because countless users reuse passwords and email addresses for many online accounts, any massive breach of account credentials from a large online service (such as the Yahoo and LinkedIn breaches disclosed in 2016) will result in thousands, if not millions, of stolen Apple IDs. And some scammers don't even steal Apple IDs ‚Äî they make new ones in batches of hundreds or thousands, then sell those IDs on the black market. Those IDs are valuable because they can make scammers money. Spam advertising deep discounts on fashionable items appeared in iPhone users' Messages and iCalendar apps during last year's holiday shopping season. MORE: Best Antivirus Software for Mac More lucrative is using stolen Apple IDs to artificially boost the popularity of App Store apps by making nonexistent purchases and writing phony glowing reviews. Xiao showed a price chart that offered to boost an app into the top 10 in the U.S. App Store for $16,000. "Many users may find strange things in their purchase histories," Xiao said. He pointed out that one fake antivirus app, named after a well-known Norse god, made it to No. 3 among paid apps in the App Store, even though the app is really "scareware" that fakes infection in order to prove its own worth. (That app is still in the App Store, even though Apple says it doesn't let antivirus apps in.) The slides for Xiao's presentation are available on GitHub.

The largest component of the S&P 500 and a core holding on Wall Street, Apple's stock climbed 0.9 percent to end at $133.29, above its record high close of $133.00 hit on Feb. 23, 2015 and giving it a market value of about $699 billion. Its increase helped balloon the S&P 500's .SPX market capitalization on Monday beyond $20 trillion for the first time. While mutual funds have largely bet on Apple in recent months, some big names missed out on all or part of its recent acceleration. Hedge fund manager Dan Loeb's Third Point LLC cut its stake in Apple by 26 percent to 1.9 million shares in the fourth quarter, according to regulatory filings, while George Soros and Carl Icahn also shed their Apple shares last year. In contrast, the number of mutual funds reporting they became Apple shareholders in recent quarterly filings has jumped by 187 percent to 287, while the number of mutual funds liquidating their Apple holdings dropped by 26 percent to 151, according to Morningstar. Among the big names who backed the stock, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) last August said it had increased its stake in Apple by 55 percent to 15 million shares, now worth $2 billion. David Einhorn's hedge fund Greenlight Capital in January said it still likes Apple. Apple has climbed 50 percent from lows in the first half of last year and is up 15 percent so far in 2017. It was still short of its all-time intraday high of $134.54, set on April 28, 2015. Monday's gain came after Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski raised her price target for Apple to $150. She said she is more confident that an upcoming 10th anniversary iPhone will feature augmented-reality technology, which could help boost demand in a saturated smartphone market. Many investors are betting that Apple will mark the iPhone's 10th anniversary with a dramatically improved model. They also believe that strong sales of the iPhone 6S two years ago have left a larger-than-normal base of customers ready to upgrade. The Cupertino, California company reported strong December-quarter results on Jan. 31, and although it gave a cautious outlook for the current quarter, Wall Street expects revenue to grow this year after sinking nearly 8 percent in fiscal 2016. In 1998, when the S&P 500 closed above $10 trillion for the first time, Apple accounted for just under 0.06 percent of the index. It now accounts for about 3.5 percent of the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The 721 days that have passed since Apple's previous record-high close represent the largest gap between such milestones since the iPhone's launch in 2007.

One of them is that Apple will feature wireless charging to their next smartphone. And this is very possible due to the fact that Apple joined the Wireless Power Consortium, a group for wireless power. According to reports the company will present a phone that will use inductive s charging and that the company will not provide a charger. But it will offer it as an extra accessory. On the other hand maybe the tech giant wants to adopt the long-range charging. And why not? According to a survey from IHS Technology showed that more than 90% of smartphone users want to have wireless charging. 9to5Mac provided a statement from Apple to Business Insider: ‚ÄúApple is an active member of many standards development organizations, as both a leader and contributor. Apple is joining the Wireless Power Consortium to be able to participate and contribute ideas to the open, collaborative development of future wireless charging standards. We look forward to working together with the WPC and its members.‚Äù Quick reminder that the next iPhone will probably feature an edge-to-edge display with almost invisible bezels, no Home button and a flexible plastic OLED screen. Also Apple filed an unnamed wireless device with the Federal Communications Commission. And the speculations fly around. Is it a speaker for Siri, like Alexa? Is it another smart device for your home? Maybe a Wi-Fi? But the company is super secretive about its new project. All we know is that the device exists, it has Bluetooth, LE and NFC. Keep in mind that this is not the first time that Apple filed to the FCC for a similar device. At first many thought that it was an Apple TV but that plan was quickly dismissed. According to a report from MacRumors it is possible that the California-based company manufactured a device for internal use, such as iBeacon which is used by the company to communicate with OS devices. If you want to check out the mysterious device you can visit the FCC website. And if you manage to figure out what it might be let us know in the comment section.

The next generation iPhone will likely debut sometime in the fall, so Apple will need as many OLED panels as it can get for its new flagship. The iPhone 8 will be a major departure from its predecessor, featuring a 5.2-5.8-inch OLED display. Rumors suggest that the new phone will have nearly no bezels and will integrate the Home button and Touch ID sensor into the screen. Apple is expected to launch the new iPhone, dubbed iPhone 8, this fall on its usual yearly iPhone refresh cycle. However, the demand will be much higher than before as the new phone is slated to be a major departure from its predecessor, the iPhone 7.

On the other hand, Apple has also been reportedly working on an iris scanner for the new iPhone, which would replace fingerprint scanners. We‚Äôve previously seen two different methods of an embedded Touch ID sensor, and today‚Äôs patent marks a third‚Ä¶ The patent, discovered by AppleInsider, describes using infrared emitters and sensors placed along the LEDs inside an OLED display. Exemplary methods and systems use a micro light emitting diode (LED) in an active matrix display to emit light and a sensing IR diode to sense light. A display panel includes a display substrate having a display region, an array of subpixel circuits, and an array of selection devices. Each subpixel circuit includes a driving circuit to operate a corresponding infrared (IR) emitting LED in a light emission mode. Each selection device may be coupled to a corresponding sensing IR diode to operate the corresponding sensing IR diode in a light sensing mode. This method seems to only work with an OLED display, however. Which means certain models, which would feature an LCD display, would not work.

He emphasized that by hosting more than music to its Apple Music will set the service apart from its competition. During a Recode‚Äôs Code Media conference, he said that adding video can be one of the differentiating elements that the company can add to Apple Music. In its 15 months, the service has grown to 20 million users, thereby, allowing it to be the fastest-growing subscription services. The company will add videos to its subscription service through its upcoming launch of reality TV show. One of them is the Planet of the Apps. Produced by Propagate Content, this show‚Äôs main stars are app developers. What Is The Planet Of The Apps? In this show, contestants will make a pitch about their iOS apps to the judges while they descend an escalator. They must impress the panel of judges, consist of Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow, Gary Vaynerchuk and Will.i.am, to be included in the list of final developers for mentorship. During the last round, they need to pitch their app ideas to Lightspeed Venture Partners. The company has committed to more than $10 million in capital to fund the winning app. The winning app will be featured on the App Store. During the Code Media conference, the show‚Äôs co-producer, who was also present during the Code Media chat, said that apps play a major role in the current cultural landscape. Eddy Cue also emphasized on the company‚Äôs strategy as an influencer of the culture. Although Apple acknowledged video‚Äôs role in its music subscription service, it is not planning to buy a lot of TV shows. Instead, it wants to do something creative that can surely move culture. Apart from the Planet of the Apps, the company will also release Carpool Karaoke: The Series. It is set to be available on Apple Music soon. It is based on the popular segment of the Late Late Show, hosted by James Corden. In this TV show, he rides with celebrities and sings in a car. Previous reports stated that Apple ordered 16 episodes that will stream weekly on Apple Music. It will be presented by Fulwell 73 and CBS Television Studios. As regards to the host, it is noted that James Corden won‚Äôt be hosting it. Cue also said that constant introduction of new services was a key to the service‚Äôs growth. He stated that less than 100 million people in the world are subscribed to music. But Cue also emphasized that Apple Music will still be completely about music, even though those new shows will appear on Apple Music. Then again, he said that the shows of MTV were not about music. So, Apple Music will be about culture, rather than concentrating on music. He also said that it would try to add Apple News to cut down fake news.

Apple is now listed as a member of Qi, a wireless charging consortium, something they weren‚Äôt apart of a week ago. Early rumors suggest that Apple is working on long range wireless charging, however, that technology may not be ready at launch so the company may other manufacturers with short range charging via a pad of sorts. Similar to the current Apple Watch, the iPhone would be placed on some sort of magnetic charger, and would be a separate accessory. While Apple may want long-range RF charging, the company couldn‚Äôt wait and is joining Qi as a result, according to¬†IHS Technology analyst Vicky Yussuff. The success of wireless charging adoption from Apple‚Äôs competitors is something that Apple can no longer ignore. IHS Technology consumer survey data shows over 90% of consumers want wireless charging on their next device. Apple has also stepped in and provided us a statement. Apple is an active member of many standards development organizations, as both a leader and contributor. Apple is joining the Wireless Power Consortium to be able to participate and contribute ideas to the open, collaborative development of future wireless charging standards. We look forward to working together with the WPC and its members. Tags: 2017 iPhone, Qi, Wireless charging About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

Apple‚Äôs online store is out of stock and will begin shipping in 5-6 weeks. The display went on sale late last year with an introductory price of $974 until the end of March as part of Apple‚Äôs USB-C sale. Apple said back in March during its MacBook Pro event that it‚Äôs working with LG to integrate the display with macOS. The UltraFine display is Apple‚Äôs current solution for those who are looking to purchase an external Retina display to replace their current Thunderbolt Display. An Apple Customer Support representative confirmed that Apple has removed the display from its store shelves with no indication of when they‚Äôre going back in stock. Apple‚Äôs online store lists the display with 5-6 week ship dates with no option to pick-up in store.

You might like a romantic person or an adventurous character. Or your are only want to date people you have Apple devices, and better an iPhone. According to a survey by the dating site Match.com U.S. citizens are more picky when it comes to dating other people. And if you have an Android then you might be out of luck. The survey questions more than 5.500 single people and the findings are pretty interesting. So survey showed that Apple users are more likely to judge negatively Android users while people who use an Android are 15 times more likely to say something bad about iPhone owners. And if you have an old smartphone then you might not get a date at all. Abby Rodman psychotherapist in Boston says: ‚ÄúWe look for so many other ways in which we‚Äôre compatible with potential partners, why shouldn‚Äôt phones be on the list?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere a person lives, what car they drive, and what they do for a living are all things we weigh before embarking on a relationship. That may be pitiful commentary, but we‚Äôre also looking for compatibility in the non-materialistic: political viewpoints, religious convictions, and fundamental ethical values.‚Äù Also, Simon Rego, chief psychologist at Montefiore Medical Center talked about technology and dating: ‚ÄúThe metrics of the traditional date have shifted,‚Äù says He does see a cultish aspect to the technology we use. ‚ÄúSome people would rather lose their sense of smell than their iPhones. It‚Äôs as important to spell-check your text as it is to straighten your tie. Actually, I‚Äôm not sure people even wear ties on dates anymore.‚Äù And if you spend too much time on social media that can be a no0no for some singles. When the time comes to ‚Äúbefriend‚Äù someone on Facebook and arrange a date then your use of social media might determine if you will go on with the date. And it is a bit ironic if you think about it. If some people judge others by their smartphone and arrange online dates then the use of social media might not be such a huge problem. Abby Rodman also says about the matter: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre living every breath of your life out loud on social media, you may be perceived as not being reliable enough to honor the sanctity of another‚Äôs confidence or of a romantic relationship.‚Äù Despite the smartphone differences both Apple and Android users have some things in common when it comes to dating. Almost 15% of people who are dating won‚Äôt date someone with a cracked smartphone screen, it added. Also, bad grammar, discolored teeth and poor fashion choices are among the list.

However thanks to social media and the way news is spread and shared, fake news is starting to become a serious problem especially when people don‚Äôt check the source and find out if what they‚Äôre sharing is the real deal. This is an issue that Facebook is combating and has gotten quite a lot of blame for, and it looks like Apple wants to nip it in the bud quickly before the spotlight falls onto them. As you know, Apple has a News app of their own and during a recent interview, Apple‚Äôs internet service chief Eddy Cue revealed the company‚Äôs plans to combat fake news on their end. According to Cue, ‚ÄúWe wanted Apple News to be available to everyone, but we want to vet and make sure that the news providers are legitimate. We‚Äôre very concerned about all of the news items and the clickbait from that standpoint, and that driving a lot of the news coverage. We‚Äôre trying to do some things in Apple News, we‚Äôre learning from that and we need to share that together as an industry and improve it.‚Äù He also revealed that because a lot of news these days are being read through such apps and devices, that Apple feels that they do have a responsibility for ensuring that the content delivered is the real deal. However as to what exactly Apple will be doing was not revealed, but it‚Äôs good to know that they are looking into it. Filed in Apple. Read more about Apps and iOS.

Apple reportedly signs new 60-million-panel deal with Samsung By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd ¬∑ Feb 13, 2017 with 28 comments The iPhone 6S Plus uses an LCD display, while most modern flagships use AMOLED For years now, Apple has been expected to make the transition from LED to OLED panels in its smartphones. These rumors recently intensified as numerous sources within the industry pointed to the iPhone maker adopting OLED displays for at least one of its iPhone models coming out later this year. Samsung has been part of these rumors for a long time as well, because its subsidiary, Samsung Display, creates most of the available OLED panels used in today‚Äôs smartphones, and is one of the few companies able to churn out the number of panels Apple would require. Last year, sources inside the Korean electronics giant, not to mention its own public financial records, pointed to a massive deal signed between Samsung Display and a third party, believed to be Apple. According to reports at the time, the deal would see Samsung Display provide Apple with 100 million OLED display panels, starting this year. Now, a new deal between the two companies seems to have been made, according to Korean media. The new arrangement will see Samsung supply a further 60 million panels to Apple, significantly boosting Samsung Display‚Äôs share of the iPhone-maker‚Äôs business. Considering Apple sold around 200 million iPhones over its last four quarters, 160 million OLED displays seems like a huge number. The size of that order appears even more surprising in the context of recent rumors pointing to just one iPhone model, the 10-year anniversary edition, having an OLED display, while two further ‚Äúregular‚Äù models were expected to continue using LCD technology. This increased order, which hasn‚Äôt been officially confirmed by either of the two companies, might point to Apple deciding to use OLED panels in more of its products. Or it might point to the company being extremely optimistic about the rumored 10th-anniversary iPhone. In either case, with the next iPhone still half a year away, we‚Äôll just have to wait until further information becomes available.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Apple Reportedly Orders 160 Million OLED Displays From Samsung By Tyler Lee on 02/14/2017 03:42 PST One of the rumored features of this year‚Äôs iPhone is that it will see Apple finally switch to an OLED display. However one of the recent reports have suggested that due to shortages, the OLED iPhone will be limited to a particular model of the iPhone 8 Plus variety, meaning that Apple‚Äôs other iPhones will continue to use LCD. However a new report out of Korea from The Investor (via Cult of Mac) is painting a very different picture. If the reports are true, it seems that Apple has ordered an additional 60 million OLEDs from Samsung. This is on top of a previously rumored agreement in which Samsung would supply Apple with 100 million OLED panels for the iPhone 8. Now 160 million is obviously not a small figure to scoff at, and like we said it seems to contradict the earlier claims that the OLED screen would be exclusive to the iPhone 8 Plus. Given that Apple typically sells about 200 million iPhones a year, 160 million means that it accounts for 80% of iPhone sales, meaning that it seems unlikely that all 160 million orders are just for one particular model. In any case take it with a grain of salt for now, but this could possibly be good news for would-be customers who do not plan to purchase the larger Plus model, but would still like an OLED screen anyway.

AirPods Review Wireless future by Adam Cook on February 14, 2017 Details ¬† ¬† There‚Äôs a distinct possibility that, no matter what I write here, you‚Äôve already made your mind up about Apple‚Äôs AirPods. Whether it‚Äôs how they look, or whatever else, but regardless, I‚Äôm here to tell you that I really, really like them. In fact, I kinda love them. They‚Äôre fancy tech, for sure, and not cheap. Know in advance that I like the packed in earbuds Apple usually supplied with iPhones. In fact, know that I think there‚Äôs a strange snobbery around them in many circles, despite the fact that thousands upon thousands of people use them quite happily every day, and never find reason to complain. Look, I know that you can buy headphones for hundreds of pounds that have superior audio quality (I‚Äôve reviewed some excellent, and expensive headphones in my time), and I do firmly believe that you get what you pay for. I will say though: I like, and regularly use the stock Apple EarPods, and for a pair of headphones that come in the box, they provide pretty damn fine audio quality ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because they are ‚Äúfree‚Äù, but they‚Äôre nowhere near as bad as people say. Let‚Äôs not beat around the bush then, because the AirPods are an improvement, audio-wise. Not a giant leap, but they do sound slightly better. Nuances in the music seem clearer, whereas the bass and treble seem mostly the same. This is a clarity thing, with the moments in music you might otherwise lose coming through in the mix, and that‚Äôs a good thing. I think it‚Äôs also worth mentioning that I have always found the EarPods comfortable, and the AirPods are no different. Interestingly, passing them round the house, it seems everyone agrees with me, and my wife (notorious in our house for saying buds are too big or too small, she‚Äôs the Goldilocks of headphones) found them comfortable as well. I‚Äôve used bluetooth buds before, and the fact these have been designed by Apple, for Apple products, is very apparent. They just work, flawlessly so. Open the included case near your phone and the device will recognise them and offer to pair them. From there, it‚Äôs clever, yet simple design all the way: put one Pod in, the music will go from your phone to the Pod. Put the second one in, it‚Äôll now be in stereo. Take a Pod out? It‚Äôll pause the music. Put it back in? Yep, it starts playing again. Such simplicity is welcomed, and in the settings for your AirPods you can choose whether a double tap of the AirPod stem activates Siri, or pauses your music. In other words, if you don‚Äôt fancy taking a Pod out to pause, or using a button on your phone or watch (whatever, really), you can double tap your headphones to pause whatever is playing. If there‚Äôs a minor complaint here, it‚Äôs that you can‚Äôt turn the audio up or down like you could with a normal pair of headphones, but the chances are that if you‚Äôre spending ¬£180 on them, you‚Äôve probably got an Apple Watch or iPhone which means you can still do it very quickly. The included case is also a charger, believe it or not. The case itself holds 24 hours of charge, while the AirPods themselves go for around five hours without needing to go back in. The truly impressive thing is that popping them back in the case for 10-15 minutes will give you another 2-3 hours of charge. Again, at the risk of repeating myself, this is impressive tech. The case itself charges via Lightning connector, as usual. In fact, as I write this, I haven‚Äôt charged the case for three days, and I wear the AirPods for hours every day: ultimately, you‚Äôre going to be incredibly unlucky if you find yourself with them not charged. Waxing lyrical to a colleague, the question I got asked was: ‚Äúbut surely you‚Äôll lose them?‚Äù. That‚Äôs a fair question, but I‚Äôd counter with: ‚Äúdo you lose your stock Apple EarPods?‚Äù. No, because they‚Äôre cabled, the conversation continues, but I found running with the AirPods, and general gym-exercise was absolutely fine. If you‚Äôre going to treat them with a lack of respect and throw them down wherever you fancy, sure, you might lose them in the same you might lose your keys. But the supplied charging case is smaller than a packet of tic-tacs, and goes in your pocket just fine. When you‚Äôre not using them, put them in there and you‚Äôll keep them safe. It‚Äôs like any other expensive tech: look after it and it‚Äôll stay safe. While I‚Äôll never be able to convince you if you‚Äôve already made your mind up, the future does appear to be wireless. The AirPods are comfy, sound great, and yes, they‚Äôre not the cheapest bluetooth headphones out there, but for a set that just work with your existing setup, I can‚Äôt recommend them highly enough. Oh, and they look fine on, as well, don‚Äôt let people tell you otherwise. The AirPods are now my go-to pair of headphones, and they feel like magic. scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; width:80px; height:62px;" allowTransparency="true"> Positives Comfortable Impressive charge time Great audio Premium build quality Negatives No wireless way to change volume Not cheap Editor Rating ¬† Our Score 9.5 SCORE OUT OF TEN 9.5 In Short ¬† The AirPods are comfy, sound great, and yes, they're not the cheapest bluetooth headphones out there, but for a set that just work with your existing setup, I can't recommend them highly enough. 1 like Reviews, Tech appleApple AirPodsfeat Newly Added Halo Wars 2 Review 9.0 ¬† How to Survive 2 Review¬† Mario Sports Superstars is shaping up to be a lot of fun¬† Victor Vran: Overkill Edition announced¬† Alwa‚Äôs Awakening Review¬† Latest Reviews Halo Wars 2 Review 9.0 ¬† How to Survive 2 Review¬† Alwa‚Äôs Awakening Review¬† Apple AirPods Review¬† Divide Review¬† Random Video Latest PODCAST Podcast: Like a blade to the chest (08/02/17) Full Story ¬† 9.0 Halo Wars 2 Review by Gary Baileyon February 16, 2017 Halo?

Recently during an interview with The Independent, Cook once again reiterated Apple‚Äôs interest in the technology and stated how he believes that it is a ‚Äúbig idea‚Äù just like the smartphone once was. According to Cook, ‚ÄúI regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone, we don‚Äôt have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it‚Äôs for everyone. I think AR is that big, it‚Äôs huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives. And be entertaining.‚Äù Cook also revealed why he believes that AR is better than VR. ‚ÄúMost people don‚Äôt want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can‚Äôt do that because you get sick from it. With AR you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance.‚Äù It‚Äôs interesting that Cook is so excited about the technology. This has previously led to speculation that Apple could have AR plans. The company has acquired companies that dealt with AR in the past, so it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising if they were to eventually integrate it into some of their products in the future. Filed in Apple.

This happened after Goldman Sachs said that Apple was slightly undervalued based on hearing speculation about the device possibly having AR features, signaling it may be a significant update to the iPhone. The price of the stock had been steadily rising after Apple's 2016 Q4 earnings call. The highest price of Apple¬ís stock during a business day was $134.54 per share, which the closing date has not yet reached. Many investors Apple usually buy stock during the building up of rumors and leaks until around the time that a new iPhone is announced; that¬ís why you¬íll see a drastic shift in stock prices every year around September. Back in 2014, stock kept rising even a couple of months after the iPhone 6 came out, though it was a significant upgrade over the iPhone 5. AAPL - Stock price over the last year Given 2016¬ís iPhone 7 and MacBook Pros were a bit underwhelming for some, Apple is expected to launch a totally revamped iPhone for the original iPhone¬ís 10-year anniversary and among its expected features are wireless charging, an OLED display, and some kind of AR feature has also been widely rumored. Maybe not something along the lines of the Amazon Fire Phone parallax effect throughout the UI, but maybe Apple will put the feature to a useful application.

Cue began by talking about their original reality show, Planet of the Apps. The show‚Äôs first trailer premiered today as well. The interview shed some light on the original idea of the show.¬†Silverman, along with Will.i.am, created the basic concept of the show and pitched it to major networks. After the failed attempts,¬†Will.i.am mentioned the idea to Apple and that‚Äôs how the relationship started. Silverman explains: ‚ÄúMy partners and I were working on the show and taking the show out to pitch it. We took it out to pitch it to the traditional players and platforms and were really focused on broadcast. During¬†the process, we had one day of meetings and all of the people we pitched to wanted the show. Will said, ‚ÄòI have to go have a meeting with Jimmy Iovine¬†and Eddy Cue,¬†are you guys cool if i bring up the idea?‚Äô Will laid out the concept and they immediately¬†connected on it.‚Äù Apple has also took the wraps off the second peek into Carpool Karaoke today as well. More specifically, this clip shows off the concept of having multiple hosts on the show, as apposed to just James Corden. The description for the clip reads: Based on the segment that has become a global, viral video sensation on The Late Late Show with James Corden, the new CARPOOL KARAOKE series features 16 celebrity pairings riding along in a car together as they sing tunes from their personal playlists and surprise fans who don‚Äôt expect to see big stars belting out tunes one lane over. Aside from a ‚ÄúSpring‚Äù release date, we don‚Äôt know when the show will actually launch. But it‚Äôs interesting that it‚Äôs behind a paywall for Apple Music considering Apple just launched its own TV app. It would make more sense for Apple to create a channel within the TV app for shows such as Planet of the Apps and Carpool Karaoke.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube So we know that Apple is interested in getting into original programming. We recently saw the trailer for ‚ÄúCarpool Karaoke‚Äù released, and in case you‚Äôre hankering for more Apple originals, the trailer for the upcoming reality TV show ‚ÄúPlanet of the Apps‚Äù has been released, giving us an idea of what to expect. According to the video‚Äôs description, ‚ÄúPlanet of the Apps celebrates the world of apps and the talented people who create them. Hosted by Zane Lowe and featuring advisers Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow, Gary Vaynerchuk and will.i.am, the series highlights developers who have the vision to shape the future, solve real problems, and inspire change within our daily lives.‚Äù Basically the show involves app developers pitching ideas to these four celebrities in hopes that their idea gets chosen. In a way it‚Äôs very similar to other competition-based reality shows out there, such as The Voice, The Apprentice, American Idol, America‚Äôs Got Talent, and more where people are given a brief amount of time to try and sell themselves and their talent to the judges. It is an interesting pick for a panel of judges, but we guess we‚Äôll have to wait for the series to air before we can determine how good (or bad) it is. Just like ‚ÄúCarpool Karaoke‚Äù, ‚ÄúPlanet of the Apps‚Äù will only be available to Apple Music subscribers. Filed in Apple >General. Read more about Apps, Entertainment and iOS.

We hit the headline numbers, key metrics, and dig through management's comments to catch all the info investors need to know. Sarah Priestley and Dylan Lewis (TMFSarahp) Feb 14, 2017 at 12:11PM Two big heavyweights of the tech industry, PayPal¬†(NASDAQ:PYPL) and Alphabet¬†(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), reported their fourth-quarter results earlier this month, and Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Sarah Priestley have dug through the reports. In this episode of Industry Focus: Tech, they share the most interesting points from both reports, from the most important earnings numbers to little Q&A gems that shed some light on each companies' long-term plans, and more.¬† A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Jan. 27, 2017. Dylan Lewis:¬†Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's¬†Friday, Jan. 27, and we're breaking them¬†quarterly results from¬†PayPal¬†and¬†Alphabet. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis,¬†and I'm joined in the studio by fool.com¬†tech editor Sarah Priestley. Sarah,¬†how's it going? Sarah Priestley:¬†It's good,¬†it's a pleasure to be here, thank you for having me. Lewis: Are¬†you excited for pizza day? Priestley:¬†I am very excited. It's¬†going to derail my New Year's resolutions,¬†but that's OK.¬†[laughs]¬† Lewis: That's a callback to your¬†episode with the Vincent Shen. Are you finding that the Apple Watch is being helpful? Priestley:¬†Yes. It's¬†definitely reminding me at 9 p.m. that I have done 0 steps,¬†so I just end up walking around my living room¬†like a crazy person. Lewis: I do that when I'm on the phone all the time. That's¬†how I get my exercise in. Priestley:¬†That's¬†probably a good idea, yeah. Lewis: So,¬†Sarah, a ton going on in tech¬†this week, the next couple weeks with earnings. Two pretty followed Fool¬†companies reported yesterday after the bell. We dug into the reports and¬†are ready to talk about them. You did¬†some of the heavy lifting with PayPal; I dug into Alphabet. Why don't we¬†talk about PayPal first. How did the results look? Priestley:¬†To give you an overview for the fourth quarter,¬†earnings came in at $0.42 per share. $2.9 billion in revenue. Operating revenue was a little¬†higher than expected at 21%. Transactions were $1.8 billion. But the volume was¬†below expected. Expected was $100 billion and they delivered $99.3 billion. And that is why share prices are down about 3.5% this morning. So,¬†it seems like a slight overreaction¬†when you dig into their numbers. But, yeah,¬†that's the reason for the share price falling. Lewis: And that's really one of the core metrics that investors tend to focus on for them as a company, right? Priestley:¬†Absolutely. They really are¬†measured on engagement, so¬†number of customers, and engagement of those customers,¬†and the key metrics for those. Lewis: Looking beyond some of the top line numbers,¬†what else popped up to you in the report? Priestley:¬†The¬†operating margin for the fourth quarter was down to 15.4%. The reason that we're¬†commenting on this is that that's a lot,¬†it takes up a lot of room¬†in the bullish theses,¬†that the new partnerships they've started with¬†a lot of the banks,¬†Visa,¬†Mastercard, they're going to really pressure their margins down. Lewis: Is the thought there that they're working with very big institutions and big players, and they just don't¬†have the negotiating room that they might with some smaller players?¬† Priestley:¬†Absolutely. That's part of it. And also,¬†it's just the standard transaction payment. It's¬†the same thing for¬†Square¬†and other payment processors; it's a standard transaction amount on card processing. So, that¬†15.4% compared to 16.1%¬†in the fourth quarter of last year -- you can see, that's quite a decline there. Management has talked about the fact that they are really doing everything they can to leverage their other income against this. And I feel like they've done a pretty good job. Their CEO, Dan¬†Schulman,¬†has said that they won't be a slave to quarter-to-quarter margin performance. Lewis: Which is¬†something we like to hear as Foolish investors. Priestley:¬†That's¬†very true. And,¬†I would also comment that¬†the management team is really¬†being driven for their compensation package on the¬†long-term performance of this stock,¬†and I think that really shows in their reporting. They're¬†focused on free cash flow in their¬†projects, and what they're delivering to their customers. Just to give you a couple of the year-over-year figures: Earnings per share for the year¬†increased 15% to $1.15. Non-GAAP was $1.50 on guidance of $1.45 to $1.50. That's pretty good. Revenue for the full year was up 17%, and 21% on a currency-neutral basis, and they guided for 19%, so they really beat that. Lewis: Like Alphabet, their¬†fiscal Q4 comes¬†with the calendar Q4, so¬†we were able to look at full year results here,¬†and not just the quarterly results. What's going on with total payment volume?¬†I know that's something that people really like to focus on with them. Priestley:¬†Yeah,¬†absolutely.¬†If we had seen total payment volume less than 25%,¬†I think we would have seen a bigger decline in the stock price. Luckily, for the fourth quarter,¬†payment volume was up 25%. As I said, the¬†actual processed amount was $99.3 billion, which missed the expectations. Interestingly, the majority of this was pushed by international. International¬†expanded 27%. The U.S. was 23%.¬† Lewis: And¬†for the¬†unacquainted, total payment volume is just¬†the gross amount that they are¬†helping to facilitate. Priestley:¬†Yes. The way to look at this is,¬†the total payment volume is the number of¬†payments that they process. Then, the transaction is the amount that they process. So, they're¬†averaging about $56 per transaction right now. That's¬†slightly down from $60 that they were averaging a couple quarters ago. But¬†it's still very good. Lewis: So, for the amount per transaction to be down, they¬†must be doing more total transactions¬†to be making it up in volume¬†and still be seeing growth, right? Priestley:¬†Yes,¬†you're exactly right.¬†I will also comment that, of their transactions in their Q4, $100 billion was mobile payments, which is an increase of 55%, and it's almost a third now of their transactions processed. Which is fantastic, and I think the management team has really isolated that as an opportunity for the company. That's where they're going to really demonstrate their industry leadership. The market is moving toward mobile, and they're really pioneering in the mobile industry. Lewis: So what can people expect looking forward, either first quarter¬†of 2017 or¬†further out, broadly in 2017? Priestley:¬†Absolutely. I'll look for 2017¬†quarter four revenue we're expecting to grow¬†on a currency neutral basis¬†16% to 18%. That gives you a range of $2.9 billion to $2.95 billion. That was¬†actually¬†slightly more conservative than¬†some analysts were expecting, which played into their share price¬†performance today. But full-year performance is strong, revenue growth 15% to 17% and 17% to 19% currency neutral, which gives you about $12.45 billion to $12.65 billion. Lewis: Is there¬†anything to worry about with¬†some of these numbers that we're looking at, that¬†management growth projections are different than¬†what the market is expecting? Because,¬†they are still very much in growth mode as a business, and I know that early on, those projections, if they start to decelerate at all, can start to scare people off a little bit. Priestley:¬†I think they have been fairly conservative¬†in some of their estimations,¬†because they really do have a huge potential with the mobile traffic. I think,¬†if you look at some of their projects that they're¬†working on now, Venmo has increased 100% year over year. It was¬†Time Magazine's¬†best app, it's processed $5.6 billion, which was up 126%. So,¬†I think they have a¬†huge potential with a lot of the projects they're working on; they've¬†experienced huge growth. The problem with these is that they are not monetized yet. And an¬†analyst actually raised the question in the earnings call: "Is your¬†projection in 2017 building in¬†some of the expectations for¬†monetizing this, and also Xoom?" which is their international money transfer program. They dismissed this. They said¬†it was pushing out to 2018, some of the¬†opportunities,¬†and that they will be focused on growth. So, I think,¬†for 2017, these might be conservative estimates. But for 2018,¬†we might actually start to see¬†the fruits of that labor. Lewis: Yeah, and you said, 55% of¬†what was being processed, broadly for the business, was¬†coming from mobile. When you look at Venmo specifically,¬†that is almost entirely mobile. It's more peer-to-peer. There are¬†some questions about whether or not they will be able to monetize that very well,¬†and what that might look like, because me giving you $5 because¬†you bought me lunch the other day, they don't really take anything on that. Priestley:¬†No,¬†they don't. And¬†something to say is,¬†it's becoming a hugely crowded market. I think¬†PayPal, to some degree, has a first-mover advantage, but they're¬†definitely not the biggest player in this industry. The banks have gotten together and created clearXchange, which is a peer-to-peer¬†payment which is also free right now. It's¬†owned by the banks, so it has a lot of clout. Whether or not people pick it up to the rate that they've picked up Venmo, which is¬†hugely popular with millennials, a lot of our friends use it all the time, we use it. Also,¬†Apple. Apple has grown hugely. Tim Cook in his last earnings call -- so,¬†this is a bit outdated -- said that¬†75% of¬†swiping transactions were from Apple Pay. Lewis: Wow. It's¬†hard to believe.¬†Anecdotally, though, when I'm out with my friends,¬†and maybe you can lend some color on this too, if someone covers the tab,¬†I'm paying them via Venmo. No one is ever like, "Do you have¬†Bank of America¬†mobile payment processing?" So, they do seem to have that first-mover¬†advantage, and I think they have that name recognition. When you have that huge installed base, as they do, it really comes down to whether they can flip the monetization switch on. I guess investors are¬†going to have to be patient on that, if¬†management is pushing that out to 2018. Priestley:¬†Absolutely. I will say,¬†they do have a lot of initiatives that are panning out for them right now. One Touch¬†basically enables you¬†to fill in your bank details, and you work through PayPal,¬†and you can just click one button at the checkout and it's transacted through¬†PayPal, which is hugely beneficial for mobile.¬†I don't know about you, but frequently, when I'm¬† looking at shoes online, as soon as I get to¬†the card payment, and you have to zoom in on those small boxes and put your card numbers in, they lose me. I think it's something like a¬†74% cart-abandonment rate on mobile. Lewis: So when¬†people reach that checkout phase and they¬†see that they need to drop in their credit card number, their security code, their address, shipping address, zip code, all that stuff,¬†they wind up ditching it? Priestley:¬†Absolutely. But, PayPal One Touch,¬†they have 87% conversion rate on mobile. That's incredible. They've had¬†a lot of people starting to use that. They have added a lot of One Touch users. And, I think, of their merchants, about one-third right now are on One Touch. And they just launched this last year. So there's a huge¬†potential here for them to really deliver on their promise. They've said they want to make customers' lives easier, and they're doing that, absolutely. Lewis: Anything else that¬†management provided color on with the business, and¬†strategically where they're looking, that¬†investors should know? Priestley:¬†I think the focus is absolutely on mobile. Dan Schulman has¬†definitely commented on the fact that mobile is the biggest¬†opportunity for them, and there are a lot of industry tailwinds that they're experiencing right now. And¬†I would completely agree. I think¬†Black Friday this year was the biggest online shopping day in history. In¬†quarter three last year -- we're still waiting for quarter four --¬†the Census Bureau said that¬†online retail made up 10% of all retail transactions. So you can see that if they are positioning themselves well to benefit from this, it should be a rising tide that lifts all boats. Lewis: I know they've¬†talked a little bit in the past about¬†continuing to be an asset-light business. Is that something that management recommitted to in¬†the most recent call? Priestley:¬†Yeah,¬†absolutely. This is something that analysts have been focusing on. I definitely noticed a couple of questions about this in the earnings call. Square offers capital, it offers loans, as part of its services. It's not a huge part of their business, but it is a risk area of the business. So, in the fourth quarter, they had $123 million loss on loans. As a service similar to the company Square, which deals mostly with small businesses, but obviously this is individuals, PayPal has access to a lot of people's information and their spending habits and how much money they have. So they want to really leverage that information, and offer it out to partners to facilitate the loans using their information, which takes the risk away from PayPal, but they're still generating a percentage of income from it. So, overall, Dan Schulman¬†commented that it's a really competitive environment for this. I think the payment space is¬†just getting more and more competitive, every angle of it. But¬†overall, I think this is definitely a good move¬†for the company. It's the right decision,¬†it's going to eliminate some risk. But¬†it's also potentially going to bring in a degree of¬†revenue too, if they can grow that segment. Lewis: So,¬†it seems like the general takeaway here is: Wait and see with a lot of the company's¬†mobile initiatives. The core business¬†seems to be humming along. There was a little bit of disappointment,¬†but nothing thesis-altering,¬†nothing crazy in the report. Priestley:¬†No,¬†absolutely not. And they didn't touch too much on¬†some of their partners. They've had some really high-profile¬†partnerships with¬†Alibaba, Vodafone¬†in the U.K. and Europe, and many others; Discover, that they recently¬†announced. They didn't touch on that too much, so we can't really give investors a good flavor for how that's going, only that it's in line with their¬†expectations. So,¬†yeah, I agree with what you said. I think¬†mobile is going to be a big area of focus, we'll continue to have a look at those transaction volumes and customer engagement. Lewis:¬†So¬†Sarah,¬†I said that you did the heavy lifting on PayPal. I did most of the homework with Alphabet's earnings.¬†I'm going to flip it over to you and let you host for the second half of the show. Priestley:¬†It's¬†really nice to not be in the hot seat.¬†[laughs]¬† Lewis: Yeah.¬†I'll stop firing questions at you. It's my turn. Priestley:¬†So, yeah, Alphabet¬†reported the same time, yesterday after the bell. What were the results? Lewis: Overall, Alphabet's¬†revenue came in at about $26.1 billion for Q4, up 22% year over year, which beat analysts' estimates of $25.3 billion. Earnings per share came in at $7.56, slightly lower than analysts' projections of $7.63 per share. I think the real story -- and what caused some of the¬†immediate reaction for the stock -- was that adjusted profit missed by much more. That came in at $9.36 a share, versus expectations of $9.64 a share. We saw, after hours, the stock was down about 2.5% to 3%. That's what most of the market seemed to really fixate on. Priestley:¬†And what was the cause of that? Lewis: Tax rate, basically, is the short of it. In Q4, Alphabet had an effective tax rate of 22%. They also highlighted their broad 2016 tax rate, because they're able to report whole fiscal year results as well. The company's effective tax rate for the year was 19%. That's a big bump. And you realize that average is also incorporating other quarters. You can get a sense of how much more they were paying out in taxes this quarter. Really, if you want to get down to the nitty-gritty,¬†MarketWatch¬†writer Jeremy Owen does¬†a really good job breaking down the specifics, but¬†the gist of the issue is,¬†the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued some changes a while back,¬†basically impacting¬†how companies can treat stock-based compensation for their adjusted earnings numbers. And that wound up impacting results for this quarter. Moving forward, the company will¬†no longer be excluding stock-based compensation expenses from their non-GAAP results, which should smooth things out. But they wound up dealing with a little bit of a hiccup this quarter to reconcile. Priestley:¬†Yeah, that's¬†really unusual, the change for GAAP there. Lewis: Yeah. Typically, you think of non-GAAP numbers as being¬†something where the Financial Accounting Standards Board gives people a¬†decent amount of latitude to operate how they want to. But¬†they like to rein things in every now and then,¬†specifically with stock-based compensation because it's something that a lot of firms use to make their non-GAAP numbers look quite a bit better than their GAAP¬†numbers, especially in the tech space. Looking at¬†a couple of the different segments, their Google¬†segment, which is search, ads,¬†Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube,¬†pretty much anything that falls under their internet properties, came in at $25.8 billion. So,¬†looking at a company with $26 billion in quarterly revenue, that's the meat of it right there. That is¬†generally performing pretty well. Their Google Sites segment, which is the¬†majority of that, was up 20% year over year. Network revenue up 7% year over year. Other revenue, which is a smaller portion¬†a little bit less related to the internet properties within that segment -- think¬†Hardware, Google Play, and their cloud segment -- was $3.4 billion, which was up 62% year over year. So,¬†that's a very fast-growing segment within¬†Sundar Pichai's Google area of the business. I think,¬†if you're looking for indicators for them, the two big ones that tell the story for the ad business and what's going on with some of the internet properties: Aggregate paid clicks, which is basically the¬†number of times that people are interacting with ads online, was up 36% year over year. Aggregate cost per click, or CPCs, as they're commonly known, was down 15% year over year. This is¬†not really a surprise. This is a story that's been¬†playing out for a long time. We¬†talked about the shift to mobile when we were¬†talking about PayPal. The same thing is happening with internet search. CPCs have been driven down¬†because the effectiveness of¬†mobile ads isn't necessarily quite the same as it is for desktop. But for the longest time, Google has been able to make it up on volume. There's¬†actually quite a parallel there with¬†what happened with PayPal and the¬†volume making up for the smaller transactions. We're¬†seeing the same effects here with Alphabet. Priestley:¬†Would you suggest that's¬†something that investors should include in their thesis going forward? Lewis: I think it's something that, at¬†this point, we shouldn't be too surprised by. This story has been playing out for a decent amount of time. If it really¬†accelerates, you might have to worry. But they have been very good at¬†making the volume make it work out. Eventually, mobile will need to find a floor somewhere, and enjoy that. But so long as we're still in that¬†transition to mobile,¬†I think we're going to continue to see this for a while, unfortunately. Priestley:¬†OK. What about the Other Bets¬†segment? I know there have been some interesting moves this year. Lewis: Yeah, this is¬†something that people love to ask about, because it's like, "Where is¬†Google wasting all of this money?" As a reminder, this is basically all the stuff they do that isn't tied to their¬†internet properties. Think of it as their moonshot projects. The big financial contributors for this segment are Nest, Fiber, and Verily. They tend to¬†focus on a full-year breakout¬†for the segment¬†because the numbers are so small¬†relative to the overall business. But revenue came in at $809 million for 2016, which was up¬†82% year over year. Operating loss¬†not including stock-based compensation was $2.9 billion, down slightly year over year. But, this¬†segment is still a money pit for Alphabet, and I think it will¬†continue to be. They have reined in costs¬†a little bit under CFO Ruth Porat. I think she has forced all of the Other Bets¬†initiatives to¬†at least be able to show a path to monetization, or a road map to¬†what that might look like. But I think there's a certain test-and-innovate¬†atmosphere that they want to maintain. And¬†investors have been OK with that, because their core internet business just prints money for them. Something that is¬†interesting with them and the Other Bets segment is, they spun out¬†Waymo, which is their autonomous driving¬†segment. For the longest time, that was the Google Self-Driving Car Project. A couple months ago, they said, "This is a stand-alone business unit, and it will be nested within the Alphabet holding structure. It will continue to be in Other Bets." And¬†we didn't get any financial insight into what's going on with that. But they talked about it in the call. Ruth Porat¬†provided some commentary on what they're¬†basically doing with Waymo as a blueprint for what they will continue to be doing with Other Bets. Not a ton to report there,¬†but this is something that Daniel Sparks and I¬†talked about in a podcast when they announced that a few months ago. As we, in the next couple quarters, over¬†the next year, continue to get more information about Waymo,¬†I think we can look at that specific business segment and see the path for¬†what's going to be going on for some of the Other Bets as they¬†continue to mature and eventually see monetization. So, not a ton to report with Other Bets stuff, but¬†at least we have something that we can start to track for what the company's ambitions might be. Priestley:¬†Absolutely. It¬†looks like they're moving forward with that. Was there¬†anything else in the numbers that stood out to you in the earnings call? Lewis:¬†I think¬†some of the things that people need to keep in mind¬†with this report,¬†because the stock was down after hours, I think¬†as of taping this morning, they were down 40 or 50 basis points,¬†so not a crazy reaction like 3% that we saw¬†after hours yesterday, but still down,¬†I think people might be scratching their heads a little bit with some of the tax stuff they saw. Prior to the report,¬†the company was trading at all-time highs. It's¬†traded up for a while. I think it's somewhere in the teens in the last year or so. So, there's that. And¬†also, Alphabet does not provide detailed¬†quarterly guidance. Most¬†companies do offer up that guidance, and analysts create their own¬†models based on those numbers, those line items, and they have their¬†puts and takes to¬†tweak it slightly. But because Alphabet doesn't give¬†those baseline expectations, the¬†likelihood of actual numbers being¬†different than analysts expectations is¬†slightly higher than it would be¬†for other companies. So, the market's reaction¬†is always, I think, generally going to be¬†a little bit sharper than what we might see¬†for a company that does offer standard guidance. Priestley:¬†Yeah,¬†because they have nothing ready¬†to peg their estimates to. Lewis: Yeah. They have¬†the general trend of things¬†and what they can glean from commentary. But¬†very often, you'll see¬†analysts' expectations more or less mirror guidance with¬†slight adjustments. Not having that as a crutch¬†can just add some unpredictability to things. I think that's the way you have to think about it. Priestley:¬†Any other little gems? Lewis: Outside of the¬†numbers, something that caught my eye that I think is a great point, and¬†really underscores the importance¬†of reading company conference calls, and¬†not just relying on the numbers that you see reported¬†and the quick earnings takes you'll see online: Mark Mahaney from¬†RBC Capital Markets¬†in the Q&A¬†section of the call asked this¬†really great question, and I think it points to a looming risk for¬†Alphabet, and I just want to highlight that for listeners. He said, "It¬†looks to me like Google devices are being outsold 10 to 1 or¬†something like that in most homes. It's immaterial now,¬†but you could see you in five years¬†there's a new voice search interaction interface¬†and it's not Google in the home. That¬†could be a real challenge for the company." And¬†he was basically positing, "What are you guys doing about all of the virtual-assistant and smart-home devices?" Priestley:¬†Yeah,¬†great question. Lewis: Yeah. And¬†Sundar Pichai,¬†Google CEO,¬†he gave that generally positive answer,¬†talking about the investments the company is making¬†and how they're working toward voice search, and how they're trying to meet consumers¬†in every situation that they might be using voice search,¬†whether it be phones, TV, homes, cars, whatever. But really, at its core, Mahaney's question is¬†getting at this idea of: Amazon's Echo¬†devices are selling like hotcakes. If the installed base for them,¬†or really any other virtual assistant, gets¬†massive, and consumers start using those devices¬†for the types of things and the purposes that¬†people are generally using Google mobile and¬†desktop search for,¬†what does that do for your business? I don't want to be alarmist with any of this. I am an Alphabet shareholder,¬†I really love the company. But I think he makes a good point. Earlier this month, actually, at an ad industry¬†conference, there was an Amazon¬†VP¬†talking about some of the capabilities¬†and some of the opportunities¬†that Amazon might explore. That led¬†some analysts to speculate that¬†the company might be interested in exploring paid search with its Alexa product. This is not something that is a next-quarter, next-year issue. But over the next five to 10 years,¬†we need to keep an eye on how people are using search, and¬†how people are using home assistants or¬†virtual assistants. Because,¬†if we see that slowly eat into¬†what would otherwise be desktop or mobile search,¬†you have to wonder about how that might¬†impact Google's core business, and really¬†what prints money for them and allows them to fund¬†all of these other projects. Priestley:¬†Yeah. And also, which products they're using. If¬†everybody starts adopting the Google Nest, then they're good. Lewis: Yeah. If people are using Nest or Google¬†Assistant, then yeah, not a huge problem,¬†that will keep them within that ecosystem. If they are using products that don't lean on¬†Google search, and you have platforms that are¬†able to monetize that search,¬†Google might get crowded out a little bit. Again, Google did $26 billion in revenue this quarter. The¬†vast majority of that was online ads. It's a huge market. I think people's more in-depth searching, or more research-based stuff, is¬†always going to be on desktop or mobile. You can only glean so much from audio. But¬†if you want the quick answer on something -- say¬†you want to know who was the fifth president of the United States --¬†you can find that out with a voice search,¬†and not really have to worry about being on mobile or desktop. And that's less impressions for Google Ad Search. So, it's¬†something to keep in mind. Again, this is a five, 10-year risk. But, just,¬†investors, keep an eye on what's going on¬†with the virtual assistant market,¬†because it's something that could impact Alphabet down the road. Priestley:¬†That's really interesting.¬†I will hand the baton back to you.¬†[laughs]¬† Lewis: Oh,¬†you're going to let me wrap up? That's¬†so magnanimous of you.

Apple iPhone 8 Could Feature a Fingerprint Sensor Embedded into the Display GO Apple has patented several other similar methods before Feb 14, 2017 14:22 GMT ¬†¬∑¬† By Alexandra Vaidos ¬†¬∑¬† Share:¬† Last year, we reported that Apple filed a patent application for a fingerprint sensor built into the display and it seems that it wasn‚Äôt the only such feature that the Cupertino giant patented. A new patent shows a method of embedding the fingerprint sensor into the screen. The patent application was filed back in 2014, which means that Apple had plenty of time to perfect the method and it might actually be featured on the iPhone 8. The upcoming iPhone 8 or iPhone X will mark the 10-year anniversary since the first iPhone was released. The smartphone is said to come with major design changes, tiny bezels, and even a slightly curved display. In order to achieve smaller bezels, Apple could very well remove the physical home button and place the fingerprint scanner below the display. The new method can only be used on OLED displays The new patent reveals just how Apple might do that. The smartphone could use infrared emitters and sensors placed alongside the RGB LEDs in an OLED-style display, according to Apple Insider. This would allow the reading of fingerprints through high-resolution touch sensing features. The patent also says that this method can only be used with an OLED display, which suggests that it might be featured on the iPhone 8 since the phone is said to come with such a screen type. The patent is assigned to Apple, but the technology was invented by LuxVue, a company that Apple bought in 2014. However, there‚Äôs no guarantee that Apple will actually develop the new technology, considering that the company has also patented two other methods. One of the past patents revealed a method of placing a sensor behind the screen and reading fingerprints through gaps in the space. In addition, there‚Äôs the option of using ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, namely Qualcomm's Snapdragon Sense ID, which utilizes ultrasonic waves instead. The iPhone 8 is also rumored to come with edge-to-edge display, wide-range wireless charging, and a bigger battery. #Apple#iPhone 8#Fingerprint sensor#OLED display#Touch ID subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related ¬†¬∑¬† Hot right now ¬†¬∑¬† Latest news iPhone 8 to Squeeze 5.5-Inch iPhone Plus Battery in a 4.7-Inch Body iPhone 8 with Dual-Edge Display, Slim Bezels Imagined in Concept Video Apple Reportedly Paid Samsung $4.3 Billion for More iPhone OLED Displays Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature Iris Scanner Apple Edges Out Samsung to Become Top Global Smartphone Vendor in Q4 Microsoft Extends Support for Original Windows 10 Version DebConf18 Will Be Hosted in Hsinchu, Taiwan, as First Debian Conference in Asia Moto G5 and G5 Plus Press Renders and Specs Revealed by Spanish Retailer Apple‚Äôs iPhone 8 to Ditch Home Button in Favor of Virtual Capacitive Buttons No New Windows 10 Cumulative Updates Coming This Month After All Apple Edges Out Samsung to Become Top Global Smartphone Vendor in Q4 Microsoft‚Äôs February Security Updates to Launch in March ¬†¬† Apple patent application for fingerprint scanner into the display new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple‚Äôs iPhone 8 to Ditch Home Button in Favor of Virtual Capacitive Buttons more on: Apple i softpedia¬Æ ¬† ¬†¬†Like 202K ¬†¬†¬†+1 56K ¬† ¬†¬†Follow 13K ¬© 2001-2017 Softpedia.

One of the benefits of working for a big company is that you get a say in the type of computer you wish to use. I use a Lenovo ThinkPad, while many of my colleagues use MacBook Airs ‚Äì a decision that requires an opinion piece of its own to understand. Some folk choose Mac minis. They'll take their Mac mini out of their locker and carry it to their 'hot desk' for the day. At the end of each day, they'll unplug it and return it to their locker. I know, it's mind-boggling ‚Äì and in more ways than you might think. For one, it has been 854 days since Apple's last Mac mini update, or more than two years. In and of itself, the Mac mini's age isn't a problem, as you should generally be able to get at least three years out of a decent computer, and often many more. But what you won't see on any Apple spec sheet is the fact that its 'latest' Mac minis use Intel's 4th-generation 'Haswell' Core processors. These actually launched in July 2014, making the technology at the heart of the device positively ancient, at least in computer chip time. These processors are significantly less efficient and powerful than current-gen Intel CPUs, and even pale in comparison to the 5th-gen kit found in the seemingly abandoned MacBook Air. Compared to the 6th- and 7th-gen kit found in the latest 13-inch MacBook Pro? Don't get me started. Related: Intel Core i processors explained At ¬£479, the Mac mini is the cheapest way to join the excellent macOS ecosystem; even the most expensive Mac mini model 'only' costs ¬£949, which is less than you'll pay for a new MacBook Pro. Yet given its fossilised internals, you won't be making the most of what macOS Sierra has to offer. You don‚Äôt get the benefits of a great touchpad, brilliant screen or backlit keyboard. You don‚Äôt get processors powerful enough to do multimedia task particularly well, and the cheapest model also comes with just 4GB of RAM, plus you have to attach numerous cables to get the benefit of its desktop form factor. One argument in favour of the device is that it features more ports than all the MacBooks. This is true: it does have a pair of ThunderBolt/DisplayPort connectors and an HDMI port, along with four USB ports and an SD card slot. However, it can‚Äôt output to a 4K monitor at more than a juddery 30Hz, making its high-res capability useless for many people. It‚Äôs lumped with slow hard disks in all but the most expensive model, which receives a slightly faster ‚ÄúFusion‚Äù drive with a bit of solid state cache. But there‚Äôs no high-performance storage anywhere to be seen. What really irks me here is that the Mac mini has the potential to be a fantastic machine. Nowadays, you can quite happily squeeze a proper quad-core Intel processor into a compact PC chassis, rather than the piddly U-series dual cores in the Mac mini. Intel‚Äôs Skull Canyon range of PCs, the stylish HP Pavilion Wave and the impressive Zotac Zbox Magnus, are but three examples of what can be achieved in a compact space. To dive a bit deeper, let's use the Pavilion Wave as our example. It's a complete PC that includes a built-in speaker, high-quality design, and components that are substantially faster than the Mac mini. Yet it costs, at most, ¬£730 for 128GB of SSD storage, a 1TB hard disk and a proper quad-core i5 processor from Intel‚Äôs sixth-gen range. Plus, it can output 4K at a full 60Hz. All this value from HP, a company that's aggressively pursuing Apple levels of flashy lifestyle kit. Against the odds, it's actually succeeding. Windows 10 may lag behind macOS in terms of ease of use, but HP's PC shows what‚Äôs possible in hardware terms. If Apple simply refreshed the Mac mini this year with the latest 7th-gen Intel Core processors, I might see a reason to buy one again. But what the mini really needs is a complete overhaul ‚Äì a new design and components that match what consumers expect in 2017. Oh, and a nice marketing push from Apple to help me feel better about parting with my hard earned cash. Maybe a 2017 Mac mini update is in the works and being kept remarkably well under wraps. Given that so many people prefer macOS and the Apple brand ‚Äì and that the Mac mini is, in terms of computers, the easiest way to get on board with these things ‚Äì it would make sense. Yet given the complete lack of rumours surrounding a Mac mini refresh, I fear for the future of this compact machine. It's a shame because, ultimately, it means that Apple is content with giving you a half-arsed user experience, undermining its great software by continuing to flog slow and outdated hardware. That's why, this Valentine's Day, I've fallen out of love with Apple. Come autumn, I hope Apple helps me open my heart again. WATCH: Laptop buying guide Do you agree with Michael?

I kept it until if could no longer process my yearly tax returns. But the new iMacs had gotten to be more expensive than I wanted to buy. My mom bought my first one as my birthday/Xmas present. A friend who has worked at Apple for years told me about the then, new Mac Mini. I wasted no time buying one. I am now on my second one, the last 2009 model. It may not be the fastest computer on the block, but it works for me most of the time, with some minor disruptions. I love me my Minis. So far, I have heard the 2010 Mini's are the end of the line of Minis. I refuse to accept that. I don't like laptops and their fragility. I also like that should anyone break in and want to steal my computer, they would likely walk right by my Mac mini, as most people don't even know what it is. As much as I like Apple products - I hate their pricing and I am on a budget for electronics, all which have a limited life. I don't know what I will do if Apple does not either continue the Mini, or come up with something equal or better at a lower price than their other computers. My hope is that Apple is not just content selling to smaller businesses, or those who have a lot more money to spend on electronics. Please, please, please. - either bring back my the MacMinis or, at least something equal or better at a fair market price for the budget minded! I want to stay loyal to Apple and I really don't like PC's. I had to use those at work for years and hated them. matt February 15, 2017, 4:42 am There was a recent article on the web that explained apples limited choices for mobile processors. You got to put part of the blame on intel. I'd love to see a Mac mini with a better video then intel , but intel would sue the crap out of you if you sold an i5 with nvidia graphics Edward Lock February 15, 2017, 6:30 am Why buy an overpriced Lemon like "MAC", when you can have a more capable lemon cream pie PC for less than 1/2 the price.WTF?...........puffy cuteness and esoteric purpleness, yea real useful. Bob Forsberg February 15, 2017, 7:35 am MacOS is my system of choice, but Apple's hardware is, as you say "ancient" by computer standards. Apple has transformed into a hand held device company, ignoring those of us using desktop systems. Since Apple lags in hardware manufacturing, they should license MacOS to run on superior and often refreshed, high-end PC hardware. We miss you Steve. itsallgonepearshaped February 15, 2017, 9:05 am I just bought myself an Intel NUC 6th Gen box. Smaller, lighter and faster than my old mac mini server. I'm moving away from MacOS back to windows due to the lack of investment and continually disappointing and constrained hardware. I will keep my Macbook pro for a couple more years as it's one a year old. Not sure about by my iMac 5k, it's a beautiful machine, but runs Windows under bootcamp(which I need for work) like a dysfunctional child. Alex Walsh February 15, 2017, 11:09 am Hackintosh a Gigabyte Brix? From a quick look Sierra is achievable. That's a proper Mac Mini :) Michael Passingham February 15, 2017, 12:24 pm Yeah, Apple is specific about the chips it wants. The most recent MacBook Pros used last-gen Skylake chips because the Kaby Lake chips apple uses (normally with Iris Graphics on board) weren't ready yet. But, all the same, I do think Apple could slap an SSD in, load it up with some more RAM and upgrade to a Skylake chip and lots of people would be happy. jheartney February 15, 2017, 1:20 pm Got tired of waiting for Apple to sell a reasonable mini-tower; I'm building a Hackintosh. (Macintosh owner since 1990; had more Macs than I can count. Apple's innovative DNA died with Steve, and now they're just a money factory.) Roger Randall February 15, 2017, 11:12 pm Um, there are three generations of Minis beyond the 2010 models. 2011, 2012 and the current (crippled) models. I have 4, one is a quad-core i7 that is pretty fast. You can still buy good used models (prices are going up though) and parts are still available. SCSZ February 16, 2017, 12:58 am I've seen that. But I am hoping Apple will change it's mind or make something better which won't cost to much. I don't want to spend money on a later model Mini and then find out a new one is coming out. I will wait 6 months or so, and see what happens.

The ad gives us a glimpse into Apple‚Äôs version of the popular Carpool Karaoke with James Corden which debuted on The Late Late Show. Apple first announced its plan for the show last year, with details slowly becoming available as time goes on. Today‚Äôs ad shows off the concept of rotating hosts which include¬†John Legend, Will Smith, James Corden, Blake Shelton, and Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal. Here‚Äôs the list of confirmed celebrities on board: Featuring James Corden, Will Smith, Billy Eichner, Metallica, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Ariana Grande, Seth MacFarlane, Chelsea Handler, Blake Shelton, Michael Strahan, John Cena, Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, and many more. The plot of the show seems to be the same as Corden‚Äôs version, with artists driving around singing popular tunes, talking to each other, and doing various activities. As previously noted, James Corden will not be hosting the show, but will be an executive producer for it. Apple plans on releasing 16 episodes, which will be at least 30 minutes in length. Corden will continue to do his version of the¬†series, but will be limited to one episode per month. It‚Äôs still unclear when Apple plans on releasing the new episodes, aside from ‚Äúcoming soon to Apple Music.‚Äù Apple‚Äôs description of the show reads: Based on the segment that has become a global, viral video sensation on The Late Late Show with James Corden, the new CARPOOL KARAOKE series features 16 celebrity pairings riding along in a car together as they sing tunes from their personal playlists and surprise fans who don‚Äôt expect to see big stars belting out tunes one lane over.

Verizon announced on Monday that it's "rolling out a new unlimited data plan called Verizon Unlimited." If you make the switch, the plan also comes with a new phone. The plan comes with unlimited data, talk, and text all for $80 month. Available phones include the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy S7 and others. Before you can get your hands on the new phone you have to drop your other carrier and transfer your phone number to Verizon. Wochit Tech Build a Raspberry Pi Laptop With Official Screen, 3D-Printed Case Geek.com reports that A new portable Pi project uses the official 7-inch touch-screen to create a mini laptop for on-the-go users. Thingiverse user ‚Äúsurferboy‚Äù published blueprints for building the compact computer, which includes the Raspberry Pi Foundation display and an RII mini wireless keyboard and touchpad. Wochit Tech Verizon reveals $80 unlimited data plan - finally! Verizon has finally realized that customers want one thing and one thing only - unlimited data. The wireless carrier announced it will launch a new introductory plan on Monday that offers unlimited data, talk time and texts for $80 per month for the first line when you select automatic payments. Unlimited data, has been increasingly difficult to come by as carriers have raised prices or ditched the plans entirely. Both Verizon and AT&T ended their unlimited offers in 2010. Wochit Tech SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO The iPhone 8 is shaping up to be the most exciting and controversial smartphones of 2017 and new leaks will only increase this‚Ä¶ Following news that the iPhone 8 will carry an asking price in excess of $1,000/¬£800 (whether that is ‚Äústarting from‚Äù or ‚Äúup to‚Äù remains unclear), we now have a better idea of how Apple will justify this: more of its functionality will be exclusive than we expected. According to Mac Otakara, Apple has decided the iPhone 8 will be the only 2017 iPhone to integrate wireless charging. This contradicts previous reports which claimed the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus (incremental upgrades on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus) would also hop on the wireless bandwagon.¬† ¬© Provided by Forbes Media LLC Apple iPhone 8 concepts based on leaks shows how wireless charging could look. Image credit: Veniamin Geskin Apple iPhone 8 concepts based on leaks shows how wireless charging could look. Image credit: Veniamin Geskin For the latter two models Mac Otakara claims Apple will have a workaround. It will sell separate wireless chargers for them made by Luxshare, the Chinese company behind the inductive charging in the Apple Watch. These are unlikely to be compatible with previous iPhones without additional accessories, such as wireless charging cases. There is more bad news too as Mac Otakara says the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus will not include the Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adaptor supplied with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. There will be no Lightning to USB Type-C adaptor either, Apple‚Äôs preferred standard for its MacBook range. No reason for this was given. Understanding Apple‚Äôs 2017 iPhones So what is going on here and what should you think? To get a handle on it, it helps to understand Apple‚Äôs strategy for 2017. The company will release three premium iPhones: the iPhone 8 (some say it will be called the ‚ÄòiPhone X‚Äô), the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. The former will be a radical redesign to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone while the latter two will retain the same designs launched with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in 2014. ¬© Provided by Forbes Media LLC Concept render of the much rumoured 2017 10th anniversary iPhone 8 alongside iterative iPhone 7S models. Concept image credit: Veniamin Geskin Concept render of the much rumoured 2017 10th anniversary iPhone 8 alongside iterative iPhone 7S models. Concept image credit: Veniamin Geskin Should Apple nail the iPhone 8 design it is likely to fly off shelves ‚Äì even if models start at $1,000, given top of the range iPhone 7 Plus models are already close to this figure ‚Äì and help boost Apple‚Äôs profit margins which (while huge compared to rivals) have been falling in recent years. Of course by making the iPhone 8 the only model with integrated wireless charging, the chances of its success would only increase. But should you trust Mac Otakara? On the one hand the site is famed for its big exclusives. Notably last year it was first to report Apple would remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (I had theorised it much earlier, but that was speculation). But Mac Otakara has been wrong in the past and its poor English language translations often undermine it. For example this time its reference to 5-inch iphones is a clear error.¬† Consequently my advice is always to keep calm until Tim Cook is standing on stage with the new models in September. Yes you can expect three premium iPhones, yes you can expect one to be a radical departure from previous generations, and yes you can expect that model to be most expensive iPhone ever made. Arguably the stakes have never been higher, but it‚Äôs also nice to see Apple taking risks again‚Ä¶ Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Though not definitive in its relation to the iPhone 8, the move has provided even more fuel to the rumours surrounding the inclusion of wireless charging on an iPhone for some time. While Apple has generally proven to be slower in adopting industry-wide standards and features until it feels a rightful need to do so (for example, including NFC on its devices years after competitors), this hasn't stopped its fans from wishing for the inclusion of newer features found on competing phones and the ensuing rumours regarding the next model of the iPhone including them. One of the most prominent features in this regard has been wireless charging, which some competing phones have had for years. This move may present the most tangible evidence for Apple's intention to add the technology to its devices. Alongside the company's joining of the WPC, several experts have identified the likelihood of the nifty convenience being included in the next iteration of the iPhone. Apple currently only offers one device with wireless charging and that's the Apple Watch. As such, signing up to the WPC may simply be an attempt to shore up its position with regard to the feature as found on its wearable but Apple's increasing interest in the field, alongside its growing expertise definitely has insiders hopeful.

No, scratch that - they'd just be happy with the NFC, actually. The group of banks has amended its application to just focus soley on the NFC function, removing the collective negotiation request on Apple which the ACCC deemed "potentially detrimental to the public". Open NFC access has gained the support of retailers, as well as competitors. "The applicants flatly reject Apple's unsupported assertions that the application is about an objection to the fees that Apple wishes to impose, rather than NFC access," the banks said in a statement. "Apple's conspiracy theories about 'Trojan horse fees' are similarly dismissed by the applicants as fantasy." "Apple recorded over $US7 billion in services revenue, which includes Apple Pay fees, from their customers in the last 3 months of 2016 alone, and hopes to double that over the next four years," the statement continues, "With their services business set to become the size of a standalone Fortune 100 company this year, Apple is the leading expert on deriving fee revenues from iPhone users, not the applicants." Payments specialist and spokesperson on behalf of the applicants, Lance Blockley, said the banks are ready, willing, and able to participate in Apple Pay, alongside being able to offer their customers their own mobile wallet products. "This application has always been about consumer choice, and allowing competition between the makers of mobile wallets to offer the best products and features they can to determine which mobile wallet consumers will use," Blockley says, "The applicants want to put up their digital offerings head to head with Apple Pay, and let the market and individual consumers decide which best suits their needs" According to Blockley, open access to the NFC function "as occurs on the world's most popular and widely installed mobile operating system Android "is important not just to the applicants and mobile payments "but to a range of NFC-powered functions across many sectors and uses". "This has global implications for the use of NFC on smart phones," Blockley says. Blockley reinforces that the permission to jointly negotiate with Apple "is not an attempt to delay Apple Pay" from entering the Australian market, stating the banks understand and expect that Apple Pay would be offered to their customers alongside open access to the NFC function. "Any delay or frustration will be as a result of Apple refusing to negotiate," Blockley says. "Apple is not a bank or a credit card scheme, and Apple cannot on their own complete a mobile payment. Nor are the applicants manufacturers of mobile phones ‚Äì both parties need each other to bring strong mobile payment offerings to the market." The full submission can be read here. Comments Almost Guest Feb 14, 2017, 12:35pm I would be happy if there was not one more entity taking a cut of my transactions.

Reply -1 Aleph Ruehl @alephruehl Feb 14, 2017, 3:29pm It may be your phone but it's their software which they are free to amend within reason.

Reply 0 klaw @klaw Feb 15, 2017, 10:45am I'm pretty sure he's alluding to the fact that ANZ are paying Apple a fee to offer those services, which are then passed on to ANZ's customers in the form of higher fees and charges for their various services. Apple's terms make it impossible to charge customers directly every time they use Apple Pay, but you can be sure they're not just doing for free out of the goodness of their hearts. Reply 1 mosesvii @mosesvii Feb 15, 2017, 2:12pm I moved to ANZ simply for Apple Pay. Screw Westpac and the rest of them. I compared the rates and fees and found I would save money with them anyway. I don't take a wallet with me anywhere now. It sits with a license in my car.

I've been using commbank's Tap and Pay app since 2015, close to two years, on my Android phone. But hey, Apple pay has fingerprint recognition, which I'm sure was a feature worth the 18 month wait. Reply 0 klaw @klaw Feb 14, 2017, 2:05pm Since we're having a contest..... CommBank were actually pretty late to the party (March 2015), and their implementation of Tap and Pay is arguably the worst of all banks that currently offer it. CUA launched Tap and Pay in July 2014, and I still rate it more highly than CBA's clunky app. That said, Android Pay is much better than both of them, for my usage. Reply 1 ross_co @ross_co Feb 14, 2017, 2:42pm I'm a new CBA member, so maybe the app has updated since you have used it, but it's actually really good, has finger print fingerprint authentication and is pretty quick to use. Android pay isn't compatible with my debit/credit cards unfortunately. Reply 0 klaw @klaw Feb 14, 2017, 4:06pm It's better since the fingerprint authorisation, but using Tap and Pay via the app is pretty inconvenient since it still requires a PIN. When you come to make a payment, you have to: a) Wake/unlock phone b) Open app c) Authorise with fingerprint d) Select Tap and Pay e) Enter PIN f) Place phone next to terminal (You can reduce this by one step by using the Tap and Pay 1x1 widget shortcut) All of those actions require the user to be paying attention the whole time, to hit the touch targets and complete the operation correctly. So you either hold up those waiting behind you, or you have to prepare for it beforehand. Compared to Android Pay: a) Wake/unlock phone b) Place phone next to terminal This can all be done in one smooth motion if you have a fingerprint reader. IMO CommBank would be doing all their members a massive favour if they dropped Tap and Pay from their app and just rolled out Android Pay. Their app would be easier to keep updated, and everyone would have a better payment experience. Reply 0 backfromthedead @backfromthedead Feb 14, 2017, 5:57pm Westpac with Samsung phone. No need to wake phone, just hover over terminal and you're on your way. Been using it for two years and I couldn't live without it. In fact it's so good, I won't get any other brand phone. Reply 0 klaw @klaw Feb 15, 2017, 7:47am That's not secure enough for my liking. I'm happy to have to wake the phone to authorise the payment, considering that it takes zero time and only a fraction more effort. Also, it would lock me into using both Samsung and Westpac, neither of which appeal to me. Last edited February 15, 2017 10:45 am Reply 0 backfromthedead @backfromthedead Feb 15, 2017, 12:04pm Yeah, fair enough. I wish you could use other phones as well with Westpac. Security wise, it's okay and if any money goes missing, the bank will reimburse you.... But that takes a week. Other than that, I've never had any problems.

On the other hand, if I double-press the home button on my iPhone using one of the fingers which has been scanned, the phone is unlocked and ready to pay before I even get it out of my pocket. If it's lost/stolen, no one can use it to make payments. Convenience + security. Reply 1 backfromthedead @backfromthedead Feb 15, 2017, 3:23pm I think you can set it with pin or finger print but I couldn't be bothered with that and yes, I suppose if someone stole my phone they could use it. The same could happen to my key card. That has no security so if anyone stole my wallet, they could use my card to purchase anything provided it wasn't over a hundred dollars. Speaking of which, ANZ sent out a new card for some bloke that use to rent the place I'm at and in the letter it said the pin hasn't changed and it was good to go. I could of used his card with pay wave but being the good bloke I am, I threw it in the bin. Reply 0 The5thElephant @the5thelephant Feb 16, 2017, 1:13pm You don't even need to double press the home button, the iPhone automatically detects if it is near an NFC payment device and opens up your wallet to the default card. I just tap the phone with my finger on the home button and it works perfectly. Reply 0 darren @darren Feb 16, 2017, 9:37am Westpac are dicks or their developers are idiots. Originally, NFC chips had a secure bit in it you couldn't use unelss the OEM (like Samsung) gave you the access keys. Google realised this is stupid and made it possible to entirely emulate the secure bit in software. This was baked into Android years ago. This allows any phone to make payments. Every time I've contacted Westpac about getting with the times they've said "nah, we are sticking with this". Surely it would be easier to must make the app instead of having to add in the keys for every phone Samsung ever release. Reply 0 backfromthedead @backfromthedead Feb 16, 2017, 10:15am I think why they only use Samsung phones is because they are the most abundant Android phone in the market and it isn't worth their time or money to make a system for all Android phones. Yes, Westpac are dicks but I use Samsung phones so it'll do me for the interim. Reply 0 ross_co @ross_co Feb 15, 2017, 10:00am Not gonna lie, that sounds a lot easier. Reply 1 mosesvii @mosesvii Feb 15, 2017, 2:16pm 100% agree. Apple Pay is the same. Just double press the home button and place next to the terminal. It's hilarious to me that banks think they'll have better apps than either Apple or Google. Banks are notoriously slow at updating their own apps plus they're UI is clunky. Reply 1 darren @darren Feb 16, 2017, 9:34am As the comments in this thread indicate, a heap of banks look like they have perfectly workable payment solutions already. Reply 0 The5thElephant @the5thelephant Feb 16, 2017, 1:15pm You don't even need to double-press the home button, the iPhone will wake from sleep when it detects it is near an NFC payment device and go straight to your default Apple Pay card. Just rest your finger on the Touch-ID sensor. Reply 0 tonyintsv @tonyintsv Feb 15, 2017, 3:46pm I use my phone to tap and pay all the time and don't have to do any of that. unlock the phone (finger on the scanner on the back) open the app (almost instant) tap pay enter pin done. Are you really that petty that the extra 10 seconds to open the app is causing you injury? Reply -1 klaw @klaw Feb 15, 2017, 6:09pm @tonyintsv You just listed the same steps as me. So yes, you do "have to do all that." You can't open the app, tap pay, and enter the PIN, without looking at the screen the whole time and paying at least a little bit of attention to the process. And I'm not saying that it's difficult - it's just nowhere near as convenient, or as eyes-free, as other solutions because it skips several of those steps. Reply 0 tonyintsv @tonyintsv Feb 16, 2017, 8:08am So you are that petty. That's all you had to say. Edit. And weren't you saying in an earlier post you want it to be MORE secure? So you want more security with less inconvenience? Petty and petty again... Last edited February 16, 2017 8:12 am Reply -3 klaw @klaw Feb 16, 2017, 11:16am Android Pay's native solution is equally secure (requires the phone to be unlocked), but since it has fewer steps it's faster, easier to use, and doesn't require you to look at the screen at all. That's objectively a better user experience, and I don't think it's petty at all, but have it your way. Reply 0 ross_co @ross_co Feb 16, 2017, 11:23am What has being petty got to do with it? If that was the case we all would stick you using cards and not phones to make payments. It's about making the transaction as fast and secure as can be, so removing 10 seconds from a transaction is a good thing. Reply 1 The5thElephant @the5thelephant Feb 16, 2017, 1:17pm It's not about being petty, it's about saving more time than I would using my card in my wallet. With Apple Pay (and presumably Google Pay) you just tap your device, you don't even need to wake it up or open an app, just hold your finger on the sensor for confirmation. That is WAY faster and more convenient than what you described. Reply 0 darren @darren Feb 16, 2017, 9:24am NAB work the same way. Unlock is all that is required. After the payment goes through you hit "done" and the pay screen goes away. I guess that could count as an extra step? Reply 0 dknigs @dknigs Feb 15, 2017, 11:59pm Is it quicker than passing by phone over an nfc terminal with a locked screen and authenticating the purchase with my fingerprint?

Reply -1 cj_johnson @cj_johnson Feb 16, 2017, 12:04am Or maybe people shouldn't be whining about how the big 4 aren't licking Apple's balls? They have solutions already. Just because it doesn't cover your precious favourite brand doesn't mean that they are in the wrong. Do you know what a company forcing all payment methods be theirs is? A monopoly. But apple could be the biggest monopoly on the planet and you wouldn't give a shit. Because your team won. Go you! You win the top prize: the chance to experience what it's like to have one company controlling all prices and passing the costs on to you!

All Apple need to do is find a way to get you to deposit money with them and market it in a way to make sheeple think it's the best idea since sliced bread. Next thing Apple will be telling us is they invented blockchain... Reply 0 klaw @klaw Feb 15, 2017, 10:48am They don't even need to do that. They just need to make it possible to pay via NFC from your iTunes account - simply pulling money from the user's bank account or credit card into iTunes, and then passing it on to the merchant. I honestly can't understand why they're not already doing that, or why the likes of Paypal haven't integrated a Tap and Pay solution.

That whole list includes no more than ~20% of Australians credit/debit cards. The other 80% are associated with banks that don't participate in Apple Pay, and most of them are part of the court action this article is about. Reply 1 mdolley @mdolley Feb 14, 2017, 3:35pm This still seems like a dangerous precedent to me...

Reply 1 g-man @g-man Feb 14, 2017, 4:58pm That's such a bad comparison. They want access to use the nfc chip. I see no where asking for access to iOS software. Just hardware layer access.

The point of these mobile wallets is convenience and for maximum convenience I want a single app that has deep OS and hardware integration and that's only going to come from the OS and/or hardware vendor. *obviously that single app has to be demonstrably secure and provide at least the basic functionality I need for the convenience pay off, which I think Google Wallet & Apple Pay do (Microsoft Wallet too, but it's US only). Reply 1 klaw @klaw Feb 14, 2017, 4:24pm As a consumer, you should always want choice. Even if some of your options aren't very good, you can exercise your right as a user to avoid a bad option and choose another, based on your personal criteria. Not wanting to have choice is simply asking to be held hostage by a monopoly vendor. However benevolent that vendor might currently seem, user lock-in is a demonstrably bad thing and should be avoided where possible. Last edited February 14, 2017 4:24 pm Reply 0 horsesauce @horsesauce Feb 14, 2017, 4:53pm I would have some choice through selecting a bank and a phone. BUT, in my opinion and experience, choice at an app level is just going to be a choice between 50 imperfect solutions and I'll end up with 5 different apps and have to pick the right one for each situation and none of them will give the full end to end solution that the OS & hardware manufacturer can provide. I understand what your saying but the whole point of this for me is convenience, I want a single point of entry, I want hardware level integration (e.g. an NFC tap prompts for payment, rather than me opening an app), I want in-app and web payments through the same system. In terms of lock-in, if a phone platform or bank is no longer agreeable then I'll switch to another, and if non are then I'll go back credit cards and manual payments. Reply 0 backfromthedead @backfromthedead Feb 14, 2017, 6:02pm You don't open an app with Westpac and Samsung phone. Just wave phone over terminal. You don't even have to wake the phone.

Reply 0 klaw @klaw Feb 14, 2017, 4:20pm @mdolley: That's not a very apt analogy, because in your scenario, more than half of the "cars on the road" already allow access to "the autopilot system."

I had access to my AMEX via apple pay again within an hour, as soon as they had issued a new card number and a week before I received it. Commbank though? A week for a new card, and another week until it asked for a pin for pay pass purchases above $100. Super secure. Reply 1 OriginalFranz Guest Feb 15, 2017, 6:50pm If the australian banks want something this bad, they're obviously up to no good. I'm with Apple on this one, australian banks are not to be trusted.

This is the most blind sheeple comment I have ever seen. They are businesses. They exist to make money. They want to be able to use the NFC chip without paying Apple shitloads of money. You know, just like on Android where any app you allow can use the NFC chip. Reply 0 klaw @klaw Feb 16, 2017, 11:24am Apple have locked everyone else out of the NFC for "security reasons" but that security conveniently means that Apple Pay the only game in town on their OS, and they can leverage their customer base to force banks to give up a portion of their interchange fees, forming a sweet ongoing revenue stream for them at the bank's expense. But sure, it must all be a scam by the Australian banks, and Apple are pure as the driven snow. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

And for his part, Apple CEO Tim Cook is a fan of the technology. In an interview with The Independent, Cook talked about the potential of virtual reality tech versus AR. While Cook isn‚Äôt much of a VR adopter ‚Äî¬†he describes the technology as something that ‚Äúcloses the world out‚Äù ‚Äî the Apple CEO is more enthused on the potential of AR as a platform. ‚ÄúI regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone, we don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it‚Äôs for everyone,‚Äù Cook told The Independent. ‚ÄúI think AR is that big, it‚Äôs huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives and be entertaining. I view AR like I view the silicon here in my iPhone, it‚Äôs not a product per se, it‚Äôs a core technology,‚Äù Cook said. Related Stories Apple Joins Wireless Power Consortium, Hinting Toward Wireless Charging In Next iPhone New Apple iPhone 8 Could Feature Wireless Charging The statement echoes past AR endorsements from Cook. The Apple CEO has described AR as a field where Apple thinks ‚Äúthere's great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity‚Äù in a quarterly conference call last year. As for those opportunities, speculation has focused on where Apple might eventually integrate AR technology. Apple is reportedly working on its own AR glasses with German optics company Carl Zeiss. The high-end version of the upcoming iPhone 8 is also rumored to include 3D-sensing technology that could potentially be used for AR. 3D sensors can detect a phone‚Äôs surrounding environment and use that data for applications like face detection. Apple‚Äôs early push into AR also places the company onto a side in the AR/VR divide. Companies like Apple and Microsoft ‚Äî¬†through its HoloLens tech ‚Äî¬†have focused on AR investment and development, while competitors like Samsung and Google have pushed VR applications through add-ons like the Samsung Gear VR and Daydream View. The focus makes sense with Apple‚Äôs likely larger goals. While companies such as Samsung want to complement their existing smartphones with VR, Apple likely wants the upside that comes from building its own AR ecosystem. The timeline for when Apple AR will roll out remains unclear, but it‚Äôll be interesting to see how the company integrates the technology with the iPhone or elsewhere.

The topics I‚Äôm covering will include: How to choose a laptop from hundreds of possibilities What software to use in place of MacOS-only favorites How your iPhone, iPad, and the rest of Apple‚Äôs ecosystem can still fit in Welcome to the vast world of PC gaming What it‚Äôs like in PC-land, and whether I'd return to the Mac Desperate times Despair drove me to switch from a Mac to a PC. I‚Äôve used Apple computers since college, starting with¬†a boxy, wee¬†Apple Mac Classic II¬†in a computer lab. It had a low-resolution monochrome display. And a floppy drive. Soon I bought a¬†used¬†PowerBook 100. From then on, I was committed, steadily working my way through PowerBooks, iBooks, MacBooks, a MacBook Air and MacBook Pros.¬† Fast-forward to now:¬†I‚Äôve come to rely heavily on Apple-exclusive software that syncs data with my iPad Pro, iPhone SE and my current computer‚Äîa 13-inch 2015 MacBook Pro Retina with 8GB of RAM, a 2.9GHz Intel Core i5 processor, and a 512GB SSD. My 400-film and 11,000-media collection lives in iTunes.¬†I‚Äôm in deep.¬† Apple This was my first Apple laptop, the PowerBook 100. Why I‚Äôm bailing on Macs My beef with Apple is the lack of polish I‚Äôve been seeing in the software over the past few years (don‚Äôt get me started on the state of iTunes), and the amount of trouble I‚Äôve had personally with the hardware since investing $2,700 for my current laptop. My workflow has been plagued by graphical glitches, slowdowns, and occasional refusal on the part of my ports to recognize external storage media. At times, my MacBook Pro has outright refused to boot. Heck, I couldn‚Äôt get it to format an SD card if my life depended on it. Reinstalling MacOS has done nothing to sort out these issues, nor has restoring my system from a Time Machine backup. Having paid extra for AppleCare, I‚Äôve taken in my MacBook Pro several times to be serviced. A few months ago, an Apple tech replaced the entire bottom half of my computer with a new one‚Äîit cost less than hunting down an issue with the laptop‚Äôs logic board, I was told. And yet, the thing still refuses to fulfill Apple‚Äôs promise of ‚Äòit just works.‚Äô Seamus Bellamy My current workstation setup: all Apple, all of the time. The experience has left me frustrated enough to be willing to step into the unknown and see how the other side lives.¬†It‚Äôs a sentiment echoed by a lot of folks online of late, amid concerns that Apple, as a company, has lost its way. Apple once catered to creatives‚Äîhardcore power users in film and music production, desktop publishing, and other artistic endeavors. They valued the company‚Äôs hardware for its performance and ease of use. But the last update to the company‚Äôs iconic Mac Pro desktop was years ago. The company‚Äôs MacBook Pro laptop line saw years of underwhelming incremental updates before being given a serious overhaul a few months ago. If the feedback from professional reviewers and everyday users like you are to be believed, however, the release of Apple‚Äôs latest laptops have done more to aggravate consumers than excite them in the way the company was once known for. Having done away with all ports save one for headphones and a few holes for Thunderbolt 3/Displayport 1.2 and USB-C connections, owners of Apple‚Äôs latest have been forced to invest in a forest of dongles so they can continue to use their trusty peripherals. Also, the processing power of these new portable rigs is underwhelming when compared to similarly priced Windows 10 hardware, which is salt rubbed into an already raw wound for many Apple aficionados. It's time to switch. I don‚Äôt yet know where this journey will take me, but by the end, you and I both will have a well-informed opinion on whether it‚Äôs worth it.

Credit: Peter Sayer More like this This year's iPhones expected to get wireless charging I don‚Äôt expect Energous wireless charging in iPhone 8 Why you plug gadgets into the wall like a Neanderthal Video Review: Huawei's Mate 9 gives good value for the price Apple has joined the consortium behind the Qi wireless charging system, supercharging rumors that owners of future iPhones could live tangle-free. Last week, a financial analyst claimed Apple will release three new iPhones with wireless charging capabilities this year, reviving an on-again, off-again rumor about the next-generation iPhone's capabilities. The appearance of Apple's name on the membership list of the Wireless Power Consortium, Qi's creator, over the last week adds credence to that rumor. Its name was not on the list cached by Google's search engine last Tuesday. "After several years of increasing rumor, Apple‚Äôs membership with the Wireless Power Consortium points strongly to the expectation that the next iPhone will include wireless charging technology," said Vicky Yussuff, an analyst at market watcher IHS Technology. Don't expect too much, though: That's pretty much what IHS analysts said about the last iPhone, too. In fact, Apple's membership of the WPC may have nothing to do with phones. The magnetic charging adapter supplied with the Apple Watch will charge Qi devices (although the Watch itself is programmed not to work with just any Qi charger, only those supplied or approved by Apple) so membership may just be a delayed recognition of that usage. Nine in 10 consumers want wireless charging on their next phone, according to Yussuff. The technology is now so widely adopted that it's no longer something Apple can ignore, she added. IHS expects around 350 million wireless-chargeable devices to ship this year in a market largely driven by Samsung Electronics, which has included the capability in its top-of-the-range phones since the launch of the Galaxy S6 in 2015. Samsung also sells wireless charging covers for the older S4 and S5. In fact, Samsung included not one but two wireless charging systems in its S6 and S7 phones: Qi and the rival Powermat technology from the Power Matters Alliance. The PMA has since merged with another wireless charging consortium, the Alliance for Wireless Power (AW4P) to form the Airfoil Alliance. That organization does not list Apple among its members, however. Samsung has put off its next phone launch until late March, while Apple is not expected to announce new models until September. Later this month, though, mobile phone manufacturers will gather in Barcelona for the Mobile World Congress. Yussuff expects the show will see at least one major phone maker unveil a new device with wireless charging.

"Carpool Karaoke" is coming to Apple Music, but James Corden ‚Äî the "Late Late Show" host who put the segment on the map ‚Äî will let celebrities ride shotgun. In a star-studded trailer for the new series, famous faces will be matched up to sing along for the ride, including Billy Eichner with Metallica, John Cena with Shaquille O'Neal, John Legend with Alicia Keys and Taraji P. Henson, Seth MacFarlane with Ariana Grande, Chelsea Handler with Blake Shelton and Michael Strahan with Jeff Gordon. Corden does make an appearance in the trailer along with Will Smith ‚Äî and yes there is also a marching band performing "Gettin' Jiggy With It." James Corden's 'Carpool Karaoke' to stream on Apple Music Alicia Keys, John Legend and Taraji P. Henson are featured in Apple Music‚Äôs new ‚ÄúCarpool Karaoke‚Äù series. (Apple via YouTube) Not only is there plenty of car time in the new series, Corden and Smith also take a ride in a helicopter to the tune of R. Kelly's "I Believe I Can Fly." "Carpool Karaoke" is set to debut exclusively on Apple Music in the coming months. Apple ordered 16 episodes of the series which will be released weekly. An Apple Music subscription costs $10 per month, but perhaps the videos will still find a way to YouTube.

Apple is said to have made the video to highlight "the diversity, variety and freedom of expression of Carnival," as well as a way to continue its "Shot on iPhone" campaign, which has recently focused on explaining the advantages of Portrait Mode. The video includes a collection of over 500 photographs taken with an iPhone 7 Plus and its Portrait Mode feature, and is edited to give the still images a sense of stop-motion animation. The song used in the video -- by artists BaianaSystem and Yzal√∫ -- is also available exclusively on Apple Music. [Direct Link] The Brazilian video follows a collection of ads that Apple has created to share the advantages of Portrait Mode on the iPhone 7 Plus, which blurs the background of a photo so that the person or object in the foreground stands out. Just yesterday, two Portrait Mode videos were published on the company's YouTube channel in order to detail the differences between a normal photo and one taken in Portrait Mode.

Rating: 2 Votes lucascampelo 23 hours ago at 02:23 am Great ad. One could theorize that they're having trouble moving units there, thus going full offense on the advertising. Ironically, a 7 plus could probably buy a house there. I'm Brazilian. Yes, iPhones are 2 times more expensive here than the US for the same model, thus selling a lot less.

But this year, analysts, insiders, and commentators appear to think that the next iteration could make up for the disappointment.¬†Fast Company, ranking Apple as the fourth most innovative firm in the world, argues that the company's increased focus on building chips in-house will allow it to create "the most compelling consumer-electronics experiences." Our own Will Knight explains that Siri could be getting a shot in the arm, by learning from its mistakes. And the rumor mill predicts a slew of new iPhone features, including wireless charging, curved screens, and superior battery life. That buzz, combined with stronger-than-expected iPhone sales over the holidays, saw Apple stock reach an all-time high at the close of the markets yesterday. It remains to be seen, of course, whether the bluster amounts to much. Do you need The Download? Sign up here¬†to get it for free in your inbox. Imagining the Future of VR Storytelling at Google Jessica Brillhart is the principal filmmaker for virtual reality at Google. But what, exactly, does that mean? In an interview with our editor in chief, Jason Pontin, she explains that she gets to explore how everything from exotic 16-camera rigs to cheap cardboard headsets could be used to provide new experiences that traditional film cannot. It may sound like one of the more cushy and creative Silicon Valley jobs, but it poses some challenging puzzles. ‚ÄúVR is an embodied medium: creators are taking [a] detached eye and reattaching it to someone‚Äôs face,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúVR reminds us of the nuances of experiences, what connects people with each other, with places, with things in the real world. And that to me is the key to really understanding what kind of storytelling could even exist in a VR space.‚Äù Converting Climate Change Deniers There‚Äôs an ever-growing base of evidence to support the fact that humans cause climate change‚Äîand it's (slowly) nudging public acceptance of the phenomenon to increase. The results of global warming are manifest around the planet. The 700-foot high Oroville Dam currently teeters on the brink of disaster, with a climate-exacerbated double blow of drought and flood causing operators to use its emergency slipways and evacuate nearly 200,000 people. Sea ice levels have hit record lows at both poles. And in Australia, longer heat waves are causing increased bushfire risk. A new equation suggests that humans are causing the climate to change 170 times faster than natural forces. And, in the UK at least, people are willing to believe it: more people than ever there now believe that climate change is real. How long until the new White House administration follows suit? Ten Fascinating Things What lurks in the ocean‚Äôs deepest reaches? According to a new study of the Pacific's Kermadec and Mariana trenches, high levels of chemicals that were banned in the 1970s. Researchers claim that levels of contamination are similar to the most polluted industrial areas of the northwest Pacific. Four weeks ago, 20 percent of Cameroon's population found their Internet blocked‚Äîand it remains the case. Affecting just English-speaking parts of the country, it‚Äôs believed to be politically motivated. It ought stop: the ban will be hurting the country‚Äôs economy. Researchers have used pottery from the ancient Judean people to show that Earth‚Äôs magnetic field briefly spiked to nearly twice its current intensity¬†in the 8th Century BC. If correct, a similar event could wreak havoc with modern technology.¬† Ever since Uber conceded the Chinese market, it‚Äôs shifted its Asian attentions to India. But now it, and large homegrown rival, Ola, have a problem: thousands of drivers in New Delhi¬†have gone on strike for four days, demanding better pay. Watch out, Skype: Amazon is after you. The e-tailer has announced¬†Chime, which will host video conferences and live-share documents on its servers. It may sound ten years late, but Amazon is¬†targeting the businesses sector‚Äîwhich, as many of us know, remains lacking. Over the last year, Google‚Äôs self-driving car project haemorrhaged staff‚Äîincluding its technical lead. New reports suggest that the exodus was the result of a pay structure where early staffers received¬†so much money that they had little incentive to stay. In many parts of the world, humid conditions can lead to loss of crops via rot and fungal toxins. A new kind of ceramic bead sucks moisture out of the air and could make the process of drying crops twice as energy efficient. Tens of thousands of Americans die in hospital every year because of preventable causes. Joe Kiani, head of medical device firm Masimo, hopes to reduce that number by having medical devices communicate on a single, open platform.¬† Nutritionists make foods healthy by sucking salt, sugar, and fat out‚Äîoften at the expense of taste. But what if we could fool our brain into believing that the results taste like the junk we love? We may be able to, by tweaking the texture of food. Triangulene sounds like it could be the potent foe of a superhero. But it‚Äôs actually an¬†exotic molecule that IBM researchers have built by moving single atoms at a time. Quote of the Day "Over time I think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence ‚Ä¶ It's mostly about bandwidth, the speed of the connection between your brain and the digital version of yourself.‚Äù ‚Äî Elon Musk thinks that, in a future filled with robots, humans will need to create a direct link with computers to move information around fast enough if they plan to keep up.

What exactly Cue means by that isn‚Äôt clear ‚Äì it was already confirmed that the streaming service had over 20 million subscribers in December last year. That figure was up from seventeen million in September. Assuming Apple Music is now adding about a million users a month, that would put it around 22 million now. You can decide if that‚Äôs ‚Äúwell past‚Äù 20 million or not for yourself. Cue also apparently said that Apple is not completely happy with its streaming service‚Äôs growth levels just yet, adding that he still sees room for ‚Äúexponential‚Äù growth in the market that is not currently being achieved. He noted that around 100 million people are paying for streaming music worldwide, but many more are listening to music online. This may or may not have been an indication that Apple supports moves to revise the safe harbour rules that currently allow companies like YouTube to force rights owners into licensing free-to-access streaming services that pay much less into the music industry. Or it might just be another dig at Spotify‚Äôs freemium offer, which we all know Apple doesn‚Äôt like. Apple‚Äôs strategy to attract users to date has been partly based around exclusives, but Cue also acknowledged in his talk that such exclusives ‚Äúare never good for the long-term basis‚Äù of the music industry.

Maestri is expected to speak around 1:20PT/4:20ET and there will be a live audio stream of the speech. Tim Cook has attended the¬†Technology and Internet Conference in the past, which takes place every year and is put on by Goldman Sachs. Maestri‚Äôs appearance at the conference comes following Apple‚Äôs record earnings report for Q1 2017. At the event, we‚Äôll likely see¬†Maestri reiterate much of what was explained in Apple‚Äôs earnings call last month, noting things such as an improved iPhone average selling ¬†price and Apple‚Äôs return to growth. This certainly isn‚Äôt the platform on which we‚Äôd expect major product announcements. Instead, Maestri will likely stick to the business side of things. In 2015, Tim Cook spoke at the conference discussing topics such as the influence of Steve Jobs, as well as extending iOS into the car, home, and health industries. Cook also discussed Apple‚Äôs efforts in Apple Pay, China, enterprise,¬†emerging¬†markets, green energy, and diversity. We‚Äôll have live coverage of¬†Maestri‚Äôs speech at the¬†Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference, but you‚Äôll be able to listen in here.¬†Maestri is expected to speak at around 1:20PT/4:20ET.

Much like the first clip, this one offers a quick look at some of the guests that will appear on the show‚Ä¶ In the description, Apple says that celebrity pairings will sing their own personal playlists while driving around. The clip also shows the celebrities doing other things such as helicopter rides, drinking at a bar, and more. Based on the segment that has become a global, viral video sensation on The Late Late Show with James Corden, the new CARPOOL KARAOKE series features 16 celebrity pairings riding along in a car together as they sing tunes from their personal playlists and surprise fans who don‚Äôt expect to see big stars belting out tunes one lane over. The video also offers first look at where Apple‚Äôs original content will be viewable¬†in the Apple Music app. Carpool Karaoke producer Ben Winston joined Apple‚Äôs Eddy Cue on stage this evening¬†at the Code Media conference to premiere the clip. Cue announced that the series will premiere this April.

From smartphones themselves to fingerprint readers, Apple‚Äôs usual approach is to sit back and watch what other companies do, then aim to produce a better version some way down the line. With smartphones, Apple watched other companies launch devices which required a stylus, and then created¬†one that could be used with your finger. With fingerprint readers, Apple looked at ones what required you to roll your finger across an optical reader and then created a far more reliable one-touch¬†capacitive sensor. And so on. For a long time, it looked like it was doing the same thing with wireless charging ‚Äì but that now seems in some doubt ‚Ä¶ As I wrote back in 2015, inductive wireless charging is a very half-hearted solution. For a start, it isn‚Äôt really wireless in any meaningful sense of the term. You still have a visible wire which needs to go all the way to your phone, it‚Äôs just that it goes to a charging pad instead of directly to the handset. While you can argue that it‚Äôs more convenient to simply put your phone down on a pad than to have to plug in a cable, that‚Äôs swings and roundabouts: a cable lets me continue to use my phone while I‚Äôm charging it. Pick it up from a pad, however, and it‚Äôs no longer charging. Apple does of course use inductive charging for the Watch, but that use makes sense. It‚Äôs a much smaller device, so you don‚Äôt want to have a (comparatively) huge charging socket in the side of it, and¬†most people find that the Watch comfortably makes it through a full day, so¬†you don‚Äôt need to charge it during use. I said then that, where the iPhone was concerned, Apple was quite right to ignore inductive charging and wait for a better solution. There were at the time a couple of alternative technologies on the horizon that seemed possible candidates for addressing the charging problem. The first of these is fuel cells: a different form of battery that can power an iPhone for a week and a MacBook for a month. As I mentioned last time, Apple has a patent on using fuel cells in portable electronic devices, and has reportedly been working on it for some time. But while fuel cells last much longer than batteries, replenishing them is more expensive and less convenient than recharging a conventional battery. Which is why an alternative form of wireless charging seemed a much likelier bet: RF charging. RF charging uses radio signals ‚Äì which could even be Wi-Fi ones ‚Äì to¬†provide long-distance wireless charging. Distances of 15-20 feet have been demonstrated, with suggestions that it may work up to 30 feet.¬†Put a charger or two on the wall, or even incorporate them into existing devices like iMacs and TVs, and you have a true wireless charging solution. With a few of these chargers in a house or apartment, you can effectively blanket your entire home in wireless power, allowing all your compatible devices to be charging wherever they are and whether or not you are using them. Bye-bye visible cables. Until recently, it seemed like that was what Apple was waiting for. A company called Energous demonstrated the technology a couple of years ago, using an iPad to control it. There seemed to be evidence of Apple partnering with Energous¬†(though the company sort-of denied it at the time), with another link¬†later found to an Apple supplier. Energous even announced a delay to the launch of its technology as a result of a ‚Äòkey strategic partnership‚Äò rumored to be with Apple. The evidence all seemed to be pointing in the same direction: Apple was ignoring the older wireless charging tech being used by competitors, and appeared to have links to a far superior technology. It made perfect sense that it was waiting until it could offer long-distance charging. A recent contract, however, appeared to suggest otherwise. That contract was for a component reportedly used in conventional inductive charging. We also today learned that Apple has joined an industry group set up to promote Qi charging ‚Äì the same pad-based inductive charging system other smartphone¬†manufacturers have been offering since 2009 (the Palm Pre), and which Apple‚Äôs arch-competitor Samsung first offered with the Galaxy S4 back in 2013. For Apple to offer the exact same tech in 2017 would, in my view, be way too little, way too late. Not only that, but if Apple does the same as it did with the Watch ‚Äì adopt Qi tech but tweak it to make it incompatible with non-Apple chargers ‚Äì then it would lose one of the key benefits of the standard: the ability to use any of the existing public chargers out there in coffee shops, airports and the like. If Apple really does intend to offer Qi-based short-range inductive charging, it had better have some rabbit to pull out of the hat to make its version of the technology worth the wait ‚Ä¶ Guides Opinion pieces & commentary View THe Guide iPhone 8 View THe Guide wireless charging View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.
