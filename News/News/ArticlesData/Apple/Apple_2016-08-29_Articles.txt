And Other Big Questions Kathy Gilsinan and Krishnadev Calamur 4:30 PM ET My President Was Black Ta-Nehisi Coates Dec 13, 2016 Adam Chandler Aug 30, 2016 Business Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size On Monday afternoon, as Apple announced the date of its next hysteria-inducing press conference and product release, the European Union’s antitrust regulators were preparing an announcement of their own: On Tuesday, the European Commission (EC) presented Apple with a €13 billion (about $14.5 billion) bill for back taxes covering nearly a decade of its operations in Ireland—during which the company paid an effective annual tax rate of between .005 percent and 1 percent, according to the EC. In other words, regulators decided a multinational corporation would have to pay up for using shell companies to hide earnings and avoid paying billions in taxes. With the obvious exception of Apple, who wouldn’t be happy about that? Indeed, over at The Guardian, one columnist crowed that the ruling represented a huge victory in the fight against tax avoidance. Meanwhile, Des Cahill, the mayor of Cork, Ireland’s second-largest city and Apple’s Irish hub, immediately suggested that the money be set aside for local use. “Many infrastructural projects like the Cork to Limerick motorway were cut by government during the downturn and should these funds become available Cork has to feel the benefit as Cork has been Apple’s epicenter,” Cahill told The Wall Street Journal. But despite Ireland’s protracted austerity and looming economic uncertainty amid the impending Brexit, Cahill’s message, along with the announced penalty, were not embraced by the Irish government. Finance Minister Michael Noonan quickly vowed to lead an appeal against the EC ruling, lambasting it as “the encroachment of EU state aid rules.”   The United States also voiced disapproval of the EU decision. A spokesperson from the Treasury, which has previously characterized EU tax investigations as disproportionately focused on American companies, said the department was “disappointed” by the ruling. “We believe that retroactive tax assessments by the commission are unfair, contrary to well-established legal principles, and call into question the tax rules of individual member states,” the spokesperson added. In her remarks on Tuesday, Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner, seemed to anticipate this criticism. “This has to do with profits generated in Europe and recorded in Europe,” she said. “Whatever the issue Apple may have with the U.S. tax code is not an issue for us.” Jeffrey Winters, a professor of political science at Northwestern University, could not muster much sympathy for Noonan and his compatriots. “It is absurd for Ireland to complain that it is being forced by the EU to collect over $13 billion in taxes it should have received had Apple not abused its power and size,” Winters wrote in an email. “And if Ireland doesn't want the taxes, the U.S. should be arguing for claiming its share based on where Apple actually does a large portion of its business and sales.” Winters added that he thought the United States should not be siding with Apple and Ireland. “Instead of saluting the EU for this important move in favor of ordinary citizens, the U.S. government has gotten caught up in a stupid game of nationalism, claiming U.S. corporations are being unfairly targeted,” Winters wrote to me. “But what nationalism is Apple showing as it parks hundreds of billions of dollars in profits offshore and uses transfer pricing and shell corporations to avoid taxes?” As Tim Fernholz noted at Quartz, Tuesday’s ruling hardly came as a surprise, given that in the past couple years a U.S. Senate committee and the EU each released reports signaling their disapproval of Apple’s tax arrangement. With hundreds of major multinational companies spread out across Ireland and the European Union, and dozens of tax investigations pending, Apple’s dispute with the EU may be the biggest to date, but it certainly won’t be the last.

Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common? Continue Reading Mike Sager / Reuters What Donald Trump Owes Wall Street Conor Friedersdorf New information on conflicts of interest that would challenge even a saint Wells Fargo. JPMorgan Chase. Fidelity Investments. Prudential PLC. Vanguard Group. These are among the major financial institutions that own business debt held by Donald Trump, according to an investigation just published by the Wall Street Journal. While the president-elect’s finances remain murky, due largely to his refusal to release his tax returns, the newspaper reports that he owes at least hundreds of millions of dollars, that the debt is held by more than 150 institutions, and that some of it is backed by his personal guarantee. “As a result, a broader array of financial institutions now are in a potentially powerful position over the incoming president,” it states. “If the Trump businesses were to default on their debts, the giant financial institutions that serve as so-called special servicers of these loan pools would have the power to foreclose on some of Mr. Trump’s marquee properties or seek the tens of millions of dollars that Mr. Trump personally guaranteed on the loans.” Continue Reading Kevin Lamarque / Reuters An Intelligence Report That Will Change No One’s Mind David A. Graham Multiple agencies have confidently concluded that Russian hackers intended to hurt Clinton and help Trump, but it’s unlikely to persuade skeptics. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence released its most detailed report on alleged Russian hacking aimed at interfering with the presidential election on Friday. The 25-page report states that the CIA, FBI, and NSA have concluded that Russia was behind a series of attacks, as well as disinformation disseminated via various media, with the goal of undermining faith in U.S. elections and harming Hillary Clinton’s presidential prospects and her prospective administration. They have concluded, however, that there was no meddling in vote tallying. Although the unclassified report, which is based on a longer, classified report, uses the strongest language and offers the most detailed assessment yet, it does not or cannot provide evidence for its assertions. That virtually guarantees that it will not change many minds in the debate, which has become heavily partisan. The intelligence community is in effect telling readers, “trust us”—something the president-elect, among others, has been unwilling to do.

Who else has been hacked? Could the CIA be wrong? Updated on January 6, 2017 In a “declassified version of a highly classified assessment” released on Friday January 6, the U.S. intelligence community laid out its judgment that “Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election,” with the specific goal of harming Hillary Clinton’s “electability and potential presidency.” The report went on: “We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.” These conclusions had previously been reported, based accounts anonymous intelligence officials gave to various news outlets. The January 6 intelligence assessment was the first time the Office of the Director of National Intelligence had detailed them officially in public. Continue Reading Ian Allen My President Was Black Ta-Nehisi Coates A history of the first African American White House—and of what came next In the waning days of President Barack Obama’s administration, he and his wife, Michelle, hosted a farewell party, the full import of which no one could then grasp. It was late October, Friday the 21st, and the president had spent many of the previous weeks, as he would spend the two subsequent weeks, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Things were looking up. Polls in the crucial states of Virginia and Pennsylvania showed Clinton with solid advantages. The formidable GOP strongholds of Georgia and Texas were said to be under threat. The moment seemed to buoy Obama. He had been light on his feet in these last few weeks, cracking jokes at the expense of Republican opponents and laughing off hecklers. At a rally in Orlando on October 28, he greeted a student who would be introducing him by dancing toward her and then noting that the song playing over the loudspeakers—the Gap Band’s “Outstanding”—was older than she was. Continue Reading Etienne Fabre / SSAC A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave In France Ed Yong A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found. In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Continue Reading Where Great Writers are Made Edward J.

The Workshop’s brand-new and clean-lined Glenn Schaeffer Library adjoins the house in the rear, as a fashionable offspring might flank a more elegantly dressed parent. In the library’s Frank Conroy Reading Room, which overlooks the gray waters of the Iowa River, are tall, glassed bookcases containing some 3,000 volumes published by graduates of the Workshop since it began, in 1936. Upstairs, in an unused office, are 16 large boxes of alumni books for which no shelf space is yet available. In a wire basket, on the desk of program associate Connie Brothers, are dozens of clipped reviews of recent books. “And those are only the ones I happen to have seen,” Brothers says.

White A CFPB investigation concluded that Transunion and Equifax deceived Americans about the reports they provided and the fees they charged. In personal finance, practically everything can turn on one’s credit score. It’s both an indicator of one’s financial past, and the key to accessing necessities—without insane costs—in the future. But on Tuesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that two of the three major credit-reporting agencies responsible for doling out those scores—Equifax and Transunion—have been deceiving and taking advantage of Americans. The Bureau ordered the agencies to pay more than $23 million in fines and restitution.   In their investigation, the Bureau found that the two agencies had been misrepresenting the scores provided to consumers, telling them that the score reports they received were the same reports that lenders and businesses received, when, in fact, they were not. The investigation also found problems with the way the agencies advertised their products, using promotions that suggested that their credit reports were either free or cost only $1. According to the CFPB the agencies did not properly disclose that after a trial of seven to 30 days, individuals would be enrolled in a full-price subscription, which could total $16 or more per month. The Bureau also found Equifax to be in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which states that the agencies must provide one free report every 12 months made available at a central site. Before viewing their free report, consumers were forced to view advertisements for Equifax, which is prohibited by law.

There’s perhaps been no better satire of the Obama presidency than the figure of Luther, Obama’s anger translator. Key & Peele’s serialized sketch, in which the title character says all the things Obama won’t and can’t say as president, was multifaceted in its insights: about the performative demands of the office, about Obama’s own cool demeanor, about the collision of all those things in the person of the country’s first black president. Key & Peele’s Luther sketches—including, and perhaps especially, the one performed with the actual President Obama, at the 2015 White House Correspondents’ Dinner—were, in all that, as profound as they were wacky, and as much about the country Obama governed as they were about the president himself.

Toggle navigation News Sport Obits Features Videos Directory Donegal TD demands public inquiry into Apple sweetheart deal 12:46 Tuesday 30th of August 2016 Sinn Féin Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty TD has said there must be a public inquiry to establish who facilitated the state’s sweetheart deal with Apple. Deputy Doherty was speaking today after the EU Commission ruled that Ireland granted undue tax benefits of up to €13billion. He said the government’s decision to appeal this ruling should be put to a vote in the Dáil and his party will be bringing forward a motion to oppose such an appeal. Deputy Doherty said: “Today’s ruling has shocked even those of us who have been watching this issue with a keen eye.  Up to €13billion of tax has been lost as a result of a sweetheart deal with Apple.  That is a massive amount of money and we must have a public inquiry to establish who facilitated this deal. “Given the state is chasing people who have not paid their water charges through the courts it is unimaginable that the government will appeal this ruling. “The government should accept the EU Commission ruling and impose the correct tax bill on Apple. Any decision to appeal the ruling should be put to a vote of the Dáil. “The argument made by government for appealing the ruling is to protect Ireland’s reputation but unfortunately the damage has already been done and an appeal has the potential to further damage our international reputation." He continued: “It is also very telling that the government is only too willing to take on Europe on this matter when it refused to do so when ordinary Irish citizens were saddled with billions of euro of banking debt, when the EU imposed crippling austerity measures on this state and when the Irish people democratically rejected water charges at the general election this year. “So we are now in a situation where the government is taking on the EU in a case that would see the state lose billions of euro in tax if the government is successful yet it has repeatedly refused to take on the EU when the lives of Irish citizens were being ruined by its policies.” If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Donegal Now editorial team.

Whispers the US firm would ditch the hundred-year old technology started back in December 2015.  Within days of the first rumours breaking that Apple was considering dropping the headphone socket, some 300,000 people signed an online petition against the move. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has even voiced concern about the controversial move. Elsewhere, the iPhone 7 is expected be the first Apple smartphone to ship with a dual-camera set-up. Based on the latest rumours and leaks, the side-by-side rear twin cameras will appear like an elongated, pill-shaped protrusion from the aluminium back panel. Rumours suggest the strange new camera could allow iPhone owners to simultaneously snap a wide-angle image – as well as a cropped, or zoomed-in version of the same photo.

By the Editorial Board A levy Tuesday by the European Commission of $14.3 billion plus interest in Irish taxes on the ostensibly U.S. firm Apple called attention to the loaded question of to whom — if anyone — do large internationally operating firms pay taxes? In the case of Apple, the claim is that it owes this amount in taxes for the period 2003-2014 to Ireland, to which, under deals negotiated in 1991 and 2007, its shadow office in Ireland paid taxes at a rate of 0.0005 percent in 2014, for example. Apple’s profits in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India were thus, in principle, taxed in Ireland at close to a zero rate. Apple’s “head office” in Ireland has no premises and no employees. Ireland offers firms like Apple deals like that to attract investment. Ireland apparently plans to appeal the commission’s decision at the Court of Justice of the European Union, calling it wrong and not wishing to jeopardize other such deals it has or seeks with offshore companies. The commission calls the Ireland-Apple relationship, based on the tax benefit, “illegal state aid,” disadvantaging Apple’s competition. Other theoretically American companies, including Amazon, McDonald’s, Mylan and Starbucks, have advantageous deals with other EU countries, such as Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Apple computer owners shouldn’t worry. The $14.3 billion tax bill won’t break the bank. Apple’s reserves are $120 billion. In an election year in which economic inequality is a central issue, the question of to whom major companies pay taxes is of great interest. Put that question alongside the one of why Washington has not achieved tax reform at a time when the flight of American jobs overseas has impoverished the country’s middle class while its very rich have become even richer, and the Apple in Ireland matter becomes of much more than passing interest.

With the European Commission being accused of having crossed a red line and damaged future investment in Ireland, will the country's grievances see it part ways with Europe? By Nick Heath | August 30, 2016 -- 17:05 GMT (10:05 PDT) | Topic: Apple The Apple tax ruling has been seen by some as a reason for Ireland to leave the EU. Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto The decision by the European Commission (EC) that Ireland should claim €13bn in 'illegal tax benefits' back from Apple has stoked debate over whether Ireland should follow the UK and look to leave the EU. Speaking ahead of today's EC ruling, Brian Hayes, Irish MEP for the Fine Gael party, said Ireland would not stand for any European interference with its ability to set corporation tax. Read this The land where skilled IT workers don't pay tax. Yes, it really exists Some countries in Eastern Europe have opted for an innovative way to hang onto their most talented IT staffers. Read More "That is the absolute red line issue. Any attempt made to cajole us [on corporation tax], as far as I'm concerned, we're out the door," he told the Irish Independent. Any bid to rein in tax agreements drawn up by Ireland would, he said, put the country at a disadvantage when compared to a UK outside of Europe and unfettered by the same restrictions. "We cannot be tied into an anti-business, anti-growth pact while the Brits are allowed to move on. We have a lot more to lose than anybody else," he said. The two-year investigation by the EC into Apple's tax affairs found that two tax rulings that Ireland gave to the company substantially and artificially lowered the tax Apple paid in the country since 1991. The tax deal allowed Apple to pay billions of euros less than would otherwise have been the case, with the firm at one point paying a tax rate of just 0.005 percent. Following the EC decision, Hayes again raised the prospect that Ireland would become less attractive as a place to do business. "The credibility of Ireland's business environment is on the line here," he said. "What is also at stake is our future ability to attract FDI [foreign direct investment] into the country with a taxation system that is certain, clear and based on Irish law." Other economic analysts have backed Hayes' argument that a Britain outside of the EU could be well-placed to use the promise of lower taxation to lure companies like Apple to the UK. "Britain could benefit. If Ireland cannot offer sweetheart deals within the EU, the City of London can perhaps offer something more appealing outside the bloc," Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, told the Yorkshire Post. For its part, Apple has already warned that the EC's decision, which is being challenged by both Apple and the Irish government, "will have a profound and harmful effect on investment and job creation in Europe". However, Apple also said that it remains "committed to Ireland and we plan to continue investing there". The harm that the EC's decision will do to this investment is also the number one fear for the Irish government. "Ireland has very real concerns about the way in which the European Commission is undermining the international consensus, impeding reform and creating uncertainty for business and investment in Europe," a spokesperson for the Department of Finance said. But while an independent Ireland would have more control over taxation, if Ireland were to leave the EU it could also complicate matters for domestic businesses, leaving firms wrestling with uncertainty over trade tariffs and continued access to EU markets.

Read More When it comes to public sentiment about Europe in Ireland, the Irish public have voted against EU interests in the past, with the majority of voters (53 percent) rejecting the Treaty of Lisbon when a referendum was held in 2008. However, a second referendum in 2009 saw 67 percent back the treaty. The Taoiseach, the Irish Prime Minister, also actively encouraged British citizens to vote to remain in the EU, ahead of the referendum in June. Ultimately the chance of the EC's decision on Apple having any meaningful impact on Ireland's future in the bloc is negligible, according to one European Union expert. Dr Geoffrey Edwards, director of European Studies at Cambridge University, pointed out that Ireland had undergone significant hardship as a result of the spending cuts and financial reforms demanded by Europe in the wake of Ireland's €67.5bn bailout in 2010. Given the difficulties those reforms caused had failed to trigger a referendum on Ireland's future in the EU, he said the EC's decision on Apple would likely have no repercussions for Ireland's continued membership. "If the Irish can put up with the Eurozone package they had to suffer, then they can put with this," he said.

But Apple isn’t the only US corporation to face scrutiny from the European Union, which is questioning the legality of tax breaks EU member countries give to big foreign companies to entice them to do business there. Last October, the European Commission ruled that a tax arrangement between Starbucks (SBUX) and the Netherlands was illegal, forcing the Seattle-based coffee giant to pay back $32.7 million. The Netherlands filed an appeal this January, although it could be at least another year-and-a-half before any resolution. For Amazon (AMZN) and McDonald’s (MCD), European tax investigations are ongoing. Both corporations may be in hot water over tax situations with Luxembourg, the small European country bordered by Belgium, France and Germany. In October 2014, the European Commission began an investigation into Amazon’s tax arrangements with Luxembourg, claiming a tax ruling from 2003 favoring Amazon may also be in violation of the trade bloc’s rules. “Based on a methodology set by the tax ruling, Amazon EU Sàrl pays a tax deductible royalty to a limited liability partnership established in Luxembourg but which is not subject to corporate taxation in Luxembourg,” part of the commission’s press release reads, adding that most European profits of Amazon are recorded in Luxembourg but not subject to corporate taxation in that country. Amazon declined to comment when reached by Yahoo Finance. It’s also unclear when the European Commission will finally offer a ruling for the Seattle-based company. McDonald’s, meanwhile, came under scrutiny in December 2015, when the European Commission declared the European franchising side of the corporation “has not virtually paid any corporate tax in Luxembourg nor in the US” since 2008 for royalties paid by franchisees operating restaurants in Europe and Russia. The commission has not made a decision in the case of McDonald’s, either. McDonald’s did not immediately return Yahoo Finance’s request for comment. As The Wall Street Journal pointed out Tuesday, Facebook (FB) may not be immune to scrutiny in the months to come. The No. 1 social network, like Apple, has significant operations in Ireland, including a new headquarters and data center outside Dublin, and the European Commission may very well investigate whether Facebook’s local tax arrangements are similar to Apple’s. “We pay all taxes required by law everywhere we operate,” a Facebook spokesperson told Yahoo Finance. In Apple’s case, the European Commission declared the Irish government had broken state aid rules by forming an arrangement with Apple that allowed the company to significantly reduce its tax bill. “Member States cannot give tax benefits to selected companies — this is illegal under EU state aid rules,” Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner, said in a statement. As Yahoo Finance managing editor Sam Ro points out, it’s unclear whether Apple will be responsible for paying the entire $14.5 billion sum, whether Apple will do so do in one lump sum, or whether the figure will be reduced.

Again. I decided to bake a cake. Because trying to wrestle gluten-free pie dough for an apple pie just seemed too fussy. Too complicated. Though in all honesty, that isn't the whole, unvarnished truth. The whole, unvarnished truth is, Yours Truly is more of a cake person than a pie person. It's true- pies have their charm. I've been known to inhale a slice or two of apple pie in my day. But here's the thing. And I'm going to be blunt. Gluten-free pastry crust is simply not as flaky and tender and melt-in-your-mouth wonderful as wheat pastry crust. There. I said it. Fighting words, to some. And if you are among those true believers feel free to disagree. And go eat your gluten-free pie. I bless you with a thousand sprinkles of pie fairy dust. With love. And kisses. And pink ponies. Respectfully. Gluten, you see, is more than a pesky protein with a bad rep. Gluten is what makes pastry dough soft, flaky and tender. Gluten is what inspired bakers to bake all those years ago, firing up their hand-hewn brick-lined ovens. Gluten was their muse. Their seductive mistress. Gluten took them beyond three ingredient pancakes and palm-tossed flatbreads. Gluten fed their imagination. Inspired tarts, baklava, cupcakes. Napoleons. And yes. Apple pie. Because gluten is a magical ingredient (despite its bad press these days). We have to admit it. She's not an easy paramour to replace. Perhaps some day soon I'll be tempted to experiment with a gluten-free wheat-free pastry dough. I'll be lured into believing I can recreate such delicate, fragile beauty. But not today. I'll bake this 'no apology necessary' Apple Crisp or this amazing Pumpkin Pie with Coconut-Pecan Crust. For breakfast, I'll eat applesauce cake. Right now, I can live with that. Karina's Wheat-Free Applesauce Crumb Cake Recipe with Cinnamon Originally published November 2012 by Karina Allrich. We debated whether or not to add chopped nuts to this (delightful!) cinnamon-laced and apple pie spiced gluten-free coffee cake. And though we were mightily tempted, we decided to keep it simple, and skipped the nuts. Ingredients: 1 cup sorghum flour 1 cup potato starch (not potato flour) 1/2 cup hazelnut, chestnut or almond flour 1 1/3 cup light brown sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons xanthan gum 1 teaspoon sea salt 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon allspice 1 teaspoon ginger 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg 3 organic free-range eggs, beaten 1/2 cup expeller pressed canola oil or coconut oil 1 tablespoon bourbon vanilla extract 1 cup organic applesauce For the topping: 1/3 cup light brown sugar 3 tablespoons sorghum flour 3 tablespoons organic coconut oil 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Line a 9-inch deep cake pan or baking dish with a piece of parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl, whisk to combine the dry ingredients: sorghum flour, potato starch, hazelnut flour, brown sugar, xanthan gum, sea salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, allspice, ginger, and nutmeg. Add in the eggs, oil, and vanilla extract. Beat to combine. Add in the applesauce and beat by hand to mix the batter. Scoop the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth it out to the edges. Make the topping combining the brown sugar, sorghum flour, coconut oil, and cinnamon. Mix with a fork until sandy textured. Spread the crumb topping on the batter. Lightly press down. Bake in the center of the oven for 40 minutes, then loosely tent a piece of foil over the top to prevent the topping from over-browning. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes more, until the center of the cake is firm and a wooden pick inserted in the middle emerges clean. Cool the cake on a wire rack. Delicious and fragrant with spices served warm. Careful- it will be a bit fragile when warm. This lovely cinnamon-spiced cake may be baked the night before, cooled, and wrapped for the next morning. Slice, wrap in foil, and freeze uneaten cake slices in a freezer bag.

Pays Taxes Overseas (or Avoids Them) Cupertino's overseas tax strategies are both complex and effective, and the company has a Plan B on hand. Here's what you need to know. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Aug 30, 2016 at 6:43PM Image source: Getty Images. By now, you probably know all about the $14.6 billion Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) owes the Irish government in back taxes. Cupertino is sure to appeal that decision by European Union regulators, but the age of Ireland-based tax shelters may be coming to an accelerated halt. Do you know how elaborate Apple's international tax structure actually is? Let's have a closer look. Apple's transcontinental tax connections The company was an early adopter of the "double Irish with a Dutch sandwich" strategy back in the 1980s -- some even say the company invented this tax evasion tool. The double Irish depended on a quirk in Irish tax laws, where a company could be incorporated in Ireland but avoid corporate income taxes by having its "central management and control" in another state. So, you could set up one shell company with this physical center on the Emerald Isle, taking advantage of Ireland's paltry 12.5% tax rate and European domicile. Another company would technically be incorporated in Ireland but have its base of operations in an entirely tax-free jurisdiction, such as the Cayman Islands or Bermuda. Crucially, the second entity was assigned the rights to important intellectual property, such as technology patents or design trademarks. The first company was set up to collect revenue from the American company's non-U.S. operations. However, most of this top-line revenue would be spent on license fees and royalties for that intellectual property nugget, allowing the 100% Irish unit to report low profits or none at all, while the Caribbean business pocketed the real bottom-line profits in a tax-free haven. The "Dutch sandwich" part of the grand scheme refers to a third business registered in the Netherlands. This is a shim between the two Irish companies, working around Ireland's substantial taxes on transferring profits out of the country. But those taxes are waived when the target is based elsewhere in the European Union, and the Netherlands does not tax profit transfers overseas, so the Dutch middle-man makes for a smoother and lower-cost transfer to that sun-drenched tax haven. What's wrong with the double Irish? Now, the double Irish is properly discussed in the past tense. The Irish tax code got an overhaul in 2013, removing the legal basis for registering businesses in Ireland with tax domiciles elsewhere. This change removes the second half of the double Irish, destroying the whole tax-evasion tactic. However, the new rules currently only apply to starting a new business. Existing companies are still grandfathered in until 2020. So, Apple's big European tax bill has nothing to do with Cupertino overstepping its legal limits. Instead, the Commission found that Ireland was wrong to allow Apple's tax structure to exist in the first place. Apple will obviously fight this outcome tooth and nail. In a strange twist, the company has an ally in the Irish government. Ireland has also vowed to overturn the European Commission's verdict, which leaves the country fighting to keep Apple from paying it money. This sounds silly at first glance, but it makes sense when you consider Ireland's place as a favored business center under light taxation. Irish regulators fear the Apple decision may lead to a lemming trail of foreign businesses seeking new tax shelters elsewhere -- long before that looming 2020 deadline kicks in. Apple's Plan B You may have heard Apple complaining that it can't take profits home from overseas until the repatriation tax is lowered, but the company has actually been preparing to shift some overseas cash back to domestic shores by pre-paying some of the expected tax bills. Five years ago, longtime Apple analyst Katy Huberty revealed that the company indeed pays some domestic taxes on foreign earnings. At the time, she used this fact as ammunition in favor of an Apple dividend. The dividend policy followed a few months later, and Apple is still following its old policy of paying down some foreign repatriation fees in advance. Here's the evidence: Fiscal Year Total Tax Rate Effective Domestic Tax Rate Effective Foreign Tax Rate 2015 26.3% 65.1% 6.2% 2014 26.1% 62.8% 4.4% 2013 26.1% 60.9% 5.8% Data source: Apple's SEC filings. The Irish strategy keeps overseas taxes very low. However, Apple routinely pays nearly double the 35% federal tax rate on domestic pre-tax earnings. This is a symptom of Uncle Sam collecting taxes above and beyond his federal and state levies to cover some of those troubling repatriation fees in advance. When I checked in on this phenomenon in 2011, Apple's total tax rate stopped at 24%. The foreign tax bill amounted to just 1% of overseas profits, while the domestic tax rate ballooned to 79%. The 2013 reform seems to have steered Apple in a new direction, but the double Irish is still working wonders. Keep in mind that only 34% of Apple's pre-tax profits come from domestic sales, and the balance keeps tipping further and further overseas. In 2013, the domestic portion of EBIT profits was 39%. What does this all mean? Apple spearheaded the charge into Irish-Caribbean tax strategies 30 years ago. Now, pretty much every multinational business worth its salt has followed suit -- and now Apple must lead the way to a new international tax strategy. The double Irish has kept billions of dollars away from tax collectors around the world, and some of it may get clawed back if the European Commission's verdict isn't overturned. Investors of all stripes should keep an eye on this conflict, because the effects will spread far beyond Apple. Anders Bylund has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Yesterday, the EU’s executive branch ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros—about $14.5 billion—plus interest in back taxes. According to the EU, Ireland gave Apple preferential tax treatment, allowing the American company to avoid taxes other businesses would have to pay. The decision could be a bad sign for Amazon, which could be on the hook for hundreds of millions of euros in back taxes in Luxembourg. And it’s part of growing trend, as the EU cracks down on American tech companies over all sorts of issues. Earlier this year, the EU filed an antitrust complaint against Google over its Android operating system. Last year, it filed another over the Google search engine and sided with activists in a lawsuit against Facebook that overturned long standing data sharing rules. Both Apple and Ireland deny the EU’s claims and plan to appeal the decision, and you can bet Amazon will too if the EU orders it to pay back taxes as well. Google is still fighting the EU’s antitrust suits. But for all these companies, the road ahead will be long and difficult. Playing Favorites The EU alleges that Ireland gave Apple an unfair advantage in the form of two tax rulings that allowed the company to route its profits to a head office that wasn’t based in any country and didn’t have any employees or own premises. “Therefore, only a small percentage of Apple Sales International’s profits were taxed in Ireland, and the rest was taxed nowhere,” the EU’s announcement says. Based on its total European profits, the EU estimates that Apple effectively paid a tax rate of only about 0.05 percent. This, in and of itself, was not against law, the announcement explains. The problem, the EU says, is that Ireland gave Apple the privilege without giving it to others. The EU concluded that based on what other companies paid, Apple should have paid an extra $14.5 billion for the period between 2003 to 2014. Rather than merely force Ireland to change its tax policies—or fine the country for breaking EU law—the EU has instead ordered Apple to pay the amount that EU believes it should have paid in the first place. The bigger issue for the EU commissioners, however, might be that because all of Apple’s European profits flow towards its Irish subsidiaries, no other EU member state is able to tax the company, even for gadgets sold in their countries. The EU’s announcement notes that Apple’s tax bill could be reduced if other EU countries forced Apple to pay taxes for that period as well. In other words, if Ireland doesn’t want the money, the EU thinks perhaps some other member countries might. But Apple claims it didn’t receive preferential treatment from the Irish government. “The opinion issued on August 30th alleges that Ireland gave Apple a special deal on our taxes,” the company said in a statement. “This claim has no basis in fact or in law. We never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals.” Ireland also denies wrongdoing. “Ireland does not do deals with taxpayers,” Irish Minister for Finance Michael Noonan said in a statement published today. Tough on Tech Tech companies aren’t the only ones under the microscope. In addition to investigating Amazon’s Luxembourg arrangement, the EU is looking into the country’s dealings with McDonald’s, and has already ordered Starbuck and Fiat to pay millions in back taxes and ruled that a Belgian tax break used by Anheuser-Busch InBev, BP, and others is illegal. But the EU’s interest in tech companies is what has captured the most attention. Its relatively hard line against Silicon Valley companies seems to stand in stark contrast to the US, where governments are often perceived to be giving tech a free pass. Uber has managed to steamroll local regulators, while Silicon Valley, which is becoming a revolving door for White House staffers, spends millions to lobby the government at the national level. Google in particular has enjoyed a cozy relationship with the Obama administration. The EU may not have actually earned its reputation for being tough on tech. It recently urged member countries to go easy on Airbnb and Uber, and privacy advocates argue that its new data privacy rules don’t go far enough. But the bigger question is whether any government still has the capacity to regulate the Internet giants, who are only becoming more powerful. The EU’s cases against Apple, Amazon, and Google won’t answer that question. But it may give us some hints as to what the future holds. Go Back to Top.

(AFP photos) The White House has voiced concern over economic consequences of the European Commission’s order for the Apple Company to pay billions in unpaid taxes, saying the move could threaten the long-sought fairness of the international tax system. "We are concerned about a unilateral approach... that threaten to undermine progress that we have made collaboratively with the Europeans to make the international taxation system fair," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a press briefing on Tuesday. Describing the move as unfair to US taxpayers, Earnest added that the administration of US President Barack Obama had repeatedly reiterated its "willingness to go and fight for" American taxpayers and American businesses overseas, which were being "treated unfairly." The comments were made after the European Union ordered the US tech giant to pay some 13 billion euros (14.5 billion dollars) of unpaid taxes to Ireland. Brussels accused Apple of avoiding tax payment for its business in Europe through illegal arrangements with Dublin. Dublin has also been accused of collaboration with Apple to evade taxes. Apple and the Irish government immediately said they would appeal against the 28-nation bloc’s ruling, with the company warning it could cost European jobs. This file photo shows a woman walking by an Apple logo during a media event in San Francisco, California. The US Treasury Department also slammed the EU’s move, saying, "We believe that retroactive tax assessments by the Commission are unfair, contrary to well-established legal principles and call into question the tax rules of individual member states," The case could "threaten to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the US and the EU," the department added. "Treasury is disappointed that the Commission is acting unilaterally and departing from the important progress the US, the EU, and the rest of the international community have made together to combat tax avoidance," it concluded. The European Commission (EC) is expected to rule on the case next month. This is the biggest corporate tax avoidance investigation ever undertaken by the commission. The EC is the executive body of the EU, responsible for implementing decisions, proposing legislation, upholding the EU treaties and managing the day-to-day business of the bloc. A 2013 report by the US Senate confirmed that Apple has paid little to no taxes on at least $74 billion of the profit it earned by exploiting Irish and American tax laws. Tim Cook, who became Apple’s CEO after the death of its founder Steve Jobs five years ago, has denounced the case as “political crap.” “There is no truth behind it,” he said. “Apple pays every tax dollar we owe.” The EU estimates that tax avoidance by multinational corporations costs member states anywhere between $50 million to $78 billion a year in lost taxes. In addition to Apple, other American companies like Amazon and Starbucks are also suspected of tax evasion. Loading ...

Apple’s first operations in Europe were in Ireland, where the company opened a factory in 1980. Since then Apple has continued to operate out of Ireland and according to the EU, the country has given special tax benefits to Apple. The EU alleges that the benefits Ireland gave to Apple were actually illegal, meaning Apple paid substantially less tax than other businesses. Apple CEO Tim Cook responded to the allegations, saying that the Apple has never asked, nor received any special deal on taxes.  He calls the commission’s ruling unprecedented. Cook ended his letter by saying Apple is committed to Ireland, regardless of how the European Union rules on the taxes. 7-Day Forecast Around our Area Center Providing Life Skills to their Clients Local Artist Talks About “Pure Charlevoix” Leadership Program is for Emerging Leaders A Women’s Club That’s not Just for Women Charlevoix Garden Club Enjoys Gardening BASES is Helping the Community of Charlevoix State News Vetoed Bill for Morel Mushrooms Electronic Licenses Bill Signed Possible Speed Limit Increase DNR Hosting Meeting for Proposed Plan in Muskegon Attorney General Reminds You to Shop Smart for Gym Membership Two Large Retailers are Closing Their Stores World News Microsoft Showed Future Plan at CES SeaWorld Killer Whale, Tilikum, Passed Away Macy’s Announced Store Closings Two Large Retailers are Closing Their Stores RECALL – J.M.

Europe’s competition enforcer said Apple’s illegal deals with the Irish government allowed the technology giant to pay virtually nothing on its European business in some years. The arrangements enabled Apple to funnel profit from two Irish subsidiaries to a “head office” with “no employees, no premises, no real activities,” the commission said. Advertisement By doing so, Apple paid only 50 euros in taxes for every 1 million euros in profit during 2014. As part of its ruling, Europe demanded that Ireland recoup 10 years’ worth of back taxes, some 13 billion euros, or about $14.5 billion, plus interest. The amount is a drop in the bucket for Apple, which has a total cash pile of more than $230 billion. Even so, the company described the order as a “devastating blow” to the rule of law. The US Treasury Department said it jeopardized “the important spirit of economic partnership between the US and the EU.” Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Since taking over as competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager has made tax avoidance a central focus, a campaign that has also ensnared Starbucks in the Netherlands, Amazon in Luxembourg, and Anheuser-Busch InBev in Belgium. The US Treasury, one of the most vocal critics of these moves, has said Europe is overstepping its power, unfairly targeting US companies and hurting global efforts to curtail tax avoidance. The US government is an unlikely advocate. Politicians have berated Apple for paying too little by setting up complex and opaque tax structures. Officials have hit back against corporate mergers that allowed companies to move their headquarters to such places as Ireland to take advantage of lower tax rates. But the positioning in the Apple case reflects a political tug of war over big profitable companies, their potential tax bounty, and the rights to regulate them. Advertisement “US companies are the grandmasters of tax avoidance,” said Edward D. Kleinbard, a professor at the Gould School of Law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. “Nevertheless, because of the nature of US politics,” he said, the Apple case “will be framed by the US as Europe overreaching and discriminating against ‘our team.’ ” Since early this year, Vestager and Jacob J. Lew, the US treasury secretary, and their teams have met regularly to discuss Europe’s tax investigations. Lew visited Brussels in July to put forward the US perspective. Last week, the Treasury Department released a report criticizing any moves to recoup back taxes from US companies. Politicians also chimed in after the Apple decision. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, called it a “cheap money grab” by the European Commission, “targeting US businesses and the US tax base.” The Senate Finance Committee chairman, Orrin G. Hatch, said the decision “encroaches on US tax jurisdiction.” Apple and Ireland had similar defenses. Timothy D. Cook, chief executive of the technology company, said Europe’s ruling had “no basis in fact or in law” and called it an effort to “rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws, and upend the international tax system in the process.” The company called the effective tax rate “a completely made-up number.” The Finance Ministry of Ireland said the commission’s decision would undermine a continuing global tax overhaul and create business uncertainty. The ministry said taxes were a “fundamental matter of sovereignty.” Ireland and Apple both said they intended to fight Europe’s decision, even though any appeal could take years. The commission said the amount due in Ireland could be reduced if US authorities decided that Apple should have paid more tax in the United States. Other countries in the European Union could also potentially take a share. “The ultimate goal should of course be that all companies, big or small, pay tax where they generate their profits,” the competition commissioner, Vestager, said at a news conference in Brussels on Tuesday. “We need a change in corporate philosophies and the right legislation to address loopholes and ensure transparency.” Although the United States appears to side with Apple and Ireland in this specific fight, the overall view is more complicated. A US Senate committee said in 2013 that Apple had negotiated a special corporate tax rate of 2 percent or less in Ireland. While the committee did not accuse Apple of breaking any laws, lawmakers criticized the “gimmicks,” “schemes” and complex corporate structures that allowed the company to sidestep taxes. The public scrutiny and the emergence of previously confidential information about Apple’s tax arrangements, in part, helped spark Europe’s own investigation into the issue. Apple and other companies have also faced criticism for keeping large reserves of cash overseas. The money is not taxed at home until it is brought back to the parent company in the United States. Nonfinancial US companies hold a combined $1.7 trillion in cash overseas, according to the credit rating agency Moody’s. Just the international piece of Apple’s stash amounts to nearly $215 billion.

Rendering from Foster + Partners European Union regulators announced today that following a two-year investigation into Ireland's treatment of two corporate entities operated by Apple in Cork, they've concluded that Ireland illegally offered tax breaks to Apple dating back to 1991 that by 2014 amounted to them paying an effective corporate tax rate of 0.005 percent. In a just-released statement, European competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said, "Member States cannot give tax benefits to selected companies  this is illegal under EU state aid rules... [and it's clear] Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years." Vestager says the European Commission concluded that Apple owes 13 billion euros, or $14.5 billion in back taxes, plus interest, after "two tax rulings issued by Ireland to Apple have substantially and artificially lowered the tax paid by Apple in Ireland since 1991." Apple CEO Tim Cook immediately issued an open letter "to the Apple community in Europe" saying that Apple's first operations in Cork date back 36 years, "long before introducing iPhone, iPod or even the Mac," and "As our business has grown over the years, we have become the largest taxpayer in Ireland, the largest taxpayer in the United States, and the largest taxpayer in the world." Cook says further, "The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process." And he says that the claim that Apple gave special tax breaks to the company "has no basis in fact or in law." As the SF Chronicle reports, Vestager went further in a news conference to illustrate her point about how easily Apple has been getting off, tax-wise, saying that for every million euros earned, Apple had only been paying 50 euros in tax. If Apple were to comply with the ruling, it would be a major windfall for Ireland, a country of just 4.6 million people, the equivalent of over $3,000 for every person there. This could get interesting given that claims about Apple dodging paying their fair share in taxes go back a while now, and Ireland has long been known as a low-tax shelter by many American companies. Back in 2012, the New York Times reported how Apple paid only $3 billion in worldwide taxes the previous year, an effective tax rate of 10 percent, which was about 14 percent less than one would expect from non-tech companies like Wal-Mart. They did this, reportedly, by allocating about 70 percent of its profits to overseas entities, including the two they own in Ireland. Earlier this year, the mayor of Cupertino, home to Apple HQ which is soon to look like a giant spaceship, was waging a campaign to shine light on how little Apple is paying in local and US taxes. Ron Eckstein of the advocacy group Americans for Tax Fairness put it this way: "They’re all just as good at engineering their own tax rates as they are at engineering new technology." As Bloomberg reports, Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said, "I disagree profoundly with the commission’s decision," and he claims that there had been no exceptions made in how Apple was taxed. Specifically, regulators object to the practice of routing all the company's European profits through the "head offices" in Ireland, and thereby justifying only paying taxes in that one low-tax country. From the statement: In fact, the tax treatment in Ireland enabled Apple to avoid taxation on almost all profits generated by sales of Apple products in the entire EU Single Market. This is due to Apple's decision to record all sales in Ireland rather than in the countries where the products were sold. This structure is however outside the remit of EU state aid control. If other countries were to require Apple to pay more tax on profits of the two companies over the same period under their national taxation rules, this would reduce the amount to be recovered by Ireland. Cook says that this ruling could "strike a devastating blow to the sovereignty of EU member states over their own tax matters," adding, "Ireland has said they plan to appeal the Commission’s ruling and Apple will do the same."

Apple now offers four iCloud storage tiers at prices that start at $0.99. The new 2TB iCloud storage option comes just over a week ahead of the company's September 7 event, where new versions of the iPhone and Apple Watch are expected to debut alongside new operating system updates. Rumors have suggested camera improvements could be one of the features coming to the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, and that could be one of the reasons Apple is introducing more storage space. A dual-lens camera, as is rumored for the iPhone 7 Plus, could potentially produce images that are larger, resulting in customers who need more space to store their photos and other files. We've also heard rumors that the high-end iPhone models could offer up to 256GB of storage (perhaps limited to the iPhone 7 Plus), which could be another factor leading to Apple's decision to increase available iCloud storage space. Perhaps the biggest reason for the jump in iCloud space is a new desktop syncing feature coming to macOS Sierra. In the new operating system, all files stored on the desktop or in the Documents folder of a Mac are automatically uploaded to iCloud to make them available across a wide range of devices.

Llamas The Associated Press NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico Every day of the year, droves of peasants from all over Mexico gather at a truck stop in this scruffy border town to begin their trip north. The journey to the United States is one of stark contradictions built on desperate promises of a better life and bone-chilling fears of what could happen along the way. Those making the trip know they have to be ready to ford rushing rivers, scale rocky mountains and brave barren deserts. They are prepared to endure a surreal mix of mind-numbing boredom and extreme physical excursion. Nuevo Laredo is where many would-be migrants from southern Oaxaca and Chiapas states come to cross the U.S. border. From the truck stop most will head to a sun-baked stretch of Mexicos border with the United States, reaching American soil through a clearing in the brush beside the highway to the nearby town of Piedras Negras. Most of those peasants arriving on buses from southern and central Mexico flock to the truck stop to meet with prearranged smugglers who they will pay between $200 and $1,000 to follow across the border. After the initial crossing, prices can double or triple depending on which state migrants want to reach. Other would-be migrants arrive without a contact and head to the truck stop where locals say finding border-crossing guides, known as coyotes or chicken keepers, is as easy as buying a soft drink. Those meeting smugglers are told to wait. They mill around the truck stop or sit in dingy hotel rooms for hours, days, weeks or months as their smugglers wait for more clients to arrive. Under a blistering summer sun, one of those recently waiting on his smuggler was Fidel Hernandez, a 40-year-old farmer from the nearby town of Nuevo Leob who said he has crossed the border eight times since first heading north in 1998. I went to improve my life, to improve the lives of my children, said Hernandez, who said the money he has earned picking fruit in California and Texas is putting his eight children through some of Mexicos finest private schools. Hernandez said he has made the trip north so many times that he no longer worries about dying or being capture by border guards. He said hes more worried that his children will grow up to be as desperate as he is. Hernandez said the trip he is waiting for begins when a van arrives to carry migrants and their smuggler to the highway. There drivers leave the smuggler and the group of migrants to hike for hours in the sun. The appointed crossing point is so close to a Mexican border checkpoint that any traffic heading there risks being searched, Hernandez said. Smugglers usually accompany the group to the clearing, before turning back to meet up with more clients in Nuevo Laredo. They always promise to catch up with the group hours later, at an appointed meeting point on the other side. Discuss Print Posted in Local News on Monday, July 30, 2001 12:00 am.

Subscribe Posted August 30, 2016 06:16 pm By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG ASSOCIATED PRESS Europe hits Apple with $15 billion-plus tax bill for Ireland SAN FRANCISCO — The European Union ordered Apple on Tuesday to pay nearly $15 billion in back taxes to Ireland, plus billions more in interest, in a move that dramatically escalates the fight over whether America’s biggest corporations are paying their fair share around the world. While Apple could easily afford the bill, the tech giant said it will challenge the EU decision, which found Ireland granted a sweetheart deal that let Apple pay almost no taxes across the European bloc for 11 years. And Ireland, which has long used low taxes to attract foreign businesses, said it will stand with Apple. “We now find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we don’t owe them any more than we’ve already paid,” Apple CEO Tim Cook complained in a statement. The White House also blasted the ruling as unfair and disruptive to its own efforts at tax reform. But the decision was welcomed by groups that have long criticized the practices used by Apple and other large companies to legally reduce their tax obligations. The ruling was the latest in a series of aggressive moves by European officials to hold U.S. businesses, particularly big tech companies, accountable under the EU’s rules on taxation, competition and privacy. “They’re going after Apple, which means a big name and big dollars,” said Brad Badertscher, a corporate tax expert at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business. “It’s a big shot across the pond to U.S. companies.” California-based Apple reported over $53 billion in profit in its last fiscal year on worldwide sales of more than $233 billion. It says it paid $13 billion in corporate income taxes globally. But EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Ireland granted such lavish tax breaks to Apple that the company’s effective corporate tax rate on its European profits dropped from 1 percent in 2003 to a mere 0.005 percent in 2014. While Apple disputed her figures, Vestager argued that Ireland violated EU rules by essentially giving subsidies to selected companies. Under its current arrangement, Apple treats virtually all sales of iPhones and other goods and services in the EU’s 28 nations as revenue generated by its Irish subsidiaries. Vestager ordered Ireland to recover the unpaid taxes for the years 2003 to 2014, plus interest, which one analyst said could amount to an additional 6 billion euros. For Ireland, a country of barely 4.6 million people, the sum would be a huge windfall — equivalent to over $3,150 for every man, woman and child. And yet the government said it will appeal the decision, arguing it granted no special treatment to Apple. Ireland has for years offered low corporate tax rates to multinationals, a common strategy among Europe’s smaller countries, including Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Multinationals have such huge revenue that these countries can reap big gains even from low taxes. They also benefit from the jobs created. Apple has 5,500 workers in Ireland, making it one of the biggest private-sector employers. “It is important that we send a strong message that Ireland remains an attractive and stable location of choice for long-term substantive investment,” said Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan. “Apple has been in Ireland since the 1980s and employs thousands of people in Cork.” Apple likewise argued that it followed the law and paid every cent of what it owed. “We are confident the commission’s order will be overturned,” Cook said, while also warning: “Beyond the obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe.” Badertscher agreed the ruling could discourage U.S. companies from investing in Europe. But others applauded the crackdown on what they described as a “race to the bottom” by individual nations offering lower tax rates than their neighbors. “To its credit, the European Union understands that when member nations act as tax havens, as Ireland has, there are casualties far beyond the borders of Ireland,” said Matthew Gardner, executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a liberal research group in Washington. “It’s not a good economic development strategy for Ireland in the long run, and it also subverts the tax system of every other member nation and nations around world,” he added. But the EU’s move risks the ire of the United States. In recent weeks, the Obama administration warned European officials that their investigations seemed to be unfairly singling out U.S. companies. U.S. Treasury officials also complained that imposing European taxes retroactively could hurt American taxpayers, since U.S. companies can receive a tax credit in this country for taxes paid overseas. Apple, along with other big U.S. multinationals, has built a vast stockpile of cash from its foreign operations, but it has left the money overseas to avoid paying U.S. taxes that it would owe if it brought that money home. The company reported this summer that it holds nearly $215 billion in cash and securities overseas, much of it generated by its Irish subsidiaries. Cook has complained that high U.S. taxes have discouraged the company from bringing those earnings home. Apple said the EU ruling will have no immediate effect on its finances. Wall Street analysts agreed, noting the potential tax bill is a small fraction of the company’s cash stockpile.

X Government faces threat of split after EU’s Apple ruling Independents undecided over whether to support Noonan’s plan to appeal tax ruling Wed, Aug 31, 2016, 00:21 Updated: Wed, Aug 31, 2016, 09:45 Pat Leahy, Harry McGee Video Images Cliff Taylor, Managing Editor of The Irish Times, and Pat Leahy, Deputy Political Editor, react to the news that Apple have been ordered by the EU to pay €13bn in unpaid taxes to the Irish state. Minister for Finance Michael Noonan: Opposition TDs dispute his and the Department of Finance’s view that the billions in back taxes could not be spent on public services. Photograph: Aidan Crawley/Bloomberg         Independent Alliance Ministers were undecided last night on whether they would support the proposal from Minister for Finance Michael Noonan to appeal yesterday’s ruling from the European Commission which directed Apple to pay €13 billion in back taxes to the Irish State. The Cabinet will meet this morning to discuss the ruling. Mr Noonan will seek formal approval for the decision to appeal the directive but Fine Gael Ministers have already said repeatedly that the decision will be appealed, a position also endorsed by the Taoiseach. If the Independent Alliance Ministers do not agree to the appeal, it will place the future of the Coalition Government in immediate jeopardy, according to sources in Fine Gael. Independent Alliance Ministers were in contact with each other last night following briefings with Department of Finance officials and with their own independent advisers. However, sources close to Independent Alliance Ministers said that they had not decided whether to agree to an appeal, and would not decide until they meet before Cabinet this morning. Yesterday, the European Commission announced that Apple’s tax arrangements – which enabled it to channel profits earned in Europe and other markets outside the US through Ireland without paying tax on the bulk of them – constituted a form of illegal state aid to the firm. Consequently, the commission ruled, Apple must pay the State back taxes of €13 billion, plus interest – which by some estimates could add several billion euro. The unexpectedly large sum calculated by the commission took many in political circles by surprise, including a number of the Independent Alliance members who had anticipated a sum of €6 billion-€7 billion following briefings from Mr Noonan and his officials on Monday. It also precipitated a storm of criticism for Mr Noonan’s stated intention of appealing the ruling, with Sinn Féin and the People Before Profit-Anti Austerity Alliance group demanding that the State accept the money and begin to spend it. ADVERTISEMENT The Apple tax ruling The EC issued a ruling on August 30th in relation to the tax arrangements of Apple in Ireland, where it has its European HQ. The EC said Apple had been granted selective treatment by Ireland through two tax rulings in 1991 and 2007. The EC has ordered Ireland to recover up to €13 billion from the tech giant.  Minister for Finance Michael Noonan indicated Ireland would appeal the decision "to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation”. Q&A: Cliff Taylor answers the key questions I found this helpful Yes No People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett accused the “entire political establishment” of having “colluded with Apple in an act of economic treason to rob the public of billions of desperately needed cash for public housing and other cash starved public services.” Public inquiry Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty also called for a public inquiry into Apple’s tax arrangements. Department of Finance officials confirmed that once collected from Apple in the coming months, the €13 billion sum, plus interest, will be lodged in an escrow account pending the outcome of the appeals process, which could take several years. Department of Finance officials and Ministers said that, even if Ireland loses the appeal and is ultimately paid the money, it will be required by EU rules to use it to pay down the national debt, rather than invest it in public services and infrastructure. However, this is disputed by Opposition TDs. Apple issued a statement rejecting the findings and saying the company now found itself required to pay tax to a government which says no tax is owed. The Government immediately began an aggressive campaign against the ruling. According to a briefing document obtained by The Irish Times, the Government believes it would be “irresponsible and extremely short-sighted to consider the European Commission decision as a windfall for the State.” “Keeping the money would mean accepting the commission’s hugely damaging analysis which would mean, agreeing that Ireland provided illegal state aid; accepting the commission’s encroachment into sovereign tax rights; and creating huge uncertainty for business in Ireland,” the document states. Speaking yesterday, Mr Noonan likened accepting the money to “eating the seed potatoes.” The Government also accused the commission of encroaching into an area – taxation – where it has no powers. However, announcing the ruling in Brussels, European commissioner for competition Margrette Vestager said that EU state aid rules applied to taxation as well as other areas of activity and were in place to protect EU taxpayers. So-called head office Ms Vestager said that Apple had allocated most of its profits to a so-called head office incorporated in Ireland but which existed only on paper. “It has no employees, no premises and no real activities,” she said. EU politicians in Brussels widely welcomed the European Commission’s decision. However, the reaction in the US was predictably more hostile, with White House spokesman Josh Learner confirming that the Obama administration had been contacted by Apple executives in the wake of the Brussels announcement. The White House expressed concern too about the commission’s ruling saying that American taxpayers will ultimately foot the €13 billion tax bill imposed by the EU on Apple.       Topics: Harry Mcgee Josh Learner Margrette Vestager Michael Noonan Pat Leahy Pearse Doherty Richard Boyd Barrett Department of Finance Eu European Commission Fine Gael Obama Administration People Before Profit Alliance Sinn Fein White House Apple Profit Anti Brussels Ireland United States Read More Inside China’s ‘iPhone City’, the land of sweeteners and perks John McManus: Apple’s adventures in tax wonderland Apple ruling: EU accuses Ireland of inconsistencies on tax rules Apple dismisses tax bill, says Ireland ‘doesn’t do any engineering for us’ Cliff Taylor: Battle lines drawn in State’s EU Apple appeal Court ruling on Spanish tax may give clues to Apple appeal Meet ‘the Maxforce’ – the EU team that fined Ireland €13bn over Apple Apple CEO invited to attend tax ruling hearing in Dublin EU Court asks Government to tweak its Apple tax appeal European Commission refuses to comment on Noonan claims Leading US politicians criticise EU ruling on Apple Apple’s €13bn Irish tax bill does not contain seeds of change Apple claims it paid $800m tax on European profits in 2014 Business Podcast: Making sense of the Apple ruling Independent Ministers demand early recall of Dáil to debate Apple appeal Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy Nearly everybody paid their property tax last year Technology CES 2017: Anglers get a helping hand from PowerRay Pro12 Johnny Sexton cruises on return as Leinster hammer sorry Zebre Economy Draghi’s German problem has come back to haunt him Sponsored Making a difficult fertility journey a lot less lonely Redbreast Lustau: an old friend with a new whiskey perspective Infertility and the workplace: one woman's experience Do you know how much you’ll save by switching health plan?

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Saturday January 7, 2017 News Business Larger / SmallerNight Mode Apple Ireland ruling heralds twilight of easy European tax deals Alex Webb and Adam Satariano 31 Aug 2016, 9:04 a.m. The days when big multnationals could easily slice tax bills in Europe are coming to an end. The EU tax ruling will not only affect Apple, but the likes of Amazon, Google and McDonald's as well. Apple Ireland ruling heralds twilight of easy European tax deals Europe's tax ruling on Apple sends a bright red warning shot to multinationals across the board. Photo: Carl Court Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit The days when big multinational technology companies could easily slice tax bills in Europe are coming to an end. For decades, businesses like Apple that generate significant revenue around the globe flocked to Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, where they counted on amenable fiscal regimes to reduce their tax, even if they had minimal operations on the ground. On Tuesday, European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager sent the strongest signal yet that she won't abide by these strategies when she demanded Apple pay €13 billion ($19.3 billion) in back taxes. "Every global company that is exposed to EU taxes in individual nations now has to look back and ask whether any of their agreements are subject to similar attacks," said Thomas Cooke, a professor at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business. "This is the first signal of a long play that's going to take place over many, many months." Every time an iPhone or iPad is purchased in London, Paris or Milan, Apple books the profit at a subsidiary in the Irish city of Cork. The process is part of a decades-long arrangement with the Irish government that's allowed the company to pay lower taxes on these European sales. The European Commission ruled that Ireland gave Apple illegally favourable tax treatment, letting it pay an effective tax rate on European profits of 1 per cent in 2003 and down to 0.005 per cent in 2014. Apple and Ireland vowed to appeal. Source: European Commission Apple's Irish tax arrangement was considered "the most brazen" among multinational techy companies, said Aisling Donohue, a partner at tax and business advisory firm MGPartners in Ireland. While other companies should be concerned, they aren't likely to face as much scrutiny, she said. Broader push Still, Vestager's move is part of a broader push to close loopholes that European regulators think give foreign companies an advantage. Google parent Alphabet has also been a beneficiary of Ireland's tax regime, using the so-called "Double Irish" mechanism to save billions in tax on its international earnings. Ireland is phasing this out, although companies have until 2021 to adjust. Amazon.com used a similar process to effectively send profit through Luxembourg. In Europe, the e-commerce giant told authorities that the intellectual property behind its web shopping platform was immensely valuable, justifying the billions in tax-free revenue it collected there since moving its technology assets to Luxembourg a decade ago. In the US it played down the value of those same assets to explain why it paid so little in taxes for licensing them. That prompted investigations on both sides of the Atlantic and Amazon changed its policy in 2015, largely eliminating the practice. "You can't bank on achieving the savings in post-tax profits that you might have once expected," said Jolyon Maugham, a British trial lawyer specialising in tax cases at Devereux Chambers. "That makes the pursuit of such strategies rather more difficult to justify." Unsustainable About six months ago, Netflix told an investor that the company will likely pay higher international tax rates than other large US technology companies currently pay. Netflix, which recently began expanding aggressively abroad, said it views other US tech companies' international tax strategies as unsustainable, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person didn't want to be identified recounting a private discussion. "Multinationals with aggressive tax planning strategies can expect to pay more tax," Sarah Jane Mahmud, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, wrote in a recent research note. "EU reforms will require income to be taxed where generated through, among other things, new restrictions on use of controlled foreign companies." A Netflix spokeswoman didn't respond to requests seeking comment Tuesday. Spokesmen at Alphabet and Amazon declined to comment. 'Apple follows the law' Even if Apple has to pay billions and other tax strategies fizzle, Ireland's 12.5 per cent corporate rate means it's still likely to trump its homemarket US as a preferred corporate tax domicile. The iPhone maker has been there since opening a factory in Cork in 1980. "We received guidance from Irish tax authorities on how to comply correctly with Irish tax law - the same kind of guidance available to any company doing business there," CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. "In Ireland and in every country where we operate, Apple follows the law and we pay all the taxes we owe." The timing of Europe's decision, ahead of the US presidential election, means tax reform may become a more prominent issue. Donald Trump proposed taxing companies' accumulated offshore profit at 10 per cent, compared with the current top corporate rate of 35 per cent. The tax Apple pays abroad is deductible from the 35 per cent it must pay should it bring offshore profits home. Implications for other multinationals One major tech investor said low European taxes don't help international investors because the resulting higher overseas profits are still out of reach for things like share buybacks, dividends and acquisitions of other global companies. If European tax rates rise, there would be more incentive to repatriate the money to the countries where revenues are generated, said the investor, who asked not to be named discussing internal strategy ideas. The Apple ruling adds more pressure on the US to overhaul its tax system. And the US is not the only market where calls to end multinationals' tax dodging will get new intensity: According to a report published by Oxfam in June using IMF data, Australia misses out on $6 billion in annual revenue from big international companies operating here but using low-tax or no-tax nations to avoid paying tax locally. Apart from Ireland, the tax havens cited in the report included other European nations such as the Netherlands, Malta, Luxembourg, Belgium and Austria. Meanwhile, for Apple and its rivals, there's another sting in the spectacular Ireland ruling: The revelation that a regulator can impose higher tax bills retroactively - even though they were legal according to national laws - will top companies' list of concerns, according to Adam Halpern, a tax lawyer at Fenwick & West. "You thought you understood what your risk profile was in terms of tax, and then a regional non-governmental agency comes in and tells you to pay more," he said.

NEW YORK: Wall Street traded flat early Tuesday as Apple shares took a modest loss following an order from the European Union to pay $14.5 billion in back taxes. Apple was down 0.5 percent shortly after 1400 GMT, making for a more than 3 percent loss in the past two weeks as the European Commission's decision loomed. Retailers meanwhile showed signs of trouble, with fashion chain Abercrombie & Fitch down 21 percent after disappointing second-quarter results. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1 percent at 18,484.12 while the S&P 500 was virtually unchanged at 2,180.19. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 0.2 percent at 5,240.42. The EC announced Tuesday that Apple owed $14.5 billion in back taxes to Ireland, which its said had shown preferential treatment to the company. The company said it would fight the decision and predicted it would win. "Ireland has said they plan to appeal the Commission's ruling and Apple will do the same. We are confident that the Commission's order will be reversed," said chief executive Tim Cook. Shares in other Silicon Valley players saw little movement. Google parent Alphabet lost 0.3 percent. Microsoft was down less 0.2 percent. HP fell less than 0.1 percent while IBM was essentially flat. Along with Abercrombie & Fitch's troubles, other retailers were also in negative territory, with Gap down 2.8 percent, Nordstrom down 1.4 percent, Urban Outfitters off 1.3 percent and American Eagle Outfitters down 1.2 percent. Major oil companies were all modestly upward-bound. Chevron was up 0.3 percent, Exxon Mobil added 0.1 percent and Marathon Petroleum 0.2 percent. Apple shares lost some of their shine on Tuesday after the European Union ordered the US tech giant to pay a record $14.5 billion in back taxes in Ireland. Shares in the iPhone and iPad maker fell 0.4 percent after the European Commission concluded that Dublin had shown preferential treatment to the California tech giant. Including this morning's loss, shares in the company had fallen 3.3 percent in the two weeks ahead of the widely-anticipated decision. Apple has vowed to appeal the ruling, as has Ireland, which has sought to attract foreign firms with its low corporate tax rate and willingness to negotiate specific tax treatment.  Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus E-Paper Aaj Kal Sunday Magazine sunday magazine aaj kal Business Plus TGIF Zaiqa TV Company Financials Contact us Privacy Policy TERMS AND CONDITIONS © 2016 Dailytimes - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Powered By opustech.co
EU Orders Apple to Pay $14.5 Billion in Back Taxes to Ireland VOA News Facebook 0 Twitter 0 E-mail More Google+ LinkedIn KakaoStory August 31, 2016 08:11 The European Union's antitrust regulator Tuesday ordered technology giant Apple to repay Ireland $14.5 billion in back taxes, saying the world's most valuable company received an unfair tax break from Dublin and managed to avoid almost all corporate taxes across the 28-nation bloc for more than a decade. Apple chief executive Tim Cook immediately said the U.S.-based multi-national company would appeal the ruling, as did Ireland. Ireland, however, was placed in the odd position of rejecting a payment that is the equivalent of 5 percent of its national economic product and officials expressed concerns that the ruling against Apple could hurt the country's longtime reputation as a low-tax haven with an open door for international investment. In Washington, U.S. officials also voiced their disappointment in the decision. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said U.S. taxpayers could eventually bear the brunt of the decision, if Apple is forced to make the payment, because the company then could deduct the billions it pays Ireland from the U.S. taxes it owes. "We are concerned about a unilateral approach," Earnest said, adding that it "threatens to undermine progress that we have made collaboratively with the Europeans to make the international taxation system fair" for both taxpayers and companies. The U.S. Treasury called the ruling "unfair, contrary to well-established legal principles." European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager speaks during a media conference at EU headquarters in Brussels on Aug. 30, 2016. /AP ◆ Tax Rate of 0.005 Percent The EU's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager said, "Tax rulings granted by Ireland have artificially reduced Apple's tax burden for over two decades, in breach of the EU state aid rules. Apple now has to repay the benefits." She questioned how anyone might think that Apple's 2014 Irish tax rate of 0.005 percent was fair. Apple employs nearly 6,000 people in Ireland. Cook said he was "confident" the tax ruling would be overturned. The technology giant, the maker of the popular iPhones, was able to legally funnel its international sales revenue through Ireland in order to lower its tax payments; however, the commission ruled that European law makes it illegal for a company to receive state tax aid, and would require Apple to pay back Ireland for the tax breaks it received. Vestager said that Apple illegally benefited from a tax deal with Ireland that no other business received. "Member states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies – this is illegal under EU state aid rules," she said in a statement. “The commission's investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years." ◆ Funneling All Through One Country Apple took all of its profits from European sales and recorded them in Ireland. From there, the majority of Apple's European profits were allocated to a "head office" within the company that had no physical presence or employees in any country. Only a small fraction of Apple's profits was allocated to its "Irish branch" so only those profits were taxed by Ireland. That allowed Apple to pay just over $11 million in corporate taxes in 2011 -- an effective tax rate of less than 1 percent. In the following years, Apple’s profits continued to increase, but its tax payments continued to decrease. The European Commission ruling marks Europe’s largest-ever tax penalty -- though Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan immediately indicated the country will appeal the ruling. "The decision leaves me with no choice but to seek Cabinet approval to appeal the decision before the European courts," Noonan said in a statement. "This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system, to provide tax certainty to business, and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules." Last month, the U.S. Treasury Department criticized the European Commission, accusing it of unfairly singling out U.S. companies for punishment under its "new approach" to dealing with legal tax breaks given to multinational corporations operating within its member states. The commission denied that it is targeting U.S. businesses, and instead said that EU rules ban member states from offering tax breaks that are not available in other European countries. "This is a standard feature of EU state aid rules," the commission said in a statement. Copyright © Chosunilbo & Chosun.com Previous Next All Headlines Back to Top

The issue of tax and tech slammed into the markets today when the EC said Apple owed $14.5bn in taxes to Ireland from its business practices going back ten years. The EC has not imposed any fine. It has calculated that through its tax relationship with the Republic of Ireland Apple underpaid on tax owed on goods sold throughout the EU over a ten year period. Ireland has said it has not offered any illegal tax status to Apple or its subsidiaries located in Ireland and it would appeal the ruling in the courts. The Irish Government said it profoundly disagrees with the EC ruling and that all of its tax behaviour “was founded on the strict application of the law.” Tax and tech is hugely controversial. Last year the UK Government reached a tax settlement with Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which saw it pay £130m in missed tax payments. Since last summer when it was revealed just how little some tech firms were paying in UK tax, just how much multi-national online companies pay into the UK exchequer has come under increased scrutiny.  For example the question of how much tax Amazon and other cloud companies pay on revenue generated through goods sold in the UK is a hot political topic. Today’s ruling has seen that issue re-emerge with media outlets such as thesun covering the topic with an article asking what it means for the tax arrangements of Amazon and McDonalds. The issues in this game are consistent: What’s a fair amount of tax for a firm to pay? How much does tax affect inward investment plans? What are its obligations that a company has to its host country? What are the host country’s priorities? The Ireland/Apple case is unusual in that both Ireland and Apple have said they will appeal this ruling in the courts. Both see themselves as victims of an unjust ruling. In a statement Apple said: "The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process. The commission’s case is not about how much Apple pays in taxes, it’s about which government collects the money. It will have a profound and harmful effect on investment and job creation in Europe. Apple follows the law and pays all of the taxes we owe wherever we operate. We will appeal and we are confident the decision will be overturned.” Implications for the UK inward investment. As CBR wrote after the Brexit vote, companies make long term investment decisions for  a wide variety of reasons. The attractiveness of the UK for foreign direct investment from large multi-national technology businesses remains strong. Whether the type of retrospective action taken by the EC might push multi-national companies to consider the UK more favourably as a location for investment remains to be seen.  Any direct fall out, while probably not unlikely, will be difficult to map. Proponents of Brexit are likely to see today’s ruling as a positive. This is because in the long term the UK won’t have to answer directly to the European Commission. However this will be balanced against a myriad of other factors. Already there is talk of the UK setting its own corporation tax rate, at a level lower than that in the rest of the EU. But if today’s ruling tells us anything it is that actions on tax rates tend to have reactions. How countries treat foreign direct investors has always been a divisive issue and as today’s decision shows, even within a free trade area such as the European Economic Area, governed by a supranational bodies of the EU where countries are supposed not to behave in anti-competitive ways and seek unfair advantage over their fellow members, the stakes are so high that the players don’t hesitate to resort to the courts to protect their interests. Attracting inward investment has always been politically sensitive. The finely balanced political game of attracting big company inward investment without being seen to be offering unfair sweetheart deals on tax – which tend to annoy voters and create unfair competition for home grown companies – and creating new technology jobs and a digital economy is becoming more complex. The inter-relationships to be considered go beyond the shores of the UK economy. The old days of inward investment win and lose in the technology space were often based on creating plant and factories which meant companies and countries were locked in. The marriage of convenience had to have some longevity. However the very agility and flexibility that many of today’s tech companies are offering mean capital and investment and therefore jobs and tax generation can move across borders much more quickly. It would naive to believe that companies and countries won't contiue to seek advantages. Politicians and technocrats need to make the rules clear and apply them consistently. Companies need to behave appropriately and recognise that just as customers make markets and must come first, those customers seeking the best deal are also citizens which drive political policy and actions. What today's actions have shown is that the debate on how much tax tech businesses pay in the UK is never far below the surface.     Previous ArticleMoving IT from the back office to the board room Next ArticleEquinix to spend £26m for UK data centre expansion Most read Inside Silicon Valley Startup Rubrik: Reinventing Cloud Backup Ellie Burns 5th January 2017 Cyber attack ‘fear factor’ sends UK cyber insurance soaring Ellie Burns 5th January 2017 House of Fraser banks on Tandem to improve customer finance James Nunns 4th January 2017 How to follow CES 2017: From Twitter to Live Streams – don’t miss any CES news Ellie Burns 3rd January 2017 Manchester City scores Google backing for hackathon James Nunns 3rd January 2017 What were the Biggest Tech Stories of 2016 Ambrose McNevin 23rd December 2016 2017 cloud predictions: Hear what Microsoft, Salesforce, VMware & more see for the future of cloud James Nunns 23rd December 2016 Latest White Papers How Intel IT’s Integrated Analytics Platform Helps Sales and Marketing By Intel HPE Security Research – Cyber Risk Report 2016 By HPE Le stockage de demain By Kaminario Editor’s Pick Google Tango, Accenture & BMW create an augmented reality revolution James Nunns 5th January 2017 Is the European Commission picking winners in the broadband delivery stakes?

Apple`s shares fell 0.8 percent on the Nasdaq, leaving them down 3.2 percent over the last two weeks as the European Commission decision loomed. Apple said it will challenge the ruling that it was given unwarranted tax breaks by Ireland. Meanwhile, a drop in eurozone business confidence saw markets in Paris and Frankfurt finish higher on expectations that the European Central Bank will increase stimulus measures. A sharp monthly rise in US consumer confidence for August that was reported Tuesday did not appear to inspire buyers on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 percent while the broader S&P 500 lost 0.2 percent and the Nasdaq was down 0.2 percent. Bill Lynch of Hinsdale Associates told AFP there had been little to move US markets one way or another in late summer trading. "We were up yesterday so we`re just giving up some of the gains," he said. Lynch added that markets may be treading water in advance of Friday`s figures on US job creation in March, which will help determine the likelihood of a near-term increase in US interest rates. Shares in other multinationals which, like Apple, run much of their international operations via Ireland, such as Google parent Alphabet and Facebook, also dipped. Microsoft and HP fell 0.4 percent while Google parent Alphabet Inc was down 0.5 percent.The EU has recently stepped up its campaign against deep corporate tax breaks from member states, last year ordering US coffee giant Starbucks and Italian automaker Fiat each to repay up to 30 million euros in back taxes to the Netherlands and Luxembourg respectively. ETX Capital analyst Neil Wilson said investors were fretting over the longer term implications rather than the size of the fine. "For Apple and others like it, this could be a watershed," Wilson added. "Caught between an aggressive EC and the Obama regime`s clampdown on tax inversions, it`s looking increasingly tough for multinationals to avoid paying the going tax rate." In Europe, Frankfurt`s DAX 30 finished up 1.1 percent and the CAC 40 in Paris added 0.8 percent as weak German inflation and a drop in eurozone business confidence raised hopes the ECB will beef up stimulus. The Economic Sentiment Indicator for the 19-nation eurozone fell one full point to 103.5 in August as Britain`s vote to quit the European Union continued to undermine business and consumer confidence in August. Meanwhile Germany`s 12-month inflation rate dipped to 0.3 percent in August, suggesting central bank easing is not yet bearing fruit. "The ECB has reason to increase its policy support, perhaps as soon as next week," Jack Allen at Capital Economics wrote. London`s FTSE 100 index dipped 0.3 percent after a long holiday weekend. Asian equities mostly rose on Tuesday, but Tokyo ended slightly lower on tepid data and profit-taking.

There was never much doubt that large multinational companies enjoy a great deal of leverage over governments at all levels — local, state, even national — but on Tuesday, European regulators actually quantified it. Related News/Archive Airbnb nears tax deal with Hillsborough County as college football championship nears 3 Weeks Ago Tampa drops idea of steering slice of tax revenue from downtown to Ybor 2 Weeks Ago Security to be tight for college football championship game 2 Weeks Ago European Commission officials allege that Ireland's government secured 5,500 jobs from Apple by striking a tax agreement that allowed the company to underpay its taxes by $14.5 billion between 2003 and 2014. The arrangement made the company's effective Irish tax rate no higher than 1 percent over that time. The ruling adds to a strained relationship between the United States and the European Union over who has the right to regulate tax payments by some of the world's largest companies. The European Commission, under the leadership of Margrethe Vestager, the competition chief, has aggressively sought to stamp out sweetheart tax deals that countries strike with multinational companies. Along with Apple, the campaign has also ensnared Starbucks in the Netherlands, Amazon in Luxembourg and Anheuser-Busch InBev in Belgium. If it stands, the European ruling would force Apple to pay that $14.5 billion to Ireland. But Irish leaders don't want the money; they say they will appeal the ruling, as will the company. You can read that desire to appeal a lot of ways, but here's the easiest one: A tax-friendly relationship with Apple, and its 5,500 jobs, is worth more to Ireland than $14.5 billion. That's the minimum value of Apple's leverage over the country for the period 2003-2014. As a straight calculation, it works out to $220,000 per job, per year. That seems like a heavy subsidy for any government to pay a corporation, let alone the most profitable corporation in the history of the world, which Apple happens to be. Apple says it has invested nearly 140 million euros in Cork, Ireland, since 2012, in order to expand its campus there — where it is the largest private employer. It says it will eventually add 1,000 more workers, and it claims its spending has supported 2,500 jobs in "services such as facilities, catering, security, recruitment, printing, fulfillment and maintenance." This is a familiar story to anyone who has covered economic development policy in almost any state in America in the past quarter-century. Companies, particularly large companies, use their leverage over lawmakers to win tax concessions, a practice exhaustively documented by the group Good Jobs First. It doesn't always work — the fact that every tech company in Silicon Valley hasn't been lured to a lower-tax state shows how companies factor things other than tax rates into their location decisions — but it often does. It's true internationally, as well. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently told the Washington Post that the company won't bring its international cash stockpile back to the United States to invest here until there's a "fair rate" for corporate taxation in America. There are two big issues here, for policymakers at every level of government. One is about companies that don't have much leverage: small businesses, or businesses that only exist in an entrepreneur's mind. Those companies are the losers when big companies are taxed lower than everyone else. That's a key argument European officials made in targeting Apple. The other issue, though, is transparent incentives. Existing companies rationally want to minimize their tax bills, and lawmakers rationally want to maximize economic growth in their areas. Those forces push toward better and better tax deals for the biggest companies. They are the reason Ireland's relationship with Apple is worth $220,000 per job, if the alternative is no jobs and no investment. As long as companies have that much leverage, the math will keep working in their favor.

USA TODAY For Apple, the $14.5 billion fine amounts to 6% of its cash and investments of $232.4 billion as of June. (Photo: Justin Sullivan) Apple's (AAPL) tax policy caught up with it Tuesday after the European Union demanded $14.5 billion to be repaid after a decade of lucrative tax breaks in Ireland. A blow that big could sink many companies, but it's a drop in the bucket for Apple. A tax repayment of $14.5 billion would wipe out the entire year's profits of 487 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500, individually. Apple isn't most companies, though, it can easily afford to pay back the money. For Apple, the $14.5 billion fine amounts to a mere 6% of its cash and investments of $232.4 billion as of June. Apple generates nearly four times more than the size of the tax penalty in free cash flow in just one year, making this $14.5 billion hit a little more than a financial annoyance. Apple paid an effective tax rate of 1% on its European profits in 2003 and as little as 0.005% in 2014, according to a report to clients from Credit Suisse to clients co-authored by analyst Kulbinder Garcha. USA TODAY Apple's tax clash could soon extend to others Investors wonder what the loss of this lucrative tax shelter will mean for profits going forward, which is the more important consideration at this point. "The implications of of this ruling remain unclear and difficult to determine," according to the Credit Suisse report. Taxes could suddenly become a more important line item to Apple. The company was able to reduce its tax load using a variety of "complex entities" such as Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe, Credit Suisse says. Credit Suisse estimates that Apple's effective tax rate should have been roughly 5% higher than it was. Apple's effective tax rate over the past 12 months has been 25.6%. Investors seem to be taking the decision in stride. The stock was down less than 1% at $105.92 in early afternoon trading, but closed at $106, down .77%. Perhaps they figure Apple can appeal its way out of making the entire repayment. "We believe the Apple will not likely pay this entire amount as both Apple and Ireland have stated that they will appeal the ruling," the Credit Suisse report says.

Apple and Dublin said the U.S. company's tax treatment was in line with Irish and European Union law and they would appeal the ruling, which is part of a drive against what the EU says are sweetheart tax deals that usually smaller states in the bloc offer multinational companies to lure jobs and investment. The U.S. feels its firms are being targeted by the EU and a U.S. Treasury spokesperson warned the move threatens to undermine U.S. investment in Europe and "the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU." Starbucks Corp has been ordered to pay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) to the Dutch state, while Amazon.com Inc and McDonald's Corp are also under investigation by the Commission, the EU's executive arm. Apple's stock fell less than 1 percent. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager questioned how anyone might think an arrangement that allowed Apple to pay a tax rate of 0.005 percent, as Apple's main Irish unit did in 2014, was fair. "Tax rulings granted by Ireland have artificially reduced Apple's tax burden for over two decades, in breach of the EU state aid rules. Apple now has to repay the benefits," Vestager told a news conference. Analysts said the size of the claim underlined the Commission's aggressive stance, but since each case involves different circumstances and tax rules, lawyers said it was hard to see if further big claims were any more or less likely. Apple, which had more than $200 billion in cash and readily marketable securities at the end of June, is likely to see the case drag out for years in EU and possibly Irish courts. Apple warned investors in a July regulatory filing that the Commission's investigation could lead to "material" liability for further tax payments, but that it could not estimate the impact. On Tuesday the company said it expects to place "some amount of cash" in an escrow account. Tax experts say the European Commission faces a tough battle to convince courts to back up its stand. While the EU has found that certain tax regulations are anti-competitive, it has never before ruled whether countries have applied tax regulations fairly in the way it has with Apple, Starbucks and others. As a result, some lawyers and accountants said they doubted Apple would end up paying back any tax. "I am not persuaded by the reasoning the EU has applied," said Tim Wach, global managing director at international tax advisers Taxand. "ARTIFICIAL" ARRANGEMENT The EU's ruling challenges the way that Ireland agreed to tax the profits of Irish-registered Apple subsidiaries, through which most of its non-U.S. profits flowed. Apple Inc licences the rights to technology designed in the United States to Irish subsidiaries. These then hire contract manufacturers to make devices which they sell to Apple retail subsidiaries around Europe and Asia. Since the manufacturing cost is a small portion of device sales prices and retail subsidiaries are allocated a small operating margin, Apple Ireland is very profitable. In 2011, it earned $22 billion after paying $2 billion to its U.S. parent in relation to the rights to Apple intellectual property. However, the Irish tax authority agreed only 50 million euros of this was taxable in Ireland, the European Commission said. Under the terms of Apple's tax deal, first agreed in 1991 and renewed in 2007, Apple could allocate most of the profits earned by its Irish operating units to a "head office" that did not have any employees or own any premises. "This 'head office' had no operating capacity to handle and manage the distribution business, or any other substantive business for that matter," the Commission said. The Commission said this agreement had no basis in tax law and was not available to others, and so represented state aid. Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said he profoundly disagreed with the decision and in order to preserve Ireland's attractiveness for investment he would appeal. "There is no economic basis for this decision. It's bizarre and it's an exercise in politics by the Competition Commission," Noonan said. "They don't have responsibility for taxes and they are opening a back door through state aid to influence tax policy in European countries when the European treaties say tax policy is a matter for sovereign governments," he added. Ireland's low corporate tax rate has been a cornerstone of the country's economic policy for decades, drawing investors from multinational companies whose staff account for almost one in 10 of the country's workers. For many technology firms like Google and Facebook, a key attraction is that Ireland allows companies to adopt tax structures which see them pay much less than the 12.5 percent headline rate. The companies say they follow all tax rules. Apple said it was confident of winning an appeal. "The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple's history in Europe, ignore Ireland's tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process," CEO Tim Cook said in a letter to customers posted on Apple's website. "A company's profits should be taxed in the country where the value is created," he added. U.S. OPPOSITION The U.S. Treasury Department published a white paper last week in which it said it was looking at possible responses to what it sees as unfair targeting of its firms, which could include extra taxes on the U.S. arms of European companies. The paper noted that the EU executive's tax rulings could cost the U.S. exchequer money. Under U.S. tax law, Apple's Irish profits are taxable if brought back to the United States - something the company would have to do if it wanted to use the money to pay dividends. But any tax paid in Europe is reduced from the tax due in the United States. The Treasury has said the Commission's approach was at odds with EU tax law and international treaties. The Commission, which has also ruled European companies including carmaker Fiat and Swedish engineer Atlas Copco AB must pay tax claims worth over $350 million, said its application of competition law to tax rulings followed EU law and treated all companies equally. Nonetheless, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg have already appealed EU rulings against their tax deals with multinationals. Apple employs 5,500 people in areas such as logistics and distribution in the Irish city of Cork, which has about a quarter of Apple's Europe-based staff. The Commission has previously said Apple's tax treatment had been "motivated by employment considerations." Apple has said it paid Ireland's 12.5 percent rate on all the income that it generates in the country. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri decried the effective tax rate cited by Vestager as "a completely made-up number."

Happy New Year firework wallpapers   skip to main content skip to main menu     You can now buy 2TB of iCloud storage for $20/month, but free tier is still just 5GB By Christian Zibreg, Aug 30, 2016 Tweet 8 Comments With eight days left until Apple’s big iPhone 7 reveal scheduled for September 7, the company has just added a brand new two-terabyte tier to its iCloud storage upgrades. Now available for purchase on an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch in Settings → Storage, or a Mac in System Preferences → iCloud → Manage, it’ll set data-hungry users back $19.99 each month. Quickly, do the math in your head—at $20 per month, you’re looking at a yearly cost of $240 for the privilege of having two terabytes of iCloud storage for your device backups, photos, videos, personal information, files and whatever else you like. By comparison, Dropbox’s 1TB tier is a $99.99 per year value, or about $8.3 per month. Unfortunately, Apple’s free iCloud tier is still paltry five gigabytes. Price points for other tiers have not been tweaked. After today’s change, iCloud storage tiers are as follows: 5GB—free 50GB—$0.99 per month 200GB—$2.99 per month 1TB—$9.99 per month 2TB—$19.99 per month Check out Apple’s support document for availability information and pricing of iCloud storage upgrades around the world. The new tier makes sense for people who plan on using macOS Sierra’s new feature which keeps the contents of a user’s Documents and Desktop folders synchronized and available on iOS devices via iCloud Drive. Also, Sierra includes another feature, called Optimize Storage, that frees up storage space on your computer by keeping only the latest and frequently used files locally while storing those you access infrequently in iCloud. What do you think of the new 2TB iCloud tier? Does the fact that the new offering went live ahead of the iPhone 7 event indicate that the new phones will double the storage versus existing models, do you think? Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend Dropbox for iOS gains bulk renaming of photos, offline folders & recent save locations Google Drive becomes Android migration tool with contacts, photos, videos & calendar sync Apple to unify its separate cloud services teams to improve Siri, Maps, iTunes, iCloud & more OneDrive implements 3D Touch previews for files and folders Related Topics Apple, Cloud, iCloud, News, Storage Chris Gilmore I just use the .99, 50GB one. That with 64GB iPhone 6s is plenty for me. James G Don’t need it yet (currently on 1TB plan) but glad to see I won’t have to worry as my photo library grows with all the videos and photos with whatever new camera the iPhone 7 Plus will have. Wish they’d get more competitive with pricing but iCloud Drive supports iCloud Photo Library which is what really sets it apart. paul_krupa I am running MacOS on my MacBook pro and discovered that some VMs (GBs!!!) was syncing while I was tethering on my iPhone hotspot. So I went through my 30GB ATT data plan pretty fast last month before I realized what was up. The fix wasn’t too easy either. I had to copy the Documents folder to an external drive, disconnect Documents from icloud (which deletes local folder) and re-copy the Documents folder back. Fortunately I had a 128GB SSD that made the transfers real fast. diggitydang Where’s the Family Plan??? Come on, Apple. Tyler Smith They really need to become more competitive with their free version… Like 15 gb would be perfect for almost every iPhone user… but taking $12 bucks a year (i know its not much but thats not the point) is just petty. Joseph Jerry Hache iCloud storage would be fine if Apple made it easier to use. I bought the 200GB plan, and turned off all settings for using cellular data on my iPhone.

For decades, businesses like Apple that generate significant revenue around the globe flocked to Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, where they counted on amenable fiscal regimes to reduce their tax, even if they had minimal operations on the ground.

More videos EU slaps Apple with $19 billion tax bill Ireland gave undue tax benefits to Apple which Commissioner Margrethe Vestager says the tech giant now has to pay back. On Tuesday, European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager sent the strongest signal yet that she won't abide by these strategies when she demanded Apple pay €13 billion ($19.3 billion) in back taxes. "Every global company that is exposed to EU taxes in individual nations now has to look back and ask whether any of their agreements are subject to similar attacks," said Thomas Cooke, a professor at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business. "This is the first signal of a long play that's going to take place over many, many months." Related Content Apple ordered to pay Ireland over $19 billion, EU rules The tax havens costing Australia $6b a year Every time an iPhone or iPad is purchased in London, Paris or Milan, Apple books the profit at a subsidiary in the Irish city of Cork. The process is part of a decades-long arrangement with the Irish government that's allowed the company to pay lower taxes on these European sales. The European Commission ruled that Ireland gave Apple illegally favourable tax treatment, letting it pay an effective tax rate on European profits of 1 per cent in 2003 and down to 0.005 per cent in 2014. Apple and Ireland vowed to appeal. Source: European Commission Advertisement Apple's Irish tax arrangement was considered "the most brazen" among multinational techy companies, said Aisling Donohue, a partner at tax and business advisory firm MGPartners in Ireland. While other companies should be concerned, they aren't likely to face as much scrutiny, she said. Broader push Still, Vestager's move is part of a broader push to close loopholes that European regulators think give foreign companies an advantage. Google parent Alphabet has also been a beneficiary of Ireland's tax regime, using the so-called "Double Irish" mechanism to save billions in tax on its international earnings. Ireland is phasing this out, although companies have until 2021 to adjust. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Europe's tax ruling on Apple sends a bright red warning shot to multinationals across the board. Photo: Amazon.com used a similar process to effectively send profit through Luxembourg. In Europe, the e-commerce giant told authorities that the intellectual property behind its web shopping platform was immensely valuable, justifying the billions in tax-free revenue it collected there since moving its technology assets to Luxembourg a decade ago. In the US it played down the value of those same assets to explain why it paid so little in taxes for licensing them. That prompted investigations on both sides of the Atlantic and Amazon changed its policy in 2015, largely eliminating the practice. "You can't bank on achieving the savings in post-tax profits that you might have once expected," said Jolyon Maugham, a British trial lawyer specialising in tax cases at Devereux Chambers. "That makes the pursuit of such strategies rather more difficult to justify." Unsustainable About six months ago, Netflix told an investor that the company will likely pay higher international tax rates than other large US technology companies currently pay. Netflix, which recently began expanding aggressively abroad, said it views other US tech companies' international tax strategies as unsustainable, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person didn't want to be identified recounting a private discussion. "Multinationals with aggressive tax planning strategies can expect to pay more tax," Sarah Jane Mahmud, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, wrote in a recent research note. "EU reforms will require income to be taxed where generated through, among other things, new restrictions on use of controlled foreign companies." A Netflix spokeswoman didn't respond to requests seeking comment Tuesday. Spokesmen at Alphabet and Amazon declined to comment. 'Apple follows the law' Even if Apple has to pay billions and other tax strategies fizzle, Ireland's 12.5 per cent corporate rate means it's still likely to trump its homemarket US as a preferred corporate tax domicile. The iPhone maker has been there since opening a factory in Cork in 1980. "We received guidance from Irish tax authorities on how to comply correctly with Irish tax law - the same kind of guidance available to any company doing business there," CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. "In Ireland and in every country where we operate, Apple follows the law and we pay all the taxes we owe." The timing of Europe's decision, ahead of the US presidential election, means tax reform may become a more prominent issue. Donald Trump proposed taxing companies' accumulated offshore profit at 10 per cent, compared with the current top corporate rate of 35 per cent. The tax Apple pays abroad is deductible from the 35 per cent it must pay should it bring offshore profits home. Implications for other multinationals One major tech investor said low European taxes don't help international investors because the resulting higher overseas profits are still out of reach for things like share buybacks, dividends and acquisitions of other global companies. If European tax rates rise, there would be more incentive to repatriate the money to the countries where revenues are generated, said the investor, who asked not to be named discussing internal strategy ideas. The Apple ruling adds more pressure on the US to overhaul its tax system. And the US is not the only market where calls to end multinationals' tax dodging will get new intensity: According to a report published by Oxfam in June using IMF data, Australia misses out on $6 billion in annual revenue from big international companies operating here but using low-tax or no-tax nations to avoid paying tax locally. Apart from Ireland, the tax havens cited in the report included other European nations such as the Netherlands, Malta, Luxembourg, Belgium and Austria. Meanwhile, for Apple and its rivals, there's another sting in the spectacular Ireland ruling: The revelation that a regulator can impose higher tax bills retroactively - even though they were legal according to national laws - will top companies' list of concerns, according to Adam Halpern, a tax lawyer at Fenwick & West. "You thought you understood what your risk profile was in terms of tax, and then a regional non-governmental agency comes in and tells you to pay more," he said.

That amount of storage costs $19.99 a month, according to the page. (Hat tip to 9to5Mac for reporting the news.) The number of GB — 100 — that you get per dollar for this new tier is exactly in line with the second highest tier of 1TB, which costs $9.99 a month. For lower tiers — 50GB for $0.99/month and 200GB for $2.99/month — the price is better. Apple lowered its iCloud prices last year and the year before that. Apple has never offered an unlimited iCloud storage tier. Amazon, Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, and Microsoft OneDrive offer unlimited storage tiers for certain types of customers. In iOS 10, which will be released in the coming weeks, the iCloud Drive app for iOS shows the desktop folder from your Mac. Like Apple Music, the iCloud service falls under Apple’s growing Services category. In the second quarter of Apple’s 2016 fiscal year the category brought in almost $6 billion — up 20 percent year over year — out of $51.97 billion in revenue for the quarter.

By Kara Guzman Posted on August 30, 2016 Share Tweet Share Share Email Comments Bruce Daniels likes analogies. For example, the 67-year-old Capitola resident says his most-recent life change—leaving his tech career at age 59 and entering a UCSC doctorate program in hydroclimatology—was like “jumping into a swimming pool.” All of a sudden, he had to do calculus again, and it had been 30 years since he’d taken a math class. At the time, Daniels was a successful software engineer. He began his career at Hewlett-Packard, then moved to Apple in the 1980s, where he wrote code for Apple’s early computers, the Lisa and its successor, the Macintosh. He then launched a startup that was bought by Borland, worked for Oracle, and later, for Sun Microsystems. He was considering a job offer from Google when he decided to take the plunge—quitting his line of work to study how the climate affects water supplies. “I started getting a little antsy about that kind of work,” says Daniels. “Certainly going from the Macintosh and the Lisa to any other kind of job is a letdown. I mean, you’re doing a project that has some value and some interest, but it’s not like creating this new revolution in computing. I started thinking, ‘Well, is this really what I want to do?’” Daniels was interested in water, and while working full-time in Silicon Valley, he had begun serving on Soquel Creek Water District’s board in 2000. He also served on a regional water quality control board. He already knew UCSC earth science professors Andy Fisher and Lisa Sloan, who encouraged him to apply, and eventually became his advisers. “I really wanted to do [the Ph.D], so I put lots of time and effort into it, and persevered. I wanted to do something that was important, something that wasn’t being done very much,” he says. “Climatologists can tell you about climate, precipitation and forecasts. But then there’s very few people who can relate that precipitation to groundwater recharge, and it’s not a simple relationship.”   Bigger Picture Daniels is now Soquel Creek Water District’s board president, and spends most of his time traveling and speaking publicly about climate change and water. He wants to show people the science behind how warming temperatures threaten water supplies. He uses analogies to explain the complexities, of course—and they work. He starts by describing the Earth’s atmosphere as a “little box.” It can hold a certain amount of water, known as humidity. “You have to fill the box up completely, and then a little bit more before you get clouds, and then it has to fill up a little bit more to get rain. Then, essentially, when that happens, that box empties,” says Daniels. Research shows that California’s rainy season, which currently runs from December to March, will shorten to an intense two-month season. The state’s weather patterns will become feast-or-famine—the storm seasons will be stormier and the dry seasons even drier, experts have said. That’s because the Earth is warming. As humans burn fossil fuels, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases. It’s like sleeping with an extra blanket on the bed—you get hot, Daniels says. “That’s kind of what’s happening on Earth. We’re putting extra blankets on the Earth. And that has to cause the planet to warm up, because more energy is being kept inside the Earth than is leaving the Earth, so there’s an imbalance,” he says. As the planet warms, more water in the atmosphere evaporates into steam, like a kettle on a flame. That makes rain less likely. Back to the atmospheric box analogy: “In the future, the box gets bigger. Often you don’t get enough water in the box to get rain,” Daniels says. “When you have rain, the box is now bigger, so that rain is more intense.”   Water Supply at Risk The crux of why this matters, says Daniels, is that California’s groundwater—the water-bearing soil and rock from which wells draw—will not recharge like it once did. The ground can only soak in a certain amount. So when the storms hit harder in a shorter amount of time, more rainwater will run off and be lost, says Daniels. He wants to sound the alarm that everyone in California needs to figure out how to make a sustainable water supply, and climate change needs to be factored into the solution. Since last year, he’s given dozens of talks to national groundwater associations, local water agencies and nonprofits. One study that Daniels refers to in his talks shows that the Southwest, including California, has a more than 80 percent chance of experiencing a 35-year megadrought by the century’s end. “California is a big agricultural state. What will happen if we get 30-year droughts? We’re going to have to make big changes if we’re going to survive this thing, and if our descendants are going to survive this thing,” Daniels says. The water business must adjust, he says. “A lot of the people who are working in the field don’t really understand this connection. They kind of know that climate probably impacts the water, but they don’t know the details. They don’t know the numbers behind it,” Daniels says. Daniels, who wrote his dissertation on California’s rainfall records, says the state’s weather patterns began to come off the tracks around the year 2000. Between 1900 and 2000, only 30 years were considered “dry years.” But now, out of the past 15 years, 11 years have been dry. That’s a huge increase, Daniels says. “It’s almost like someone snapped their fingers and the world started working differently. There’s a lot of research going on exactly to that effect—it’s called Arctic amplification. Basically, as the Arctic warms up, the temperature difference between where we are and the North Pole is less, and it’s that difference that drives the jet streams,” says Daniels. “And if the jet stream is driven less energetically, the jet stream slows down. Just like a river, it meanders more, and it may tend to get stuck in a particular pattern.” Daniels stresses the need to understand the problem. “There are all these surprising things that are happening out there, and most of them aren’t good,” he says. “We need to start thinking about how we deal with it.” About the author Related posts Kara Guzman Contributor at Good Times | Blog Kara Guzman is a Santa Cruz-based science and environment writer.

While Apple could easily afford the bill, the tech giant said it will challenge the EU decision, which found that Ireland granted a sweetheart deal that let Apple pay almost no taxes across the European bloc for 11 years. And Ireland, which has long used low taxes to attract foreign businesses, said it will stand with Apple. “We now find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we don’t owe them any more than we’ve already paid,” Apple complained. The White House also blasted the ruling as unfair and disruptive to its own efforts at tax reform. But the decision was welcomed by groups that have long criticized the tax practices used by Apple and other large companies to legally reduce their obligations around the world. It was the latest in a series of aggressive moves by European officials to hold U.S. businesses, particularly big tech companies, accountable under the EU’s rules on taxation, competition and privacy. “They’re going after Apple, which means a big name and big dollars,” said Brad Badertscher, a corporate tax expert at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business. “It’s a big shot across the pond to U.S. companies.” Apple reported over $53 billion in profit in its last fiscal year on worldwide sales of more than $233 billion. It says it paid $13 billion in corporate income taxes globally. But EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Ireland granted such lavish tax breaks to Apple that the company’s effective corporate tax rate on its European profit dropped from 1 percent in 2003 to a mere 0.005 percent in 2014. Vestager argued that Ireland violated EU rules by essentially giving favorable subsidies to selected companies. Under its arrangement, Apple treats virtually all sales of iPhones and other goods and services in the EU’s 28 nations as revenue generated by its Irish subsidiaries. Vestager ordered Ireland to recover the unpaid taxes for the years 2003 to 2014, plus interest. For Ireland, a country of barely 4.6 million people, the sum would be a huge windfall — equivalent to $3,150 for every man, woman and child. And yet the government said it will appeal the decision, arguing it granted no special treatment to Apple. Multinationals produce such huge revenue that countries can reap big gains even from low taxes. They also benefit from the jobs created. Apple has 5,500 workers in Ireland, making it one of the biggest private-sector employers. “It is important that we send a strong message that Ireland remains an attractive and stable location of choice for long-term substantive investment,” said Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan. “Apple has been in Ireland since the 1980s and employs thousands of people in Cork.” Apple likewise argued that it followed the law and paid every cent of what it owed. “We are confident the commission’s order will be overturned,” the company said in a statement, while also warning: “Beyond the obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe.” Badertscher agreed the ruling could discourage U.S. companies from investing in Europe. But others applauded the crackdown on what they described as a “race to the bottom” by individual nations offering lower tax rates than their neighbors. “To its credit, the European Union understands that when member nations act as tax havens, as Ireland has, there are casualties far beyond the borders of Ireland,” said Matthew Gardner, executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a liberal research group in Washington. “It’s not a good economic development strategy for Ireland in the long run, and it also subverts the tax system of every other member nation and nations around world,” he added. But the EU’s move risks the ire of the United States. In recent weeks, the Obama administration warned European officials that their investigations seemed to be unfairly singling out U.S. companies. U.S. Treasury officials also complained that imposing European taxes retroactively could hurt American taxpayers, since U.S. companies can receive a tax credit in this country for taxes paid overseas. Apple, along with other big U.S. multinationals, has built a vast stockpile of cash from its foreign operations, but it has left the money overseas to avoid paying U.S. taxes. The company holds nearly $215 billion in cash and securities overseas, much of it generated by its Irish subsidiaries. CEO Tim Cook has complained that high U.S. taxes have discouraged the company from bringing those earnings home. Apple said the EU ruling will have no immediate effect on its finances. Wall Street analysts agreed, noting the potential tax bill is a small fraction of the company’s cash stockpile. Apple stock declined by less than 1 percent Tuesday.

Joel Hills Business Editor In a sense Apple is a victim of its spectacular success. Since the company launched the iPhone in 2007 it has shifted so many devices worldwide and played the international tax system so shrewdly that it is now has a mountain of cash stashed out the reach of the tax authorities that is so high that it's causing embarrassment and some anger. Apple's cash reserves held by foreign (non-US) subsidiaries stands at $215 billion. Much of this sits offshore where it's of limited use to Apple but the company can't seem to bring itself to repatriate the money to the US and hand over 35% of it to the US government. In recent years multinational companies have woken up to the joy of tax: that profits can be shifted between jurisdictions to minimise bills; that governments will compete with each other to lower tax rates to attract investment. Play video The Irish government was prepared to allow Apple to pay next to nothing in tax if it meant creating jobs in Ireland. In a sense the policy proved successful, the company employs 5,500 people there today and still manufactures iMacs to order. The European Commission decided that the shenanigans had gone on long enough. It has decided that Ireland's special arrangement infringed the right of other countries to charge Apple tax and was therefore illegal. Last year the Commission ordered Fiat and Starbucks to repay money in Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Amazon and McDonalds are under investigation for their tax affairs. Will the Irish government get the 13 billion Euros the Commission calculates it's owed? The door has been left open for other governments to stake their claim for a share of the spoils. Apple has responded with fury, so too has the US government. The Obama administration wants Apple to pay more tax but in the United States not Ireland. Given that Apple more obviously creates wealth in California rather than Cork it's hard to see the Irish government winning the tax tussle that's about to get underway.

Shares of Apple slid, down 0.9 percent as of 3.08pm in New York, after the European Commission ruled that Ireland granted the company undue tax benefits of up to 13 billion euros (US$14.5 billion)—"illegal aid” under EU rules that the commission says Ireland now must recover from Apple. However, the move drew criticism from the US Treasury Department and lawmakers. "The European Commission's decision is a predatory and naked tax grab," US Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement, Reuters reported. In 2.52pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.39 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.38 percent. In 2.37pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated 0.40 percent. Slides shares of Boeing and those of Nike, down 1.5 percent and 1.1 percent respectively, led the Dow lower. Financial stocks bucked the trend, with shares of JPMorgan Chase up 0.7 percent and those of Goldman Sachs trading 0.6 percent stronger recently. In the latest US economic data, a Conference Board report showed its consumer confidence index rose 4.4 points to 101.1 in August, the highest reading since September 2015. "This will likely be interpreted as more evidence that the U.S. economic recovery is back on track following the missteps earlier this year," Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York, told Reuters. Potential deal news bolstered the mood. Shares of Canada's Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan and Agrium jumped after the fertiliser producers said they are in talks about a potential merger of equals. "No decision has been made as to whether to proceed with such a combination, no agreement has been reached, and there can be no assurance that any transaction will result from these discussions," the companies said in their separate releases, without offering further details. Even so, people familiar with the matter said a combination could be announced as soon as next week, according to Bloomberg, which first reported that the rivals were in talks about a merger. Agrium shares jumped, trading 6.4 percent higher as of 1.49pm in Toronto, while those of Potash Corp also rallied, trading 12.4 percent stronger. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a 0.5 percent advance from the previous close. France’s CAC 40 index rose 0.8 percent and Germany’s DAX index climbed 1.1 percent. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index slid 0.3 percent.

Supplied by Jefferson Graham  Siri, Apple's personal digital assistant, soon will be on more apps — but not all. Apple, with great fanfare at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, announced Siri was now open to app developers to bring Siri voice functionality to apps such as Uber, Lyft, Runtastic and WeChat. It will be part of a September upgrade of iOS 10, Apple's mobile operating system. "Siri works with your favourite apps from the App Store, so you can ask it to book a ride through Lyft, or send money to someone with Square," Apple said then. Make that "some" of your favourite apps. When the new Siri launches, sometime in mid-to-late September, it won't be available in all apps. Related Quotes 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating... Last updated: Updating... View full quote Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements "Siri is only limited to six categories," says Benjamin Mayo, a London-based app developer and blogger for the 9to5Mac Apple website. "There's huge omissions in music and media playback apps." The idea is Siri will soon be able to do more than just open your app, but now operate them as well. And while Apple has deals with several big app developers — Facebook and Twitter, to open, compose and publish posts, and Yelp to search for reviews — most non-Apple apps haven't had access to Siri functionality. "I would love to be able to offer Siri," says Adam Grossman, co-founder of the Dark Sky app, which predicts when, where and for how long rain will be coming to your neighbourhood. "Hopefully Apple will expand the categories." Siri was first introduced by Apple in 2011 as "an intelligent assistant that helps you get things done just by asking," for such tasks as setting reminders and appointments, opening apps and getting traffic directions. Comedians had a field day with Siri after it launched, asking silly questions like "Siri, will you marry me?" and "Do you think I'm hot?" and having fun with the automated responses. Apple has upgraded Siri substantially since, to work more effectively in more categories, but still has issues with users accents, or getting the right information. Apple has "lost ground" to rivals Google and Microsoft in voice direction and is "playing catch-up," according to CNET, with more accurate voice commands and answers on Google's Android platform and Microsoft's Cortana digital assistant for Windows. . Here's what you will be able to do with the new Siri: Ride-hailing: Booking Lyft with your voice. Communication: Dictate messages to "send, search and read back" texts. At the WWDC conference, Apple mentioned apps such as China's WeChat and WhatsApp. Photo search: Apple has talked about how you could ask Siri to locate photos shot last month, in iOS 10 for instance, and use the same functionality on apps like Pinterest and EyeEm. Payments: Siri will let users make payments via apps like Venmo and Square. Voice calls: The digital assistant will initiate phone calls on apps like Skype. Workouts: Siri will tell apps like Runtastic, Runkeeper and MapMyRun to start an activity session and operate the app hands free. "MapMyRun app will contain ability to start, pause, stop, cancel and save workouts using Siri," says Albert Lee, vice president of connected products for Under Armour, which owns MapMyRun and MyFitnessPal. The "hands-free experience really valuable in a workout setting." As a developer, Dark Sky's Grossman knows that people are more likely to use his app if they could say, "Hey Siri, is it about to rain?" than taking the time to unlock the home screen, find the app, open it up and search for the results. "Our goal is to make it so they don't have to open the app at all," Grossman says. The update to iOS 10 is expected by mid-to-late September, and historically pre-dates the launch of a new iPhone by two days. Eager Apple fans can go to beta.apple.com and download the beta, although Apple recommends backing up your device, and warns that potential issues could arise from the beta.

Widespread encryption built into smartphones is “making more and more of the room that we are charged to investigate dark,” Comey said in a cybersecurity symposium. The remarks reiterated points that Comey has made repeatedly in the last two years, before Congress and in other settings, about the growing collision between electronic privacy and national security. The Justice Department decided within the last year to not seek a legislative resolution, and some of the public debate surrounding the FBI’s legal fight with Apple Inc. has subsided in the last few months since federal authorities were able to access a locked phone in a terror case without the help of the technology giant. The FBI sought a court order to force Apple to help it hack into an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters, a demand the tech giant and other privacy advocates said would dramatically weaken security of its products. The FBI ultimately got into the phone with the help of an unidentified third party, leaving the legal dispute unresolved. But Comey made clear Tuesday that he expects that dialogue to continue. “The conversation we’ve been trying to have about this has dipped below public consciousness now, and that’s fine,” Comey said at a symposium organized by Symantec, a Mountain View technology company. “Because what we want to do is collect information this year so that next year we can have an adult conversation in this country.” The American people, he said, have a reasonable expectation of privacy in private spaces — including houses, cars and electronic devices. But that right is not absolute when law enforcement has probable cause to believe that there’s evidence of a crime in one of those places. He said it’s not the role of the FBI or tech companies to tell the American people how to live and govern themselves. “We need to understand in the FBI how is this exactly affecting our work, and then share that with folks,” Comey said, conceding that the American people might ultimately decide that privacy was more important than “that portion of the room being dark.” He also stood by the Justice Department’s decision to bring indictments against Chinese and Iranian officials in major cyberattack cases in the last two years, rejecting criticism from those who have called the criminal charges meaningless gestures unlikely to result in a conviction. Those actions can make a foreign defendant think twice before traveling overseas, and can deter governments. He said there’s been progress with the Chinese government since 2014 indictments that accused five Chinese military officials of siphoning secrets from American corporations.

We’re still a week away from Apple’s big unveiling, but plenty of folks nerdier than we have gotten the skinny on the new generation. Apple sent out invitations for the iPhone 7 event on September 7 https://t.co/0EqvtLvM7q pic.twitter.com/oglVvO1Dad— Business Insider (@businessinsider) August 29, 2016 Here’s what to expect from the new product, according to CNET. Just know that all of this intel is liable to change! NEWS: Kanye West Begs Apple to Pay Tidal in “D—k Swinging” Twitter Rant It’ll be announced on September 7, released by September 23 Apple is holding an event in San Francisco on September 7 to announce the new generation, and it should hit shelves by September 23 or maybe even as soon as September 16. (We’re sure fanboys are setting up camps outside stores already.) It’ll look pretty much the same It seems the company is holding out on the rumored massive redesign — featuring an edge-to-edge display and doing away with the home button — until the iPhone’s 10th anniversary next summer. Might wanna hang onto your upgrades, people! It’ll come in two sizes Just as we had the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and then the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, we’ll have the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus — with screen sizes of 4.7 and 5.5 inches, respectively. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Embed from Getty Images It’ll have a dual-lens camera on the larger model The iPhone 7 Plus will have two rear-facing camera lens, which will likely let users adjust a photo’s focus even after it’s been taken. That technology, however, could also have 3D imaging implications. Sexting just got serious. NEWS: Possible Suicide Reported at Apple Headquarters It won’t have a headphone jack Apparently Apple is phasing out traditional headphones in favor of ones that connect via Bluetooth or the Lightning connector (the same connector into which you plug the charger on current models). Don’t worry, there will be adaptors, too, because Apple loves its $$$.

But don’t go crazy, dynamo. NEWS: 7 Self-Care Apps to Help You Live Your Happiest Life It’ll be faster and more capacious The new generation will have an A10 processor that’ll let you do tasks on the device faster.

It was a U.S. Senate report in May 2013 revealing the tech giant's deal with the Irish government to rule a big slice of its global earnings untaxable that prompted the European Commission to launch its own inquiries the following month. The U.S. Treasury said the Commission's order that Apple pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland - which the company and Dublin are appealing - endangers EU-U.S. economic relations just as efforts to reach a transatlantic free trade pact unravel. A senior Democratic senator said Brussels had made "a cheap money grab" for U.S. revenues. But his party colleague who chaired hearings into Apple's taxes three years ago, Carl Levin, said the Europeans were only trying to take what U.S. authorities had failed to claim by not closing loopholes that allowed firms to hoard profits overseas. "The IRS has failed to stake a claim for U.S. taxes on those revenues," he said in a statement, referring to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. "So Europe attempts to fill the vacuum. Shame on Apple for dodging U.S. taxes. Shame on the IRS for failing to challenge Apple’s tax avoidance." For Marcel Fratzscher, president of leading German economic think-tank DIW Berlin and author of a new book on growing inequality, the mudslinging between politicians reflects how global corporations have exploited competition for investment to blunt states' efforts to co-operate against tax avoidance. "Companies are playing one government against another," he told Reuters. EU LISTENED TO SENATE EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, a straight-talking Dane who dismisses talk of leading an anti-American crusade, says the hearings at the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations chaired by Levin were what gave her Spanish predecessor grounds to demand disclosure by Apple and Ireland. "The Commission listened and decided to look deeper into the matter," Vestager said in June, crediting media reporting and hearings in the British parliament for also providing evidence to help break secrecy around nearly 1,000 cases across Europe. The Commission said in its judgment on Apple that the United States and other countries were welcome to try and claim some of the unpaid taxes for themselves - highlighting just the complaints of Levin and other senators three years ago when they skewered Apple CEO Tim Cook for failing to bring cash home. As well as Apple, Starbucks Corp was ordered to pay more Dutch taxes and Amazon.com Inc and McDonald's Corp are still being investigated; a series of EU accusations that Google, part of Alphabet Inc, has abused its market power have also fuelled complaints from U.S. President Barack Obama's administration that Europe is out to punish American success. Competition lawyer Pierre Sabbadini said political pressures drove different responses by different authorities. Leaks and public hearings on tax deals had created pressure among voters for the EU to act in 2013, he said, while the size of the companies targeted gave them clout with political leaders, too. "When investigation-target companies have grown to the size of Apple, they can reach out for political support," he said. The Obama administration has taken its own action to curb tax avoidance schemes lately. In April, amid public controversy over drug company Pfizer Inc's proposed merger with Allergan Plc of Ireland, it announced plans to curb so-called "tax inversions", by which U.S. firms have undertaken cross-border mergers in order to switch to a domicile abroad and so avoid U.S. taxes. Pfizer abandoned the merger.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 30, 2016 at 5:22PM Image source: Intel.  Over the last five to six years, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) talked quite a lot about its efforts to become a major player in the market for processors and related components targeted at smartphones and tablets. Followers of the company's mobile strategy know that it was a spectacular failure. Intel couldn't deliver competitive products at the breakneck pace required to succeed in the market. As a result, as part of restructuring actions announced earlier this year, Intel cancelled all of the mobile processors that it had previously told investors to expect to come to market. At this point, it looked as though the company had effectively exited the market for smartphone processors altogether, opting instead to focus on building stand-alone modems with the aim of winning business at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, at a recent investor conference, an Intel executive indicated that Intel would eventually be back in the smartphone processor game. In this column, I would like to outline what I believe would be a winning strategy for the company in the mobile market. A three-pronged approach Intel's ultimate goal in mobile is to generate the heftiest return possible for its shareholders; this means keeping spending down and revenues (and gross profit margins) high. To that end, the company can go after this market in the following three key ways: contract chip manufacturing, sales of stand-alone modems, and sales of integrated applications processor and modem products. Let's take a look at what Intel's strategy could be in each of these segments. Contract chip manufacturing, but not for everybody I don't think Intel is particularly well set up to become a truly general purpose contract chip manufacturer. Where I think Intel can add value is for customers that are potentially willing to pay more in order to get better performance/power consumption than they otherwise could have from one of Intel's competitors (assuming that Intel's technology can remain superior to what the competition offers). Intel already announced that it will build chips for LG, and there are rumblings that Intel may be trying to win at least some of Apple's A-series chip business at some point down the line. I don't think Intel should (or, frankly, could) build chips for all of the mobile chip companies. However, if Intel is serious about this business, and if its technology is really ahead of the competition's, then going after high end mobile chip customers -- particularly ones that don't compete with Intel's own product lines -- could be a nice way for Intel to profit from mobile. The stand-alone modem opportunity When the tear-downs for Apple's upcoming iPhone 7 come in, many expect that Intel will supply modems for some of the models. As far as smartphones go, Apple is really the only company that still relies on stand-alone modems rather than on modems integrated into the same piece of silicon as the applications processor. As long as Apple continues to use such stand-alone modems, and as long as Intel builds competitive modems for this market, the iPhone could represent a nice opportunity for the chipmaker to try to profit from the mobile market. That said, this is the most "fragile" of the mobile opportunities in front of Intel. If Apple ever builds up a competent modem team and decides to integrate the modem into its applications processors, then Intel's iPhone-related revenue will go to zero within a couple of product generations. Integrated applications processors and modems As Intel's modems gain credibility in the marketplace, there may be an opportunity for the chip-maker to take those modems and integrate them into applications processors targeted at low-end and mid-range smartphones. In fact, I would imagine such applications processors would be fairly generic, packing ARM Cortex A-series processor cores, graphics and media engines from either ARM or Imagination, and a few in-house technologies (such as the image signal processor, memory controller, and modem). If these chips can meet the performance/power/feature requirements of low-end and mid-range smartphones, Intel could probably bring in a reasonable amount of revenue for a relatively small incremental investment. Intel shouldn't bother trying to build in-house chips for the high-end of the smartphone market. These chips tend to be more difficult/complex to produce and the market for them is quite small and increasingly dominated by in-house processor designs. Going after this segment via foundry is the smarter approach. Why this strategy could succeed Intel's prior strategy was to try to build products targeted at every segment of the smartphone market while relying on in-house technology. The strategy, for a number of reasons, clearly failed. What I have outlined above would have a much better chance of succeeding simply because it plays to Intel's strengths. Intel is a world-class chip manufacturer and it is becoming increasingly good at building modems. Attacking the high-end of the market by building other people's chip designs for them solves several problems that Intel faced previously: One problem that Intel faced is that it simply couldn't read the market properly and as such didn't wind up designing chips that were competitive in that segment. By letting mobile experts worry about defining the chip's features, Intel no longer has to deal with trying to predict future market trends. Another problem that Intel would have faced at the high end of the smartphone market, had it actually built competitive products, is that much of this market is held captive by Apple's own A-series processors, as well as in-house efforts from Samsung, Huawei, and others. Intel isn't going to win over Samsung (Samsung is a direct chip manufacturing competitor to Intel), but it could conceivably win over other customers. For the low-end of the market, Intel could leverage a lot of third party technologies in order to bring chips to market fairly quickly. Intel's main points of differentiation here would be the modem as well as the performance/power characteristics of its manufacturing technology. In this case, Intel would again have the benefit of not having to try to predict the future as it would presumably work with ARM and other third-party technology providers to do much of the heavy lifting. Intel's job would be to essentially bundle these technologies with its modems and manufacture them. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

If you happened to spend your daylight hours under a rock and only decided to check the news on your favourite fruit-based touchable device this evening – here’s what you missed: The European Commission says Ireland gave illegal tax benefits to Apple worth up to €13bn. Full story to follow— TheJournal.ie (@thejournal_ie) August 30, 2016 Source: TheJournal.ie/Twitter You can read our own main story on it here, but – just to give you a flavour of the international interest in it – here’s the first five paragraphs from global news wire AFP: The EU ordered tech giant Apple on Tuesday to pay a record 13 billion euros in back taxes in Ireland, a move Washington warned could damage hugely important transatlantic economic ties. Brussels said Apple, the world’s most valuable company, avoided virtually all tax on its business in the bloc by illegal arrangements with Dublin which gave the company an unfair advantage over competitors. Apple and the Irish government immediately said they would appeal against the European Commission ruling, with the iPhone maker warning it could cost European jobs. The White House meanwhile cautioned against “unilateral” measures by the EU. The company’s shares lost some of their shine after the ruling, down 0.7 percent in early afternoon trading, making for a more than 3 percent loss over the past two weeks ahead of the highly anticipated ruling.

It was a U.S. Senate report in May 2013 revealing the tech giant's deal with the Irish government to rule a big slice of its global earnings untaxable that prompted the European Commission to launch its own inquiries the following month. The U.S. Treasury said the Commission's order that Apple pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland - which the company and Dublin are appealing - endangers EU-U.S. economic relations just as efforts to reach a transatlantic free trade pact unravel . A senior Democratic senator said Brussels had made "a cheap money grab" for U.S. revenues. But his party colleague who chaired hearings into Apple's taxes three years ago, Carl Levin, said the Europeans were only trying to take what U.S. authorities had failed to claim by not closing loopholes that allowed firms to hoard profits overseas. "The IRS has failed to stake a claim for U.S. taxes on those revenues," he said in a statement, referring to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. "So Europe attempts to fill the vacuum. Shame on Apple for dodging U.S. taxes. Shame on the IRS for failing to challenge Apple's tax avoidance." For Marcel Fratzscher, president of leading German economic think-tank DIW Berlin and author of a new book on growing inequality, the mudslinging between politicians reflects how global corporations have exploited competition for investment to blunt states' efforts to co-operate against tax avoidance. "Companies are playing one government against another," he told Reuters. EU LISTENED TO SENATE EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, a straight-talking Dane who dismisses talk of leading an anti-American crusade, says the hearings at the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations chaired by Levin were what gave her Spanish predecessor grounds to demand disclosure by Apple and Ireland. "The Commission listened and decided to look deeper into the matter," Vestager said in June, crediting media reporting and hearings in the British parliament for also providing evidence to help break secrecy around nearly 1,000 cases across Europe. The Commission said in its judgment on Apple that the United States and other countries were welcome to try and claim some of the unpaid taxes for themselves - highlighting just the complaints of Levin and other senators three years ago when they skewered Apple CEO Tim Cook for failing to bring cash home. As well as Apple, Starbucks Corp was ordered to pay more Dutch taxes and Amazon.com Inc and McDonald's Corp are still being investigated; a series of EU accusations that Google, part of Alphabet Inc, has abused its market power have also fuelled complaints from U.S. President Barack Obama's administration that Europe is out to punish American success. Competition lawyer Pierre Sabbadini said political pressures drove different responses by different authorities. Leaks and public hearings on tax deals had created pressure among voters for the EU to act in 2013, he said, while the size of the companies targeted gave them clout with political leaders, too. "When investigation-target companies have grown to the size of Apple, they can reach out for political support," he said. The Obama administration has taken its own action to curb tax avoidance schemes lately. In April, amid public controversy over drug company Pfizer Inc's proposed merger with Allergan Plc of Ireland, it announced plans to curb so-called "tax inversions", by which U.S. firms have undertaken cross-border mergers in order to switch to a domicile abroad and so avoid U.S. taxes. Pfizer abandoned the merger.

A file picture dated January 27, 2015 of the company's logo at an Apple Store in Washington, DC. (SHAWN THEW / EPA) Tribune news servicesContact Reporter The European Union ordered Apple on Tuesday to pay nearly $15 billion in back taxes to Ireland, plus billions more in interest, in a move that dramatically escalates the fight over whether America's biggest corporations are paying their fair share around the world. While Apple could easily afford the bill, the tech giant said it will challenge the EU decision, which found that Ireland granted a sweetheart deal that let Apple pay almost no taxes across the European bloc for 11 years. And Ireland, which has long used low taxes to attract foreign businesses, said it will stand with Apple. "We now find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we don't owe them any more than we've already paid," Apple CEO Tim Cook complained in a statement. The White House also blasted the ruling as unfair and disruptive to its own efforts at tax reform. But the decision was welcomed by groups that have long criticized the practices used by Apple and other large companies to legally reduce their tax obligations.

A botched attempt to break into the iPhone of an Arab activist using hitherto unknown espionage software has trigged a global upgrade of Apple's mobile operating system, researchers said Thursday. The spyware took advantage of three previously undisclosed weaknesses in Apple's mobile operating... (Tribune news services) The ruling was the latest in a series of aggressive moves by European officials to hold U.S. businesses, particularly big tech companies, accountable under the EU's rules on taxation, competition and privacy. "They're going after Apple, which means a big name and big dollars," said Brad Badertscher, a corporate tax expert at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business. "It's a big shot across the pond to U.S. companies." California-based Apple reported over $53 billion in profit in its last fiscal year on worldwide sales of more than $233 billion. It says it paid $13 billion in corporate income taxes globally. But EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Ireland granted such lavish tax breaks to Apple that the company's effective corporate tax rate on its European profits dropped from 1 percent in 2003 to a mere 0.005 percent in 2014. While Apple disputed her figures, Vestager argued that Ireland violated EU rules by essentially giving subsidies to selected companies. Under its current arrangement, Apple treats virtually all sales of iPhones and other goods and services in the EU's 28 nations as revenue generated by its Irish subsidiaries. Vestager ordered Ireland to recover the unpaid taxes for the years 2003 to 2014, plus interest, which one analyst said could amount to an additional 6 billion euros. For Ireland, a country of barely 4.6 million people, the sum would be a huge windfall — equivalent to over 2,800 euros ($3,150) for every man, woman and child. And yet the government said it will appeal the decision, arguing it granted no special treatment to Apple. Apple said to plan first pro laptop overhaul in four years Mark Gurman Apple is preparing the first significant overhaul of its MacBook Pro laptop line in over four years, according to people familiar with the matter, using one of its older products to help reverse two quarters of sliding sales.

(Mark Gurman) Ireland has for years offered low corporate tax rates to multinationals, a common strategy among Europe's smaller countries, including Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Multinationals have such huge revenue that these countries can reap big gains even from low taxes. They also benefit from the jobs created. Apple has 5,500 workers in Ireland, making it one of the biggest private-sector employers. "It is important that we send a strong message that Ireland remains an attractive and stable location of choice for long-term substantive investment," said Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan. "Apple has been in Ireland since the 1980s and employs thousands of people in Cork." Apple likewise argued that it followed the law and paid every cent of what it owed. "We are confident the commission's order will be overturned," Cook said, while also warning: "Beyond the obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe." Badertscher agreed the ruling could discourage U.S. companies from investing in Europe. But others applauded the crackdown on what they described as a "race to the bottom" by individual nations offering lower tax rates than their neighbors. "To its credit, the European Union understands that when member nations act as tax havens, as Ireland has, there are casualties far beyond the borders of Ireland," said Matthew Gardner, executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a liberal research group in Washington. "It's not a good economic development strategy for Ireland in the long run, and it also subverts the tax system of every other member nation and nations around world," he added. But the EU's move risks the ire of the United States. In recent weeks, the Obama administration warned European officials that their investigations seemed to be unfairly singling out U.S. companies. U.S. Treasury officials also complained that imposing European taxes retroactively could hurt American taxpayers, since U.S. companies can receive a tax credit in this country for taxes paid overseas. Apple, along with other big U.S. multinationals, has built a vast stockpile of cash from its foreign operations, but it has left the money overseas to avoid paying U.S. taxes that it would owe if it brought that money home. The company reported this summer that it holds nearly $215 billion in cash and securities overseas, much of it generated by its Irish subsidiaries. Cook has complained that high U.S. taxes have discouraged the company from bringing those earnings home. Apple said the EU ruling will have no immediate effect on its finances. Wall Street analysts agreed, noting the potential tax bill is a small fraction of the company's cash stockpile. Apple stock declined by less than 1 percent Tuesday.

 What just happened to Apple, explained Dan Bobkoff Aug. 30, 2016, 5:28 PM 138,612 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook. AP The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, is ordering Apple to pay $14.5 billion in taxes to Ireland. But Ireland doesn't want the money, and Apple says it shouldn't have to pay. And the kind of tax breaks that the EU accuses Ireland of offering Apple are similar to the kind of deals common in, and legal in, the US. What happened? This is what the EU says: Apple Inc., which is based in California, set up two companies in Ireland: Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe. According to the European Commission, these companies had no employees or real offices but still realized large profits. Apple paid virtually no tax to Ireland, or to any country, on these profits because of a former law in Ireland. In the last year that the law was in effect, 2015, Apple Sales International paid just 0.005% tax, according to the commission. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager. Thomson Reuters The investigation into Apple by the European Commission was led by Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, a member of Denmark's social liberal party. The commission is not a tax authority; instead, its job is to maintain fairness between the EU member states. And that brings us to the most important part in this story: The commission says this law specifically favored Apple for special treatment. When Apple sold iPhones, iPads, and Macs in an EU single-market nation, such as France, the commission said Apple would funnel the profits from France to Ireland and would not pay tax in either country. But this is not really about Apple's tax-avoidance strategies, which are infamous. The European Commission's issue is really not with Apple but with Ireland. Aid versus tax How's this for a tricky balancing act? EU leaders have no issue with different member nations charging different corporate-tax rates. That's why it's acceptable for Ireland to charge businesses a 12.5% income tax whereas France levies 33.3%. The European Commission released this infographic showing how Apple paid virtually no taxes through its Irish companies. European Commission This is crucial because nations want to maintain autonomy over their fiscal policies. That's part of the ongoing power struggle between individual nations and the EU (remember Brexit?). What's not acceptable is what the EU calls "state aid." This is when a country offers something special that's seen as benefiting an individual company. It can be even more basic. If France taxed companies in the north less than those in the south, that's generally state aid in the EU's view. It's the same with trying to get a German company to move to Denmark by abating property taxes for a new headquarters. "The view is that not levying taxes that everyone else has to pay amounts to the same result as giving money to just one company," Philipp Werner, a partner in the law firm Jones Day's Brussels office who has represented multinational companies appealing state-aid decisions, told Business Insider. If Apple had just paid the standard 12.5% income tax in Ireland, the country wouldn't have EU leaders upset in Brussels. Instead, the commission says Ireland gave Apple "selective tax treatment" starting in 1991, with the first of two tax rulings. In effect, Ireland signed off on a plan in which Apple would move money to a stateless "head office" with no meaningful activities. "Therefore, only a small percentage of Apple Sales International's profits were taxed in Ireland, and the rest was taxed nowhere," the commission said in a press release. Ireland explicitly said this was fine by its standards. But the EU contends that this arrangement "gave Apple an undue advantage that is illegal under EU state aid rules." "Apple entered into a deal with Ireland to not pay tax on all those profits," Edward Kleinbard, a professor of law and business at the USC Gould School of Law, told Business Insider. Instead, Apple paid "an arbitrarily small amount to Ireland in return for a vague promise to keep jobs in Ireland." Apple and Ireland aren't the commission's first targets. There were similar rulings against the Starbucks' tax dealings in the Netherlands and a division of Fiat in Luxembourg. Apple and Ireland have a different view Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan. Thomson Reuters Apple was one of the first major tech companies to set up shop in Ireland. At the time, in 1980, Ireland was in bad economic shape. Unemployment was high, and many people left Ireland to try to find work in other countries. Low corporate tax was one way Ireland improved its economy and attracted big companies, and Apple was one of the early companies to benefit. Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan has categorically rejected the notion that this was a special deal for Apple. "The Irish Revenue don't do deals," Noonan told CNBC on August 30. "They issue opinions to clarify a tax situation for individual companies, but we never do deals." He continued to say that Apple doesn't owe any taxes to Ireland. "They may owe it elsewhere, but not to the Irish authorities." To underscore the delicate relationship, Noonan accused the commission of meddling in the policies of sovereign governments. For its part, Apple CEO Tim Cook shot back, saying in an open letter that the European Commission "has launched an effort to rewrite Apple's history in Europe, ignore Ireland's tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process." Both Ireland and Apple say the company has become a big part of the Irish economy, with 6,000 workers there. And Cook also objected to the ruling being retroactive. Under EU rules, it can compel a country to collect taxes going back 10 years from the first date it asked for information. Ireland doesn’t want the money Here's one of the ironies: The EU is, in effect, ordering Ireland to collect a lot of money. Most, if not all, of the $14.5 billion would go to Ireland and could be used to pay down debts. But Ireland is not interested. "Although they get a huge amount of money back, they also want to fight it," said Werner at Jones Day. "They're not only thinking about Apple — they're thinking a whole lot of other companies established in Ireland." Losing this battle will hurt Ireland's credibility as an inexpensive place to do business, and a place where tax laws are clear and settled. Why is the US fighting this? US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew. REUTERS/Gleb Garanich Another irony: You might think the US would applaud any effort to collect tax from US-based multinationals using Irish subsidiaries to pay less, or zero, tax. But there are a few reasons the US Treasury department is vehemently against this EU ruling and other pending cases targeting companies, such as Amazon. One is simple: It wants to protect US businesses, and the Treasury says they're being unfairly targeted by this EU crackdown. Second, the US wants to preserve tax revenue it hopes one day will come its way. Companies like Apple say US taxes are too high, so they keep foreign earnings overseas. But Congress has long debated ways to get multinational American companies to repatriate some of that cash. The Treasury Department says if the commission wins this case, US companies could use these taxes paid in Europe to offset US taxes. That, it says, "would effectively constitute a transfer of revenue to the EU from the US government and its taxpayers," according to a Treasury white paper. What about other European countries? In his letter, though, Cook may have stepped into another debate over its aggressive tax avoidance by saying, " A company’s profits should be taxed in the country where the value is created." This is a different issue. If Apple made money in France but realized those profits in Ireland, it is up to France, not the EU, to complain and try to get some of that money back. The whole reason Apple's European operations are in Ireland, after all, are for its tax advantages. The question is just whether Apple received illegal special treatment. Wait, don't these tax breaks happen in the US all the time? Tesla's Gigafactory, in Nevada, received the kind of tax breaks that would be illegal in the EU. YouTube/Above Reno One reason all this might seem odd to Americans is that the "special treatment" Ireland is accused of giving Apple is similar to incentives American states give companies all the time legally. Massachusetts, for instance, put together $145 million in incentives to persuade General Electric to move from suburban Connecticut to Boston. Never mind that some research suggests these sweetheart deals often don't pay off. Politicians can't stop offering them. When Tesla said publicly it wanted to build a Gigafactory to produce batteries, states like California, Nex Mexico, and Nevada stumbled over themselves to offer the most generous tax breaks. In the end, Nevada agreed to $1.2 billion in tax incentives to win the deal. If these deals were issued by France to attract a company based in Denmark, it would be illegal under EU rules. What about inversions? Some American companies have gone further than Apple to take advantage of Irish tax breaks. Pharmaceutical firm Allergan has acquired or formed Irish subsidiaries and then "inverted," or transferred its legal headquarters to Ireland. Even if its headquarters were in the US, it is effectively an Irish company. "Inversions are separate but related," Kleinbard said. Companies that invert "take advantage of an easily manipulated definition of what is a US company." Nothing in the European Commission ruling affects inversions. It's up to US authorities to crack down if they want to stop the practice. Congress, for instance, could change tax law to consider a company American if its leadership and most of its workers are based in the US. What's next? Apple, the most profitable company in the world, and Ireland, which has some of the lowest corporate taxes, made easy targets for the European Commission. But it's clearly not done yet. It's targeting McDonald's for allegedly paying no tax on its earnings in Luxembourg. The antitrust regulators are also looking into Amazon. Ireland, however, will almost surely appeal the ruling against its dealings with Apple. It has a lot more on the line than $14.5 billion.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Behold: The very best of CES 2017 Business Understanding Apple’s tax mess: Why Apple owes $14.5 billion, and why Ireland doesn’t want it Chris Mills @chrisfmills August 30th, 2016 at 12:42 PM Share Tweet In a ruling handed down this morning, Apple was given a $14.5 billion bill for back taxes by the European Commission, related to its business in Europe and Ireland. Apple’s tax situation, including the hundreds of billions in cash held offshore, has always been a hot topic for the company. But how did it land in this mess, and who does it even owe money to anyway? DON’T MISS: There are still two big problems with Apple’s iPhones, but the iPhone 7 will solve one of them The situation right now is a little unclear. This morning’s ruling was given by the European Commission, which says that both Apple and Ireland made a tax arrangement against the rules of the EU. As a result, Apple owes money to Ireland, but the country disagrees. In a statement, the Finance Minister said he “disagrees profoundly” with the EC’s ruling, and will appeal. As you might expect, Apple is also planning on launching an appeal. CEO Tim Cook argues that because Apple complied with Irish tax authorities, there shouldn’t be any penalties applied, and Cook is confident that Apple’s case will “ultimately prevail.” Oh, and the US government is also on Apple’s side, accusing the EU in a statement last week of acting as a “supra-national tax authority.” In other words, we have the stage set for one hell of a fight. In one corner, the European Commission, a powerful international body with the backing of all the EU member states (except Ireland), who are tired of having Apple pay very little tax on billions in sales. In the other, we have the world’s largest corporation, the US Treasury Department, and an Irish government that really doesn’t want to be labelled as a tax haven. Apple’s tax arrangement What the sides ultimately disagree on is how Apple’s taxes are structured through Ireland. It’s a complicated arrangement used by hundreds of big companies aside from Apple, but it works something like this. Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe are two Irish-registered companies, which hold the intellectual property to Apple products and brands outside of North and South America. Using legal tax mechanisms, all sales of Apple products in Europe went to these companies, so the bulk of all profits made in Europe ended up in Ireland. Using transfer pricing like this to funnel profits into a particular country is a legal and well-used (if ethically dubious) practice. The real problem is how profits were taxed once they got to Ireland. Apple and Ireland agreed on a system that channeled “most profits…away from Ireland to a ‘head office’ within Apple Sales International,” according to the EC. The Commission’s investigation showed that Apple had been given a tax rate as low as 0.005 percent at some points, far lower than the already-low Irish corporation tax rate of 12.5 percent. So whose rules did Apple break? The EU’s involvement makes this a weird case. Normally, tax evasion is pretty cut-and-dry: a country has rules on tax, a corporation breaks them, and then the company is found out and has to pay up. But in this case, Apple was in compliance with Ireland’s rules. It was Ireland’s rules that were out of line with the EU’s taxation policies, which don’t allow member states to act as tax havens. So Apple has to pay back taxes to Ireland, but Ireland doesn’t want the money. Directly after the Commission released its findings, Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan released a statement, saying “I disagree profoundly with the Commission’s decision,” and that he has “no choice but to seek Cabinet approval to appeal the decision before the European Courts. This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign Member State competence of taxation.” What does Apple say? Obviously, Apple isn’t happy about the ruling. Tim Cook issued an open letter to customers this morning, seeking to reassure them. In it, he restates Apple’s long-running justification of the Irish tax arrangements. Cook points out that Apple has had a tangible presence in Ireland for decades, starting with a factory with 60 employees in Cork, Ireland back in 1980. He goes on to say that “over the years, we received guidance from Irish tax authorities on how to comply correctly with Irish tax law — the same kind of guidance available to any company doing business there. In Ireland and in every country where we operate, Apple follows the law and we pay all the taxes we owe.” Cook’s final argument goes back to one of the principles of taxation, that “a company’s profits should be taxed in the country where the value is created.” Since Apple’s R&D is mostly done in California, Cook argues, that’s where Apple should be taxed. They’re all powerful-sounding arguments, but most don’t apply to this ruling. Apple does have a physical presence in Ireland, but its low taxation rate really depends on the existence of a “head office” in the country that coordinates worldwide sales. According to the EC investigation, the head office exists on paper only. The fact that Apple was in accordance with Irish tax law is also a moot point. The European Commission objects to Ireland’s own taxation policies, claiming they’re out of line with EU rules. You can see the point: the EU is a free trade zone, so if one country can manipulate its taxation code to offer low rates to multinationals, it’s offering all of the benefits of a tax haven while also being inside the world’s biggest single market. Cook’s final argument also ignores some important facts — mainly that if Apple should be taxed where it creates the value (R&D in California), why are hundreds of billions of dollars sitting offshore? What about the US government? The US Treasury Department has been unusually vocal about this case, in statements last week and also after the ruling was handed down today. Mostly, the Department objects to retroactive taxation, which is says is “unfair, contrary to well-established legal principles, and call into question the tax rules of individual Member States.” So what happens next? After the international hand-wringing is done, Apple is highly unlikely to just sit down and pay up. (Although it’s worth mentioning that the $14.5 billion back tax bill is barely 10 percent of Apple’s offshore tax holdings.) Both Apple and Ireland have said they will appeal the decision. Given that EU bureaucracy moves at a truly glacial pace, and the first investigation took three years, don’t expect this to be settled soon. But there is also a very good chance Apple ends up paying some money from this. Ireland and the United States may well disagree with the ruling, but public opinion in the 27 other EU member states is on the other side. Ireland offering favourable rates has enabled dozens of other high-profile multinationals like Starbucks and Google to avoid paying taxes in other countries.

Roston - Aug 30, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Rumors about Apple, headphones, and what the company has in store for the future of iPhone audio are all over the place, and amidst the speculation is one involving ‘AirPods’ — suspected Bluetooth earbuds that Apple may be launching in the future. A trademark filing referring to AirPods first surfaced earlier this summer, and now a Russian website has spotted Eurasian certifications for several Apple products, among them being Apple AirPods. The Eurasian Economic Union (EAEC) covers Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Armenia, and requires products intended for sale in those regions to have proper certification. The folks at iPhones.ru searched the relevant Eurasian website and found issued certificates related to the Apple Watch (a total of three certifications), two iPhones (models A1778 and A1784), and a pair of wireless earbuds called AirPods. The discovery is a pretty strong indicator that we’ll be seeing AirPods announced by Apple in the near future, but everything beyond that remains speculation. Will they be bundled with the next iPhone? Possibly. Rumor has it Apple has plans to get rid of the headphone port in the near future, instead requiring users to use Lightning-compatible headphones or an adapter. The rest of the certifications are shown below — they include three related to the Apple Watch, for whatever reason listing “watchOS 2” for all three of them instead of the latest version. There are also two for an iOS 10 device, which is likely the pair of new iPhones Apple will be announcing in upcoming days.

But how will it replace the 3.5mm headset port? How will it fix the problem it’s creating? After all, most of us already have at least one pair of regular wired headphones that will no longer work on a device that doesn’t have the audio jack, right? DON’T MISS: We have some bad news about this year’s new Nexus phones Many people think that Apple will either include wireless headphones in the iPhone 7 box (or AirPods), or include Lightning EarPods. Others believe that the company will bundle a 3.5mm-to-Lightning adapter with the iPhone 7 so that you can keep using your current headphones with the new iPhone. Apple obviously is not commenting on the matter just yet, but its actions speak louder than words — especially if we’re talking about filing official documentation with regulatory bodies. Such Apple documents filed with the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) on Monday, listing several unannounced products, including a couple of iPhone models, no less than 10 Apple Watch models, and a pair of never-before-seen "AirPods" wireless headphones. The EEC is the regulatory body that governs trademarks and patents, among other things, for Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia. Discovered by Mobiltelefon.ru on Tuesday, the filings seem to indicate that Apple is indeed planning to launch wireless headphones in the future. It’s not clear whether they’ll be bundled with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, or whether they’ll be sold separately in Apple stores. The second possibility seems infinitely more likely, of course. The filing also contains three wireless headphone models that will be sold under the Beats brand. The Apple A1778 and A1784 are two upcoming iPhones that will run iOS 10. These are the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, though it’s not clear which is which. What’s puzzling about the listing is that it offers 10 distinct product names for upcoming Apple Watch models. Recent reports said that Apple will launch an Apple Watch 2 this fall, without specifying how many different models each watch family will have. Apple’s fall event is scheduled for September 7th, at which point we should find out more details about the fate of our headphones.

The ruling is a dramatic escalation by the EU executive Commission in its battle to have multinationals pay their fair share in the region, where popular outrage over corporate tax dodging has grown after years of financial crises and austerity budgets. ___ US stocks mostly lower as investors wait for jobs report NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks fell slightly on Tuesday in another quiet day on Wall Street as hesitant investors remained on the sidelines as a slow summer winds down. Shares of the candy company Hershey plunged after it walked away from a merger proposal, and Apple slipped after the company was hit with a large tax bill in Europe. Investors continue to wait to see whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this year. The next key piece of data is coming on Friday with the August jobs report. ___ US bank earnings in 2Q climbed 1.4 per cent to $43.6B WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. banks’ earnings in the April-June period rose 1.4 per cent from a year earlier as growth in lending fueled interest income. The data issued Tuesday by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. showed continued strength in the banking industry eight years after the financial crisis struck. However, the impact of low oil prices on energy companies led banks to continue to post bigger losses on commercial and industrial loans. The FDIC reported that U.S. banks earned $43.6 billion in the second quarter, up from $43 billion a year earlier. It marks a record profit for the industry. ___ US home prices rise in June at slowest pace in 10 months WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. home prices rose modestly in June, pushed up by strong sales and a limited supply of available properties. The Standard & Poor’s CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index, released Tuesday, increased 5.1 per cent in June compared with a year ago. That’s down from a 5.3 per cent annual gain in May and is the slowest year-over-year pace since last August. Nationwide prices are increasing more quickly than incomes as buyers compete for the dwindling supply of available homes. That reflects an ongoing imbalance in the housing market that could stifle sales in the coming months. ___ US consumer confidence in August highest in 11 months WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumer confidence rose in August to its highest level in 11 months, suggesting economic growth could pick up in the second half of the year. The Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index rose to 101.1, up from 96.7 in July. It was the highest level for confidence since the index hit 102.6 last September. The gain reflected consumers’ brighter views about current the economic situation and their expectations for the future. ___ Abercrombie closing up to 60 stores after posting wider loss NEW YORK (AP) — Abercrombie & Fitch Co. reported a wider loss for its second quarter on Tuesday and said it’s closing up to 60 stores in the United States as both U.S. and international sales fell. The teen-focused retailer also offered a downbeat outlook for a key sales measure, as business continues to be hurt by a decline in tourists to its flagships in key cities. The closures will represent about 8 per cent of its store count in the domestic market. Abercrombie’s shares tumbled more than 20 per cent. ___ Potash Corp. and Agrium say they are in talks to combine NEW YORK (AP) — Fertilizer makers Potash Corp. and Agrium say they are in talks to combine into one company. The Canadian companies gave no financial details about a possible deal and say there’s no guarantee that a merger will happen. Both companies sell fertilizers and other agricultural products around the world. Potash is based in Saskatoon, Canada. Agrium is headquartered in Calgary, Canada. ___ France wants halt to ‘imbalanced’ EU-US trade deal talks PARIS (AP) — The French government wants the European Union to end talks with the U.S. on forging a sweeping trade deal that it sees as too friendly to U.S. businesses. French President Francois Hollande said Tuesday that talks on a landmark trade deal between the U.S. and European Union are unbalanced and cannot be completed before President Barack Obama leaves office. It’s the latest blow to the proposed free-trade zone that would encompass half the world’s economy. There’s resistance on both continents, and the talks are complicated by Britain’s planned exit from the EU and presidential elections in the U.S. and France. ___ Chipotle’s latest freebie: Kids eat free on Sundays NEW YORK (AP) — Chipotle’s latest burrito giveaway is for children. The company is offering free kid’s meals on Sundays during the month of September, another attempt to lure back customers spooked by a series of food scares. In June, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. launched a three-month loyalty program that lets customers earn free meals based on the number of visits they make each month. On Monday, it announced that high school and college students could get a free soda or iced tea if they buy a meal and show ID. The chain has already given away millions of free burritos this year. ___ Seattle weighs new rules for businesses with hourly workers SEATTLE (AP) — Seattle leaders have proposed new rules for retail and food-service businesses with hourly employees, including requiring them to schedule shifts two weeks in advance and compensate workers for some last-minute changes. It’s the latest push by a city that has led the nation in mandating worker benefits. Seattle was among the first to phase in a $15 hourly minimum wage, mandate sick leave for many companies and offer paid parental leave for city workers. Now, leaders are targeting erratic schedules they say make it difficult for people to juggle child care, school or other jobs or to count on stable income. ___ Christie nixes bill to raise New Jersey minimum wage to $15 PENNINGTON BOROUGH, N.J. (AP) — Republican Gov. Chris Christie on Tuesday shot down an attempt to raise New Jersey’s minimum wage to $10.10 an hour in the next year and to at least $15 over the next five. Christie announced his veto at an event at a market in Pennington, saying it would burden small businesses and describing the proposal as the “heavy hand of government.” Christie said raising wages is the job of business owners. Democrats, who control the statehouse, and liberal groups have put the legislation at the centre of their agenda. The Legislature sent Christie the measure in June. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 48.69 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 18,454.30. The Standard and Poor’s 500 lost 4.26 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 2,176.12. The Nasdaq composite fell 9.34 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 5,222.99. Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 63 cents to $46.35 a barrel. Brent crude, used to price oil internationally, fell 89 cents to $48.37 a barrel. In other energy commodities, heating oil fell 1.5 cents to $1.471 a gallon, wholesale gasoline fell 1.9 cents to $1.448 a gallon and natural gas fell 7 cents to $2.827 per thousand cubic feet. shares Share: Facebook Email Twitter LinkedIn Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.

Picture: AFP News Corp Australia Network Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend EU antitrust regulators have ordered Apple to pay up to 13 billion euros ($A19.15 billion) in taxes to the Irish government after ruling that a special scheme to route profits through Ireland was illegal state aid. The massive sum, some 40 times bigger than the previous known demand by the European Commission to a company in such a case, could be reduced, the EU executive said in a statement, if other countries sought more tax themselves from the US tech giant. It also risks inflaming tensions with the U.S., which argues the EU is picking on American companies and depriving it of potential tax windfalls of its own. White House press secretary Josh Earnest answered questions about international taxes relating to Ireland and Apple, the United States economy, cybersecurity and other topics. Picture: AP.Source:AP “The White House says the Obama administration is concerned that American taxpayers will ultimately bear the brunt of the European Union’s decision requiring Apple to pay billions of dollars in back taxes,” The Associated Press reports. At the heart of the matter is the EU’s claim that many multinationals - including Amazon and McDonalds - struck deals with EU countries to pay unusually low tax in exchange for basing their EU operations there. Apple, which with Ireland, has already said it will appeal the decision, paid a tax rate on European profits of between 0.005 and one per cent, the Commission said. “Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years,” said EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager. “This selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of one per cent on its European profits in 2003, down to 0.005 per cent in 2014,” she added. #Ireland gave illegal tax benefits to #Apple worth up to €13 billion: https://t.co/FppCWW52z4 pic.twitter.com/jkFqh35CO1— European Commission (@EU_Commission) August 30, 2016 The Apple case, which the commission has been looking into since mid-2013, is one of several high-profile probes into tax deals that EU member states granted multinationals including Starbucks, Amazon and McDonald’s. The European Union’s executive found Apple’s sales profits in Ireland, where the company has its European headquarters, were allocated in a way that “did not correspond to economic reality.” Most of the profits generated in Europe were allocated to head offices that “existed only on paper” and did not have to pay taxes anywhere, the commission said in a statement. Tbe European Union says a deal between Apple and Ireland amounted to illegal state aid. Picture: APSource:AP It demanded Ireland recoup unpaid taxes from 2003 - 10 years before the start of its inquiry - until 2014, when Apple changed its structure in Ireland. Dublin immediately announced plans to appeal Tuesday’s decision before the European courts. “This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation,” said Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan. Taxation is usually a national competence in the 28-country EU, but the commission believes it can intervene because these tax arrangements constitute state aid, an area it regulates. Unfair state aid could give companies a competitive advantage. But the Irish government said the approach is “not appropriate,” in a statement that expressed “very real concerns” that the commission is “undermining the international consensus, impeding reform and creating uncertainty for business and investment in Europe.” Last year, the commission ordered the Netherlands and Luxembourg to recoup taxes from the Starbucks coffee chain and a Fiat subsidiary. Inquiries are still underway into benefits granted to online retailer Amazon and the McDonald’s restaurant franchise. The US Treasury lashed out last week at the commission’s approach, arguing that it is “inconsistent” with international norms and undermines the global fight against tax avoidance. Washington said member states should not be forced into recovering unpaid taxes, warning that it was considering “potential responses” to the commission’s approach.

"This would strike a devastating blow to the sovereignty of EU member states over their own tax matters, and to the principle of certainty of law in Europe," Cook said in a statement Tuesday, adding: "Beyond the obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe." On Tuesday, the electronics giant was hit with a massive €13bn ($14.5bn) tax bill following a two-year investigation into the unusual arrangement Apple had reached with the Irish tax authorities that saw it pay an extraordinary 0.005 per cent tax rate in 2014. The European Commission called it "illegal state aid," the Irish tax authorities claimed they had "collected the full amount of tax due," and Apple... well, Apple claimed that the same deal is available to every business based in Ireland, if only they ask. "Over the years, we received guidance from Irish tax authorities on how to comply correctly with Irish tax law – the same kind of guidance available to any company doing business there. In Ireland and in every country where we operate, Apple follows the law and we pay all the taxes we owe." Cook also strongly disputes the EC's claims that Apple has reached a special agreement with Ireland: "The opinion issued on August 30th alleges that Ireland gave Apple a special deal on our taxes. This claim has no basis in fact or in law. We never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals." The EC explains how Apple's unusual tax arrangement works Of course, the suspicion is that the Irish authorities struck a deal with Apple in order to get it to hire people in parts of the country that were not doing well. Cook's response only serves to support this idea, and could even be seen as a coded warning to the Irish government that if it doesn't fight the decision, Apple will start dropping people. "In October 1980, Apple opened a factory in Cork, Ireland with 60 employees," Cook said, reminiscing about the days of Steve Jobs. "At the time, Cork was suffering from high unemployment and extremely low economic investment ... We have operated continuously in Cork ever since, even through periods of uncertainty about our own business, and today we employ nearly 6,000 people across Ireland. The vast majority are still in Cork." Better days? Steve Jobs visits the new Apple building in Cork in 1980 He also implies that forcing Apple to pay billions in back taxes may impact the country, beyond just itself: "Countless multinational companies followed Apple by investing in Cork, and today the local economy is stronger than ever." Despite the huge potential bill, Apple's share price dropped by just one per cent on the news. That is likely in no small part because it will still be the Irish tax authorities that ultimately decide how much Apple must pay. And Ireland is currently sticking to its guns, saying it will appeal the ruling. Cook says Apple will do the same and notes: "We are confident that the Commission's order will be reversed." Whether it will be or not is the fifteen billion dollar question. ® Sponsored: Achieving rapid delivery of high quality software with continuous delivery Tips and corrections 209 Comments Whitepapers The 2016 study on the insecurity of privileged users For purposes of this research, privileged users include database administrators, network engineers, IT security practitioners and cloud custodians Can Machine Learning Prevent Application Downtime?

That’s because the European Union ruled that the tech giant gave special and illegal tax treatment to the country. Shortly after the decision, the U.S. Treasury Department expressed disappointment. “The commission’s actions could threaten to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU,” the department said in a statement. Last week, the Treasury Department warned that the European Commission was overstepping its powers and becoming a “supranational tax authority.” The U.S. is trying to protect its revenue, explained Alan Auerbach, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley and former deputy chief of staff on the U.S. Joint Committee on Taxation. “If Apple pays more taxes in Ireland, that means it will pay fewer taxes in the U.S. to the extent that it repatriates any of those earnings from Ireland,” he said. “[That’s] because the U.S. gives foreign tax credits for taxes paid in foreign countries.” Another reason the U.S. is on Apple’s team? “It’s a big engine of activity in Silicon Valley and other places in the U.S. The Treasury may feel that it’s important for Apple to remain a healthy company,” he said. The U.S. Treasury has also complained that the commission is unfairly targeting American businesses and that its retroactive penalties go against legal principles. “The expectation is that it would not be retroactive,” said Diane Ring, who teaches international taxation at Boston College Law School. “It would be forward-looking: ‘Ireland you shouldn’t do this again with Apple.’" Both Ireland and Apple said they would appeal.  Reema Khrais Reema Khrais is a general assignment reporter based out of Los Angeles.

Photograph: Aerial Archives / Alamy Stock Ph/Alamy Stock Photo Olivia Solon in San Francisco Tuesday 30 August 2016 17.20 EDT Last modified on Friday 11 November 2016 06.35 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close This article is 4 months old Ireland’s cosy relationship with Silicon Valley has been called into question after the European commission slapped Apple with a whopping $14.6bn tax bill. The commission argued the “sweetheart” tax arrangements Ireland made with Apple between 1991 and 2015 allowed the tech giant to avoid tax on almost all profits from sales of its products across the EU’s single market, booking the profits in Ireland rather than the country where the product was sold. The reaction in Silicon Valley – which has long used creative accounting to outsmart the tax man – as well as the wider tech community has been one of shock and disappointment. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Why Apple is facing a €13bn tax bill in Ireland “Instead of saying ‘going forward, this won’t be allowed’ – which seems more fair – the EU is trying to change the rules of the game retroactively. It makes little sense to me,” said Om Malik of the San Francisco venture capital firm True Ventures. “If they change the rules going forward, that’s their prerogative. These companies have been complying with the Irish rules. Now a lot of them will have to re-evaluate their relationships with Europe.” ‘This could be a serious problem for the tech industry’ It’s not just big companies that will be affected, says Matt Lerner from the venture capital seed fund and accelerator 500 Startups. “The world is getting smaller. Every day we see the free flow of talent and capital across borders. Sometimes it’s for a lower cost of living, or to reach talent or for tax breaks. Even startups are doing this stuff,” he said. The EU is trying to change the rules of the game retroactively Om Malik, True Ventures “What concerns founders and their investors is if there’s a lack of predictability. Apple has been doing this since 1991, thinking it was following the law, and now suddenly it’s a problem. “Intellectually, this concerns me a lot. For this to suddenly happen could be a serious problem for the tech industry,” he said. “But the public markets aren’t too panicked about this, which leads me to believe this isn’t the end of it.” ‘Ireland may never see a cent of that €13bn’ For Daire Hickey, the Irish cofounder of Web Summit, a conference for startups, the decision is bad news for his homeland, despite some Irish newspapers reporting the news as if it were a lottery win for the country. “Ireland has always been transparent in its wish to tax Apple and other multinationals at a low rate. The EU is moving the goalposts by giving a decision on something that has been going on for decades. “While the country could do with €13bn, we have always been up front about our low tax rate and we absolutely have to defend it. Tech giants know where the power lies. It’s not with us | Rafael Behr Read more “It’s farcical to suggest for the EU to dangle €13bn in front of the Irish people. Between appeals, claims made by other countries, including the US, Ireland may never see a cent of that €13bn. This policy could open the floodgates for chaos.” But not everyone in the valley is Team Apple. ‘Sales in Europe should be taxed in Europe’ “Neither Apple nor any other company should be allowed to have their cake and eat it too,” said Pratap Chatterjee, of the San Francisco-based watchdog CorpWatch. “Sales in Europe should be taxed in Europe.” It is wrong that my purchases are used to enrich the 1% rather than support the community in which Apple works Pratap Chatterjee, CorpWatch “As a San Francisco Bay area resident, I have used Apple computers and phones for 25 years and I think it is wrong that my purchases are used to enrich the 1% rather than supporting the community in which it works.” Silicon Valley has long had close ties with the Emerald Isle, stemming from the thousands of Irish emigrants who moved to San Francisco in the early 1800s, fleeing a country facing famine in favour of one on the cusp of a gold rush. In 1854, two newly successful Irish arrivals, Denis Oliver and Dan McGlynn, bought a plot of land to the south of San Francisco and founded a ranch, which they named after a place in Galway where Oliver grew up – Menlo Park, now home to Facebook and the venture capital firms clustered along Sand Hill Road. In more recent years, Ireland, along with the Netherlands and Luxembourg, have wooed Silicon Valley with attractive tax deals, offering low rates of corporate tax in return for job creation and investment. What this meant for Apple was an effective tax rate of less than 1% of profits. Today’s ruling is just the start. Tax collectors across Europe will be poring over the business activities of Apple and other multinationals in their markets, wringing their hands at the tantalizing possibility of an EU-sanctioned windfall. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley’s tech elite prepares to board private jets to Burning Man, wondering what the European Union has against them.

Brussels said Apple, the world's most valuable company, avoided virtually all tax on its business in the bloc by illegal arrangements with Dublin which gave the company an unfair advantage over competitors. Apple and the Irish government immediately said they would appeal against the European Commission ruling, with the iPhone maker warning it could cost European jobs. The White House meanwhile cautioned against "unilateral" measures by the EU. The company's shares lost some of their shine after the ruling, down 0.7 per cent in early afternoon trading, making for a more than 3 per cent loss over the past two weeks ahead of the highly anticipated ruling. "This decision sends a clear message. Member states cannot give unfair tax benefits to selected companies, no matter if European or foreign, large or small," EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. "The Commission's investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years," she added. Ireland has attracted multinationals over many years by offering extremely favourable sweetheart tax deals to generate much-needed jobs and investment. But after a three-year investigation Brussels said the arrangement with Apple broke EU laws on state aid. The findings come amid growing tensions between Washington and Brussels over a series of EU anti-trust investigations targeting other giant US companies such as Google, Amazon, McDonald's, Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler. Apple has had a base in the southern city of Cork since 1980 and employs nearly 6,000 people in Ireland, through which it routes its international sales totalling billions. Apple chief Tim Cook said he was "confident" the EU ruling would be overturned, adding that the Silicon Valley giant was the biggest taxpayer in Ireland, the United States and the world. "The most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe," he said. Cook also warned that the ruling was a "devastating blow to the sovereignty of EU member states over their own tax matters", echoing the concerns of Dublin over the decision. Ireland's Finance Minister Michael Noonan described the ruling as "bizarre" and "an exercise in politics by the Competition Commission".

Finance Search US, European markets split as Apple hit with $14.5 bn tax billAFP – Tue, Aug 30, 2016 9:49 PM AEST Related Content View Photo The European Commission found that Apple avoided tax bills on virtually all its profits in the bloc under its arrangements with Ireland European and US equities markets went in opposite directions on Tuesday, with Wall Street in negative territory after European officials ordered Apple to pay $14.5 billion in back taxes. Apple's shares fell 0.8 percent on the Nasdaq, leaving them down 3.2 percent over the last two weeks as the European Commission decision loomed. Apple said it will challenge the ruling that it was given unwarranted tax breaks by Ireland. Meanwhile, a drop in eurozone business confidence saw markets in Paris and Frankfurt finish higher on expectations that the European Central Bank will increase stimulus measures. A sharp monthly rise in US consumer confidence for August that was reported Tuesday did not appear to inspire buyers on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 percent while the broader S&P 500 lost 0.2 percent and the Nasdaq was down 0.2 percent. Bill Lynch of Hinsdale Associates told AFP there had been little to move US markets one way or another in late summer trading. "We were up yesterday so we're just giving up some of the gains," he said. Lynch added that markets may be treading water in advance of Friday's figures on US job creation in August, which will help determine the likelihood of a near-term increase in US interest rates. Shares in other multinationals which, like Apple, run much of their international operations via Ireland, such as Google parent Alphabet and Facebook, also dipped. Microsoft and HP fell 0.4 percent while Google parent Alphabet Inc was down 0.5 percent. - 'Tough for multinationals' - The EU has recently stepped up its campaign against deep corporate tax breaks from member states, last year ordering US coffee giant Starbucks and Italian automaker Fiat each to repay up to 30 million euros in back taxes to the Netherlands and Luxembourg respectively. ETX Capital analyst Neil Wilson said investors were fretting over the longer term implications rather than the size of the fine. "For Apple and others like it, this could be a watershed," Wilson added. "Caught between an aggressive EC and the Obama regime's clampdown on tax inversions, it's looking increasingly tough for multinationals to avoid paying the going tax rate." In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX 30 finished up 1.1 percent and the CAC 40 in Paris added 0.8 percent as weak German inflation and a drop in eurozone business confidence raised hopes the ECB will beef up stimulus. The Economic Sentiment Indicator for the 19-nation eurozone fell one full point to 103.5 in August as Britain's vote to quit the European Union continued to undermine business and consumer confidence in August. Meanwhile Germany's 12-month inflation rate dipped to 0.3 percent in August, suggesting central bank easing is not yet bearing fruit. "The ECB has reason to increase its policy support, perhaps as soon as next week," Jack Allen at Capital Economics wrote. London's FTSE 100 index dipped 0.3 percent after a long holiday weekend. Asian equities mostly rose on Tuesday, but Tokyo ended slightly lower on tepid data and profit-taking. - Key figures around 2100 GMT - New York - DOW: DOWN 0.3 percent at 18,454.30 (close) New York - S&P 500: DOWN 0.2 percent at 2,176.12 (close) New York - Nasdaq: DOWN 0.2 percent at 5,222.99 (close) London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.3 percent at 6,820.79 points (close) Frankfurt - DAX 30: UP 1.1 percent at 10,657.64 (close) Paris - CAC 40: UP 0.8 percent at 4,457.49 (close) EURO STOXX 50: UP 1.1 percent at 3,030.25 (close) Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.1 percent at 16,725.35 (close) Shanghai - Composite: UP 0.2 percent at 3,074.68 (close) Hong Kong - Hang Seng: UP 0.9 percent at 23,016.11 (close) Euro/dollar: DOWN at $1.1143 from $1.1187 late on Monday Dollar/yen: UP at 103.02 yen from 101.88 yen Pound/dollar: DOWN at $1.3076 from $1.3105 Top Stories » Jamie Oliver to shut 6 UK restaurantsAAP Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver is shutting six of his 42 Jamie's Italian restaurants in Britain amid tough trading … Fiat avoids Trump wrath, but Mexico imports coming soonAFP Mexico slams 'threats' against investorsAFP VW near $2 bn US criminal settlement in 'dieselgate': reportAFP Sponsored  On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Car Insurance Sussan Ley NBN Florida airport Interflora James Hird Interest rate Australia Mexico wall Australia energy Tilikum Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Behold: The very best of CES 2017 Mobile Image Source: iFeng Official Apple documentation reveals one fix for the iPhone 7’s headphone problem Chris Smith @chris_writes August 30th, 2016 at 5:15 PM Share Tweet In case you didn’t know, Apple is going to kill the standard audio jack on the iPhone 7 – go grab your pitchfork. But how will it replace the 3.5mm headset port? How will it fix the problem it’s creating? After all, most of us already have at least one pair of regular wired headphones that will no longer work on a device that doesn’t have the audio jack, right? DON’T MISS: We have some bad news about this year’s new Nexus phones Many people think that Apple will either include wireless headphones in the iPhone 7 box (or AirPods), or include Lightning EarPods. Others believe that the company will bundle a 3.5mm-to-Lightning adapter with the iPhone 7 so that you can keep using your current headphones with the new iPhone. Apple obviously is not commenting on the matter just yet, but its actions speak louder than words — especially if we’re talking about filing official documentation with regulatory bodies. Such Apple documents filed with the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) on Monday, listing several unannounced products, including a couple of iPhone models, no less than 10 Apple Watch models, and a pair of never-before-seen “AirPods” wireless headphones. The EEC is the regulatory body that governs trademarks and patents, among other things, for Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia. Credit: Apple Insider Discovered by Mobiltelefon.ru on Tuesday, the filings seem to indicate that Apple is indeed planning to launch wireless headphones in the future. It’s not clear whether they’ll be bundled with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, or whether they’ll be sold separately in Apple stores. The second possibility seems infinitely more likely, of course. The filing also contains three wireless headphone models that will be sold under the Beats brand. The Apple A1778 and A1784 are two upcoming iPhones that will run iOS 10. These are the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, though it’s not clear which is which. What’s puzzling about the listing is that it offers 10 distinct product names for upcoming Apple Watch models. Recent reports said that Apple will launch an Apple Watch 2 this fall, without specifying how many different models each watch family will have. Apple’s fall event is scheduled for September 7th, at which point we should find out more details about the fate of our headphones.

Reuters EU demands Apple pay Ireland 13 billion euros in taxes, citing illegal tax breaks The Israelis behind history's 'most sophisticated tracker program' that wormed into Apple If spies can hack our iPhones, what’s stopping them from framing us for crimes? Israeli companies could be hit with hundreds of millions of dollars in assessments for back taxes after a landmark European Union ruling ordering Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) for what it said were unpaid taxes. The European Commission ordered the U.S. technology giant to pay Ireland the amount, which Dublin opposes, saying the tax breaks Ireland had given the company were tantamount to illegal state aid. The decision is part of a drive against what the EU says are sweetheart tax deals that some member states offer multinational companies to lure jobs and investment. Harel Perlmutter, a tax attorney at Barnea & Company in Tel Aviv, said the ruling marked a new era in the tax treatment of multinational companies. That includes many Israeli companies that have based their European headquarters in countries, like Ireland, that offered the lowest tax rates. Like Apple, they could find themselves facing retroactive tax bills, he said. Worse, the EU decision could spark a tax-break war that spreads to countries outside of Europe, other tax experts warned. “Companies need to understand now more than ever that the world is becoming more complicated and reaching tax rulings with specific countries won’t stay in force forever. Even after enjoying special tax arrangements for years, they are likely to find themselves facing demands for dramatic changes in their payments,” Perlmutter said. Like Ireland, Israel also offers companies tax breaks that are often quite generous and is planning a special regime for multinational high-tech companies that would allow them to pay a super-low corporate rate of as little as 6% for companies . The tax plan, which is contained in the 2017-18 Budget Arrangements Law, aim to lure companies with intellectual property assets to base themselves in Israel where the government can then collect tax. An accountant who represents multinational companies and asked not to be identified said that while the EU ruling only directly member states, it would have a chilling effect on other countries like Israel, especially since the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is leading a crackdown on tax shelters. “The impact will be in the details of the legislation being constructed,” he said, adding optimistically, “The working assumption is that the research and development of the companies enjoying the tax benefits will actually be done in Israel, so registering the IP here won’t be fictional.”   Ora Coren Haaretz Contributor Ora Coren Send me email alerts for new articles by Ora Coren Send Close Email * Please enter your email Ora Coren For a list of Haaretz newsletters, click here.

More videos EU slaps Apple with $19 billion tax bill Ireland gave undue tax benefits to Apple which Commissioner Margrethe Vestager says the tech giant now has to pay back. Apple had been given illegal tax benefits by Ireland, where the company recorded all its profits from sales across Europe. This allowed the tech giant to pay an effective tax rate of just 0.005 per cent in 2014. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Casting a shadow: The EU could force the global giant to pay billions in back taxes related to incentives from Ireland. Photo: AP The company had booked sales profits in head offices that "existed only on paper", the Commission said. Ireland has been ordered to recover the unpaid tax but the country says it doesn't want the money – fearing it would hurt long-term investment – and will appeal the ruling. Advertisement The sum is less than early estimates of up to €19 billion, however Dublin had hoped the amount would be less than €1 billion. Apple warned the decision would "have a profound and harmful effect on investment and job creation in Europe". Source: European Commission The decision would "upend the international tax system" and Apple was confident it would be overturned on appeal, the company said in a statement. All profits from Apple's European sales had been recorded by Apple Sales International in Ireland, which paid almost no tax under a sweetheart deal with the Irish state. The money was then funnelled back to the United States as payments for research and development. "This decision sends a clear message (that) member states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies – this is illegal under EU state aid rules," said Margrethe Vestager, European Commissioner for Competition. In 2014 the European Commission opened investigations into Apple in Ireland, Starbucks into the Netherlands and Fiat and Amazon in Luxembourg. It was looking at tax rulings issued by those governments to the companies on how they could calculate their taxable profits. The Commission issued a preliminary decision in 2014 saying it believed Ireland's tax rulings for Apple had been illegal under European trade law. On Tuesday the European Commission concluded that Ireland granted "undue tax benefits" of up to €13 billion to Apple, through an effective corporate tax rate that was 1 per cent in 2003 and just 0.005 per cent by 2014. Sales profits recorded by Apples Sales International and Apple Operations Europe were attributed to head offices "that existed only on paper", the Commission said. "Two tax rulings issued by Ireland to Apple have substantially and artificially lowered the tax paid by Apple in Ireland since 1991 ... Ireland must now recover the illegal aid. "The tax treatment in Ireland enabled Apple to avoid taxation on almost all profits generated by sales of Apple products in the entire EU Single Market. This is due to Apple's decision to record all sales in Ireland rather than in the countries where the products were sold." Apple will also have to pay interest on the unpaid tax. Irish finance minister, Michael Noonan, said he would seek approval from the Irish Cabinet to appeal ruling. "It is important that we send a strong message that Ireland remains an attractive and stable location of choice for long-term substantive investment," he said. "Apple has been in Ireland since the 1980s and employs thousands of people in Cork." Ms Vestager said there were "many good and transparent ways" for EU countries to support and encourage investment without breaking competition laws. "Illegal aid harms competition," she said. "The ultimate goal should be that all companies, big or small, pay taxes where they generate their profits. However this goal would require global co-operation, she said. "We need some changes in corporate philosophies and we need changes in legislation to address loopholes and to ensure transparency." Two investigations were still underway into Amazon and McDonalds, she said. She added that not all Apple's unpaid taxes may be due in Ireland. "Other countries in the EU or elsewhere can look at our investigation and can use our data," she said. "If they conclude Apple should have recorded its sales in those countries they could require Apple to pay more tax in that country – that would reduce the amount paid to Ireland." Apple could also reduce its tax bill by paying more to its US parent company to fund R&D, she said. Last year the Netherlands was ordered to recover €30 million from Starbucks after an investigation into a similar deal. Advertisement HuffPost Australia Centrelink Phone Lines Jammed, People ...

ON AIR NOW2:00 PM - 6:00 PMSteele and Drex BUSINESS REPORT: Facts about Apple’s taxes in Ireland that may surprise you Vancouver, BC, Canada / News Talk 980 CKNW | Vancouver's News. Vancouver's Talk Michael and Robert Levy Posted: August 30, 2016 01:29 pm A few surprising facts about Apple’s taxes in Ireland and the ruling to repay $14.5 billion US plus interest after the European Commission said Ireland illegally slashed the phone maker’s tax bill between 2003 and 2014. According to Bloomberg News the ruling came on sweetheart deals cut by countries on major corporations to keep operations in their country and allows the company, in this case Apple, to move their profits and costs to wherever they are taxed most advantageously. Now catch the tax rate the Commission claims Apple paid, “an effective corporate tax rate of one per cent on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005 per cent in 2014.” The U.S. government has come in on the side of Apple and the Irish government along with Apple are going to appeal the ruling. Meanwhile, if you wonder if Apple could afford the fine should the ruling stick; no problem. Apple has a reported US $232 billion in cash, of which $214 billion is outside the U.S. And other companies possibly facing the same fate in other European Union Countries: Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler in the Netherlands and Luxembourg and investigations are ongoing against Amazon, McDonald’s and Google parent Alphabet.

US computer giant Apple faces a $14.5 billion bill for tax that the EU in Brussels has ruled was avoided in Ireland. Both Dublin and Apple are appealing the EU decision, which found that generous tax breaks granted to the US computer firm to attract it to locate and “brass-plate” many of its operations in Ireland, were illegal. The concessions granted by Irish tax authorities, like those dispensed to international companies by Luxembourg, contravene EU rules. The Irish government, of course, cut the deal because it wanted to create jobs and attract prestigious international corporations. Such tactics had much to do with the emergence in the 1990s of the Irish “Tiger” economy. This collapsed, arguably not because the model was wrong but because Irish companies and the public, just as in Greece, embarked on an unsustainable borrowing binge. Interestingly, the US government has been loud in its denunciation of the EU investigation into Apple’s Irish tax arrangements. This does not make a lot of sense. The Obama administration has protested the activities of major US corporations in “offshoring” their earnings to protect them from US tax, as well as relocating their corporate HQs outside of America for the same reasons. Apple has a huge offshore cash pile of more than $200 billion. Rather than bring that money home for reinvestment and dividends, as well as tax, it is actually borrowing to pay investors and to fund the development of new products. This makes even more sense in US tax terms, since the interest payments can be set aside the tax that Apple actually does hand over to the US Treasury. The problem with taxation law in so many countries is that it is now massively complex. For major companies with operations across the world, this has become a playground for legitimate tax mitigation, using loopholes that have occurred deliberately or through bad drafting. For understaffed and underfunded tax authorities, challenging the intricate stratagems put in place by extremely wealthy corporations is always difficult because these schemes have been designed by highly-paid accountants and lawyers. It can surely be no coincidence that the membership of many legislatures is dominated by – guess who – accountants and lawyers. Governments are clearly being deprived of billions of dollars of revenues every year. This means either that other taxpayers must pay more or governments have less to spend. There is surely an overwhelming case for an across-the-board and absolute simplification of tax codes. Personal and corporate tax rates are set and claimable expenses defined. Multinationals will pay taxes in the countries where income is earned. That tax rate of course may be different from their home country. Unfortunately, besides the catastrophic loss of income for the accountancy and tax-law professions, governments will be reluctant to be the first to introduce a system that might not be mirrored elsewhere. The risk would be that local companies might relocate to jurisdictions where they could continue to play fast and loose with the rules. Yet it seems clear that infinitely simpler and more transparent tax laws are an absolute necessity both for government incomes and to reassure ordinary taxpayers that they are not paying more than their fair share.

All News Movies Games TV Culture Anime August 29, 2016 David Webb Invites for Apple’s September Event have been sent out We call it the September Event, but let’s just call it what it is – the iPhone Event. The time of year that Apple fans wait for every year is now upon us, and no, I don’t mean the pumpkin spice latte. Apple has recently sent out their invites to the lucky few that are invited to see the reveal of the newest iPhone, in addition to the various other announcements that Apple makes in the Fall. The event will be held in San Francisco on September 7th. The invite was pretty cryptic in that it simply reads “See you on the 7th. Please join us for an invitation-only event.” The event is set to take place at 10am, and although there is no word on whether Apple will live stream it or not, there is a pretty good chance they will. With rumors surrounding the tech giant’s newest smartphone, the big question that everyone is waiting to be answered is “Will the iPhone have a headphone jack?” Rumors of Apple putting the kibosh on the 3.5 mm jack in favor of pushing users towards Bluetooth audio, or headphones with a lighting plug, have been circling for months. While there are pros on cons on both sides of the debate, the move will certainly be a bold one.

On Jan. 5th, Trump tweeted a threat to the Japanese automaker for a planned factory in Mexico for Corolla production. The tweet threatened a big border tax on future imports from the proposed plant in Baja, adding to build the plant in the United States. But the Toyota Motor Corp. is an important corporate citizen in the US already. According to the company, they have invested over $21 billion in US operations over the past 6 decades.

Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 117.91 +1.30 +1.11% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 795.99 +15.54 +1.99% McDonald's Corp MCD ▲ 120.76 +1.06 +0.89% Starbucks Corp SBUX ▲ 57.13 +0.67 +1.19% The massive sum, 40 times bigger than the previous known demand by the European Commission to a company in such a case, could be reduced, the EU executive said in a statement, if other countries sought more tax themselves from the U.S. tech giant. Apple, which with Ireland said it will appeal the decision, paid tax rates on European profits on sales of its iPhone and other devices and services of between just 0.005 percent in 2014 and 1 percent in 2003, the Commission said. "Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years," said Competition Commission Margrethe Vestager, whose crackdown on mainly U.S. multinationals has angered Washington which accuses Brussels of protectionism. Online retailer Amazon.com Inc and hamburger group McDonald's Corp face probes over taxes in Luxembourg, while coffee chain Starbucks Corp has been ordered to pay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) to the Dutch state. A bill of 300 million euros this year for Swedish engineer Atlas Copco AB to pay Belgian tax is the current known record. Other companies ordered to pay back taxes in Belgium, many of them European, have not disclosed figures. For Apple, whose earnings of $18 billion last year were the biggest ever reported by a corporation, finding several billion dollars should not be an insurmountable problem. The 13 billion euros represents about 6 percent of the firm's cash pile. As of June, Apple reported it had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $231.5 billion, of which 92.8 percent, or $214.9 billion, were held in foreign subsidiaries. It paid $2.67 billion in taxes during its latest quarter at an effective tax rate of 25.5 percent, leaving it with net income of $7.8 billion according to company filings. The European Commission in 2014 accused Ireland of dodging international tax rules by letting Apple shelter profits worth tens of billions of dollars from tax collectors in return for maintaining jobs. Apple and Ireland rejected the accusation. "I disagree profoundly with the Commission," Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said in a statement. "The decision leaves me with no choice but to seek cabinet approval to appeal. "This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation." Ireland also said the disputed tax system used in the Apple case no longer applied and that the decision had no effect on Ireland's 12.5 percent corporate tax rate or on any other company with operations in the country. Apple said in a statement it was confident of winning an appeal. "The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process. The Commission’s case is not about how much Apple pays in taxes, it’s about which government collects the money. It will have a profound and harmful effect on investment and job creation in Europe." REVERSE ENGINEERING When it opened the Apple investigation in 2014, the Commission told the Irish government that tax rulings it agreed in 1991 and 2007 with the company amounted to state aid and might have broken EU laws. The Commission said the rulings were "reverse engineered" to ensure Apple had a minimal Irish bill and that minutes of meetings between Apple representatives and Irish tax officials showed the company's tax treatment had been "motivated by employment considerations." Apple employs 5,500, or about a quarter of its Europe-based staff, in the Irish city of Cork, where it is the largest private sector employer. It has said it paid Ireland's 12.5 percent rate on all the income that it generates in the country. Ireland's low corporate tax rate has been a cornerstone of economic policy for 20 years, drawing investors from multinational companies whose staff account for almost one in 10 workers in Ireland. Some opposition Irish lawmakers have urged Dublin to collect whatever tax the Commission orders it to. But the main opposition party Fianna Fail, whose support the minority administration relies on to pass laws, said it would support an appeal based on reassurances it had been given by the government. The U.S. Treasury Department published a white paper last week that said the EU executive's tax investigations departed from international taxation norms and would have an outsized impact on U.S. companies. The Commission said it treated all companies equally. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem. Please try again.

In the letter, addressed to "the Apple community in Europe," Cook called the commission's action"unprecedented" and says it would have "serious, wide-reaching implications," casting the ruling as a rewriting of prior law that would have its own consequences. "It is effectively proposing to replace Irish tax laws with a view of what the Commission thinks the law should have been," Cook wrote. "This would strike a devastating blow to the sovereignty of EU member states over their own tax matters, and to the principle of certainty of law in Europe." Read More: • Apple hit with $20b Irish tax bill • Here's why Ireland doesn't want Apple's back tax billions Saying there was an "obvious targeting of Apple," Cook wrote that "the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe. Using the Commission's theory, every company in Ireland and across Europe is suddenly at risk of being subjected to taxes under laws that never existed." It is the second time this year Cook has taken a highly complex, controversial issue mired in political trip wires and written directly to customers and shareholders to publicly defend his company's stance. In February, Apple issued a customer letter, signed by Cook, in which he explained the company's decision to oppose an FBI order to unlock a phone belonging to the man behind the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack. "Opposing this order is not something we take lightly," Cook wrote. "We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the U.S. government."

Google, Amazon and Starbucks Andrew Jacobs and Michalis Rokas: Partnership powers in the Pacific Video Watch: Apple hit with record €13bn over Irish tax deal Defending the much lower taxes that Apple has paid overseas is not going to engender the kind of goodwill that an open letter to customers advocating for their privacy did in February. Yet the strategy of writing directly to the public, rather than relying on spokespeople or industry groups to address the topic, could at least help Cook shape the debate. In Tuesday's letter, he acknowledges the intricacy of the subject matter and attempts to outline the basics of international corporate taxes: "Taxes for multinational companies are complex, yet a fundamental principle is recognised around the world: A company's profits should be taxed in the country where the value is created. Apple, Ireland and the United States all agree on this principle." We now find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we don't owe them any more than we've already paid. Tim Cook The European Commission's ruling said that following an investigation launched in 2014, it decided that Ireland granted "undue tax benefits" to Apple, something that is illegal under the European Union's state aid rules. The European Commissioner in charge of competition policy, Margrethe Vestager, said in a statement that Apple paid an effective corporate tax rate as low as 0.005 percent in 2014. The investigation showed "that the tax rulings issued by Ireland endorsed an artificial internal allocation of profits within Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe, which has no factual or economic justification." In his letter, Cook responded by saying the allegation that Ireland gave Apple its own deal "has no basis in fact or in law" and that the company "never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals. We now find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we don't owe them any more than we've already paid." In doing so, Cook writes, "the European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple's history in Europe, ignore Ireland's tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process." He also writes that "at its root, the Commission's case is not about how much Apple pays in taxes. It is about which government collects the money." The letter echoes comments Cook made to The Washington Post in an extended, wide-ranging interview in late July examining his first five years on the job. Asked about the EU ruling, he said "the basic controversy at the root of this is, people really aren't arguing that Apple should pay more taxes. They're arguing about who they should be paid to. And so there's a tug of war going on between the countries of how you allocate profits." In Tuesday's letter, Cook said Apple, as well as Ireland, would appeal the ruling. - Washington Post By Jena McGregor Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

The Dow closed down 48 points, while the Standard & Poor's 500 and Nasdaq lost about 0.2%.  Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 117.91 +1.30 +1.11% AdChoices Wall Street continues to waver on whether the Fed will hike interest rates for the first time this year, after Fed chair Janet Yellen said Friday that the case for a rate increase had "strengthened" recently. There is a camp on Wall Street that believes the Fed will move at its Sept. 20-21 meeting if the August jobs report, set for release Friday, comes in strong. Also weighing on stocks Tuesday -- following Monday's 108-point Dow gain -- was the news surrounding iPhone maker Apple, a stock that has a sizable weighting in all three of the major U.S. stock indexes. Apple must pay up to $14.5 billion in back taxes to Ireland, the European Union ruled Tuesday after the bloc's antitrust arm concluded that the technology firm was given illegal tax benefits over two decades.  In a letter published today, Apple CEO Tim Cook responded: "The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process.

We now find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we don't owe them any more than we've already paid." Stock investors are closely watching the Fed's next move, as a rate hike would take the market by surprise, and likely continue the recent rise in the value of the U.S. dollar, which hurts the competitiveness and profitability of U.S.companies that do a lot of business abroad, as well as pressure oil prices, which are priced in dollars. A Fed hike would likely push up interest rates in the U.S. as well. In early trading Tuesday, the yield on the 10-year U.S. treasury note was 1.570%, up fractionally from Monday. Stocks in Europe were broadly higher. The Stoxx Europe 600 was up 0.5%. Shares were mostly higher in Asia, with stocks up in Hong Kong, mainland China, but slightly lower in Japan.

Tuesday, August 30, 2016 [Tweets] [Favorites] Apple, Ireland, and the EU SA.38373: At this stage, the Commission has reasons to consider that the tax ruling granted to Apple constitute State aid pursuant to Article 107(1) of the Treaty. Accordingly, the Commission has doubts that Apple is paying a sufficient amount of taxes in Ireland. The rulings are imputable to Ireland and would constitute a use of State resources in terms of foregone tax revenues. In line with the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (Joined Cases C-182/03 and C-217/03 Forum 187), tax rulings can provide an advantage to the undertaking to which they are granted if those rulings approve of a pricing arrangement which departs from conditions which would have been set between independent market operators (the arm’s length principle). The Commission examined whether the pricing arrangements in the tax rulings concluded between the Irish tax authorities and Apple depart from conditions which would have been set between independent market operators. In the present case, the methods used to determine the profit allocation to the two branches ASI and AOE are not supported by an economic assessment and seem at least in part to be guided by employment considerations which raises doubts as to whether a prudent independent market operator would have accepted a similar pricing arrangement in the same situation. Instead, the authorities accepted to calculate the profit attributable to the branches on the basis of actual costs without this choice being reasoned. As costs should normally be an appropriate net profit indicator for routine functions not requiring a specific valuable such as a unique intellectual property right, which at least existed in relation to AOE, the Commission doubts the appropriateness of the transfer pricing method chosen. European Commission (via Tim Hardwick): The European Commission has concluded that Ireland granted undue tax benefits of up to €13 billion to Apple. This is illegal under EU state aid rules, because it allowed Apple to pay substantially less tax than other businesses. Ireland must now recover the illegal aid. […] Following an in-depth state aid investigation launched in June 2014, the European Commission has concluded that two tax rulings issued by Ireland to Apple have substantially and artificially lowered the tax paid by Apple in Ireland since 1991. The rulings endorsed a way to establish the taxable profits for two Irish incorporated companies of the Apple group (Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe), which did not correspond to economic reality: almost all sales profits recorded by the two companies were internally attributed to a “head office”. The Commission’s assessment showed that these “head offices” existed only on paper and could not have generated such profits. These profits allocated to the “head offices” were not subject to tax in any country under specific provisions of the Irish tax law, which are no longer in force. As a result of the allocation method endorsed in the tax rulings, Apple only paid an effective corporate tax rate that declined from 1% in 2003 to 0.005% in 2014 on the profits of Apple Sales International. Tim Cook (via Mitchel Broussard, Hacker News, Slashdot, Investor FAQ): The opinion issued on August 30th alleges that Ireland gave Apple a special deal on our taxes. This claim has no basis in fact or in law. We never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals. We now find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we don’t owe them any more than we’ve already paid. As I understand it, Apple didn’t get a special deal; rather, they went to great lengths to take advantage of a tax loophole. Ireland was happy with this—it got lots of jobs and taxes on revenue that didn’t really have to do with Ireland. The EU says that the Apple/Ireland position is in violation of what Ireland agreed to when joining the Common Market. The business structure is definitely illegal now, which is why Apple changed it in 2015, but it was allegedly also illegal in 1991, which is why they want Apple to pay retroactively. Cook’s letter seems to be aimed at getting Ireland to fight the EU on its behalf. Kirk McElhearn: Apple is saying that sales in EU countries are actually made by Apple’s Irish subsidiary; that any brick and mortar or online store in another country is actually part of Apple Ireland. That the store where I buy my iPhone in the UK isn’t really in the UK, as far as taxes are concerned. Nick Heer: Before Ireland adjusted their tax code in 2015 to remove the so-called “Double Irish” scheme, Google, Facebook, and many other large companies made use of the country’s policies to dramatically reduce the tax they paid outside of the United States. Earlier this year, Google was accused of using a similar scheme to Apple’s in the U.K., which they ended up settling for far less than the expected amount. Todd Ditchendorf: Regardless of what you think of Apple’s tax evasion strategy, it doesn’t jibe with Cook’s usual conspicuous self-righteousness. Update (2016-08-31): Dan Bookoff: “The Irish Revenue don’t do deals,” Noonan told CNBC on August 30. “They issue opinions to clarify a tax situation for individual companies, but we never do deals.” […] One reason all this might seem odd to Americans is that the “special treatment” Ireland is accused of giving Apple is similar to incentives American states give companies all the time legally. Massachusetts, for instance, put together $145 million in incentives to persuade General Electric to move from suburban Connecticut to Boston. Update (2016-09-06): Mark Sullivan (via Hacker News): To get the other side of the argument I went to Matt Gardner, the director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (the research umbrella for Citizens for Tax Justice). The CTJ is nonpartisan and nonprofit, and it’s funded by some of the same foundations that fund NPR. As it turns out, Gardner energetically disagrees with many of the statements in Cook’s letter. Here are his responses to Cook’s main points. […] It’s clear as day—and this was one of the findings of the 2013 Senate subcommittee—that there was no sensible business reason to set up those subsidiaries except to avoid paying taxes. It makes no difference that Ireland cheerfully agreed to it. It’s still a tax dodge, just a state-sanctioned tax dodge. […] All the EU is saying is that Ireland’s tax rate is 12.5% and wouldn’t it be nice if Apple actually paid that tax rate. It’s certainly not coming up with a new tax regime that’s never been seen before. […] It sounds like what they’re saying is that these ought to be thought of as U.S. profits, which makes it hard to understand why they have been so eager to report these profits in Ireland up until now. Todd Ditchendorf reminds us of “just do what’s right” and “the bloody ROI.” Apple Business Legal Taxes Tim Cook 2 Comments 2 Comments wondering August 31, 2016 3:02 AM "The opinion issued on August 30th alleges that Ireland gave Apple a special deal on our taxes. This claim has no basis in fact or in law." I find this hard to believe considering Apple's reputation when it comes to negotiating anything with its suppliers or "partners". Lukas September 13, 2016 4:02 PM It's interesting that some of the Apple defenders are pointing out that Ireland doesn't want the money, and seem to be using this as evidence that Apple was wronged by this somehow ("It’s telling that Ireland is objecting just as strenuously as Apple"). I'm not sure if they don't understand what's going on, or if they're willingly ignoring it, but I think it's pretty sad that at least some of the Mac community has, during the last twenty years, kind of morphed from a bunch of misfits who really liked a small company that made cool products to, well, the unpaid PR division of one of the world's richest multinational corporations. Going from "the computer for the rest of us" to "tax evasion is actually kind of not that bad, if you really think about it" seems like it should be more of a stretch than it apparently turned out to be.

The announcement that the amount of unpaid taxes owed by the Cupertino based company was of the order of €13bn, likely induced sharp intakes of breath among foreign multinational executives here. But regardless of the rights and wrongs of the situation, what does it all mean for Apple’s operations in Ireland, for the tech industry here, and the wider Irish foreign direct investment space? Apple has had operations in Cork since 1980, when the fledgling company opened its European Headquarters in the city. Since then it has slowly, steadily and to an extent quietly grown its presence to become arguably the most influential employer in the region. Almost 6,000 people are now employed there in a variety of roles, including manufacturing of Mac computers and other devices, supply chain management, operations, sales, risk management, shared services and more. Nearly 1,000 of those have been added in the past year, following an investment announcement last November timed to coincide with the visit of Apple CEO Tim Cook to the plant. On Friday the company received planning permission for a new 15,000 square metre building to accommodate the new recruits. WIDER ECONOMY There are also thousands more employed in the wider regional and national economy as a result of the company’s strong foundations in the city. The presence of such a significant player has helped in the development of a vibrant tech ecosystem in the city and surrounds, with a burgeoning startup scene and the arrival of many other tech multinationals. Elsewhere in Athenry in Galway, Apple has been granted permission to build an €850 million data centre on a 500 acre greenfield site to store customer data and run many of its online services like iTunes. Between the two sites, the company is set to plough hundreds of millions of euro into the Irish economy in the coming years. So the prospect of a change of attitude towards Ireland would be deeply worrying for all Apple staff here, not to mention the government and public at large. Thankfully, as big a potential setback as today’s ruling might seem for the company, it seems unlikely to alter its outlook. Tim Cook the Apple CEO said so in his open letter to customers today. “We are committed to Ireland and we plan to continue investing there, growing and serving our customers with the same level of passion and commitment,” he wrote. The company is in deep here, and although tax may have always been or may have become a major consideration, it is unlikely a change of policy is going to result in it suddenly downsizing or pulling out. After all, this clampdown on the tax arrangements of big multinationals is an international phenomenon now, meaning it won’t be easy to find anywhere that is more welcoming from a tax perspective. Plus it has invested huge amounts not just in buildings and infrastructure, but also in people – and after all, as we learned today it is the intellectual property generated by those brains which makes vast amounts of money for Apple. And don’t forget the $231bn it has sitting on its balance sheet, which makes the €13bn it may have to pay Ireland look like relatively small change! WIDER TECH SCENCE So what then for the wider tech industry in Ireland and the FDI scene here more generally? There is little doubt that many bosses will have been spooked by today’s ruling, not solely because of the tax issue, but because of the uncertainty it has generated. The American Chamber of Commerce and the government say it is their understanding that no other US company operations in Ireland are having their tax affairs scrutinised by the European Commission in the same as Apple has had. That should come as a relief. And contacts I have had with a number of large high-profile tech multinationals today seemed to back that assertion up. But even if no others are likely to be hit with big back tax and interest bills as Apple has been, there is the general uncertainty. The mere thought that a supranational body like the EU can make seemingly retrospective rulings like it has in the case of tax, will be enough to spook many. And it all comes on the back of a perceived hostility towards US multinational tech companies from Europe in relation to wider competition issues (e.g. Google) and on data protection too (e.g. Facebook). There are also changes afoot at EU level around digital borders and net neutrality which many ICT companies may not be happy with. The IDA came out strongly today and said while the Apple ruling would be unhelpful for Ireland and Europe in general when it comes to attracting business, it remains optimistic about Ireland’s long-term prospects for winning FDI. What else could it say in the circumstances? Only time will tell if its optimism is well or misplaced.

The European Commission has aggressively sought to stamp out sweetheart tax deals that member countries strike with multinationals.PHOTO: BLOOMBERG PublishedAug 31, 2016, 5:00 am SGT More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Purchase Article Permalink: http://str.sg/4caT Copy US says EC has no right to claw back taxes from American firms but European enforcer holds firm NEW YORK • Europe's antitrust enforcer's order for Ireland to claw back billions of dollars from Apple over illegal tax breaks will ramp up transatlantic tensions over how much global companies should pay to countries where they do business, market watchers say. The decision by Ms Margrethe Vestager, the European Union Commissioner for Competition, is the culmination of a two-year investigation into whether Ireland gave preferential treatment to Apple, part of a broader crackdown on corporate tax avoidance. The clawback from Apple, which covers 10 years of back taxes of up to €13 billion (S$19.8 billion), is the largest of its kind since the European Commission (EC), the executive arm of the 28-member union, started going after member states that favoured selected companies. The European Commission has aggressively sought to stamp out sweetheart tax deals that countries strike with multinationals... But US officials have warned that the EC is overstepping its power, given that taxes are typically left to national governments to oversee and European officials should not retroactively issue penalties in past-tax rulings. The ruling adds to a strained relationship between the United States and the EU over who has the right to regulate tax payments by some of the world's largest companies. The EC has aggressively sought to stamp out sweetheart tax deals that countries strike with multinationals. Along with Apple, the campaign has also ensnared Starbucks in the Netherlands, Amazon in Luxembourg and Anheuser-Busch InBev in Belgium. But US officials have warned that the commission is overstepping its power, given that taxes are typically left to national governments to oversee and that European officials should not retroactively issue penalties in past-tax rulings. They also emphasised that such cases undermine efforts to overhaul global policies and create measures to curtail tax avoidance. "US companies are the grandmasters of tax avoidance," said Professor Edward Kleinbard of the Gould School of Law, University of Southern California, who is a former chief of staff to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. "Nevertheless, because of the nature of US politics," he said, the Apple case "will be framed by the US as Europe overreaching and discriminating against 'our team' ". Since early this year, Ms Vestager and US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, and their teams have met regularly to discuss Europe's state-aid tax investigations. Mr Lew visited Brussels in July to put forward the US perspective. Just last week, the Treasury Department released a report criticising any efforts to claw back taxes from US companies. The document repeatedly claimed that the EC did not have the right to undertake the tax clawbacks and that they could harm US efforts to collect taxes from domestic companies with vast international operations. "That outcome is deeply troubling as it would effectively constitute a transfer of revenue to the EU from the US government and its taxpayers," Mr Robert Stack, a senior Treasury official, said in the report. The EC denies these claims, saying it is relying on a history of using state-aid rules related to corporate tax issues. The Brussels-based agency also says it has the right to act when certain companies are provided with an unfair advantage - either through tax breaks or other incentives - and that Apple's operations are based in Ireland, therefore falling under its jurisdiction. "No rules have been changed - not one rule," Ms Vestager said at a news conference in Brussels yesterday. "This is a question of paying unpaid taxes." In the Apple case, the antitrust commission said the tech giant's deals with Ireland allowed the company to allocate profits from two Irish subsidiaries to a "head office", but it could not have generated such profits since it had few operations and little distribution or substantive business. By doing so, the commission said, Apple could effectively lower its tax rate on European profit to just 0.005 per cent in 2014. Ms Vestager said that amounted to roughly €50 for every €1 million in Apple's European profit. "The so-called head office had no employees, no premises, no real activities," Ms Vestager said. Apple defends its tax practices, saying it follows the law and pays all of its taxes. "The commission's case is not about how much Apple pays in taxes, it's about which government collects the money," the company said in a statement. "It will have a profound and harmful effect on investment and job creation in Europe." Ireland has broadly faced scrutiny for its tax strategies to attract large multinationals. Its corporate tax rate, at 12.5 per cent, is one of the lowest in the developed world. Other incentives and breaks allow companies to cut their bill even further.

The massive sum, 40 times bigger than the previous known demand by the European Commission to a company in such a case, could be reduced, the EU executive said in a statement, if other countries sought more tax themselves from the United States tech giant. The ruling was immediately slammed by Ireland and Apple - both announcing plans to appeal and taking aim at Brussels for what they described as regulatory overreach that could scare away international companies and stifle economic growth. Apple paid tax rates on European profits from sales of its iPhone and other devices and services of between just 0.005 per cent in 2014 and 1 per cent in 2003, the commission said. "Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years," said Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, whose crackdown on mainly US multinational companies has angered Washington. The US Treasury Department slammed the ruling, saying the decision threatened the bilateral "spirit of economic partnership". The European Commission in 2014 accused Ireland of dodging international tax rules by letting Apple shelter profits worth tens of billions of dollars from tax collectors in return for maintaining jobs. Apple and Ireland have rejected the accusation. "The decision leaves me with no choice but to seek Cabinet approval to appeal. This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation," said Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan yesterday. "It's bizarre and it's an exercise in politics by the Competition Commission."

The answer is a tax structure that the world's most valuable company made with the country on the edge of Europe. Apple created two subsidiary entities in Ireland — Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe — that effectively own most of the company's intellectual property. Those companies license that IP to other global Apple subsidiaries, and earn income from those licensing arrangements. So when an Apple iPhone is sold in China, for example, Apple's Chinese subsidiary must pay the Irish company to reflect the use of the Irish companies' intellectual property. Only Apple knows what percentage of that iPhone sale is subject to those intellectual property licensing fees, said Robert Willens, a tax consultant and Columbia Business School professor of taxation. But the result is that profit earned on the sale in China is shifted to the Irish subsidiary, said Willens. This is when Apple's agreement with the Irish government — which the European Commission is taking issue with — kicks in. Ordinarily, those profits would be taxed in Ireland at the relatively low rate of 12.5 percent but — thanks to an agreement between Apple and Ireland — the vast majority of profits in Ireland were attributed to a "head office" not located in any country and therefore not subject to taxes in Ireland or anywhere. "Apple and Ireland will say that the head office legitimately earned these profits — it's not just an accounting maneuver — that the head office is really doing things that justify attributing most of the profits to it," said Willens. The European Commission takes a different view, arguing that the head office exists only on paper and was created for the sole purpose of allowing Apple to pay very low taxes in Ireland in exchange for Apple's agreement to invest in the country and to employ a certain number of people there. The EC argues that the the tax arrangement did not reflect "economic reality." "This "head office" was not based in any country and did not have any employees or own premises. Its activities consisted solely of occasional board meetings," the European Commission said in a press release on Tuesday. The Commission wants Apple to pay €13 billion for the "undue tax benefits" the Irish government afforded the company. The European Commission used this example — based on figures from U.S. Senate public hearings — to illustrate how this worked in practice: In 2011, Apple Sales International recorded profits of €16 billion, but under the terms of the tax ruling only around €50 million were considered taxable in Ireland, leaving €15.95 billion of profits untaxed. Apple Sales International paid less than €10 million of corporate tax in Ireland in 2011 – an effective tax rate of about 0.05% on its overall annual profits. In subsequent years, Apple Sales International's profits continued to climb but, under the agreement, its taxable profits in Ireland did not — the effective tax rate decreased to 0.005% in 2014. Only the Irish branch of Apple Sales International had the capacity to generate income from Apple products, so sales profits of the subsidiary should have been recorded in Ireland, not the home office, the Commission argues. Apple makes an assumption, for accounting purposes, that it will repatriate all the taxes recorded in Ireland to the U.S. The company reports a very high tax rate of around 26 percent, but in reality pays around just 2 or 3 percent. This is something the company says it is required to do according to the accounting laws, and has been doing for years. "They have one of the largest gaps — if not the largest gap — of any company between what they record and what they actually pay," said Willens. "That's something they have been criticized for — recording high taxes they have no intention actually paying." Tax agreements between governments and companies are certainly not unique to Ireland and Apple. The EU seems to be taking a very broad view of "illegal state aid" with this tax assessment, which at 13 billion Euros is by far the largest tax assessment in the history of taxation, and leaving no room for negotiation, said Willens. The implications could be extremely wide-ranging, he said. "If the concept of illegal state aid is broadly interpreted to encompass any sort of tax incentive program that any company would have, then almost any multinational would be affected and almost any of them would have reason to be concerned," said Willens.

Earlier this year Apple was forced to take action over ransomware known as KeRanger that had been bundled into Transmission, a free and legitimate BitTorrent client for Macs. The incident was alarming since the Transmission files were signed with a legitimate Apple developer’s certificate, which meant Apple’s GateKeeper security feature wouldn’t have flagged the files as malware. Apple responded by revoking the certificate shortly after it was alerted to the threat. Now, cybercriminals have been caught using identical tactics to distribute another piece of malware identified by researchers at security firm ESET identify as Keydnap. According to ESET, Keydnap attempts to steal the content of the keychain in OS X where credentials are stored, which could enable the malware to establish a permanent backdoor. When ESET discovered the malware in July it wasn’t aware of the exact method it was used to infect Macs, however on Tuesday it discovered the backdoor malware was being distributed within Transmission v2.92. The security company wasn’t certain when the tainted Transmission file first appeared on the site, however the file’s signing dates suggest it’s only been available for a day or two, around August 28 and August 29. ESET has provided seven files or directories whose presence would indicate that a Mac has been compromised by the malware. Details of those files can be found here. Read more Security is more than User Education – it’s About Cultural Change “If any of them exists, it means the malicious Transmission application was executed and that Keydnap is most likely running,” ESET noted. Additionally, the attackers used a slightly different name for the malicious disk image than the legitimate one by adding a hyphen between the name of the app and the version number. “The malicious disk image was named Transmission2.92.dmg while the legitimate one is Transmission-2.92.dmg,” ESET continued. ESET said that the developers of Transmission have now removed the malicious file from the site. ESET has also notified Apple about the misused Apple developer certificate. Read more A ransomware infection is only the beginning of your malware problems: Cisco The code-signing key that was used to sign the malicious version of Transmission is a legitimate Apple certificate, however it was not Transmission’s certificate, which is listed as Digital Ignition LLC, but another developer’s certificate listed as Shaderkin Igor. Regardless, since the compromised certificate has been signed by Apple it will bypass Gatekeeper, ESET notes. CSO Australia has sought comment from Apple and will update the story if it receives one. ESET says the Keydnap malware has been updated since its discovery in July to include a standalone Tor client, which allows the malware to more efficiently connect to an encrypted address where it can connect to its command and control server. The security firm also found some similarities between KeRanger ransomware and Keydnap, which share “astonishingly” similar code that is responsible for dropping and running the malicious payload.

Getty By Megan Friedman Aug 30, 2016 On Tuesday, Apple got everyone talking with another of its typically cryptic launch event save-the-dates: "See you on the 7th," the invite read, with no other information other than the big reveal's location (which is in San Francisco, if you're there and free that morning, FYI). But based on years of tradition — and lots of tech-industry rumors — here's what you can anticipate from Apple's big announcement. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below And here it is! Apple iPhone (maybe Apple Watch?) event on Sept 7 at 10AM in SF. pic.twitter.com/wmio7USJ6m— Joanna Stern (@JoannaStern) August 29, 2016 Get ready for the iPhone 7. Apple is expected to unveil the newest iPhone and iPhone Plus, since that's what it usually does in September. According to 9 to 5 Mac, the new iPhone will be very similar to last year's phone, with tiny visual tweaks, faster processors, and no 16-gigabyte storage option. Bloomberg reports that it will have a dual rear camera, which will make photos brighter and zooming way better, and possibly a different type of home button. A new patent might hint to the new phone being waterproof, Quartz reports, which would be huge. But know that this upgrade will be inconvenient, at least at first. The new iPhone 7 comes with one huge rumored difference: The new model reportedly won't have a headphone jack, The Verge reports. Instead, you'll have to plug in your headphones into the same port you use to charge your iPhone, or use Bluetooth or AirPlay-enabled headphones. And that also means you'll either have to buy new iPhone-optimized headphones or buy an adapter to plug in old ones. Why the change? Fast Company reports that ditching the headphone jack will make the phone much thinner, and other reports say it will make room for other features, like more speakers. Also, in 2014, Apple bought Beats, so you can definitely blame Dr. Dre for this. (Or give him credit for the beginning of the end of tangled earbud cords.) There might be an upgraded Apple Watch too. The Verge notes that it's been two years since the Apple Watch went on sale, and the only new model came out six months later. The new model is rumored to be faster and possibly have a camera. According to CNET, there will likely be an upgraded GPS tracker and better fitness tracking in general. The only sure thing is a new operating system.

You'll finally be able to delete apps you don't use, like Stocks and Compass, you'll get transcribed voicemails so you don't have to actually listen to them, and you'll get more fun iMessages including giant emojis and doodles, according to the New York Daily News. You can watch it all live. Head to Apple's website Sept. 7 at 1 p.m. ET to watch their keynote live.

Get News Alerts Business © 2017 North Jersey Media Group August 30, 2016 Last updated: Tuesday, August 30, 2016, 4:36 PM Stocks are closing slightly lower; Hershey declines BLOOMBERG NEWS |  Wire Service NEW YORK - U.S. stocks erased their monthly gain amid thin trading volume as Apple slumped ahead of Friday's jobs report. The dollar rose, while oil fell. The S&P 500 index dropped from near a record high as the iPhone maker was ordered to pay a record 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) plus interest in a European Union tax crackdown. Meanwhile, emerging-market equities are headed for their best August since 2004. The dollar rose among most of its major peers, while Treasuries were little changed as traders assessed the path of interest rates in the world's largest economy. Crude dropped below $47 a barrel before data forecast to show that gasoline stockpiles declined while crude inventories increased in the world's largest oil consumer. American stocks have struggled to make further headway after reaching another record this month amid a spate of mixed economic data and as remarks from policy makers spurred increased speculation over the timing of the next rate move. All that Fedspeak put the spotlight on August's labor figures, which are projected to show the U.S. added 180,000 jobs, following a more robust gain in July. In the meantime, traders followed the latest developments with the EU's decision on Apple as the company has vowed to appeal. "This isn't a positive development with the EU, but you can see it as an initial volley in what's likely to be a continuing conversation," said Peter Jankovskis, who helps oversee $1.9 billion as co-chief investment officer of Lisle, Illinois-based OakBrook Investments. "We're just waiting on the Fed, looking ahead to the September meeting and parsing every new data point in that context." Consumer confidence increased to an almost one-year high in August as Americans became more optimistic about the labor market, according to a report from the New York-based Conference Board on Tuesday. Fed fund futures indicate a 34 percent chance that the Federal Open Market Committee will raise rates at the September meeting, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The probability dropped to zero in late June after the U.K. voted to leave the EU. Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer told Bloomberg Television Tuesday that rate increases will be data dependent without giving a specific timeline. He said that the U.S. is close to full employment even as the dollar has strengthened, and while there's some pessimism about the pace of expansion, "that problem is largely about productivity growth, something which is very hard to control by policy makers. It depends enormously on what private individuals are doing in their companies, and it's very slow at the moment." The S&P 500 dropped 0.4 percent at 3:05 p.m. in New York as trading volume was 11 percent below the 30-day average. The gauge is down 0.1 percent in August, after being on pace for the longest monthly advance since 2013. Apple slumped toward the lowest since Aug. 2. Appeals at EU courts can take years to finalize, meaning that the final amount the company may have to pay won't be known until then. Abercrombie & Fitch sank 21 percent after slow sales at flagship locations weighed on its latest results and outlook. Mondelez International rallied after saying it's walking away from takeover discussions with Hershey two months after its $23 billion bid was rejected by the chocolate maker. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world's second-largest producer of its namesake fertilizer, and Agrium surged after both companies confirmed they are in talks about a merger of equals as they battle falling prices and a decline in spending from farmers. European stocks climbed, extending monthly gains, amid increasing confidence in the global economy and as a weaker euro boosted exporters. The Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0.5 percent, with almost all of its industry groups rising. Commodity producers bucked the trend as metal prices fell and Citigroup analysts turned bearish on mining shares. The MSCI Emerging Market index rebounded from a three-week low. It's risen 2.6 percent since July 31 as of Monday's close, outperforming the MSCI World index of developed markets' 0.2 percent return. Developing countries that are lagging behind are mostly in the Middle East and Africa. Brazilian shares are set for their longest monthly advance since April. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot index, which tracks the currency against 10 peers, advanced 0.6 percent. The U.S. currency strengthened 0.4 percent to $1.1142 per euro, and 1.1 percent to 103.01 yen. Investors' sentiment on the dollar has oscillated in recent weeks on speculation about the Fed's tightening path after it raised rates in December for the first time since 2006. The greenback has trimmed its loss this year to 3.6 percent. "The dollar looks pretty bid across the board," said Kamal Sharma, a London-based foreign-exchange strategist at Bank of America, in an interview on Bloomberg Television. "Having said that, we've got enough event risk in September with the likes of the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and also not forgetting this week's nonfarm payrolls number." South Korea's won rose 0.5 percent versus the dollar, the best performance among 16 major currencies. Brazil's real declined amid speculation banks were seeking to weaken the currency before the monetary authority determines a key rate used in settling some financial contracts. That's overshadowed optimism that a new government will pull the country out of recession as President Dilma Rousseff's impeachment trial heads into its final stages. The yield on U.S. government debt due in a decade increased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.57 percent, after dropping seven basis points on Monday. Comments from central bankers during and in the run-up to the Kansas City Fed's annual symposium last week in Wyoming have split the market. Treasury bull Morgan Stanley predicts the Fed will forgo raising interest rates next month, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Holdings saw them as hawkish enough to raise the odds of action next month. The August payrolls data have missed the median of economists' estimates in each of the past five years, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led by Jay Barry in New York wrote in a report. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets next on Sept. 20-21 in Washington. The meeting will be followed by a press conference with Yellen and by a fresh set of economic projections by policy makers. Crude futures declined for a second day in New York, trading between $46-$48 over the past week. Inventories of gasoline probably slid by 1.25 million barrels last week and crude stockpiles may have climbed by 1.5 million barrels, according to a Bloomberg survey before an Energy Information Administration report on Wednesday. Market volatility will persist while demand and supply rebalance, according to executives gathering at an oil conference in Norway. The dollar advanced, curbing the appeal of commodities as an investment. "There is a whole slew of indications on the fundamental side that we should effectively be lower," Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodities research at BNP Paribas in London, said by telephone. "In the absence of any new supply disruption and in the absence of any progress in the supposed producer dialogue that will take place in Algiers, the market could easily retrace a few dollars." West Texas Intermediate for October delivery fell 1.3 percent to $46.35 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold futures for December delivery slid 0.8 percent to settle at $1,316.50 an ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in New York, heading for the first August decline since 2009. In the decade to 2015, bullion added 2.2 percent on average during August, the best month after January.

"In the absence of any new supply disruption and in the absence of any progress in the supposed producer dialogue that will take place in Algiers, the market could easily retrace a few dollars." West Texas Intermediate for October delivery fell 1.3 percent to $46.35 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold futures for December delivery slid 0.8 percent to settle at $1,316.50 an ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in New York, heading for the first August decline since 2009. In the decade to 2015, bullion added 2.2 percent on average during August, the best month after January.

The US Treasury said that such tax investigations were "unfair" and a senior Democrat senator called the move a "cheap money grab". A US senator said the penalty was a "cheap money grab". Photo: AFP White House spokesman Josh Earnest said if Apple paid the back taxes, it might offset that amount against tax due in the United States, which would be unfair for American taxpayers. The European Commission said Ireland had enabled Apple to pay substantially less than other businesses, in effect paying a corporate tax rate of no more than 1 percent. Apple and the government of Ireland plan to appeal against the record penalty. "Member states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies - this is illegal under EU state aid rules," said Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager. The standard rate of Irish corporate tax is 12.5 percent. The Commissions's investigation concluded that Apple had effectively paid 1 percent tax on its European profits in 2003 and about 0.005 percent in 2014. The investigation found Apple paid about 0.005 percent in 2014. Photo: AFP 'Grabbing revenue' The US Treasury said retroactive tax assessments by the Commission were "unfair, contrary to well-established legal principles, and call into question the tax rules of individual member states." Last week the Treasury warned that the European Commission was in danger of becoming a "supranational tax authority". Charles Schumer, one of the highest-ranking Democratic senators, said: "This is a cheap money grab by the European Commission, targeting US businesses and the US tax base." "By forcing their member states to retroactively impose taxes on US companies, the EU is unfairly undermining our ability to compete economically in Europe while grabbing tax revenues that should go toward investment here in the United States," he said. Apple said the decision would be harmful for jobs. "The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple's history in Europe, ignore Ireland's tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process," the company said. "The Commission's case is not about how much Apple pays in taxes, it's about which government collects the money. It will have a profound and harmful effect on investment and job creation in Europe. "Apple follows the law and pays all of the taxes we owe wherever we operate. We will appeal and we are confident the decision will be overturned." The Irish government held a similar view, with finance minister Michael Noonan saying: "The decision leaves me with no choice but to seek cabinet approval to appeal. This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation." However, the record tax bill should not be a problem for Apple, which made a net profit of $US53 billion in the 2015 financial year. Apple is not the only company that has been targeted for securing favourable tax deals in the European Union. Last year, the commission told the Netherlands to recover as much as €30m from Starbucks, while Luxembourg was ordered to claw back a similar amount from Fiat.

The setback came just before the much-awaited launch of iPhone 7. In the latest in a series of rulings that have angered Washington, Brussels said the world’s most valuable company avoided tax bills on virtually all its profits in the bloc under its arrangements with Ireland. Apple and the Irish government immediately said they would appeal against the European Commission ruling while the US said the development could undermine its economic partnership with the EU. Ireland has been seeking to attract multinationals by offering extremely favourable tax conditions, known as sweetheart deals, but EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Apple’s broke EU laws on state aid. “This decision sends a clear message. Member states cannot give unfair tax benefits to selected companies, no matter whether they are European or foreign, large or small,” Vestager said. “This is not a penalty, this is unpaid taxes to be paid,” Vestager added. The tax repayment order — by far the largest in EU’s history — follows a three-year inquiry into whether Ireland’s tax breaks for Silicon Valley titan Apple were against the law. Apple has had a base at the southern Irish city of Cork since 1980 and employs 5,000 people in Ireland, through which it routes its international sales, avoiding billions in corporation taxes. But Vestager — who has launched a series of cases against US firms — said that Apple’s “so-called head office in Ireland only existed on paper. It had no employees, no premises and no real activities.” Apple as a result paid an effective corporate tax rate of 0.005 per cent on its European profits in 2014 — equivalent to 50 Euros for every million, Vestager added. Tensions have been growing between Washington and Brussels over a series of anti-trust investigations targeting companies such as Apple, Amazon, Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler. Apple said “We will appeal and we are confident the decision will be overturned.” “It will have a profound and harmful effect on investment and job creation in Europe,” the company added.

Chief executive Tim Cook accused competition chiefs in Brussels of targeting his global brand with laws that did not exist and simultaneously putting every business on the continent at risk. The tech guru launched the broadside after Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s landmark ruling into the iPad and iPhone maker’s tax affairs found it paid just 1% tax on its European profits in 2003 and 0.005% in 2014. Two years ago that worked out at €50 on every million in profit, she said. Mr Cook dismissed the three-year investigation and went direct to his customer base with a message on apple.com and a vow to fight the order in what will likely be years of courtroom battles. He also claimed: “We have become the largest taxpayer in Ireland, the largest taxpayer in the United States, and the largest taxpayer in the world. “In Ireland and in every country where we operate, Apple follows the law and we pay all the taxes we owe.” Ireland’s Department of Finance is expected to lead the legal challenge to the Commissioner’s record findings and tax bill. Finance Minister Michael Noonan’s response was a charm offensive on satellite channels devoted to money markets and a warning that Ireland does not do “deals” with taxpayers. “Our tax system is founded on the strict application of the law … without exception,” he said. Mr Noonan added that it was necessary to fight the verdict in the courts “to defend the integrity of our tax system, to provide tax certainty to business, and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation”. The unprecedented ruling from Brussels found officials in Dublin gave assurances to Apple in 1991 and 2007 that it was abiding by law in the manner it structured its affairs, recorded profits and made payments to its California offices. The Commissioner said the treatment of Apple amounted to illegal state aid. The inquiry found that Ireland’s treatment of Apple allowed the global brand to avoid taxation on almost all profits generated by sales in the entire European single market. It said this was because Apple recorded all its sales in Ireland rather than in the countries where the products were sold. The company has had a base in Ireland since 1980 and now employs 6,000 people. Mr Cook said he was committed to the presence but warned that the “most profound and harmful effect” of the watchdog’s ruling will be on jobs and investment in Europe. #Ireland gave illegal tax benefits to #Apple worth up to €13 billion: https://t.co/FppCWW52z4 pic.twitter.com/jkFqh35CO1 — European Commission (@EU_Commission) August 30, 2016 The case is one of the most high-profile in the fight to redraw boundaries on aggressive tax avoidance, an issue which has put the EU at odds with the US government – an irony given that it was a Senate committee in Washington that first heard Apple was paying as little as 2% tax on its profits. Ms Vestager found the two tax rulings issued by Ireland on the use of two Irish incorporated companies of the Apple group – Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe – did not reflect economic reality. The commissioner said almost all sales profits recorded by them were internally attributed to a “head office” which only existed on paper and could not have generated such profits. Her inquiry found the profits were not subject to tax anywhere. Ms Vestager dismissed threatened court challenges from Apple and the Irish Government, saying she had a “very concrete case”. Elsewhere, Apple dismissed suggestions that it will have to pay €6 bn interest on top of the €13 bn tax bill, while it suggested the legal challenge to the case will take several years.

This is illegal under EU state aid rules because it allowed Apple to pay substantially less tax than other businesses. Ireland must now recover the illegal aid,” a Commission statement said. EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Apple’s “selective treatment” in Ireland meant it paid an effective tax rate of just one percent on its European profits in 2003, which then fell to a bare 0.005 percent by 2014. Apple and the Irish government immediately said they would appeal against the European Commission ruling, while the US Treasury said it could undermine its economic partnership with the EU. Reacting to the order, Apple chief Tim Cook warned the ruling threatened jobs and investment in Europe. “Apple is now in the unusual position of being asked to pay taxes to a government that says they are not due,” he said. Ireland too is an unusual situation of refusing to accept cash, which is equivalent to around five per cent of its gross domestic product as it. This ruling could affect Ireland’s policy of attracting multinational companies by offering extremely favourable tax conditions, known as sweetheart deals.

This is where you scream and curse at Apple. Done? Okay, now let's move on, talk about the pros, and consider the alternatives, including Lightning headphones. Yes. Those are a thing. They're like regular headphones - only they plug into a Lightning port instead of a 3.5mm socket. Lightning headphones are capable of receiving lossless stereo 48kHz digital audio output from Apple devices and sending mono 48kHz digital audio input. They can also draw power from an Apple device (even if the device is asleep). Apple iPhone 7 review Apple iPhone 7 Plus review Apple's Lightning port can also support headphones with integrated digital-to-analogue converters and amplifiers, so audio travelling through the Lightning port will pass into the headphones digitally, thus avoiding typical analogue signal interferences you get with other headphones. So don't panic about the change, embrace it. Browse the gallery of choices we've put together, because we've picked out a few Lightning headphones out now or coming soon - including Apple's new Lightning EarPods. They're basically an updated version of the existing EarPods - only they connect to the iPhone via the Lightning port.  The gallery includes both over-ear headphones and in-ear earbuds, as well as a variety of price points, though keep in mind many of these devices are new, top-rated (based on online reviews), and starting out at the top end in terms of cost.

Apple and tax 31 August 2016 Interesting things have happened in Europe. The EU has decided, in its infinite wisdom, that Apple has been dodging taxes in Ireland. Nothing there we didn't already know eh? However (and this is where it gets bizarre), the EU has decided that Apple must pay 13 billion (yes, that's BILLION) Euros in tax to Ireland to address the shortfall. But (and this is where it gets even weirder), both Apple and the Irish Government say that Apple has paid all its due tax and owes nothing. Wow, when was the last time you heard a government saying "no thanks" to the collection of tax? I'm in two minds over this situation (and so am I -- what the?). On the one hand, it's pretty obvious to everyone (except perhaps a few politicians) that Apple is dodging huge amounts of tax by way of a careful "use" of various mechanisms that allow profit-shifting out of high-tax countries into low-tax ones. From the reports I've read, it seems as if Apple moves its profits from relatively high tax countries like New Zealand, the USA, Australia, etc to Ireland. It then shifts them from Ireland to some tax haven on a sunny island somewhere. Like most hard-working tax-payers who do not have the luxury of structuring our affairs in this way, I have to say I'm a little pissed off that so many governments around the world (including our own) have simply classified the tax-dodging of huge multinationals as "too hard" and focused instead on squeezing every last cent out of their own workers. On the other hand, I am equally appalled that the EU would dare to try and dictate tax policy to Ireland. Tax has always been a sovereign issue, something to be decided and controlled by each nation, not by some external diktat. So who do you side with? Apple and Ireland or the EU? Well I side with nobody. All parties are nasty bits of work. Apple exploits workers in China (there are plenty of independent reports to verify this), dodges taxes by using schemes that, through their inaction, the governments of most Western nations are complicit with, and the EU is just a bunch of overgrown bullying bureaucrats. A pox on all their houses I say! Let's face it, Apple hasn't amassed a massive $200 BILLION in cash reserves by being a good corporate citizen, of that there can be little doubt. Now, if we ask ourselves why our politicians aren't jumping down Apple's throat and demanding they pay their FAIR share of tax. Let's think about this for a moment... Apple has LOTS of money. Politicians LOVE money. Apple gets to pay far less tax than hard-working Kiwis or the companies they own. You might join the dots and come up with a worrying conclusion but I couldn't possibly comment. Please visit the sponsor! Have your say in the Aardvark Forums.

It's said to have achieved its goal by setting up virtual offices with no employees, offices, or real activity and enacting provisions of Irish law no longer in use.   Meanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook says his company has done no wrong and he doesn't expect the decision to stick.   "The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple's history in Europe, ignore Ireland's tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process. The opinion issued on August 30th alleges that Ireland gave Apple a special deal on our taxes. This claim has no basis in fact or in law. We never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals. We now find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we don't owe them any more than we've already paid."   "The Commission's move is unprecedented and it has serious, wide-reaching implications. It is effectively proposing to replace Irish tax laws with a view of what the Commission thinks the law should have been. This would strike a devastating blow to the sovereignty of EU member states over their own tax matters, and to the principle of certainty of law in Europe. Ireland has said they plan to appeal the Commission's ruling and Apple will do the same. We are confident that the Commission's order will be reversed."

The S&P 500 fell for the fourth time in five sessions, but was still within 1 percent of its record closing high set earlier this month. Cyclical sectors, which are expected to perform better in an expanding economy, have taken the lead in the past few weeks as economic data paints a rosier picture of the U.S. economy. U.S. consumer confidence rose to an 11-month high in August, with households more upbeat about the labor market. Payrolls data on Friday could strengthen the case for higher U.S. interest rates, as has been hinted over the past week by Federal Reserve officials. Bets on a bottoming out of bond yields have given support to bank stocks of late. The S&P 500 financial sector is up 1.8 percent so far this week, compared with a 0.3 percent advance for the S&P. "The economy is doing well, the labor market is still doing well, there's reasons to think (interest) rates have bottomed and that is good for financials," said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer, Multi-Asset Strategies and Solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York. S&P 500 financials closed at their highest level since early December, right before the Fed raised interest rates for the first time in nearly 10 years. Cyclical sectors should continue to lead the stock market despite Tuesday's declines in all sectors outside financials, Zemsky said. "A day is not a way to look at the trend," he said. But Apple weighed on major indexes after the European Commision ordered the iPhone maker to pay Ireland up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in unpaid taxes, as it ruled the firm had received illegal state aid. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 48.69 points, or 0.26 percent, to 18,454.3, the S&P 500 lost 4.26 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,176.12 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 9.34 points, or 0.18 percent, to 5,222.99. Hershey dropped 11.2 percent to $99.19 after Mondelez abandoned its pursuit to buy the chocolate maker on Monday. Mondelez rose 3.7 percent. United Continental Holdings rallied 8.6 percent to close at $50.99 after it hired the No. 2 executive at rival American Airlines as United's board and chief executive officer seek to shape a new strategy and boost the airline's stock price. American shares rose 2.4 percent to $37.05. Abercrombie & Fitch plunged 20.3 percent to $18.29 after the teen apparel retailer posted its 14th straight quarter of declining sales and said it no longer expects comparable sales to improve this year. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.04-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.13-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 26 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 121 new highs and 20 new lows. About 5.66 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 5.98 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. The 20-day average dipped below 6 billion shares for the first time since June 2015.

The White House and the Treasury Department, which enforces federal tax policy, warned that U.S.-EU economic relations could be affected by the European Commission's ruling that Apple had received illegal state aid under its agreement with Ireland. Business groups protested. The Business Roundtable, which represents U.S. chief executives, called the decision "an act of aggression" against a law-abiding U.S. company and a sovereign government. Members of both parties in Congress pointed to the stunning decision as evidence that the U.S. tax code should be rewritten to give American companies an incentive to bring home some $2.1 trillion in U.S. corporate profits held abroad. But there was no sign that lawmakers were any closer to bridging the substantial divides that have prevented agreement up to now. "Above all, this is yet another reason why we need to fix our tax code," House Speaker Paul Ryan, the highest-ranking elected Republican, said in a statement. "Today's decision should be a spur to action." Apple was found to be holding over $181 billion offshore, more than any U.S. company, in a study published last year by two left-leaning nonprofit groups: Citizens for Tax Justice and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group Education Fund. "This is yet another example of why we need to reform the international tax system to ensure these revenues come home," said Senator Charles Schumer, the chamber's No. 3 Democrat. Even the European Commission voiced indirect criticism of the U.S. tax code, suggesting that Washington could require Apple's Irish operations to pay larger amounts of money to the U.S. parent to finance research and development, which would increase Apple's U.S. tax bill. Former Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat whose investigation of U.S. corporate tax avoidance was cited by European regulators, blamed the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for failing to challenge Apple's overseas arrangements. Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have discussed plans to encourage the repatriation of U.S. profits abroad. But House Republicans hope to move broader legislation next year that would cut the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent and adopt a "territorial" system that would exempt the overseas earnings of U.S. companies from U.S. taxation. Democrats have dismissed that as a massive tax giveaway. Other critics in Washington warned that Tuesday's European Commission move would encroach on U.S. government jurisdiction and ultimately add to the federal deficit. "We are concerned about a unilateral approach ... that threaten(s) to undermine progress that we have made collaboratively with the Europeans to make the international taxation system fair," White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. U.S. Representative Kevin Brady, Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, called the decision "a predatory and naked tax grab". Apple and Ireland said they would appeal the EU decision. But some analysts said the ruling, if upheld, could change the calculus that has kept U.S. corporate money overseas if it means higher taxes in low-tax European countries like Ireland. "The scheme of U.S. multinationals parking money offshore indefinitely, taxed at zero, may be coming to an end," said Steven Rosenthal of the Tax Policy Center research group. Online retailer Amazon.com Inc and fast-food company McDonald's Corp already face probes over taxes in Luxembourg, while coffee chain Starbucks Corp has been ordered to pay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) to the Dutch government.

Here we round up all the latest about the new device.

See related  Apple September 2016 Special Event live blog: Apple Watch 2, iPhone 7 release date and prices iPhone 7 vs iPhone SE iPhone 7: latest news 09/11/2016: Apple's new iPhone 7 came with a new choice of colour, 'Jet Black', which gives the smartphone a glossy appearance, thanks to a nine-step process that includes anodisation and polish. This new colour was extremely popular among iPhone 7 customers, despite reports that it was extremely delicate and could be damaged fairly easily. According to a report written by the Japanese publication Mac Otakara, Apple could be considering whether to add a new 'Jet White' colour to those available for iPhone 7 smart phones. Demand for Apple's new device is particularly high, with many customers still waiting to receive their iPhone 7, particularly in the new Jet Black colouring, and in its Plus version. On October 25, during a conference call with analysts, Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri said: "Worldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 Plus." Apple's new flagship smartphone was launched on 16 September and comes with new features such as dual camera and wireless headphones connected to the phone through a new system called lightening. Other colours for the iPhone 7 include silver, normal black, gold and rose gold matte. 27/10/2016: Several websites are offering iPhone users in China the possibility to purchase 'iPhone makeover kits', false cameras and dust plugs that hide the headphone jack, to make an iPhone 6 or 6s look like the new iPhone 7. Several iPhone users are buying these items and re-vamping their old Apple devices instead of buying the new flagship model. Should this trend spread, it could be detrimental for Apple, which is hoping the new device will help boost its sales. This mirrors the popular opinion among Chinese Apple users that iPhone 7 is not innovative enough to prompt them to buy it. A Beijing-based sales worker told Tech 2 he was getting a Shenzhen firm to replace his iPhone 6's case, saying: "I don't have the money to upgrade, and the (iPhone) 7 is just so-so." On Tuesday, Apple's last quarterly statement showed a decline in iPhone sales globally, with Greater China's revenue down by 30% to $8.79 billion. Counterpoint analyst Neil Shah said: "The iPhone 7 series should help Apple regain lost (China) market share as demand is tracking better than for the iPhone 6s series. Apple needs to offer something cutting-edge to appeal to maturing Chinese smartphone users who are warming to local brands." 10/10/2016: Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak said he now thinks the new Lightning audio port on iPhone 7 was a good idea, in an interview with TechRadar. In August, Wozniak told The Australian Financial Review that he believed dropping the headphone jack would "tick off a lot of people". However, he has since changed his mind, and he said: "Not that many people used it, I never used it. For those who do use it, you can buy a little adaptor dongle." Wozniak also had a change of heart in regards to the Apple Watch. "I've come to like my Apple Watch more... I use it enough in my life for things...I enjoy using it and having it. And when I don't use it, I don't even know it's there," he told TechRadar. In March, the Apple co-founder had expressed his scepticism about the wearable in a post on Reddit. The post read: "I worry a little bit about- I mean I love my Apple Watch, but - it's taken us into a jewelry market where you're going to buy a watch between $500 or $1100 based on how important you think you are as a person. "The only difference is the band in all those watches. Twenty watches from $500 to $1100. The band's the only difference? Well this isn't the company that Apple was originally, or the company that really changed the world a lot." Wozniak engineered Apple 1, the first home computer with keyboard and TV screen as a display. While Steve Jobs took care of the creative aspect of Apple products, Wozniak was the mind behind the construction of Apple's first computers and devices. 30/09/2016: An iPhone 7 has reportedly exploded during delivery, prompting fears that Apple's flagship may be suffering similar battery problems to the ill-fated Samsung Galaxy Note 7. One customer received their device only to discover that it appeared to have caught fire and exploded while en route, according to colleague and Reddit user 'kroopthesnoop'. They posted photos of their coworker's destroyed iPhone, noting that they're "not certain" what happened but adding, "something happened between the factory and delivery". The pictures show that the iPhone was discoloured, partially melted and with the screen coming away from the chassis. The unit bears a strong resemblance to the Note 7 models which overheated and exploded, an incident which prompted Samsung to initiate a full recall of the device. However, unlike the Note 7, this fault does not appear to be affecting numerous devices. Apple did not respond when asked if multiple customers had reported similar issues. 26/09/2016: Research firm GfK has revealed iPhone 7 sales were lower than expected, saying sales of both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were down 25 per cent year-on-year. If GfK's numbers are right, that means Apple shifted less than 10m iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets between September 16th and 19th. However, unlike previous years, Apple didn't release its own sales figures for the iPhone 7 on its launch weekend, explaining in its statement it was due to distribution complications rather than negative shipment results. "In years past, we've announced how many new iPhones had been sold as of the first weekend following launch. But as we have expanded our distribution through carriers and resellers to hundreds of thousands of locations around the world, we are now at a point where we know before taking the first customer pre-order that we will sell out of iPhone 7. These initial sales will be governed by supply not demand, we have decided that it is no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers. Therefore we won't be releasing a first-weekend number any longer. We are reiterating the financial guidance for the September quarter that we provided on July 26." However, Apple said it was expecting the same amount of interest from consumers in the launch weekend because it was allowing preorders a week before it was available from stores. Last year, Apple sold 13m iPhone 6S and 6S Plus devices over the launch weekend compared to 10m iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices in 2014. 14/09/2016: The iPhone 7 has already broken pre-order records, according to US mobile networks. Wireless carrier T-Mobile announced that once presales opened on 9 September, the iPhone 7 set a single-day sales record, more than any other smartphone ever sold by the company. Sprint also announced that iPhone 7 and 7 Plus preorders increased by around 375% over the first three days of availability, when compared with last year’s 6s and 6s Plus. This demand was mirrored in the UIK, where the iPhone 7 launch spurred the biggest one-day spike in UK traffic to Apple’s website that the site had ever seen. According to digital market intelligence firm SimilarWeb, the site received a 235% boost in visits on the iPhone 7’s launch day. 07/09/2016 update: The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have both launched today at Apple's special event in San Francisco. They have a new home button with force touch and taptic feedback, an A-10 chip, which makes them both faster and more battery efficient than their predecessors, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, and have a brighter, higher-resolution screen. The worst-kept secret in tech - that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will have no 3.5mm headphone jack - was also confirmed. As expected, the devices will use the lightning connector as an audio output and will ship with a pair of lightning EarPods. The company is also launching a set of wireless "AirPods" (EarPods with no physical connector) in October, but they will cost £159. Another widely rumoured feature – a dual lens rear camera – also turned out to be true. However, it is only available on the iPhone 7 Plus, not the iPhone 7. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus are available in five colours - Rose Gold, Gold, Silver, (shiny) Jet Black and (matte) Black. Both smartphones are available to pre-order from 9 September and ship on 16 September when they also hit shelves in retail stores. iOS 10, which the devices will run on, is available to download from 13 September. 07/09/2016: It's iPhone 7 launch day! The iPhone 7 and its big brother, the iPhone 7 Plus, are set to be announced today at a special launch event in San Francisco, amidst much fanfare. Rumours so far indicate the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will look identical to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, with a handful of new features - some controversial, others a little more mainstream. Last night, a leak from Apple's own store showed the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus listed as compatible devices for some accessories, including the company's new EarPods. Recent rumours suggest Apple will scrap the 3.5mm headphone port and instead insist people use Bluetooth to connect or be forced to buy an adaptor so they fit into the device's Lightning port. It also may introduce a pressure-sensitive home button that won't have moving parts like the iPhone, which will also help it be more waterproof too. The camera may be upgraded too, with storage options ranging from 32GB to 256GB. Additionally, while the iPhone doesn't normally go on sale the same day it's announced, IT Pro sources have indicated it is likely to be in UK shops from 19 September. You can find out how to watch the event, plus follow our live blog from 5.30pm UK time, at our dedicated page. Continue reading to find out the iPhone 7's release date and price iPhone 7 release date The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus launched at Apple's Special Event on 7 September, and both go on sale in the UK on 16 September. Pre-orders are available from 9 September. iPhone 7 UK price The iPhone 7 will cost upwards of £599, and the 7 Plus upwards of £719. The prices are higher than the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus were when they launched (£539 and £619 respectively), but Apple has doubled the phones' storage capacities from 16GB, 64GB, and 128GB to 32GB, 128GB and 256GB. However, like-for-like prices have jumped: the iPhone 6 128GB model was priced at £699 at launch, and the iPhone 7 128GB model price is the same. But while the 6s Plus launched at £789, the iPhone 7 Plus 128GB model is £30 more expensive, at £819. Apple hasn't given a reason, but it is thought Brexit may have pushed the price up, after the UK's decision to leave the EU caused sterling to plummet in value. OnePlus raised its phone price from £309 to £329 in response to Brexit. Apple has also scrapped the 16GB models of the 6s and 6s Plus, and added a 256GB option for the 7 and 7 Plus. Check out our pricing table below for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus UK prices. iPhone 7 32GB £599 iPhone 7 128GB £699 iPhone 7 256GB £799 iPhone 7 Plus 32GB £719 iPhone 7 Plus 128GB £819 iPhone 7 Plus 256GB £919 iPhone 7 best deals If you’re happy to sign up to a 24-month contract for your iPhone, networks are furiously competing with each other to offer the best deals available, with inclusive minutes and texts, a variety of different data options and extra perks such as free music subscriptions or inclusive roaming abroad. Three Although Three’s tariffs are by no way the cheapest per month, they do offer more data, minutes and unlimited texts. For example, opt for a mammoth 4GB data for the 32GB iPhone 7 and you’ll pay just £38 a month, although there is a £149 upfront cost. For the 128GB version, this increases to £43 a month, with the same £149 upfront, while the 256GB version will only cost an extra £5 a month - for all that extra storage! As is usually the case, the best prices are for two-year contracts, so although long-term, they’re the most manageable on a monthly basis. O2 If you’d rather pay a lot less upfront, but are happy paying a bigger monthly fee, O2’s tariffs could be just the biscuit. Starting at just £39.99 upfront for the 32GB iPhone 7, this network’s cheapest tariff is £60 a month. But that will give you an absolutely ridiculous 30GB a month data, meaning you can probably scrap your broadband too. For a more sensible, everyday option, you can pay the slightly higher fee of £59.99 upfront and then £46.50 a month if you think you’ll only use 3GB data a month That same tariff for the 128GB version will add an extra fiver onto the monthly cost, while upping the capacity to 256GB will set you back £56.50 a month, with the handset costing a tenner cheaper at £49.99 upfront. EE EE’s forte is 4G network coverage and as you’d expect, all of its iPhone 7 plans come with 4G support. Like O2, EE is focussing on cutting the upfront cost of the iPhone 7 in order to attract those who’d rather pay for the majority of their device over a two-year period. For example, £55.99 a month will get you the 32GB iPhone 7, 7GB data, unlimited calls and texts, plus you’ll only need to pay £9.99 upfront. Upgrade to the 128GB iPhone 7 and you’ll pay £49.99 upfront, with monthly repayments of £55.99. OK, maybe not as attractive as the smaller capacity iPhone 7, but not a bad proposition if you’re after 5GB data. The best deal for the 256GB iPhone 7 will increase that upfront payment to £99.99 a month, but it’ll give you 10GB data for £60.99 a month. Vodafone Vodafone offers the most interesting added extras for anyone who likes a freebie. With the company’s Red bundles, you can opt to add on a NOW TV Entertainment Pass, Spotify Premium or Sky Sports Mobile TV package when you sign up, but beware - these add-ons come with a cost because the contract prices are some of the highest out there. The 32GB version is available from £32 a month, with a hefty £250 fee upfront, while the 128GB version ups this to £37 a month with £300 upfront. If you want to get your hands on the 256GB version, that’ll cost £42 a month with £320 when you sign up. These lowest tariffs will get you a tiny 500MB data, 500 minutes to UK phones and unlimited texts, which probably won’t even satisfy the average device user. GiffGaff If you want to buy the iPhone 7 upfront from Apple whether by paying the full £599-£799 or its pay monthly plan, GiffGaff offers the best rolling, SIM-only contracts to save you money over the lifetime of the device. The no-frills network is charging £20 a month for its tariff, which, if you add that onto the cost of the handset, turns out you’re paying between £1,079 and £1,179 over a 12-month period. iPhone 7 colours The iPhone 7 is available in five colours -  Jet Black, regular black, silver, gold and rose gold. The exclusive Jet black colour, which is a brand new colour for Apple, is only available in 128GB and 256GB iterations, presumably designed to exude luxury. It's a high-gloss finish produced using a nine-step anodisation and polishing process and although its surface is equally as hard as other anodised Apple products, the company warns its high shine might show up scratches more than the other colourways. It therefore suggests you hide the shiny surface away by slipping it into a case to protect the fragility surface - a bit pointless if you want to show off you have the brand new colour. In terms of pricing for the different coloured editions, they all enter the market at the same price, although it's possible retailers will reduce some of the more unpopular colours as the iPhone 8’s appearance approaches in order to get rid of stock. iPhone 7 features Jump to: iPhone 7 operating system iPhone 7 camera and photos iPhone 7 screen iPhone 7 Siri iPhone 7 operating system The iPhone 7 family will run on iOS 10, which is available for download from 13 September on other iOS devices. The advantage of iOS 10 is it will automatically protect against a recently discovered iPhone threat, dubbed Trident. Trident is particularly dangerous for companies with iPhone deployments, because once installed, it syphons off messages - encrypted or not - to the hacker who launched the attack. That means all data on a business device is at risk of being stolen. While Apple quickly addressed the vulnerability with a patch in iOS 9.3.5, not everyone will have downloaded it, but iOS 10 will include the patch too. iPhone 7 camera and photos The camera has become something of a flagship feature for Apple's smartphones and the iPhone 7 is no exception. The iPhone 7 sports a 12-megapixel camera, the same as the iPhone 6s, and offers three times longer exposure than its predecessor. It also lets 50% more light onto the sensor, which is 60% faster than the 6s's, too. Apple's image signal processor, which is the brains of the camera, uses machine learning to identify people and objects in photos and to set white balance. The processor is also capable of recognising a greater variety of colours, as well. While the iPhone 7's camera is a clear improvement on the last, it's the iPhone 7s camera that really catches the eye. For a start, it has two cameras - a wide-angle lens and a telephoto lens, allowing it to zoom up to 10x on a shot without compromising image quality. iPhone 7 display Compared to the iPhone 6s's screen, the iPhone 7 is 25% brighter, utilising a feature called Wide Color for the first time. Wide Color is Apple's term for DCI-P3, a range of colours that became a standard for digital movie projection in the US film industry. While both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have Wide Color, they lack True Tone (which the 9.7in iPad Pro does have). One of the biggest changes on the iPhone 6s was the 3D Touch screen - an advancement on the Force Touch technology seen on the Apple Watch and most recent MacBook. You'll be glad to know that 3D Touch has now made it to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.  3D Touch allows sensors below the screen to detect whether the user has applied a tap, a press, or a deep press. It is this deep press recognition that is used for Live Photos, as well as 'Peeks' which let you see previews of emails, websites and photos, and 'Pops', which let you open the full email, site or photo simply by pressing down harder. Siri Siri has been part of iPhone since 2010, but its appearance in iOS 10 brings a whole heap of updates to the six-year-old voice assistant, so it's cleverer than ever before. It already sits at the heart not just of iPhone, but also iPads, Apple TV and the company's burgeoning smart home ecosystem. But with iOS 10, Siri becomes a bigger part of many of your go-to apps. On stage, Craig Federighi showed how wider Siri support works: You can instruct it to "Send a WeChat toNancy saying I'll be five minutes late", for instance. By opening up Siri to third-party developers, Apple has made it more useful - it'll soon be present in WhatsApp, Uber, Lyft, Slack, Map My Run, Pinterest and more.

Yes 89% No 11% Total votes: 196 A decline in Apple shares after the EU demanded the company pay a record amount in what it ruled to be back taxes weighed on Wall Street. Shares of Apple slid 0.9% after the European Commission ruled that Ireland granted the company undue tax benefits of up to €13 billion ($US14.5 billion) – "illegal aid" under EU rules that the commission says Ireland now must recover from Apple. However, the move drew criticism from the US Treasury Department and lawmakers. "The European Commission's decision is a predatory and naked tax grab," US Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement, Reuters reported. Apple and the Irish government say they will appeal the decision. At the Wall Street close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 48.69 points, or 0.3%, to 18,454.30, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.2% to 5222.99. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index retreated 0.2% to 2176.12. Slides in shares of Boeing and those of Nike, down 1.5% and 1.1% respectively, also led the Dow lower. Financial stocks bucked the trend, with shares of JPMorgan Chase up 0.7% and those of Goldman Sachs trading 0.6% stronger. In the latest US economic data, a Conference Board report showed its consumer confidence index rose 4.4 points to 101.1 in August, the highest reading since September 2015. "This will likely be interpreted as more evidence that the U.S. economic recovery is back on track following the missteps earlier this year," Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York, told Reuters. Potash companies in merger talks Potential deal news bolstered the mood. Shares of Canada's Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan and Agrium jumped after the fertiliser producers said they are in talks about a potential merger of equals. "No decision has been made as to whether to proceed with such a combination, no agreement has been reached, and there can be no assurance that any transaction will result from these discussions," the companies said in their separate releases, without offering further details. Even so, people familiar with the matter said a combination could be announced as soon as next week, according to Bloomberg, which first reported that the rivals were in talks about a merger. Agrium shares jumped, trading 6.4% higher in Toronto, while those of Potash Corp also rallied, trading 12.4% stronger. On Wall Street, Hershey shares fell 11% a day after Mondelez International ended its pursuit of the chocolatier. Gap shares dropped 4.3%, and Urban Outfitters declined 2.5%. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a 0.5% advance from the previous close. France's CAC 40 index rose 0.8% and Germany's DAX index climbed 1.1%. The UK's FTSE 100 Index slid 0.3%. (BusinessDesk) Click the hamburger symbol top right of our homepage to access the Rich List 2016 and other sections. Got a question about this story?

In the latest in a series of rulings that has angered Washington, Brussels said the world’s most valuable company avoided tax bills on virtually all its profits in the bloc under its arrangements with Dublin. Apple and the Irish government immediately said they would appeal against the European Commission ruling, while the US Treasury said it could undermine its economic partnership with the EU. Ireland has been seeking to attract multinationals by offering extremely favourable tax conditions, known as sweetheart deals, but EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Apple broke EU laws on state aid. “This decision sends a clear message. Member states cannot give unfair tax benefits to selected companies, no matter if European or foreign, large or small,” the competition commissioner said. “This is not a penalty, this is unpaid taxes to be paid,” he added. The tax repayment order — by far the largest in EU history — follows a three-year inquiry into whether Dublin’s tax breaks for Silicon Valley titan Apple were against the law. Apple has had a base at the southern city of Cork since 1980 and employs 5,000 people in Ireland, through which it routes its international sales, avoiding billions in corporation taxes. But Vestager — who has launched a series of cases against US firms — said that Apple’s “so-called head office in Ireland only existed on paper. It had no employees, no premises and no real activities”. Apple, as a result, paid an effective corporate tax rate of 0.005% on its European profits in 2014 — equivalent to 50 euros for every million, Vestager added. Tensions have been growing between Washington and Brussels over a series of anti-trust investigations targeting companies such as Apple, Amazon, Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler. Apple said “we will appeal and we are confident that the decision will be overturned”. “It will have a profound and harmful effect on investment and job creation in Europe,” the company added. Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said the decision “leaves me with no choice but to seek cabinet approval to appeal (against) the decision before the European Courts”.   Tweet Go to Top Videos Debt traps threaten Nepal quake victims Israeli soldier who shot Palestinian should get life: father Malaysia floods force thousands from homes US Tech show looks to new 'realities' Violence erupts outside Israeli military court before shooting verdict Kim says N.

Google: Digital Assistants Square Off At CES Technical Alert: Apple Higher Off 'Blowout' App Store Sales Nasdaq, S&P 500, Dow Industrials Hit Record Highs; 20K In Sight (Investor's Business Daily) The fact that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is said to owe more than $14 billion in back taxes to the government of Ireland isn't necessarily a confusing concept. The fact that Ireland doesn't want the cash is. Shares of Apple were down more than 2 percent Tuesday, but recovered to close at $106. Why Ireland Will Appeal The Ruling? According to CNBC, the Irish government plans on appealing the EU ruling, noting that the European Union bureaucrats in Brussells "have no business telling Dublin how much they should tax companies." Related Link:Ireland Gave Illegal Tax Breaks To Apple; Company Plans To Appeal $14 Billion Bill CNBC added that each individual EU member, of which Ireland is part of, sets their own tax rates. In other words, the Irish government is "essentially telling the EU to mind its own business." From EU's point of view, its members can't subsidize companies within their borders as that would give the country an unfair advantage over all the other member nations. Why Apple? Apple is foremost an "easy target" given its size, especially its massive $230 billion annual revenue. The company also sits on a huge pile of cash, most of which is "stashed" in Ireland and other countries overseas. Technically, the EU isn't picking on just Apple as it's actively investigating dozens of multinational companies operating in Europe. How Binding Is The Ruling Apple will certainly put up a fight against the ruling, but the EU has given the company four months to place the $14.5 billion in an escrow account. Apple CEO Tim Cook's response indicates he's "clearly ready to pull out all the stops," noting that the decision will " have a profound and harmful effect on investment and job creation in Europe." Thankfully, Apple has a "formidable ally" on its side - the U.S. Treasury Department. The department even warned that the U.S. government will "consider potential responses should the Commission continue its present course."

(Reuters/Eric Vidal) Share Written by Joon Ian Wong Obsession Borders August 30, 2016 There could be more reluctant recipients for the billions in back-taxes that the European commission says Apple owes: Besides Ireland, which will appeal to avoid collecting the windfall, the EU all but invited its other members and the United States to claim their share of the €13 billion ($14.5 billion) sum. “Other countries, in the EU or elsewhere, can look at our investigation. If they conclude that Apple should have recorded its sales in those countries instead of Ireland, they could require Apple to pay more tax locally,” Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner in charge of the findings, said in a statement. This would entail examining how Apple invests in intellectual property in each jurisdiction. The commission explained in a separate statement that the tax penalty to be recovered by Ireland would be reduced if US authorities “require” Apple to retroactively shift income, allocated for research and development costs over the 10-year period of the investigation, to its US parent company. The company divides R&D costs and the revenues they generate between Apple Inc., in the US, and Apple Sales International, an Irish subsidiary. The idea is that each entity pays its share of the R&D costs, and therefore books the corresponding amount of revenue. But a 2013 inquiry by a US senate committee quashed that premise. The committee found that almost all of the research work was done in the US, but a majority of the resulting revenues were being booked in Ireland, where we now know Apple enjoyed effective tax rates as low as 0.05% in 2011. The arrangement meant that Apple could keep the fruit of its R&D labors out of the US. The US senate committee urged a rethink of US tax laws to end arrangements like Apple’s, but nothing was done. The European commission’s finding against the tech giant, however, could prompt action, because real money is finally in play. “Europe’s just trying to get what they think they’re owed,” says Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, an advocacy group. “The US can make a case that the money Europe is trying to collect is money [the US] is trying to collect, because frankly, it all flows from Cupertino.” Apple could owe over $26 billion to the US tax authorities, of the $74 billion in earnings it shifted to Ireland between 2009 and 2012, according to the senate committee’s findings (pdf, p. 2). It’s not currently clear how much of the $14.5 billion the European commission is seeking could be claimed by US authorities. But the obstacles to such a clawback loom large.The Internal Revenue Service has so far declined to challenge Apple’s cost-sharing system, but it is still auditing the company’s 2011 and 2012 tax returns. Absent IRS action, US lawmakers would need to reform arcane rules that make Apple’s deferral of taxes on foreign earnings legal, a move that would be opposed by lobbyists and advocates of low taxes. Even then, there’s the question over whether retroactively applied tax laws are constitutional (pdf). “It’s all down to whether Congress acts,” says Clemente, the tax advocate. “The money’s not going to be paid next week. So there’s time.” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Ireland’s regular tax rate is 12.5 percent, and the EU’s rules state that members can’t give special benefits to individual companies, even if it is the most highly valued company in the world. Under the EU ruling, Apple would be required to pay Ireland more than $14.5 billion in back taxes. Both Apple and the Irish government plan to appeal. That’s is a huge amount of money for a small country like Ireland, which suffered terribly after the 2008 financial crisis and required a massive bailout from the EU. Many in Ireland are salivating over what kind of public infrastructure or personal tax breaks $14.5 billion could be spent on. The sum is roughly equal to Ireland’s entire health budget, to put it in perspective. Others, however, see the ruling as exactly why Ireland, just like the United Kingdom did with its Brexit vote, needs to leave an interventionist, anti-sovereignty European Union. Advertisement Continue reading To put the question a different way: Did Apple, in collusion with the Irish government, rip off the Irish public by arranging a huge tax break? Or did the European Union just undermine Ireland’s economic model and strip the country of its competitive advantage, risking Ireland’s long-term growth? Much of the debate across the Irish Sea in Britain during the lead-up to their referendum on EU membership in June centered on the idea that bureaucrats with no allegiance to Britain were sitting in Brussels and writing their laws. Proponents of a “Brexit” argued that leaving the EU would allow the country to “take back control” of its economy and borders. After the EU’s ruling on Apple and Ireland on Tuesday, one of the most outspoken Brexit leaders, Nigel Farage, tweeted that the EU was “anti-democratic” and “doomed,” and included a video of him on a television show saying “Across the whole continent, people are saying, ‘Why are our laws being made somewhere else?'” Others began using the hashtag #Irexit, or argued that it was the EU, and not Ireland, that had broken its treaty obligations to its member-state. Mehmet Simsek, Turkey’s deputy prime minister, even took the opportunity to suggest that Apple shift from Ireland to Turkey, which isn’t a EU member, where he’d be “happy to provide more generous tax incentives.” And despite the promise of an unprecedentedly large injection of tax revenue, the Irish government plans to appeal the ruling. “This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system, to provide tax certainty to business and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation,” Michael Noonan, Ireland’s finance minister said in a statement. Apple will also appeal. At the core of their argument is a denial that they got special tax rates unavailable to others. Advertisement Continue reading “The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process,” read part of a statement from Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook. The ruling, he said, would have a “profound and harmful effect on investment and job creation in Europe.” “Using the Commission’s theory, every company in Ireland and across Europe is suddenly at risk of being subjected to taxes under laws that never existed,” argued Cook. Ireland’s second and third-biggest parties seemed to align with the ruling Fine Gael party in opposing the ruling. Both the Fianna Fáil and Labour parties spokespersons stated that it was counter to their understandings of Ireland’s ability to set its own tax rules, and expressed worry that should the appeals fall through, multinationals would lose faith in Ireland as a destination for investment. Apple employs around 6,000 people across Ireland, and made overtures that those jobs would be kept there. Much further to the left on the political spectrum, the Social Democrats, Ireland’s newest political party, echoed the resentment toward Apple that many Irish citizens expressed throughout the day on social media. “While Small and Medium sized enterprises, which employ seven out of every 10 people in the private sector, struggled throughout the downturn, many going to the wall, this multinational giant was paying the bare minimum in tax,” said a statement released on their website. apple-brexit Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe More News Suggested Stories: White House worries Apple deal to cost taxpayers – Aug 30, 2016 Europe hits Apple with a $15 billion-plus tax bill – Aug 30, 2016 Why the EU's tax probe of Apple and others is raising US ire – Aug 30, 2016 Ireland to appeal EU's record $14 billion tax order on Apple – Dec 19, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

As a result, Apple has to give back the 13 billion it saved over the 2003-2014 period. The investigation concluded that Apple paid an effective corporate tax rate of 1% on its profits in Europe in 2003, whereas in 2014 the rate was as low as 0.005%. However, Ireland's official corporate tax rate is 12.5%. EU tax officials have found that whenever someone buys an Apple product in Europe, the Middle East, Africa or India, they're in fact purchasing it from Apple Sales International in Ireland. However, Apple's deal with Ireland allowed it to "avoid taxation on almost all profits generated by sales of Apple products." Tim Cook has responded to the Commission's ruling in an official statement posted on Apple Ireland's website. Apple's CEO says that the ruling suggests Apple received a special deal on taxation, which has "no basis in fact or in law." Further, he states that with its judgement, the European Commission is interfering with Irish business by replacing Irish policy with its own. In Apples case, nearly all of our research and development takes place in California, so the vast majority of our profits are taxed in the United States. European companies doing business in the U.S. are taxed according to the same principle. But the Commission is now calling to retroactively change those rules. Ireland's finance minister, Michael Noonan, expressed his disagreement with the decision stating that "the decision leaves me with no choice but to seek cabinet approval to appeal."

Apple's tax bill comes after a three-year investigation by the Brussels-based European Commission, which ruled Ireland's tax dealings with Apple breached rules on state aid. The European Commission's antitrust team is also investigating two other American giants: McDonald's and Amazon. An Amazon shipping box and McDonald's sign Getty; Reuters McDonald's The European Commission announced last December it had opened an investigation into McDonald's operations in Luxembourg to determine whether the fast food giant was given illegal tax breaks. The investigation is focused on a 2009 tax ruling that resulted in McDonald's Europe Franchising, which is headquartered in Luxembourg, from "paying no tax on their European royalties either in Luxembourg or in the U.S.," according to a news release from the European Commission. Despite recording a $280 million profit from its business in 2013, the European Commission said McDonald's did not pay a corporate tax in Luxembourg or in the United States. Many countries have double taxation treaties, allowing a corporation sending profits to its main location to avoid being taxed twice. "A tax ruling that agrees to McDonald's paying no tax on their European royalties either in Luxembourg or in the US has to be looked at very carefully under EU state aid rules," Margrethe Vestager, the commissioner in charge of antitrust investigations said in a statement. "The purpose of Double Taxation treaties between countries is to avoid double taxation - not to justify double non-taxation." McDonald's representatives have said they believe the company is properly complying with all tax laws. In their 2015 annual report, the company warned investors if the "matter is adversely resolved," McDonald's could be on the hook for a large tax bill and face a future increase. Amazon A similar probe looking at Amazon's tax dealings in Luxembourg was announced by the European Commission in 2014. In Amazon's case, which dates back to 2003, the commission is probing whether Amazon paid appropriate taxes in Luxembourg on "most" of its European profits, which were routed through a subsidiary called Amazon EU Sàrl, according to a news release. "Based on a methodology set by the tax ruling, Amazon EU Sàrl pays a tax deductible royalty to a limited liability partnership established in Luxembourg but which is not subject to corporate taxation in Luxembourg. As a result, most European profits of Amazon are recorded in Luxembourg but are not taxed in Luxembourg," the European Commission said in the news release. Amazon included the ongoing case in its 2015 annual report, telling shareholders it believes its tax estimates are reasonable, however if the case is "adversely resolved," the company may be slapped with a sizable bill. What's next for Apple Apple and the Irish government both said they would appeal the decision. Apple posted a message from CEO Tim Cook on some of its European sites calling the tax ruling "unprecedented" and one that "has serious, wide-reaching implications." "It is effectively proposing to replace Irish tax laws with a view of what the Commission thinks the law should have been," the message said. "This would strike a devastating blow to the sovereignty of E.U. member states over their own tax matters, and to the principle of certainty of law in Europe." The European Commission alleges Apple avoided tax on its profits across the E.U. by recording all sales in Ireland rather than in the country where the devices were actually sold. Ireland has been ordered to recover taxes from 2003 to 2014 of up to €13 billion [$14.5 billion] plus interest. If Apple agreed to repay tax to the other countries, "this would reduce the amount to be recovered by Ireland," the Commission said. The White House also weighed in today, with Press Secretary Josh Earnest saying he was "concerned about a unilateral approach" and said it could "undermine progress that we have made collaboratively with the Europeans to make the international taxation system fair," Reuters reported. Apple could deduct those back taxes from what it owes the United States, Earnest said. However, he noted that wouldn't be fair to American taxpayers. Ireland has positioned itself over the past two decades as an attractive place for international companies, especially those in the technology sector, to set up their European headquarters, largely due to its low corporate tax rate. Intel and Apple were some of the first American tech behemoths to set up shop in the country. Since then, Google, Facebook, Airbnb and others have followed suit.

The EU’s $14.5 Billion Shakedown of Apple Share article on Facebookshare Tweet articletweet Plus one article on Google Plus+1 Print Article Adjust font size AA AA AA AA AA AA AA by Veronique de Rugy August 30, 2016 4:19 PM I’m usually slow to defend corporations these days because so many of them have built cronyism into their business models and are free markets’ worst enemies. But The European Union’s shakedown of Apple is outrageous. The Wall Street Journal reports: The European Union’s antitrust regulator has demanded that Ireland recoup roughly €13 billion ($14.5 billion) in taxes from Apple Inc., after ruling that a deal with Dublin allowed the company to avoid almost all corporate tax across the entire bloc for more than a decade — a move that could intensify a feud between the EU and the U.S. over the bloc’s tax probes into American companies. The tax payment is the highest ever demanded under the EU’s longstanding state-aid rules that forbid companies from gaining advantages over competitors because of government help. There is so much wrong here: Apple followed the rules in place in Ireland, and what it did is legal both in Ireland and the United States. So the EU is retroactively changing the rules on the company — i.e., this is a shakedown. The EU is violating the Irish government’s right to set its own taxes. It showing its lack of respect for nations’ tax sovereignty. The EU shows that it believes that the only proper form of taxation is high and punishing. It believes that low tax burdens are a form of “state-aids,” which is laughable. A low corporate-tax rate is the best way to undermine the incentive to avoid taxes. If the EU thinks multinational companies are playing games to under-state profits in high-tax nations and over-state profits in low-tax nations, the various national governments should simply adjust their “transfer pricing” rules. This is just the beginning: Other companies are expected to get hit with this shakedown tax bill from the EU. The U.S. Department of Treasury is fighting the EU on this issue. And it is right to do so even if the only reason it fights is to retain as much revenue from multinational corporations. My prediction: This type of behavior from the EU isn’t going to help its economic outlook. On the contrary, it will hurt the EU where it can afford it the least — economic growth.

By Danny Palmer | August 30, 2016 -- 12:09 GMT (05:09 PDT) | Topic: Apple Apple has been ordered to replay billions in 'illegal state aid'. Image: CNET Apple should repay up to €13bn in taxes to Ireland, the European Commission (EC) has ruled. The EC declared tax arrangements between Apple and Ireland had allowed the company to pay "substantially less tax" than other companies, and were illegal under state aid rules. The tax deal allowed Apple to pay billions of euros less than would otherwise have been the case, at one point paying a tax rate of just 0.005 percent. Read this Apple's Irish tax arrangements look like illegal state aid, says Europe Deals with the Irish government gave the iPhone maker an unfair advantage, according to the European Commission. Read More The announcement follows a two-year investigation by the EC, which found that two tax rulings that Ireland issued to Apple substantially and artificially lowered the tax the company paid in the country since 1991. The deal saw Apple -- which is expected to announce a new iPhone in just a few days -- attribute all profits from two of its incorporated companies to a 'head office' in Ireland, which had no employees and "could not have generated such profits", according to the EC. The Commission argues that the taxable profits of two Irish incorporated companies of the Apple group, Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe, didn't correspond to "economic reality", as almost all sales profits from these companies were attributed to a head office that "existed only on paper". As a result, Apple only paid an effective corporate tax rate that declined from one percent in 2003 to 0.005 percent in 2014 on the profits of Apple Sales International. "Apple Sales International as a whole paid very little tax on its profits. In 2011, Apple Sales International made a profit of €16bn; less than €50m were allocated to the Irish branch. The rest was allocated to the so-called head office where they remained untaxed. This meant that Apple's effective tax rate in 2011 was 0.05 percent," said commissioner Margrethe Vestager, speaking at a press conference. "Apple's tax benefits in Ireland are illegal. Two tax rulings granted by Ireland have artificially reduced Apple's tax burden for over two decades in breach of EU state aid rules. Apple now has to repay the benefits worth up to €13bn, plus interest," said Vestager. "This decision sends a clear message: member states cannot give unfair tax benefits to selected companies," she added. Nonetheless, Apple maintains it has done nothing wrong and says the decision could have a negative impact on jobs. "The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple's history in Europe, ignore Ireland's tax laws, and upend the international tax system in the process," the company said in a statement. "The Commission's case is not about how much Apple pays in taxes, it's about which government collects the money. It will have a profound and harmful effect on investment and job creation in Europe." Apple says it "follows the law and pays all of the taxes we owe wherever we operate" and added it will appeal against the decision, stating it is "confident" the ruling will be overturned. The Irish government has also criticised the ruling by the European Commission and also says it will mount an appeal. "The decision leaves me with no choice but to seek cabinet approval to appeal. This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation," said Irish finance minister, Michael Noonan. Nonetheless, the Commission says its decision doesn't call into question Ireland's general tax system or its corporate tax rate, or Apple's broader tax structure in Europe. The Commission is only able to demand repayments for a ten-year period preceding its first request for information on the tax rulings. Given that dates back to 2013, Ireland told to recover unpaid tax from 2003, which could amount to up to €13bn, plus interest. "Member states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies -- this is illegal under EU state aid rules," said commissioner Vestager, who also noted that the Commission is also examining the tax affairs of Amazon. Google has also previously been accused of going to "extraordinary lengths" to avoid paying UK taxes.

The ruling, which ABC News described at length today, is the result of a three-year investigation by the commission, which is the executive branch of the European Union, that concluded Ireland gave Apple unfair tax advantages. The commission claims this gave the tech giant an effective tax rate as low as 0.005 percent at some points. Both the Irish Finance Minister and Apple have denounced the ruling and say they will seek appeals. While Apple is the subject of today’s ruling, the European Commission (EC) is currently looking into the tax dealings of two other prominent U.S. companies: McDonald’s and Amazon. Why Apple Was Taxed $14.5 Billion for Ireland, Which Doesn't Want the Money Both cases involve the tiny country of Luxembourg, nestled between Belgium, France and Germany, in the heart of Europe. UIG via Getty Images Amazon distribution center headquarters in Swansea, West Glamorgan, South Wales, U.K. Open Investigation: Amazon In October 2014, the EC opened an investigation into Amazon’s tax arrangements with Luxembourg, saying in a press release from the time, that a tax ruling in favor of Amazon from 2003 might be in violation of the trade bloc’s rules. "It applies to Amazon's subsidiary Amazon EU Sàrl, which is based in Luxembourg and records most of Amazon's European profits," the commission said. "Based on a methodology set by the tax ruling, Amazon EU Sàrl pays a tax deductible royalty to a limited liability partnership established in Luxembourg but which is not subject to corporate taxation in Luxembourg.” "As a result, most European profits of Amazon are recorded in Luxembourg but are not taxed in Luxembourg," the commission added in the statement. Amazon’s sales in Europe are structured in a way such that all transactions are between the Luxembourg company and the customers, according to Reuters. Those sales -- which total almost €14 billion ($15.6 billion at today’s rate) -- are not counted as profit, Reuters reported, because they are written off as fees to a parent company, through a tax-exempt partnership. Amazon declined to comment further to ABC News, citing the ongoing investigation, but referred to a statement provided to Reuters previously, in which the company said: "Amazon has received no special tax treatment from Luxembourg, we are subject to the same tax laws as other companies operating here." AFP/Getty Images People walk past a McDonald's fast-food outlet, on Feb. 26, 2015, in northern France. Open Investigation: McDonald’s McDonald’s has also drawn a concerned eye from the EC over its activities in Luxembourg. In December, the commission said that it was opening an investigation into McDonald’s, alleging that "McDonald's Europe Franchising has virtually not paid any corporate tax in Luxembourg nor in the U.S. on its profits since 2009," which were made from "royalties paid by franchisees operating restaurants in Europe and Russia for the right to use the McDonald's brand and associated services." The commission said that two tax rulings from Luxembourg allowed the company to operate without paying taxes in Luxembourg or the U.S. on its European profits. Those profits were more than €250 million ($278 million dollars at today's rate) in 2013, the commission said. The company was paying tax in Switzerland, according to the statement released by the EC. McDonald’s did not return ABC News’ request for comment. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Amazon, McDonald's Face EU Tax Audit Similar to Apple's " 5 Dead, Multiple People Injured in Shooting at Fort Lauderdale Airport Pelosi Calls Russian Hacking Report 'Stunning' " Kerry Says Mexico Won't Pay for Wall " Obama Says He'd Back 'Obamacare' Repeal if GOP Has Better Plan " Trump Certified as President, Faith Spotted Eagle Gets a Vote " Tilikum, a SeaWorld Killer Whale Featured in 'Blackfish,' Has Died " Palestinians, Jordan Warn Trump Over Proposed Move of Israel Embassy to Jerusalem Former NYC Nightclub Owner Found Strangled to Death, Police Say " Grieving Sisters Say 'Rude' Flight Attendant Led to Their Removal From Flight " Family's Search for Travel Nanny Garners Thousands of Applications " Experts Warn of Risks of Some at-Home Chemical Peels " Sisters Reunite With Long-Lost Mother After 4 Decades " Mattel to Release a Smart Monitor for Kids " Charleston Church Shooting Victim Was Considering Retirement, Brother Says at Dylann Roof Sentencing " Viola Davis Remembers Late Father During Tearful Walk of Fame Ceremony " Ryan Seacrest Weighs In on Mariah Carey's New Year's Performance " Hotel Suite of the Week: Pineapple Suite at Nickelodeon Punta Cana

Lions preparing for Christmas for Seniors By Suzanne Williams, Contributing writer Aug 28, 2016 Courtesy of Suzanne Williams Lions President Walt Satalino and Sandy Morris prepare for Christmas for Seniors. The Tehachapi Lions Club held its last summer backyard meeting of the season Aug. 18 at the home of President Walt Satalino. The Lions enjoyed lots of good food and camaraderie. The Lions are preparing for their upcoming Oct. 9 Apple Drop during the Tehachapi Apple Festival and were very excited to have Sandy Morris from Christmas for Seniors of Kern County as their guest speaker. Morris is a former community relations specialist in the Crime Prevention Unit of the Bakersfield Police Department. While spending numerous hours teaching safety techniques to Bakersfield’s senior citizens, she discovered many lived in low-income housing on extremely fixed incomes. These seniors were doing without everyday necessities and were too proud to ask for assistance. With that in mind, Christmas for Seniors was born. The program adopts low-income, home-bound or isolated seniors who would otherwise not have a Christmas. The seniors fill out a wish list for themselves and their pets. The seniors receive items from their wish list as well as a large box of sundries and Christmas cards from local children and community volunteers. This will be the second year that the Lions will be involved in this worthy project. Last year, the Lions provided a Christmas to 30 Tehachapi seniors due to the generosity and support of our wonderful community. You can help the Lions this year if you are aware of a senior who is isolated, has no family support and will not have a Christmas this year, by contacting us at 822-7583. The Lions fund Christmas for Seniors by selling their Apple Drop tickets, which are $5 apiece. You can purchase these tickets from any Lions member or during ticket sales at Albertsons on Sept. 10, 16, 23, 24 and 30 or Oct. 1, or at the Lions booth during the Apple Festival on Oct. 8 and 9. The Lions also need help collecting sundries items such as: two-ply toilet paper, flushable wipes, dryer fabric softener sheets, small size laundry detergent, cleaning supplies, disinfectant wipes, paper towels, Kleenex, razors and shaving cream, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, toothbrushes, toothpaste, men’s and ladies deodorant, hand sanitizer, and large-print word finds, puzzle books, books and calendars. The sundries items can be dropped off at the Lions booth during the Apple Festival, at the Greater Tehachapi Chamber of Commerce and at The Loop. The Tehachapi Lions Club motto is “We Serve.” The Lions actively serve in our community through projects, donations and camaraderie. The Lions are always looking for new members who want to serve our community. For more information about the Tehachapi Lions club, visit us at the Tehachapi Lions Club Facebook page, visit our website at e-clubhouse.org/sites/tehachapi/ or call 822-7583.

Launches “3 Marlenas” Tequila Barrel-Aged Apple Brandy Press Release Aug. 30, 2016 at 4:12 pm More Louisville-based Copper & Kings American Brandy Co. is launching limited release artisanal five-year-old Apple Brandy 3 Marlenas. Matured two years in Tequila barrels, the non-chill filtered spirit is unadulterated by any post distillation infusion of apple flavors or apple essences. Only 1000 bottles (375mL each) will be produced and sold at the distillery and a small selection of superlative bars and liquor stores. The original fine art is painted by Louisville oil painter Damon Thompson. “This is quite a restless spirit,” said founder Joe Heron. “It has a little “Thelma & Louise” rebelliousness, long-limbed and sexy. Perhaps the ghost of a wild Frida Kahlo. It’s just a cool interpretation, unusual, adventurous and lots of rock and roll in an Arizona desert. We left this for two years to really obtain the tequila nuance from the used barrel, to extract not only flavor, natural color but also character and personality.” “Copper-pot intensity, two years of polishing, really great tonality – but completely unpredictable,” said head distiller Brandon O’Daniel. “Very layered texturally and flavor wise. Just an excellent example of the work a barrel does during maturation, and the role a barrel’s provenance plays through its lifetime. Easily one of our cooler and more interesting projects. I love the way the apple brandy hangs in there, holding its own as the foundation and essence, but lets the tequila wrap its arms around it and give it a nice deep, sexy smooch.” Copper & Kings 3 Marlenas Tequila Barrel Aged Apple Brandy (100 proof/50% ABV) $40 per 375mL bottle Appearance: Burnt, honeyed amber. Aroma: Light spiciness with crisp apple, whiskey hints, honey and vanilla with a little campfire, dried fruit – prune, fig. Taste: Roasted apples, honey, slight reposado tequila vegetal notes with faint agave back-end. Smokey close with a little butter smoothness. Finish: Soft and rich, completely coats the mouth. Tequila barrel character is more forceful with a bit of heat as tannins peak, followed by creamy vanilla. 3 Marlenas will be launched Sept. 9 with a bottle signing and fiesta at Copper & Kings’ Butchertown distillery. The distillery also produces the following portfolio of fine distilled spirits: Copper & Kings American Craft Distilled Brandy (90 proof/45% ABV) – $35/750 mL Copper & Kings American Butchertown Brandy (124 proof/45% ABV) – $60/750 mL Copper & Kings Un-Aged Apple Brandy (90 Proof/45% ABV) – $30/750mL Copper & Kings Immature Brandy (90 proof/45% ABV) – $30/750 mL Copper & Kings Absinthe Blanche (130 proof/65% ABV) – $55/750 mL Copper & Kings is available in 27 markets including: Arkansas, California, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Washington D.C.

(REUTERS/Stringer) Apple CEO Tim Cook in a file photo from Nov. 11, 2015. The European Commission has ordered Apple to pay back taxes to Ireland, which could reach the billions. (Niall Carson/PA Wire/Zuma Press/TNS) Washington Post Aug 30, 2016 at 2:32 pm | Print View European authorities ruled Tuesday that Apple struck a sweetheart deal with Ireland that allowed the tech giant to underpay its taxes by more than $14.5 billion over more than a 10-year period. Apple runs its European operations from Ireland, which has a 12.5 percent corporate tax rate. But its agreement with the Irish government that allowed Apple to pay a tax rate of just 1 percent or even less — .0005 percent, in some years — according to the European Commission, which launched an investigation into Apple’s tax strategies in 2014. Apple must now repay those taxes, the commission ruled. “The Commission’s investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years,” European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who is in charge of competition policy, said in a statement from Brussels. “Member States cannot give tax benefits to selected companies. This is illegal under (European Union) state-aid rules.” Both Apple and Ireland said they would appeal. “Apple follows the law and pays all of the taxes we owe wherever we operate,” the company said in a statement. The company also took aim at the EU move as having a “profound and harmful effect on investment and job creation in Europe.” “The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process,” the Cupertino, Calif.-based company said. In Dublin, Ireland’s finance minister, Michael Noonan, denied that the country sidestepped E.U. tax rules and vowed to challenge the decision — raising yet another potential flash point between Brussels and member states over the reach of regulations and oversight. Such questions helped tip the scales in Britain in June’s vote to leave the 28-nation bloc — and have complicated transatlantic trade talks. “This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system, to provide tax certainty to business and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation,” Noonan said in a statement. Across Europe, just how much — or little — U.S. multinational companies are paying in taxes is coming under increasing scrutiny. French authorities recently raided the Paris headquarters of two U.S. corporate giants, Google and McDonald’s. And European authorities have accused the Netherlands of allowing Starbucks to avoid more than $30 million in taxes. Your next Business articles Oil prices rise as Saudi Arabia discusse ...

European Union slaps Apple with $14.5 billion USD in fees after ten years of Irish tax breaks Jessica Vomiero August 30, 2016 3:29pm Ireland has officially been ordered by the European Union to retrieve almost $14.5 billion in taxes from Apple as the result of a deal that allowed the company to avoid almost all corporate taxes across the coalition for over a decade. Apple will reportedly appeal the decision and claims to have paid all taxes in Ireland that the company was due. The tax payment is the highest ever demanded by the EU, and will be pursued under rules that prohibit countries from assisting companies in gaining financial advantages over others. In an open letter to the Apple community in Europe, penned by Tim Cook, he described the company’s presence in Ireland. Apple opened its first plant in Cork, Ireland in 1980 with just 60 employees. That presence has grown to almost 6,000 employees across Ireland today. Tim Cook writes that in addition to contributing to the growth of the Irish economy, Apple is also proud of its contributions to local communities across Europe as one of the largest tax payers in the world. “As responsible corporate citizens, we are also proud of our contributions to local economies across Europe, and to communities everywhere. As our business has grown over the years, we have become the largest taxpayer in Ireland, the largest taxpayer in the United States, and the largest taxpayer in the world,” he wrote. According to reports by the Wall Street Journal, the tax agreement offered to Apple in 2007 allowed the company to pay between zero and one percent on its European profits for more than ten years by designating just a small segment of its profit to a taxable Irish branch. Essentially, the EU determined that the tax structure offered to Apple was neither legal nor offered with any economic justification. Tim Cook states that Apple, Ireland and the United States share the understanding that a company’s profits should be taxed in the country where the value is created, and goes on to claim that the EU wants to see that standard changed. Cook goes on to write that while Apple is a great supporter of international tax reform to promote “simplicity” and “clarity,” new rules shouldn’t be applied retroactively. He claims that companies across Europe are in danger of being targeted under laws that never before existed. The United States has criticized the EU’s tax investigations, claiming that the bloc disproportionately targets American companies. Apple recently released a statement to its investors regarding the EU’s ruling to address any concerns about the company’s tax rate and financial earnings going forward, and assured its investors that the company would be virtually unaffected by these circumstances. Apple has warned investors that the process of appealing the Commission’s decision could take upwards of several years.

At least some respect is gained for not sucking up to Biden, who directly threatened them for investigating American businesses. Brad Fortin Happy, neo905? They posted the article you wanted. I just find it odd that they’re coming after Apple now, despite them having their tax deal with Ireland since before the EU even existed. They couldn’t have done this sooner? FlamesFan89 This is the EU we are talking about. They actually made this decision on day one of the EU being formed, but they just now got finished filling out all the paperwork in triplicate. Schultzter EU found in 1945, Apple in 1976. At the speed of their bureaucracy this is about right though. Brad Fortin The EU was established in 1993 with the Maastricht Treaty. gommer strike 14.5 billion for Apple? Yawn, pocket change. Sure appeal that to lower it a bit(which is what they’re expecting anyways) and it’s business as usual. It’s Me Pretty much. Even if Apple loses, it’s not much in the grand scheme of things. The precedent this will set will have interesting repercussions for any multinational that isn’t based in the EU. You’ve got the EU retroactively going after a US company for paying the taxes they were asked to pay by a country that says they don’t want this new windfall of extra taxes, all agreed to when the EU had no jurisdiction. And apparently, with international tax agreements, every extra dollar that Apple might pay in this matter will be directly deducted from taxes they would otherwise pay to repatriate the money to the US. No doubt the US will now consider double taxing EU based companies forcing the EU to write off that amount dollar for dollar. The could even consider doing so retroactively, as the EU is. ciderrules I’m sure Google and all the other tech firms in Ireland are cheering for Apple and their appeal. After all, if Apple wins then it means they also win. If Apple loses, then they’re going to be paying billions too. Omar “As our business has grown over the years, we have become the largest taxpayer in Ireland, the largest taxpayer in the United States, and the largest taxpayer in the world.” Amazing how Apple issued such a statement in response to being caught avoiding paying most of their taxes in the EU. Schultzter Define “taxes”. There’s not just tax on profit, but all kinds of sales taxes and payroll taxes and property taxes, not to mention fees, licensing, contributions, etc. that companies pay. The 14.5 billion is not everything; it’s just a small portion of what it costs to operate the business. The portion that the EU figures they can some portion of. Lets be realistic, if none of that money was going to trickle down into EU coffers they wouldn’t give a dam! willy And now we know the rest of the story…. as to why Mr. cook sold a very large amount of class 1 stock , just days before story broke….. can anybody say insider trading …. OH OH .Just sayin… willy The European Union on Tuesday hit Apple with a $14.5 billion tax penalty, ruling its deal with Ireland was illegal. EU antitrust regulators say the 13 billion euro payment to Ireland could be slashed if other countries, including the US, demand the company pay more within their own jurisdictions, the European Commission announced in a statement. “Member states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies — this is illegal under EU state aid rules,” Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. Apple is one of many US technology companies that have benefited from stashing cash overseas. That maneuver lets the companies avoid paying hefty taxes they could face by bringing the cash back to the US. In this case, the iPhone maker reached a deal with Ireland to locate much of its earnings in the country in return for hiring there . That deal let Apple pay a much smaller tax rate than the 35 percent level in the US. Apple keeps more than 90 percent of its cash overseas. An Apple spokeswoman wasn’t immediately available for comment. Such deals in Ireland have come under scrutiny by the EU over the past couple of years. The EU believes Ireland hasn’t been collecting enough taxes and instead has been giving companies like Apple too big of a break on Ireland’s already low 12.5 percent tax rate. The selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1 percent on European profits in 2003, according to the commission. In 2014, it paid a tax rate of 0.005 percent. How did Apple get away with such a low rate? European regulators said that Apple had split the profits from its European sales, with only a small slice going to the Irish branch. The vast majority of the money went to a “head office” within Apple Sales International that was not based in any country and didn’t face taxes, the commission said. The ruling comes about a week before Apple is set to unveil its newest iPhone. The company generates more than two-thirds of its revenue from the device, and this model is expected to sport a better camera and ditch the headphone jack. Apple had $231.5 billion in cash as of its quarterly earnings report last month. Nearly $215 billion of that is held overseas.

While you were sleeping: EU ruling sours Apple Aug. 31 (BusinessDesk) – A decline in Apple shares after the European Union demanded the company pay a record amount in what it ruled to be back taxes weighed on Wall Street. Shares of Apple slid, down 0.9 percent as of 3.08pm in New York, after the European Commission ruled that Ireland granted the company undue tax benefits of up to 13 billion euros (US$14.5 billion)—”illegal aid” under EU rules that the commission says Ireland now must recover from Apple. However, the move drew criticism from the US Treasury Department and lawmakers. “The European Commission’s decision is a predatory and naked tax grab,” US Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement, Reuters reported. In 2.52pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.39 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.38 percent. In 2.37pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated 0.40 percent. Slides shares of Boeing and those of Nike, down 1.5 percent and 1.1 percent respectively, led the Dow lower. Financial stocks bucked the trend, with shares of JPMorgan Chase up 0.7 percent and those of Goldman Sachs trading 0.6 percent stronger recently. In the latest US economic data, a Conference Board report showed its consumer confidence index rose 4.4 points to 101.1 in August, the highest reading since September 2015. “This will likely be interpreted as more evidence that the U.S. economic recovery is back on track following the missteps earlier this year,” Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York, told Reuters. Potential deal news bolstered the mood. Shares of Canada’s Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan and Agrium jumped after the fertiliser producers said they are in talks about a potential merger of equals. “No decision has been made as to whether to proceed with such a combination, no agreement has been reached, and there can be no assurance that any transaction will result from these discussions,” the companies said in their separate releases, without offering further details. Even so, people familiar with the matter said a combination could be announced as soon as next week, according to Bloomberg, which first reported that the rivals were in talks about a merger. Agrium shares jumped, trading 6.4 percent higher as of 1.49pm in Toronto, while those of Potash Corp also rallied, trading 12.4 percent stronger. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a 0.5 percent advance from the previous close. France’s CAC 40 index rose 0.8 percent and Germany’s DAX index climbed 1.1 percent. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index slid 0.3 percent.

"The big problem here is not what it's going to do to Apple. Apple is going to survive this. It's what it does to the investment climate in the EU at a time when they desperately need investment," he said in an interview with CNBC's "Power Lunch." On Tuesday, the executive arm of the European Union ordered the Irish government to recoup up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in back taxes from Apple, plus interest. It concluded the country granted the tech giant undue tax benefits by allowing Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1 percent on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005 percent in 2014. Both Apple and Ireland have said they will contest the ruling. Matt Nager | Bloomberg | Getty Images Carlos Gutierrez, former U.S. Secretary of Commerce and former chairman of Kellogg Co. Meanwhile, Apple isn't the only U.S. company that may have to pay back taxes. The European Commission is also investigating Amazon and McDonald's European tax affairs. "We're sending a message to any taxpayer in Europe: This is a wonderful place to do business and invest, but you have to play by the rules," EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told CNBC. However, Gutierrez said the decision on Apple was a "claw back" on an agreement that a sovereign nation made with a company. "This is amazing coming off Brexit, where you have countries who feel like they're getting suffocated by all these regulations coming out of Brussels," he said. "This is the kind of thing that creates the trend of more Brexits — an overreach by Brussels," he said. CNBC contributor Larry Kudlow called the ruling a tax grab by the European Union, and accused the EU of waging war against companies. "This is a war on business. This is a war on money. This is a war on profits and all they want to do is collect more money to spend more money and forget about the individual sovereignty of these nations," he told "Power Lunch." "The whole damn continent is going down. It's going down because of its own policies developed by this crazy European Union idea which we never should have had in the first place," he said. —CNBC's Catherine Boyle contributed to this story.

News World 0 Comments Apple employs 5500, or about a quarter of its Europe-based staff, in the Irish city of Cork, where it is the largest private sector employer. Photo: Reuters Apple has been ordered to pay Ireland €13 billion ($NZ20 billion) in unpaid taxes after the European Commission ruled the company had received illegal state aid. Apple and Dublin said the American company's tax treatment was in line with Irish and European Union law and both would appeal the ruling, which is part of a drive against what the EU says are sweetheart tax deals that usually smaller states in the bloc offer multinational companies to lure jobs and investment. Apple CEO Tim Cook. Photo: Reuters Apple employs 5500, or about a quarter of its Europe-based staff, in the Irish city of Cork, where it is the largest private sector employer. The United States feels its firms are being targeted by the EU and a US Treasury spokesperson warned the move threatens to undermine US investment in Europe and "the important spirit of economic partnership between the US and the EU". Starbucks has been ordered to pay up to €30 million euros to the Dutch state, while Amazon.com Inc and McDonald's Corp are also under investigation by the Commission, the EU's executive arm. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager questioned how anyone might think an arrangement that allowed Apple to pay a tax rate of 0.005%, as Apple's main Irish unit did in 2014, was fair. "Tax rulings granted by Ireland have artificially reduced Apple's tax burden for over two decades, in breach of the EU state aid rules. Apple now has to repay the benefits," Vestager told a news conference on Tuesday. Analysts said the size of the claim underlined the Commission's aggressive stance, but since each case involves different circumstances and tax rules, lawyers said it was hard to see if further big claims were any more or less likely. Apple, which had more than $US200 billion ($NZ277 billion) in cash and readily marketable securities at the end of June, is likely to see the case drag out for years in EU and possibly Irish courts. 'ARTIFICIAL' ARRANGEMENT The EU's ruling challenges the way that Ireland agreed to tax the profits of Irish registered Apple subsidiaries, through which most of its non-US profits flowed. Apple Inc licenses the rights to technology designed in the US to Irish subsidiaries. These then hire contract manufacturers to make devices which they sell to Apple retail subsidiaries around Europe and Asia. Since the manufacturing cost is a small portion of device sales prices and retail subsidiaries are allocated a small operating margin, Apple Ireland is very profitable. In 2011, it earned $US22 billion after paying $US2 billion to its US parent in relation to the rights to Apple intellectual property. However, the Irish tax authority agreed only €50 million of this was taxable in Ireland, the European Commission said. Under the terms of Apple’s tax deal, first agreed in 1991 and renewed in 2007, Apple could allocate most of the profits earned by its Irish operating units to a "head office" that did not have any employees or own any premises. “This 'head office' had no operating capacity to handle and manage the distribution business, or any other substantive business for that matter,” the Commission said. The Commission said this agreement had no basis in tax law and was not available to others, and so represented state aid. Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said he profoundly disagreed with the decision and in order to preserve Ireland’s attractiveness for investment he would appeal. "There is no economic basis for this decision. It's bizarre and it's an exercise in politics by the Competition Commission," Noonan said. "They don't have responsibility for taxes and they are opening a back door through state aid to influence tax policy in European countries when the European treaties say tax policy is a matter for sovereign governments," he added. Ireland's low corporate tax rate has been a cornerstone of the country’s economic policy for decades, drawing investors from multinational companies whose staff account for almost one in 10 of the country's workers. For many technology firms like Google and Facebook, a key attraction is that Ireland allows companies to adopt tax structures which see them pay much less than the 12.5 percent headline rate. The companies say they follow all tax rules. Apple said it was confident of winning an appeal. "The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process," chief executive Tim Cook said in a letter to customers posted on Apple's website. "A company’s profits should be taxed in the country where the value is created," he added. US OPPOSITION The US Treasury Department published a white paper last week in which it said it was looking at possible responses to what it sees as unfair targeting of its firms, which could include extra taxes on the US arms of European companies. The paper noted that the EU executive's tax rulings could cost the US exchequer money. Under US tax law, Apple's Irish profits are taxable if brought back to the United States – something the company would have to do if it wanted to use the money to pay dividends. But any tax paid in Europe is reduced from the tax due in the United States. The Treasury has said the Commission’s approach was at odds with EU tax law and international treaties. The Commission, which has also ruled European companies including carmaker Fiat and Swedish engineer Atlas Copco AB must pay tax claims worth over $US350 million, said its application of competition law to tax rulings followed EU law and treated all companies equally. Nonetheless, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg have already appealed EU rulings against their tax deals with multinationals. Apple has said it paid Ireland's 12.5% rate on all the income that it generates in the country. The Commission has previously said Apple's tax treatment had been "motivated by employment considerations."

Bobbi Rebell reports. 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Transcript: EU tells Apple to pay up </head> The European Union antitrust regulators ruled that Apple received illegal state aid, and ordered it to pay up to 13 billion euros, or $14.5 billion in unpaid taxes plus interest to the Irish government. At the heart of the matter: the EU believes sweetheart tax deals help divert investment and jobs away from countries where it would normally go. So, Ireland isn't paying fair allowing Apple to pay tax rates that have at times been less than one percent. Apple and Dublin will appeal the decision and say the company's tax treatment was in line with Irish and European Union law. Euan Rellie, senior managing director at BDA Partners is skeptical. (SOUNDBITE) EUAN RELLIE, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, BDA PARTNERS, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "Apple's chances are very low. Apple is gonna have to pay some tax, and, I think, there is a huge pressure now around the world on big corporations to be seen to be doing their share. Whether or not they undertook valid - in their mind - valid tax avoidance measures, there's huge political pressure on them now." The ruling also drew criticism from the US. A U.S. Treasury spokesperson warned the move threatens to undermine U.S. investment in Europe and "the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU". Other U.S. firms are under fire from European regulators. Amazon and McDonald's are facing probes over taxes in Luxembourg. Starbucks has been ordered to pay up to $33 million to the Netherlands. The case is expected to drag on for years in EU and possibly Irish courts.

News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter International Edition Saturday January, 7, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Taiwan Foreign Community National Local Foreign Affairs China-Taiwan Relations Business Arts-Leisure Analysis HTC to unveil newest flagship phone in Sept. at Berlin: report CNA August 31, 2016, 12:13 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet TAIPEI--Taiwan-based smartphone brand HTC Corp. (宏達電) will unveil its next flagship model the HTC One A9 at the IFA electronics trade show next month in a bid to compete with the next generation of iPhones, according to tech blog VentureBeat (VB). In a report posted on VB on Monday, blogger Evan Blass said HTC is about to launch a successor to its A9 flagship model at the IFA, the largest consumer electronics exhibition in Europe that will be held Sept. 2-7 in Berlin. The HTC A9, which was released in 2015, has been compared to Apple's iPhone 6s, with some commentators pointing to several similarities. "What's most interesting about the alleged follow-up device is that HTC seems to have decided to pay homage to Apple naming conventions as well, dubbing the nearly-aesthetically-unchanged model the One A9s — the same nomenclature applied to so-called 'tock' year iPhones," the Blass said in his report. The report coincided with an invitation issued by Apple on Monday for its next big event on Sept. 7, at which it is expected to announce new iPhones and Apple Watches. Blass, who also goes by the name @evleaks and is well known for leaks about high-tech gadgets, said the HTC A9s have a 5-inch display with a design in four colors — white, black, gold and silver blue. "While some of the hardware elements have been repositioned — camera lenses, flash, and sensors — the enclosure is very much identical to the One A9," Blass said. He said the sensor on the phone's main camera remains unchanged at 13 megapixels, while and sensor on the front allegedly has been changed from four ultrapixels to five megapixels. Like the flagship HTC 10, which was unveiled in April, the HTC logo name will be eliminated from the front of the new A9 models phone, Blass said. Earlier this year, foreign tech websites reported that HTC would unveil its new Desire 10 series in September, including the Desire 10 Pro and the Desirer 10 Lifestyle. The HTC Desire 10 is likely to be introduced in September, while the more advanced HTC Desire 10 Pro is likely to be unveiled after the IFA show, the sites said. Market analysts said that the efforts by HTC to launch new models are expected to boost to its shipments in the second half of the year. In reflection of the report on the new HTC A9 models, shares of HTC rose 1.08 percent Tuesday to close at NT$84.40 (US$2.66) on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, where the weighted index ended up 0.39 points.

According to the Commission, such aid was a violation of European Union regulations that prevent member states from granting special tax provisions to companies. Apple and lawmakers in the U.S. have blasted the decision, which could have broader implications for the future of commerce in the European Union. Here are five things to know about the ruling.  The payout is unprecedented The 13 billion euro fine is the largest ever issued by the European Union over such tax dealings. Though some experts had predicted the penalty could run in the tens of billions of dollars, many expected a number closer to 100 million euros.  The tech giant had previously paid a comparatively paltry $350 million in back taxes to Italy in 2015, reports Reuters. Apple is the most profitable company in the world and the most valuable, in terms of market capitalization. The case isn’t over yet Apple and Ireland have said they will appeal the opinion.  In a letter addressed to the Apple community in Europe, CEO Tim Cook said that the company is “confident that the Commission’s order will be reversed.”  During a conference call following the decision, representatives from the company mocked the rationale behind the decision, calling it “legal mumbo jumbo” that threatens state sovereignty in Europe and the rule of law. “The fundamental concern is that the commission has decided to rewrite tax law,” a representative from Apple said. The company is set to release more detailed legal briefs detailing its opposition to the ruling later on Tuesday. Ireland Finance Minister Michael Noonan said in a statement that an appeal “is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign Member State competence of taxation.” Ireland is required to recover the taxes from Apple while the appeal is pending, but the money can be held in an escrow until the case is finished, the finance minister’s office said. Amazon could be next  The online retail giant has own legal woes with the European Commission. The Commission has two pending investigations into the company, an antitrust probe and a tax case not unlike the situation with Apple. The tax investigations revolve around Luxembourg allegedly providing state aid to Amazon that the commission says would be in violation of European Union agreements. Preliminary findings in 2015 said that state aid from Luxembourg might have allowed Amazon to underpay taxes. “Amazon has received no special tax treatment from Luxembourg — we are subject to the same tax laws as other companies operating here,” Amazon said in a 2015 statement. Amazon declined to comment further. Though Amazon's case, like Apple’s, pertains to state aid, there are differences. Amazon generates less profit than Apple and aggressively reinvests what it does make into its operations. If the Commission ruled against the digital retailer, the taxes owed likely would be less significant.  A decision on the Amazon-Luxembourg case is expected within the next several months. The decision could heighten US-EU tensions  The Obama administration and members of Congress have been critical of the EU state aid cases. Ahead of the Apple ruling, the Treasury Department issued a special report last week listing its objections to the investigations. The Treasury on Tuesday declined to comment specifically on the Apple decision but reiterated that it views the Commission’s retroactive assessments as unfair. “The Commission’s actions could threaten to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU,” a Treasury spokesperson said. Lawmakers also blasted the EU’s ruling, with Speaker Paul RyanPaul RyanThere is little conservative about Trump Ryan: Trump ‘won this election fair and square’ Declassified report: Putin ordered election interference to help Trump MORE (R-Wis.) calling it “awful.” Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin HatchOrrin HatchDems to GOP leadership: Help us to fix ObamaCare Cassidy joins Senate Finance Committee Trump’s healthcare nominees are just what the doctor ordered MORE (R-Utah) said the commission “has issued an extraordinary decision that targets U.S. business by rewriting already existing tax policies.”  The top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Ron WydenRon WydenDem bill would require Trump to release tax returns Progressive group backing Trump's USTR nominee Senate Dems blast House GOP over ethics moves MORE (Ore.), warned that the decision could make partnerships between countries to prevent tax evasion more difficult. “This ruling could set a dangerous precedent that undermines our tax treaties and paints a target on American firms in the eyes of foreign governments,” he said.  Tax reform is getting a boost Lawmakers and other stakeholders said that the ruling was a sign that the U.S. international tax system should be overhauled. The back taxes that U.S. companies have to pay as a result of EU rulings could be foreign taxes that are creditable against the U.S. taxes companies have to pay when they repatriate their income. “By forcing their member states to retroactively impose taxes on U.S. companies, the EU is unfairly undermining our ability to compete economically in Europe while grabbing tax revenues that should go toward investment here in the United States,” said Sen. Charles SchumerCharles SchumerThe Hill's 12:30 Report Dems don't have to block Trump's SCOTUS pick — exploit GOP's divisions instead Trump blasts ObamaCare, Dems 'lead by head clown Chuck Schumer' MORE (D-N.Y.). “This is yet another example of why we need to reform the international tax system to ensure these revenues come home.” Sen. Rob PortmanRob PortmanGreens push senators to reject Trump’s EPA pick Regulatory reform must be a top priority in Washington Vulnerable Senate Democrats embrace Trump issues MORE (R-Ohio) similarly said that the Apple ruling signals the importance of international tax reform. “The Commission is blatantly attempting to take advantage of the antiquated U.S. international tax system,” he said. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin BradyKevin BradyIll. rep named new chairman for House tax-policy subcommittee Road to meaningful tax reform filled with potholes Trump plans executive actions for ObamaCare repeal MORE (R-Texas) called the Commission’s decision an “extreme consequence of our broken tax code,” which he said incentivizes U.S. companies to keep profits overseas.  Brady was a leader on the House Republicans’ tax reform blueprint. That proposal calls for moving toward a “territorial” system where U.S. corporations are only taxed on the income they earn in the U.S. going forward and for taxing U.S. companies’ earnings currently held offshore at lower rates. Schumer and Portman led a Senate Finance Committee working group on international tax reform last year that made similar recommendations. But Frank Clemente, executive director of the liberal Americans for Tax Fairness, said that Congress should end companies’ ability to defer U.S. taxes on their foreign earnings and require them to pay U.S. taxes on the income right away. “While it’s at it, Congress needs to collect the up to $700 billion in back taxes that Apple and other multinational corporations owe on the $2.4 trillion in profits now offshore, most of which are stashed in tax havens,” he said. Rep. Sandy Levin (Mich.), the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, cautioned that those who are criticizing the EU ruling should "totally avoid legitimizing the practices of multinationals and some nations rigging the tax system so the companies pay little or no taxes for their operations." Sen. Bernie SandersBernie SandersThe hypocrisy of climate change advocates Sanders's Trump tweet poster becomes social media meme FBI, Dems bicker over investigation of hacked servers MORE (I-Vt.) tweeted that he applauded the EU’s decision because “huge corporations can’t be allowed to use loopholes and tax havens to boost their obscene profits even higher.” Tax reform highly unlikely to happen this year because it is an election year, but many lawmakers view 2017 as a window of opportunity to enact tax changes.  Tags Charles Schumer, Bernie Sanders, Rob Portman, Orrin Hatch, Kevin Brady, Paul Ryan, Ron Wyden   Please enable JavaScript to view the featured perspectives by Versa.

"This would strike a devastating blow to the sovereignty of EU member states over their own tax matters, and to the principle of certainty of law in Europe," Cook said in a statement Tuesday, adding: "Beyond the obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe." On Tuesday, the electronics giant was hit with a massive €13bn ($14.5bn) tax bill following a two-year investigation into the unusual arrangement Apple had reached with the Irish tax authorities that saw it pay an extraordinary 0.005 per cent tax rate in 2014. The European Commission called it "illegal state aid," the Irish tax authorities claimed they had "collected the full amount of tax due," and Apple... well, Apple claimed that the same deal is available to every business based in Ireland, if only they ask. "Over the years, we received guidance from Irish tax authorities on how to comply correctly with Irish tax law – the same kind of guidance available to any company doing business there. In Ireland and in every country where we operate, Apple follows the law and we pay all the taxes we owe." Cook also strongly disputes the EC's claims that Apple has reached a special agreement with Ireland: "The opinion issued on August 30th alleges that Ireland gave Apple a special deal on our taxes. This claim has no basis in fact or in law. We never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals." The EC explains how Apple's unusual tax arrangement works Of course, the suspicion is that the Irish authorities struck a deal with Apple in order to get it to hire people in parts of the country that were not doing well. Cook's response only serves to support this idea, and could even be seen as a coded warning to the Irish government that if it doesn't fight the decision, Apple will start dropping people. "In October 1980, Apple opened a factory in Cork, Ireland with 60 employees," Cook said, reminiscing about the days of Steve Jobs. "At the time, Cork was suffering from high unemployment and extremely low economic investment ... We have operated continuously in Cork ever since, even through periods of uncertainty about our own business, and today we employ nearly 6,000 people across Ireland. The vast majority are still in Cork." Better days? Steve Jobs visits the new Apple building in Cork in 1980 He also implies that forcing Apple to pay billions in back taxes may impact the country, beyond just itself: "Countless multinational companies followed Apple by investing in Cork, and today the local economy is stronger than ever." Despite the huge potential bill, Apple's share price dropped by just one per cent on the news. That is likely in no small part because it will still be the Irish tax authorities that ultimately decide how much Apple must pay. And Ireland is currently sticking to its guns, saying it will appeal the ruling. Cook says Apple will do the same and notes: "We are confident that the Commission's order will be reversed." Whether it will be or not is the fifteen billion dollar question. ® Sponsored: Achieving rapid delivery of high quality software with continuous delivery Tips and corrections 209 Comments Whitepapers The 2016 study on the insecurity of privileged users For purposes of this research, privileged users include database administrators, network engineers, IT security practitioners and cloud custodians Can Machine Learning Prevent Application Downtime?

X Convincing voters to forgo Apple’s €13bn will not be easy The Government will fall if the Independent Alliance cannot agree to appeal the decision Tue, Aug 30, 2016, 20:20 Updated: Tue, Aug 30, 2016, 20:35 Pat Leahy Members of the Independent Alliance Shane Ross and Finian McGrath. The group went into conclave, conspicuously unable to agree with the Fine Gael intention to appeal the commission’s findings. Photograph: Gareth Chaney/Collins         The number caught everyone by surprise. The announcement by the European Commission on Tuesday that Apple owes Ireland €13 billion in back taxes (plus interest) astonished the waiting political world, prepped on recent rumours to expect a not-gargantuan sum. It is not clear whether the rumours were spin or spoof; either way they were wrong. The commission didn’t pussyfoot around – it went the whole hog. A finding that Ireland gave Apple a special deal on its taxes was entirely expected, but dealing with a potential windfall of that magnitude changed the anticipated context immediately. At least one Minister, to the direct knowledge of The Irish Times, met the news with a loud expletive. The number also greatly complicated the politics. Minister for Finance Michael Noonan has long since said the Government would appeal an adverse finding by the commission on Apple’s tax arrangements. That was one thing when everyone thought the bill would be a few hundred million, or – at most – a few billion euro. But the prospect of a windfall of €13 billion was another matter. Suddenly launching a major legal and political initiative with the intention of rejecting the money was a less straightforward narrative. Shortly after Ireland had to explain the “leprechaun economics” of a 25 per cent growth in GDP to the world, now it had to explain why it was strenuously seeking to avoid the largest tax windfall in history. More than one commentator liked it to winning the lottery and not bothering to pick up the winnings. The Apple tax ruling The EC issued a ruling on August 30th in relation to the tax arrangements of Apple in Ireland, where it has its European HQ. The EC said Apple had been granted selective treatment by Ireland through two tax rulings in 1991 and 2007. The EC has ordered Ireland to recover up to €13 billion from the tech giant.  Minister for Finance Michael Noonan indicated Ireland would appeal the decision "to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation”. Q&A: Cliff Taylor answers the key questions I found this helpful Yes No The Independent Alliance went into conclave, conspicuously unable to agree with Fine Gael’s intention to appeal. If the Alliance cannot agree to the appeal at this morning’s Cabinet meeting, then this Government is probably over, sooner rather than later. If they can’t agree this, you wouldn’t give them much chance of agreeing a budget, and a government that can’t budget can’t govern. ADVERTISEMENT Predictable The cacophony of demands to grab the cash and spend it was entirely predictable. People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett raged that the”entire political establishment have colluded over many years with Apple in an act of economic treason to rob the Irish public of €13 billion or more in desperately needed cash for public housing, the health service and other vital public services.” Sinn Féin has been waiting with some relish for the EU verdict and leaped into action. “Give us back our money,” demanded MEP Matt Carthy. For good measure, Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty also called for a public inquiry into Apple’s tax arrangements. The best can be said of all this is that at least the people doing it know its just political grandstanding. Well, this is one of the luxuries of Opposition. For all that, even a cursory reading of the commission’s findings demonstrate that it is clear that Apple – like other multinationals presumably – has constructed a series of contrived structures designed to pay as little tax as possible. All the tech giant’s platitudes about paying the tax it owes are simply public relations guff. They are not meant to be taken seriously except by the gullible. The point at issue is not whether Apple has these structures, it is whether they constituted illegal State aid or not. That will now be decided in the European courts. But the sort of hocus pocus that allows Apple to pay – by the commission’s calculations – less than 1 per cent tax on its global profits is under growing scrutiny everywhere. It is increasingly one of the great political issues of the age, even if it is confined to the margins of political debate in Ireland by the national shibboleth of the 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate. The OECD’s base erosion and profit shifting process is designed to produce international consensus on reducing tax avoidance, but it moves slowly, as such process inevitably do. It is likely that corporations will pay more tax in the future. How and where is another matter. Nonetheless, it may be that the commission has bitten off more than it can chew with this one. It’s hard to argue with Apple’s summary that it is now being “being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we don’t owe them any more than we’ve already paid”. It certainly seems like an extension of the commission’s powers into the realm of taxation, which the member states of the EU have repeatedly declined to grant. International movement Nonetheless, the commission’s move is part of an international movement. If it doesn’t win this one, it has fired a warning shot across the bows of the Apples of the world. National governments may be afraid of multinationals or susceptible to lobbying. The European Commission apparently is not. The furious debate thrown up by the decision exposes again one of the principal fault lines of Irish politics – between the (roughly) two-thirds of voters who vote for mainstream, centrist parties and Independents, who feel they have a stake in the country and its prosperity on the one hand, and those who vote for parties of the radical left, anti-establishment Independents and Sinn Féin on the other, who feel the State often conspires against them, and that politics ignores those like them. Political debate is between these two sides; but political and electoral competition is more usually within them. But Tuesday’s ruling also exposes another cleavage, too. It forces the State to choose between two of the pillars of its policies for the past 40 years: loyalty to the EU institutions and openness to multinational investors. That these choices are now forced upon an Irish Government shows how much the world has changed. There are no reasons to expect that process is at an end.

 What you need to know about Margrethe Vestager, the politician going after Apple Rachel Butt Aug. 30, 2016, 3:15 PM 8,404 facebook linkedin twitter email print Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition commissioner. Francois Lenoir/Reuters Margrethe Vestager is a corporation's worst nightmare. The antitrust enforcer recently ordered Apple to pay up to 13 billion euros in taxes as part of a broader crackdown on tax avoidance in the eurozone. Past campaigns include Starbucks in the Netherlands and Amazon in Luxembourg. "Europe is open for business, if you want to do business, but maybe not so open if you want to come for tax avoidance," she said on Bloomberg TV on Tuesday. By slamming Ireland for providing illegal incentives to Apple, Vestager is likely to ignite one of the world's biggest tax disputes and strain relations between Europe and the US. Vestager graduated with an MS in economics at the University of Copenhagen in 1993, and then took a job at the Danish ministry of finance. At 30, she was appointed minister for education and ecclesiastical affairs, before becoming a member of Parliament with the Social Liberal Party, aka Radikale. At 39, she became the political leader of that party before becoming EU competition commissioner in 2014. She has waged high-profile battles against multinationals. She has launched her third set of antitrust charges against Google, with the latest on the internet giant's advertising business. She's also turned her fire on Russian energy giant Gazprom for unfair pricing in Eastern Europe. She favors ambassadors who "truly embrace social media" and frequently tweets about case rulings and the political state. She lamented Britain's decision to leave the EU, and lauded Hillary Clinton as the first female US presidential nominee. Vestager is also known for her punchy wit. When her opposition slammed her spending plan, Vestager expressed caution toward "any judgment on size from men," according to a profile by the Financial Times' Christian Oliver and Alex Barker.

Analysts calculate that the firm is sitting on $216bn (£165bn) – getting on for double the total international reserves of the entire US government.’ Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP Tuesday 30 August 2016 15.00 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 14 September 2016 02.45 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close How’s that for taking control? On Tuesday the union that Britain has just voted to leave delivered its biggest and most important tax ruling of the lot. After two years of investigations, the European commission ruled that Apple had enjoyed special favours on its taxes from Ireland. Very lucrative favours, worth around €13bn (£11bn) in unpaid tax to the Irish government. The case goes to the heart of much that is wrong with modern politics and business – of a system in which ministers help tax-dodgers and rent-seekers to rake in billions, while community businesses go to the wall and hard-pressed families see pay packets shrink and their public services cut. It also offers the voters of Brexit Britain a grim warning of the ever more dysfunctional capitalism being urged on their government by the free-market fundamentalists around the cabinet table and the lobbyists for investment banks and big business. The big underlying question here goes far deeper than tax. It is this: how much is enough? How much should the top executives and big shareholders of Apple, or any other major company, get back – and how much do they owe their workers, the societies that protect their property rights, provide their infrastructure and workforces, and grant their legal liabilities? The story of the world’s most famous consumer electronics firm confirms how much the pendulum needs to be swung back towards the rest of us. As companies go, you don’t get richer than Apple. Analysts calculate that the firm is sitting on $216bn (£165bn) – getting on for double the total international reserves of the entire US government (worth $121bn, at the last count). This is not money just about to be invested in excellent new products, ploughed into improving conditions and training for workers, or donated to good causes. This is a straight-up hoard, a rainy-day fund for the super-rich. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Why Apple is facing a €13bn tax bill in Ireland Apple has amassed such purposeless riches in large part by exploiting the opportunities and loopholes offered by contemporary globalisation. It has outsourced production to China and it has enjoyed decades of tax reductions from Ireland. All profits from all sales made in Europe were booked in Ireland. Almost all the profits allocated to Apple Sales International, in Cork, were shifted to a head office within the firm. This “head office”, remarked the commission, “was not based in any country and did not have any employees or own premises. Its activities consisted solely of occasional board meetings.” The head office existed only on paper, and the profits allocated to it went untaxed – a version of globalisation taken to its deformed, absurd limit. If Samuel Beckett had dabbled in accounting, this is the kind of elaborate joke he might have dreamt up. Perhaps even he would have stopped short of scripting Dublin’s response , which was to angrily reject the €13bn on offer – and to begin a costly legal appeal. The unpaid taxes would pay for all public spending on the Irish health service for a year – and then some. But for decades the Irish state’s business model has been based on super-low tax rates for multinationals such as Facebook, in the hope of getting some coppers off their cash piles and a few jobs. When Apple said on Tuesday that next to no research work was carried out in its European headquarters of Cork, it was both preparing for a legal appeal and giving the game away about the quality of jobs it has actually created in Ireland. It is no good the Obama administration accusing Europe’s competition enforcer, Margrethe Vestager, of being anti-American: she has recently dished out punishment to Italy’s Fiat and Russia’s Gazprom. Apple once boasted that its machines were “made in America”, but it has now shifted manufacturing jobs to China, even though research shows that it would still make a healthy profit keeping its factories in the US. The lessons here for Brexit Britain are unignorable. For a long time, the City of London has functioned as a tax haven, the no-questions-asked capital of the rich world. As she maps out the UK’s future outside the EU at Chequers on Wednesday, Theresa May is under ever more pressure to go further down that route – to turn all of Britain into some light-touch special enterprise zone, with favours for industries making extravagant promises. The lesson of Apple in Ireland is that such promises are never as good as they seem. The foreign direct investment turns out to be indirect enrichment of a few, even while the host country’s economy gets ever sicklier.

Brussels said Apple, the world’s most valuable company, avoided virtually all tax on its business in the bloc by illegal arrangements with Dublin which gave the company an unfair advantage over competitors. Apple and the Irish government immediately said they would appeal against the European Commission ruling, with the iPhone maker warning it could cost European jobs. Ireland has attracted multinationals over many years by offering extremely favourable sweetheart tax deals to generate much-needed jobs and investment but Brussels said it broke EU laws on state aid. “This decision sends a clear message. Member states cannot give unfair tax benefits to selected companies, no matter if European or foreign, large or small,” EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. “This is not a penalty, this is unpaid taxes to be paid,” Vestager said as she presented the findings of a three-year investigation. The announcement comes amid growing tensions between Washington and Brussels over a series of EU anti-trust investigations targeting other giant US companies such as Google, Amazon, McDonald’s, Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler. ‘Devastating blow’ Apple has had a base in the southern city of Cork since 1980 and employs nearly 6,000 people in Ireland, through which it routes its international sales totalling billions. Apple chief Tim Cook said he was “confident” the EU ruling would be overturned, adding that the Silicon Valley giant was the biggest taxpayer in Ireland, the United States and the world. “The most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe,” he said. Cook also warned that the ruling was a “devastating blow to the sovereignty of EU member states over their own tax matters”, echoing the concerns of Dublin over the decision. Ireland’s Finance Minister Michael Noonan described the ruling as “bizarre” and “an exercise in politics by the Competition Commission”. Dublin, which suffered from harsh austerity measures after it was bailed out during the eurozone debt crisis, has vigorously defended its low tax rates as a way of boosting the economy. “If you look at the small print on an Apple iPhone, it says designed in California and manufactured in China and that means any profits that accrued didn’t accrue in Ireland and so I can’t see why the tax liability is in Ireland,” he said. But Vestager said Apple’s Irish operation was a sham-Apple’s “so-called head office in Ireland only existed on paper. It had no employees, no premises and no real activities.” Apple paid an effective corporate tax rate of just 0.005 per cent on its European profits in 2014 — equivalent to just 50 euros for every million, Vestager said. The Apple tax bill dwarfs the previous EU record for a state aid case-1.3 billion euros for the Nurburgring race track in Germany. US anger Washington has made increasingly angry comments over the case in recent weeks, and yesterday it echoed Apple’s warnings that the tax bill could hurt the European economy. The US Treasury said the ruling “could threaten to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the US and the EU.” The Apple decision may also complicate struggling EU-US talks on what would be the world’s biggest free trade deal, meant to be completed before US President Barack Obama steps down in January. Tax avoidance has moved sharply up the political agenda since EU governments adopted tough austerity policies to balance the public finances, driving public resentment that the rich paid relatively little tax. The issue was highlighted close to home by the LuxLeaks scandal which revealed that European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s native Luxembourg gave companies huge tax breaks while he was prime minister. In October Brussels ordered US coffee giant Starbucks and Italian automaker Fiat to each repay up to 30 million euros ($34 million) in back taxes to the Netherlands and Luxembourg respectively. The European Union yesterday ordered Apple to pay a record 13 billion euros in back taxes in Ireland, saying deals allowing the US tech giant to pay almost no tax were illegal. In the latest in a series of rulings that has angered Washington, Brussels said the world’s most valuable company avoided tax bills on virtually all its profits in the bloc under its arrangements with Dublin. ‘No employees, no premises’ Apple has had a base at the southern city of Cork since 1980 and employs 5,000 people in Ireland, through which it routes its international sales, avoiding billions in corporation taxes. But Vestager-who has launched a series of cases against US firms-said that Apple’s “so-called head office in Ireland only existed on paper. It had no employees, no premises and no real activities.” Apple as a result paid an effective corporate tax rate of 0.005 per cent on its European profits in 2014 — equivalent to 50 euros for every million, Vestager added. Tensions have been growing between Washington and Brussels over a series of anti-trust investigations targeting companies such as Apple, Amazon, Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler. Apple said “we will appeal and we are confident the decision will be overturned.” “It will have a profound and harmful effect on investment and job creation in Europe,” the company added. Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said the decision “leaves me with no choice but to seek cabinet approval to appeal the decision before the European Courts”. The Apple tax bill dwarfs the previous EU record for a state aid, the 1.3 billion euros received by the Nurburgring race track from German authorities. The US stepped up its rhetoric ahead of the decision, accusing the European Commission of unilateralism and overstepping its mandate. A bill of 300 million euros this year for Swedish engineer Atlas Copco AB to pay Belgian tax is the current known record. Other companies ordered to pay back taxes in Belgium, many of them European, have not disclosed figures. For Apple, whose earnings of $18 billion last year were the biggest ever reported by a corporation, finding several billion dollars should not be an insurmountable problem. The 13 billion euros represents about 6 percent of the firm’s cash pile. As of June, Apple reported it had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $231.5 billion, of which 92.8 percent, or $214.9 billion, were held in foreign subsidiaries. It paid $2.67 billion in taxes during its latest quarter at an effective tax rate of 25.5 percent, leaving it with net income of $7.8 billion according to company filings. Reverse engineering When it opened the Apple investigation in 2014, the Commission told the Irish government that tax rulings it agreed in 1991 and 2007 with the company amounted to state aid and might have broken EU laws. The Commission said the rulings were “reverse engineered” to ensure Apple had a minimal Irish bill and that minutes of meetings between Apple representatives and Irish tax officials showed the company’s tax treatment had been “motivated by employment considerations.” Apple employs 5,500, or about a quarter of its Europe-based staff, in the Irish city of Cork, where it is the largest private sector employer. It has said it paid Ireland’s 12.5 percent rate on all the income that it generates in the country. Ireland’s low corporate tax rate has been a cornerstone of economic policy for 20 years, drawing investors from multinational companies whose staff account for almost one in 10 workers in Ireland. – Agencies Share This article was published on 30/08/2016 Most Read A thank you letter to the terrorist Remembering the sacrifice Health charges for expats set to be increased Ethiopian expat thrown off second floor MoH fees on services for expats to rise by mid-Feb Sick camels slaughtered, meat sold to consumers Lawmakers ask govt to scrap power, fuel hikes Saudi online storm over reality ‘porn’ Do you know the code?

The deal that Brussels on Tuesday ruled illegal and ordered the tech giant to pay 13 billion euros in back taxes for is relatively simple despite the huge sums involved. - Double Irish - The European Union on August 30, 2016 orders Apple to pay a record 13 billion euros in back taxes in Ireland, saying deals allowing the US tech giant to pay almost no tax were illegal ©Justin Sullivan (Getty/AFP/File) The deal was made possible by two "tax rulings" in 1991 and 2007 granted by Ireland as it tried to make itself competitive in attracting international firms. The deals made it possible for companies to redistribute profits internally, and for whatever money was left to be taxed at a low rate of 12.5 percent. Ireland scrapped them in 2015. Apple first set up two companies incorporated in Ireland: Apple Sales International, which is in charge of selling the group's products in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and India; and Apple Operations Europe, a smaller firm which makes some kinds of hardware. All profits from Europe -- for example from an iPhone sold in London or Paris -- therefore go through Ireland. But under an agreement with the parent company in California, those two companies finance -- to the tune of at least two billion euros a year -- more than half of Apple's research into intellectual property worldwide. Under the Irish rules, those expenses can then be offset against Apple's profits from Europe. - Ghost HQ - The next step was to internally allocate most of the profits away from Ireland to a "head office" within Apple Sales International. The European Commission, however, said that this effectively did not exist. "The 'so called head office only existed on paper. It had no employees, no premises and no real activities," Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said on Tuesday. Its only real activity was occasional board meetings, the Commission said. - 0.005 percent tax - As a result, in 2011 Apple Sales International recorded $22 billion in profits but was only taxed in Ireland on $50 million, the Commission said, citing figures from US Senate hearings. By 2014 its profits had risen but the amount of tax paid did not, leading to an effective tax rate of 0.005 percent in 2014, the Commission said. Brussels said that while the tax rulings were "perfectly legal" in themselves, they amounted to illegal state aid when offered by Irish government to Apple to encourage its investment. Finally, the Commission added that while Ireland is expected to recover the tax, it may not get the whole 13 billion: if any other country is found to have made similar illegal state aid offers they may also be forced to claw back some of this overall amount.

Global perspective. advertisement European Commission orders Apple to pay billions to Ireland Tuesday 30 August 2016 at 10:13 AM ET by Miracle Jones ©  WikiMedia (Dweider) [JURIST] The European Commission [official website] ruled [press release] on Tuesday that Ireland may recover up to €13 billion from Apple [corporate website] after the company benefited from undue tax breaks. The commission ruled the tax breaks were illegal based on EU law because the tax benefit meant that Apple paid less taxes to operate in the country than other businesses, resulting in an unfair economic advantage. The ruling is the result of an investigation going back to June 2014 [case summary]. The investigation found that the structure [NYT backgrounder] of Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe was set up in a way that essentially allowed them not to pay taxes on their profits by allowing a head office that had no employees or daily business dealings to have responsibility for the profits. Member States cannot give tax benefits to selected companies—this is illegal under EU state aid rules. The Commission's investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years. In fact, this selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1 per cent on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005 per cent in 2014The actual amount of the recovery is still being determined based on the company's business dealings with other European entities. The ruling is another setback for the communications company, which continues to face multiple legal issues. The Beijing Municipal High People's Court ruled in May that Xintong Tiandi (XT), a local leather goods retailer, can continue to use the phrase "iPhone" on its leather goods in a trademark case [JURIST report]. The Beijing Intellectual Property Bureau ordered Apple to stop sale of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in Beijing due to claims by Chinese regulators that Apple Inc. violated a patent held by a Chinese company in June[JURIST report]. Apple agreed in July to a $25 million settlement with Network-1 Technologies to end a patent infringement claim [JURIST report].

Investment is needed for long-term economic growth. The blame for paltry economic growth, some argue, can be traced to high taxes on business that discourage investment. These high taxes, for example, are the reasons Apple's CEO is unwilling to pay billions of dollars in taxes owed the US government. (See Washington Examiner) But Apple's Tim Cook's sin is inversion, i.e. locating a company a lower tax country, then selling at cost (including expected profits) their product to the main branch in the US, and paying taxes (if any) on a sliver of profit. This way Apple avoids paying 35 percent to 40 percent tax on profits made abroad. Apple is not alone. In 2015, a number of profitable companies paid no taxes. According to USA Today, "27 giant profitable companies paid no taxes." This is not an aberration for in 2014 according CNBC, "20 big profitable US companies paid no taxes." Since the countries listed by USA Today, including Apple in the Washington Examiner, paid no taxes, why should they care about tax reform? Why should they be expected to pay any taxes if the tax rate were lowered from 35 percent to say 15 percent or 8.75 percent? I would like to think that paying nothing as they are doing now trumps paying any positive rate. Logic would suggest the companies that have been successful at avoiding paying taxes would be happy with the status quo. If lower tax rates can be expected to increase investment, then where are all the investments from zero taxes? Two points are worth making about investment. Point one: Investment depends on income and the interest rate. It is positively correlated with income, meaning that it moves in concert with the direction of income. When income rises, investment tends to rise, too. Inversely, when income falls investment falls. According to FRED (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis), has been trending upward for decades. In investment took a dip in Q3 2000 and bottomed out in Q4 2001. Then in Q2 2007 investment saw a steep plunge from roughly $2.7 billion to $1.8 billion in Q2 2009. (See FRED: Economic Research) The 2008 Great Recession explains this 33 percent retreat in gross private investment, implying a positive relationship between GDP and investment, alluded to earlier. For evidence, see the FRED chart below that shows the co-movement of investment and real GDP from 1947 to 2014. (Ibid.) One implication that flows from the positive correlation between investment and GDP at the macro level is that profit is income. Therefore, when a company earns growing profits, it is given thereby the wherewithal to invest in new plant and equipment and perhaps pay workers more. It does not matter that the government confiscates about half of profit is still income--half a loaf is better than no bread. Point two: The relationship between interest rates and investment is negative. Therefore, the current interest rate environment should be conducive to high levels of investment in the private sector. But that is not the case. Interest rates (1 year Treasury fell below one percent during the Q4 2008 to 0.49 percent. (See FRED) Since 2008 interest rates have remained below one percent--despite occasional rumblings by chairperson Janet Yellen promising higher rates. While low rates favor business that can borrow cheap money to meet their investment needs, they obviously hurt people who derive their income from interest earning assets. The expectation that low interest rates would increase investment have been frustrated because investment and income have been rising, the increases have not been as robust as might be expected. And it is possible interest rates have been so low they have no effect on investment. The US reputedly has the highest corporate tax rate among industrialized countries. The US statutory corporate tax rate is 35 percent. However, its effective corporate tax rate, what corporations really pay, is about 27.7 percent. There were five countries (in a study of 59 countries from 2006-2009) with higher effective corporate tax rates: Japan (38.8 percent, Morocco (33.9 percent), Italy (29.1 percent), Indonesia (28.1 percent), and Germany (27.9 percent). (See Business Round Table: Global Effective Tax Rates) One might argue the US outperforms these countries because of its lower effective corporate tax rate. But that would ignore the fact that 54 other countries with lower effective corporate rates under perform the US. Among these countries are Greece (25.2 percent), the UK (23.6 percent), France (23.1 percent), Italy (21.8 percent), and Venezuela (-3.4 percent). To argue that the high corporate tax rate in the US explains inversion, it follows that were the US corporate tax rates lowered, off-shore companies would rush their operations back to the US. The irony is despite the outflow of businesses to low tax havens, the US economy is doing better than her competitors--the EU is falling apart at the seams. Consider the brouhaha over the Greek bailout, and Brexit is the latest installation in a series of missteps. The US recovery from the Great Recession, while not robust, has been steady and sustained. One must conclude a low or even a negative effective corporate tax rate (as an investment driver) is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for economic growth. Suppose the statutory corporate tax rate is reduced by 20 percentage points, from 35 percent to 15 percent and there is a failure of investments to blossom, who or what would be blamed? Chances are stifling regulations, Dodd-Frank, the debt, and a host of other evils. Remember: a tax is just a slice on income (or profit) that is returned to the economy as spending. It is the rise in income that spurs investment as the two are entangled in a positive way. A tax receipt does not change the level of income from which it came. It merely redistributes it from private hands to Uncle Sam. - Advertisement - - Advertisement -   - Advertisement - View Ratings | Rate It Seymour Patterson received a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Oklahoma in 1980.

The EU wishes to take a bite out of Apple (Source: Getty) Alex Wild Most governments would love to get their hands on an extra €13bn (£11.1bn) from a multinational company. But the Irish government will likely be wrangling in court for many years at what will surely be considerable expense in a somewhat unusual bid to avoid collecting tax. The European Commission has ordered what is by far the largest recovery order in EU history by deciding that Ireland gave Apple tax benefits illegal under EU state aid rules. Essentially, it has concluded that two rulings by the Irish tax authorities, in 1991 and 2007, endorsed an allocation of profits within two of Apple’s Irish subsidiaries that had “no factual or economic justification”. The Commission believes these advantages were not available to all companies in Ireland. The Irish finance minister says an appeal is necessary to defend the integrity of the country’s tax system and provide certainty for businesses. Whatever the intricacies of EU tax law and whether the Commission’s conclusion is consistent with it, he certainly has a point. The Commission has been sticking its nose into the tax rulings of member states for three years in another of its characteristic, back-door power grabs. Tax harmonisation and the tax increases that inevitably follow have long been a goal of European federalists like Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. The ruling against Ireland yesterday and other recent ones against the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg have to be viewed through this prism. European federalists have long looked at Ireland's competitive tax system with envy (Source: Getty) But it’s not just the Irish government and Apple who are unhappy. Quite rightly, the US Treasury has pointed out that the Commission’s approach marks a significant expansion of the role of the EU’s Directorate-General for Competition. Rather than enforcing competition and state aid law under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Commission has morphed into a supranational tax authority, deciding whether member states’ rulings on transfer pricing are consistent with its view of the arm’s length principle. This view is derived from EU law, not the OECD’s Transfer Pricing Guidelines, something that is not consistent with the international consensus and raises questions as to the viability of bilateral tax treaties. Read more: Unleash Britain's competitive dynamo with even bigger corporation tax cuts Given that the profits the Commission has ordered to be taxed would have eventually been taxed in the US if and when they were repatriated by Apple, the move will also cost the IRS a substantial amount. When the UK eventually extricates itself from the EU, it will be better placed to avoid dangerous developments in the direction of EU tax harmonisation. Proposals for a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base have been on the agenda since 2011 and only last year German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande were pushing plans to introduce a minimum rate of corporation tax across the EU. It’s safe to say that any such rate would be closer to France’s 33 per cent or Germany’s 30-33 per cent rate than the UK’s 20 per cent. Remaining in the EU, Ireland will face increasing pressure from larger, more powerful member states to make itself a less attractive place to do business. In any case, Corporation Tax is obsolete, rendered so by the modern, globalised economy. There is no theoretical basis on which profits can be allocated across multiple jurisdictions when modern companies have such a wide variety of functions, customers and shareholders distributed around the world. Read more: Scrap corporation tax – but replace it with something better The OECD’s BEPS project and EU proposals for a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base will not change the fact that the underlying framework is redundant and, despite the pomp and ceremony surrounding them, will just lead to more complexity, bureaucracy and bigger fees for lawyers and accountants. The sooner politicians realise this and start taxing distributions from capital rather than profits, the sooner some integrity can be restored to the tax system.

The problem is a result of the phones’ bendability, which causes the touch controller chip’s soldering to crack eventually and start to lose contact with the board; a problem that's made worse through dropping and rough handling. As this happens, a flickering gray bar appears at the top of the iPhone and the screen starts becoming unresponsive, up to the point where it no longer registers touch. This same flexibility brought about the “bendgate” phenomenon. The issues led to Apple stiffening the next generation iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. Three plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against Apple over the weekend, alleging that the company knows about the design flaw but refuses to acknowledge or repair it, thereby violating several California consumer protection laws. All three plaintiffs purchased iPhones that eventually showed signs of Touch Disease. Apple refused to repair the devices; instead, it offered to replace them at a cost of more than $300. "Apple has long been aware of the defective iPhones," the complaint says. "Yet, notwithstanding its longstanding knowledge of this design defect, Apple routinely has refused to repair the iPhones without charge when the defect manifests.” The plaintiffs hope to elevate the case to “nationwide class” status to include anyone who bought an iPhone that suffered from Touch Disease. Todd Cleary of California, Jun Bai of Delaware and Thomas Davidson of Pennsylvania have also accused Apple of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment and breach of implied warranty. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages.

The European Commission’s three-year investigation into Apple’s sweetheart deal with Ireland has found it amounted to illegal state aid. Its damning report published today says the tech giant paid as little as 0.005 per cent tax by funnelling its non-US profits through its Irish headquarters with no staff or premises then on to its $178billion (£120bn) offshore fund. The giant tax bill, which could reach £16billion ($21 billion) because of interest, will not be difficult for the company to pay because it made $53.4billion (£35billion) last year – the biggest profit in corporate history. But Apple will appeal saying the Commission’s figures are ‘completely made-up’ and its CEO Tim Cook, who previously called the probe ‘political c**p’, is threatening EU job losses if they don’t back down. The US Treasury has also warned Brussels not to pursue American companies over tax avoidance – but McDonald’s, Google and Amazon could be next. Ireland has said it doesn’t want Apple’s money even though it is equivalent to £2,400 for each of its 4.5million residents and would cover the costs of its national health service for a year. Big bill: Apple, which has a base in Cork, pictured, must repay £11billion ($14.5bn) in unpaid tax because the EU says its sweetheart tax deal with Ireland amounted to state aid In the firing line: Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, pictured with Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta last week, has previously called the investigation ‘political c**p’ and has said his company will appeal against the ruling Irish question: Apple ploughs all its non-US sales through Ireland, where the EU says it has been paying hyper-low tax rates. The majority of profits are then sent offshore where no tax is paid, with some going to America for research and development . The Commission’s landmark report says that between 2003 and 2014 Apple paid a rock bottom Irish tax rate on most of its profits outside the US before sending it to a tax haven where it paid no tax at all. It has more than £120billion stashed in offshore accounts. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said: ‘Member states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies-this is illegal under EU state aid rules.’ The EU intervention is going to cause a huge row between Brussels and Washington over tax powers. The EC says Apple’s Irish arrangements allowed them to pay just 500 euros in tax on every one million euros they made. In 2011 Apple’s profits outside America were $22billion but Ireland agreed that only 50 million euros ($55million) was considered taxable. But Apple executives have now accused the Commission of doing the sums wrong in calculating the jaw-dropping £11billion ($14.5m) bill for unpaid tax. It said in a statement: ‘Apple follows the law and pays all of the taxes we owe wherever we operate. We will appeal and we are confident the decision will be overturned. ‘Apple warned of the ramifications for future investment in Europe, where it employs 22,000 people. ‘The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and up-end the international tax system in the process. ‘It will have a profound and harmful effect on investment and job creation in Europe’ The company’s chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, claimed the tech giant paid 400 million US dollars in tax in 2014 in Ireland. He claimed Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s assessment that Apple paid just 50 euro in tax for every one million euro it made that year was nonsense. He said: ‘It is a completely made-up number. We really believe that the impact of this decision will be devastating for the European economy.’ It is a completely made-up number. We really believe that the impact of this decision will be devastating for the European economy Apple’s chief financial officer Luca Maestri on the European Commission’s key tax calculations CEO Tim Cook posted a lengthy message on apple.com, warning about devastating ramifications for the sovereignty of European countries in light of the competition chief’s hard line. He said: In Ireland and in every country where we operate, Apple follows the law and we pay all the taxes we owe.’ Mr Cook accused Brussels of taking unprecedented action, with serious and wide-reaching complications. He said: ‘Beyond the obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe’.

Apple will not take a financial charge for the tax bill in its near-term results, and the fine may be placed in restricted cash but will not be immediately paid out,” Morningstar writes. “We expect both Apple and Ireland will appeal the ruling, and a final decision could take years.” “Apple has almost $215 billion in international cash on hand, so the record tax bill will make only a small dent in the firm’s cash cushion,” Morningstar writes. “Further, Apple indicated that the ruling will not have an effect on its long-term tax rate, presumably because its Irish tax structure in question was modified in 2015. Regardless, we continue to view Apple as fundamentally undervalued, and the company remains one of our best investment ideas in the tech sector.” Read more in the full article here.

If Ireland thought what they received in taxes was fair, and Apple paid it, it’s a done deal. The EU should sue Ireland to force them to bring their tax rates inline with the rest of the EU. Apple must not pay! Every government in the world will see that big target at the center of the Apple logo. This is just another reason publicly traded companies should not just sit on cash. They should pay 80% of the profits to shareholders. India, China, Russia, they will sue Apple as well. Pay the money out to shareholder, remove the target. Fight for laws that exempt the corporation from paying taxes if they pay out in dividends 80% or more in profits to shareholders. thetheloniousmac Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - 3:19 pm · Reply Arguably, by sitting on the cash they were ready for this money grab, knowing that it was coming. thetheloniousmac Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - 3:15 pm · Reply Hardly a day goes by in which we don’t see yet another example of why the Brits dumped the EU. This action against Apple is little more than organized theft. If the EU has a problem with the LEGAL deal made between Ireland and Apple, their issue should be with Ireland, not Apple. Apple should negotiate the fine down as much as possible, then stop shipments of new products to the EU, raise the prices of older products still on the shelves in the EU, and start shutting down operations in the EU. Let them use Windows and Android. Outside of a tax deal, Ireland has nothing special to offer Apple anyway. Not unless they grow a pair. Ireland should show enough strength of character to say this is our mess, And we will,handle all fines. In which case Apple could maintain their relationship with Ireland. If anyone from any other part of the EU wants Apple products they can go to Ireland or the UK to get them. critic2 Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - 9:10 pm · Reply You do realize that companies “sitting on cash” has absolutely nothing to do with a decision on whether they have a tax liability or not, and that even if the pay 80% of profits to shareholders, those profits are what’s left AFTER TAX. With the amount of cash flow that Apple generates, they are a target even if they were not carrying this much cash on the books. They can pay off this debt with one financial quarter worth of cash flow. critic2 Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - 9:15 pm · Reply Sorry, meant to put this comment in reply to BOB therealspike Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - 3:15 pm · Reply EU playing big brother.

They are saying that since one of our member states made a deal we don’t like, we’re going to charge you, Apple, twice your quarterly profits for the last quarter. macnificentseven48 Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - 4:04 pm · Reply “Apple’s share price could double and it would still be undervalued.” That’s absolutely ridiculous. Apple could go up $10 today and short-selling will be called for tomorrow. Apple has become one of the crappiest tech investments around and it’s unlikely anything short of a miracle will change that. I’m willing to bet every tech company will soar and Apple will be stuck in six feet of mud. Tim Cook is the (bad luck) albatross of Apple. Nothing good will come from him. He’d better stick to his diverse emojis because the EU is going to pick Apple’s bones clean. Buster Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - 4:04 pm · Reply Ireland should simply reign in the EC by telling them to take a long walk off a short pier. If they do not want the money then let them not cash the cheque. If not then any country in the EU will have a bunch of centralized commissioners dictating any countries tax laws. So much for financial and eroding cultural independence. Observer Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - 4:17 pm · Reply Again, someone should have read the fine print before joining the union. Who knows if Ireland did and thought that they could continue their tax laws as they always have or did the EU put in that they had to change and no one was paying attention. At this point the EU thinks they can force this and Ireland thinks they have the right to continue as they always have. I don’t see how Apple has any issue here. They were only doing as they were told and have done since 1980. Add Your Feedback Name (required) Email (required) Web cancel reply Notify me of new comments via email.

Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images There has been widespread criticism in the US of the European Commission's ruling that Apple should pay up to €13bn (£11bn) in back taxes. The US Treasury said that such tax investigations were "unfair" and undermined the tax rules of individual states. Charles Schumer, a senior Democrat senator, called the move a "cheap money grab". The White House said the ruling could cost US taxpayers. White House spokesman Josh Earnest argued that if Apple paid the back taxes, it might offset that amount against tax due in the United States, which would be unfair for American taxpayers. Apple faces €13bn Irish tax bill Apple reaction: Live updates Apple tax ruling 'a serious blow' Rory Cellan-Jones: EU takes on Apple, Ireland and the US 'Illegal state aid' Earlier the European Commission said Ireland had enabled Apple to pay substantially less than other businesses, in effect paying a corporate tax rate of no more than 1%. Ireland and Apple both said they disagreed with the record penalty and would appeal against it. "Member states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies - this is illegal under EU state aid rules," said Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager. The standard rate of Irish corporate tax is 12.5%. The Commissions's investigation concluded that Apple had effectively paid 1% tax on its European profits in 2003 and about 0.005% in 2014. Ms Vestager said that the tax agreement reached between Ireland and Apple meant that the company's taxable profits "did not correspond to economic reality". Media captionMs Vestager said the Irish tax system "allowed profits to be attributed to a head office that only existed on paper." 'Grabbing revenue' The US Treasury said: "We believe that retroactive tax assessments by the Commission are unfair, contrary to well-established legal principles, and call into question the tax rules of individual member states." Last week the Treasury warned that the European Commission was in danger of becoming a "supranational tax authority". Charles Schumer, one of the highest-ranking Democratic senators, said: "This is a cheap money grab by the European Commission, targeting US businesses and the US tax base. " "By forcing their member states to retroactively impose taxes on US companies, the EU is unfairly undermining our ability to compete economically in Europe while grabbing tax revenues that should go toward investment here in the United States," he said. 'Profound' effect Apple said the decision would be harmful for jobs. "The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple's history in Europe, ignore Ireland's tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process," the company said. "The Commission's case is not about how much Apple pays in taxes, it's about which government collects the money. It will have a profound and harmful effect on investment and job creation in Europe. "Apple follows the law and pays all of the taxes we owe wherever we operate. We will appeal and we are confident the decision will be overturned." Media captionNobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz says the EU is telling big corporations: "We can get you" The Irish government held a similar view, with finance minister Michael Noonan saying: "I disagree profoundly with the Commission." He added: "The decision leaves me with no choice but to seek cabinet approval to appeal. This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation." However, the record tax bill should not be a problem for Apple, which made a net profit of $53bn in the 2015 financial year. Apple is not the only company that has been targeted for securing favourable tax deals in the European Union. Last year, the commission told the Netherlands to recover as much as €30m (£25.6m) from Starbucks, while Luxembourg was ordered to claw back a similar amount from Fiat. Apple and Ireland €13bn demanded in back taxes. Equal to: ALL of Ireland's healthcare budget 66% of its social welfare bill 15 million iPhones 27% of Apple's 2015 profit Sources: Apple, HSE, Dept of Social Protection Getty Analysis: Dominic O'Connell, Today business presenter The current focus is on the size of the bill, but there are even larger issues at stake, including one fundamental question - who really runs the world, governments or giant corporations? At present, it is difficult to tell. Individual governments appear impotent in their attempts to apply their tax laws to multinationals like Apple. They have systems designed to deal with the movement and sale of physical goods, systems that are useless when companies derive their profits from the sale of services and the exploitation of intellectual property. In Apple's case, 90% of its foreign profits are legally channelled to Ireland, and then to subsidiaries which have no tax residence. At the same time, countries can scarcely afford not to co-operate when Apple comes calling; it has a stock market value of $600bn, and the attraction of the jobs it can create and the extra inward investment its favours can bring are too much for most politicians to resist. The European Commission's attempt to bring Apple to heel is on the surface about tax, but in the end about the power of the multinational and the power of the state. There is more to come; Margrethe Vestager, the Danish commissioner who is leading the charge against Apple, is warming up to take on Google.

What we don’t know is how Apple plans to tackle the lack of one moving forward. Will it be offering an adapter for standard wired headphones to plug into the Lightning port? Or will the company take the wireless approach and tell everyone to buy Beats? A leak on Tuesday (via 9to5Mac) suggests Apple could make wireless earphones, dubbed AirPods, available after all. The latest hint comes from Russian trademark filings published to the Eurasian Economic Commission earlier this week. These documents mention the wireless AirPods headphones by name. See also: iPhone 7 officially coming on September 7 If Apple is preparing such a solution, it’ll be interesting to see whether they’ll be bundled in with new iPhone 7 handsets or whether they’ll be sold as a standalone accessory. Given Apple is pushing a change that would make it difficult for fans to use their primary headphones, perhaps it would be a nice gesture to bundle these in? This long-running saga will come to an end on September 7 when Apple announces the iPhone 7 handsets. Whichever solution Apple decides upon we’re pretty sure the stock headphones will sound just as good as they always have. Which for those with a sarcasm by-pass means not very good at all.

More like this Update: Apple must repay $14.5B in underpaid taxes in Ireland Ireland to Europe: No, Apple doesn't owe us Apple's Cook calls European tax ruling 'total political crap' Video Tech Forecast 2017: Hiring, budgets, disruptive tech and more The White House today said it was worried that American taxpayers would pay for the European Union's decision to force Apple to pay more than $14 billion in back taxes. "It's also possible that the kinds of payments that are contemplated by the EU decision today, at the end of the day, are merely a transfer of revenue from U.S. taxpayers to the EU," said White House spokesman Josh Earnest in a Tuesday press briefing. "That's the crux of our concerns about this [unilateral] approach." If Apple was required to pay billions in back taxes to Ireland, it could then deduct those payments from what it owes to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), either retroactively or in future returns. Those deductions, in turn, would reduce Apple's tax bill to the U.S. government, lowering the amount collected by the IRS. Theoretically, that would mean U.S. taxpayers would have to make up the difference, or the government would simply have to go without those monies. "The consequences for that transfer [are] that it could be treated in the U.S. tax system as a current tax payment that would allow, essentially, Apple to deduct that EU tax payment from their U.S. taxes," Earnest added as he answered a reporter's question. "That wouldn't be fair to U.S. taxpayers." According to European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, Ireland -- an EU member -- must recover $14.5 billion (€13 billion) in back taxes for the years 2003 to 2014. Ireland, however, has indicated it will appeal the ruling. Apple has also said it plans to appeal. In the meantime, however, it will almost certainly be required to place a large amount -- Ireland was told by the EU to determine that amount -- in an escrow account. Although Apple CEO Tim Cook didn't voice the same concerns as did the White House, he came close. "At its root, the Commission's case is not about how much Apple pays in taxes," Cook wrote in an open letter published on the firm's website. "It is about which government collects the money."

The earlier Belkin Charge Dock had the same functionality as this new dock — both docks can charge an Apple Watch and Lightning-based iPhone simultaneously. Both have a built-in, moveable Lightning connector and charging puck. Both docks use their own AC adapter to supply power — 2.4 A to iPhone and 1A to Apple Watch simultaneously for full speed charging. And both docks have a small dial to raise and lower the height of the Lightning connector to adjust for different iPhone case sizes. The biggest differences between the two Belkin docks are seen in the materials, and the corresponding price tags. Whereas the Belkin (Valet) Charge Dock features an aluminum base and chrome-finished arm, PowerHouse is made of a soft-touch rubber and white plastic — the rubber seen on the front of the dock also covers the bottom of the base to prevent scuffing. The new PowerHouse dock still feels substantial, though, with a weight comparable to Charge Dock, clocking in at slightly more than a pound. But the overall footprint is smaller as PowerHouse measures 3.8” x 3.25” x 3.6”, with the arm’s length measuring 5” wide. While the older Charge Dock has a more premium look, it’s also $30 more expensive than the PowerHouse. We appreciate the clean, simple look of PowerHouse, and some users may prefer its design to the Charge Dock. Using PowerHouse is simple. The dial easily allows users to adjust to various iPhone cases, and we didn’t have an issue with any of the cases or iPhone sizes we tested. An Apple Watch is easily docked on the built-in charging puck, as well. Although it’s possible to activate Nightstand mode if you place an Apple Watch strap behind the docked iPhone, the dock clearly isn’t designed for that use. It’s nice that Belkin offers a complete docking solution with power, so no extra cables are necessary. There’s little difference between PowerHouse and Belkin’s prior (Valet) Charge Dock. But PowerHouse saves you $30 without losing any functionality. While some would rather pony up for the aluminum-and-chrome look of the other dock, PowerHouse is no slouch in the design department, either. It’s a matter of preference, but we give PowerHouse the slight edge, based on price. Comments Why not an A- over the B+?

Touch Disease is a condition prone to Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus where the screen becomes unresponsive to touch. The Inquisitr reported last week that the problem is caused when two chips that control the screen come loose from the logic board. The gap created causes intermittent issues with the display’s ability to detect touch. As the gap continues to widen, the problem progressively worsens until the screen stops responding altogether. The defect occurs exclusively in iPhone 6 models (except for the 6S series), reported iFixIt. Touch Disease happens when the logic board housing the screen control chips flexes. For example, if one were to carry an iPhone 6 in the back pocket and then sit on it, the screen’s circuitry will experience small amounts of flexing. Over time this breaks the solder holding the chips to the logic board and the phone experiences the symptoms of Touch Disease. According to iFixIt and other phone repair experts, the deficiency is not one that is hard to prevent. The flaw stems from Apple’s failure to reinforce the circuitry with underfill or by any other means. PROTO TYPE & PRODUCTION FPC & Rigid (Flex & Rigid Printed Circuit Boards), PCB ASSEMBLYhttps://t.co/efaskyVExO pic.twitter.com/Z4YnNpNKxh — Synergise PCB (@synergisepcb12) August 27, 2016 Some repair shops are seeing as many as 100 cases of Touch Disease per month. The reason third-party repair houses are seeing so much business is that Apple has refused to address the problem. Customers are reporting that when taking the non-functional phones to Apple Stores, they are told that the repair is too expensive if the phone is out of warranty, which is the case with most phones having the problem. Instead, Genius technicians suggest purchasing a new iPhone. iFixIt states that while replacing the entire logic board can be quite expensive, micro soldering new chips onto the old board is much cheaper, which is why independent repair facilities have been getting so much business. According to the Inquisitr article, repair tech Louis Rossmann predicted that Apple would not take action on the matter until forced. Rossmann points to several instances with past Apple products where the company took no action until being inundated with bad press or class-action lawsuits. Based on the company’s track record on such issues Rossmann predicted, “Apple is going to get a class-action lawsuit against them [once enough people are angry], and then they will release an extended warranty program.” It appears that his prediction is coming true. Reuters reports that a class-action lawsuit against the company was filed on Saturday over the iPhone 6 Touch Disease defect. “Todd Cleary of California, Jun Bai of Delaware and Thomas Davidson of Pennsylvania are the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which accuses Apple of fraud and violating California consumer protection laws. They seek unspecified damages.” iPhone owners sue Apple over 'Touch Disease': https://t.co/fPDq21iepN pic.twitter.com/M789iAxQII — Mashable (@mashable) August 30, 2016 The lawsuit has been filed with a federal court in San Jose, California and states, “The iPhones are not fit for the purpose of use as smartphones because of the touchscreen defect.” Apple has declined to comment, so it is unknown whether the company will fulfill the rest of Rossmann’s prediction. However, considering that 166.4 million units have sold in this fiscal year, the room for growth in this lawsuit is huge. It is highly likely that Apple will settle the dispute with something such as an extended warranty program as Louis suggested. Depending on the outcome of the case, all iPhone 6 owners may be entitled to compensation. Even users who have not experienced Touch Disease may be able to claim an extended warranty if that is what Apple offers in the settlement. In the past, Apple has handed out extended warranties that were honored for up to five years after a purchase of the faulty product. Louis Rossmann stated that in 2011, 20,000 Macbook Pro owners filed a class action lawsuit against Apple for a graphics card defect that the company denied existed. The tech giant settled the lawsuit in 2014 by extending the warranty of the 2011 Macbook Pro through the end of 2016. According to a class action lawsuit, #Apple held back the issues with its 2011 #MacBook Pro: http://t.co/9dxEBa8GDx pic.twitter.com/N407Dn4FiI — TweakTown (@TweakTown) January 19, 2015 If a similar settlement to this lawsuit is reached, this could significantly increase the lifespan of recently purchased iPhone 6 and 6 Pluses as it would also cover issues unrelated to Touch Disease. However, it is unlikely that Apple will extend the warranty to five years for the defective iPhones since smartphones have a much shorter lifespan than laptop computers. A three-year extension seems more likely in this case. All iPhone 6 series users should keep an eye on this lawsuit as it develops. If your iPhone already has Touch Disease, and you cannot wait for a settlement, hang on to the phone. You can always cash in on the settlement and then sell or give it away.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Saturday January 7, 2017 News National Larger / SmallerNight Mode Stars of entertainment and sport frequent two Sydney brothels Eamonn Duff 25 May 2014, 10:02 a.m. Dozens of famous names are among hundreds of people who have been revealed as clients at two Sydney brothels in a stash of supposedly confidential business files. Stars of entertainment and sport frequent two Sydney brothels Clients revealed: Golden Apple Brothel in Kings Cross, left, and Liasons Brothel in Edgecliff. Photo: Steve Lunam Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Brothels ignored warning on neurosurgeon Codes used to hide drug sales Candy Club not so sweet Dozens of famous names are among hundreds of people who have been revealed as clients at two Sydney brothels in a stash of supposedly confidential business files. The documents, viewed by The Sun-Herald, contain photocopies of credit cards, driver's licences and payment consent forms exposing men and women who have paid for sexual services at Liaisons in Edgecliff or the Golden Apple, in Darlinghurst Road, Kings Cross. The customers include many celebrities of music, film and television, leading corporate figures, sports personalities including NRL players past and present and two prominent horse racing identities. Doctors, lawyers, school principals, consulate officials, diplomats, bankers, artists and suburban real estate agents are also in the files. The unprecedented nature of the documents offers a unique glimpse into the seedy world of commercial sex at two of Australia's top brothels, both of which are the subject of a bitter ownership dispute in the NSW Supreme Court between two former best friends turned enemies. In one corner is Mark Paul Gray, owner of both parlours, who is proposing a $21 million apartment complex on the land Liaisons occupies. In the opposite corner is Hugh James Bond, who is claiming a 50 per cent slice of the sex empire after allegedly helping to launch it two decades ago, with a $65,000 half-share payment in former Melbourne sex parlour The Candy Club. After that business was sold, Mr Gray successfully bought and sold many other brothels and escort businesses using the men's initial $130,000. According to Mr Bond's statement of claim, that wheeling and dealing was ''conducted on the same terms and conditions as the Candy Club''. Aside from disclosing the identities of so many customers, the leaked documents also lift the lid on how much is at stake between the warring men. Company tax returns reveal the brothels collectively reaped more than $2.7 million in revenue in 2011. With both men concealing shady pasts, the feud could turn ugly in court should a settlement not be reached. Mark Gray changed his name from Mark Gdanski and he is the brother of prominent Melbourne lawyer and former St Kilda AFL club director John Gdanski. Under his original name, his brothel licence was revoked in Victoria for employing an under-age prostitute. Mr Bond has a string of drug convictions, bail breaches and apprehended violence orders and is pursuing the claim when he is unemployed and surviving on loans and handouts from friends, according to court proceedings. But while the dispute may ultimately hinge on one solitary screwed-up note that both men once signed, attention has suddenly diverted to the many thousands of pages carrying hundreds of client signatures from across Australia and overseas, who paid for sex at Mr Gray's parlours between 2008 and 2011. The Sun-Herald can reveal that over the past decade Liaisons and the Golden Apple have protected the identity of all its customers by using two fictitious eastern suburbs restaurant names as the corporate entities that appear on credit card receipts and bank statements. During 2009, one internationally renowned married Australian actor twice visited the Golden Apple, using his personal credit card on both occasions. It was a similar story for a high-profile music industry figure who, around the same period, enjoyed an $1800 two-hour hotel sex session with ''Honey'', then spent another $920 on an escort known as ''Sierra''. In 2008, a well-known married chief executive spent $500 on a Golden Apple call girl - with a receptionist's note attached to the brothel receipt explaining how he had declined to show his identification, only to then provide his credit card, signature and address. Detailed analysis of the records indicate that while some men, including one well-known television network identity, visit brothels for a six-monthly or annual fix, others are regular users. One prominent Sydney businessman, whose financial records have previously come under scrutiny at the Independent Commission Against Corruption, spent $14,560 at Liaisons during July 2009. However, that figure tells only a fraction of the story. Over three years, the same individual returned on a monthly basis, to either Liaisons or the Golden Apple, booking the same initial $1600 service which then spiralled into many thousands more. The files also show women were prepared to pay up to $1000 for an intimate female experience. In January 2009, one senior business executive spent $835 on a private session that was 30 minutes long while another interstate woman forked out $990. Not everyone, however, leaves with a happy ending: a scribbled receptionist's note during 2010 reveals how one man demanded - and received - a $615 refund at Liaisons after the women on duty failed to live up to his expectations. with Ellen Fitzgerald The story Stars of entertainment and sport frequent two Sydney brothels first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

It just (barely) sticks to the watch and charges it. If you want something as fancy as the Apple Watch itself to charge it, you want the LIFT charger. The inductive charger comes with a floating battery which charges the watch while it levitates above its base. Since it has an internal battery, you can take that section with you on the go to charge your watch when away from home. When you aren’t charging your watch, you can put an optional Orb on the charge base and get a lamp that floats in the air too. The LIFT will also charge the last two generations of Pebble watches. LIFT is currently raising production funds on Kickstarter and has already blown through its funding goal with more than 3 weeks remaining. You can get the LIFT base and charger for the watch for $159(USD) or more. If you want the watch charger and the orb lamp, you will need to cough up $219 or more with shipping in October 2016.

Apple Sued Over “Touch Disease” Flaw In iPhone 6 Devices Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple Sued Over “Touch Disease” Flaw In iPhone 6 Devices August 30, 2016 2:24 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler No Surprises Here iphone apple lawsuit class action flaw touchscreen Touch Disease iphone 6 iphone 6 plus It was really only a matter of time: owners of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices affected by the so-called “touch disease” have sued Apple over a supposed flaw that leads touchscreens to become unresponsive, essentially rendering the devices useless. The proposed class-action lawsuit [PDF], filed Saturday in U.S. District Court for Northern California, accuses Apple of fraud and violating California consumer protection laws, claiming the tech giant concealed the defect and hasn’t done anything to address the problem. According to the lawsuit, the issue, which surfaces after a flickering gray bar appears atop the touchscreen, is the result of Apple’s decision not to use a metal “shield” to protect chips that control the touchscreen. These two chips translate your finger pressure into information the phone can use, iFixit reported about the flaw last week. When the chips go bad, they don’t register even the most forceful touch. The lawsuit claims that Apple previously used a metal shield to protect the chips in earlier iPhone models, but chose not to with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.   The lack of protection makes the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus “substantially less durable to foreseeable and reasonable use by consumers and ultimately causes the touchscreen defect.” Had owners known about the defect or Apple addressed the issue previously, the plaintiffs say these people might not have made the purchase or would have paid substantially less for the devices. Fixing the issue isn’t easy for customers either, the suit — filed on behalf of two Pennsylvania and Delaware residents — alleges. For one thing, according to the complaint, Apple has reportedly refused to fix the problem when customers bring in affected phones. Both claimed to have taken their affected phones to an Apple store or contacted Apple Care for repairs related to “touch disease.” Each say they were told by Apple that they would need to pay more than $300 for a replacement iPhone. “Many other iPhone owners have communicated with Apple’s employees and agents to request that Apple remedy and/or address the Touchscreen Defect and/or resultant damage at no expense,” the complaint states. “Apple has failed and/or refused to do so.” iFixit reports that only third-party repair techs can replace the chips, as Apple repair Geniuses aren’t allowed to make specialized repairs to logic boards. “As a result of Apple’s unfair, deceptive and/or fraudulent business practices, owners of the iPhones, including Plaintiffs, have suffered an ascertainable loss of money and/or property and/or value,” the case states. “The unfair and deceptive trade practices committed by Apple were conducted in a manner giving rise to substantial aggravating circumstances.” The suit seeks unspecified damages and an order that requires Apple to repair, recall, and/or replace affected iPhones and to extend the warranties of those devices for a reasonable period of time.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson BRUSSELS/DUBLIN – The European Commission ordered Apple Inc. to pay Ireland unpaid taxes of up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) on Tuesday as it ruled the firm had received illegal state aid. Apple and Dublin said the U.S. company’s tax treatment was in line with Irish and European Union law and they would appeal the ruling, which is part of a drive against what the EU says are sweetheart tax deals that usually smaller states in the bloc offer multinational companies to lure jobs and investment. The U.S. feels its firms are being targeted by the EU and a U.S. Treasury spokesperson warned the move threatens to undermine U.S. investment in Europe and “the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU”. Starbucks Corp has been ordered to pay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) to the Dutch state, while Amazon.com Inc and McDonald’s Corp are also under investigation by the Commission, the EU’s executive arm. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager questioned how anyone might think an arrangement that allowed Apple to pay a tax rate of 0.005 percent, as Apple’s main Irish unit did in 2014, was fair. “Tax rulings granted by Ireland have artificially reduced Apple’s tax burden for over two decades, in breach of the EU state aid rules. Apple now has to repay the benefits,” Vestager told a news conference. Analysts said the size of the claim underlined the Commission’s aggressive stance, but since each case involves different circumstances and tax rules, lawyers said it was hard to see if further big claims were any more or less likely. Apple, which had more than $200 billion in cash and readily marketable securities at the end of June, is likely to see the case drag out for years in EU and possibly Irish courts. “ARTIFICIAL” ARRANGEMENT The EU’s ruling challenges the way that Ireland agreed to tax the profits of Irish registered Apple subsidiaries, through which most of its non-U.S. profits flowed.

Ireland supports Apple, challenges EU order to recoup €13b in 'illegal' tax benefits Chris Keall Wednesday August 31, 2016 43 Share Apple CEO Tim Cook Related audio: Spark boss Simon Moutter says multinational profit-shifting problem will get worse (June 28) Play Log in or subscribe to listen to audio. Pause Add to MyNBR Radio 0 0:00 0:10 Play NBR radio on Should New Zealand move quickly to crackdown on profit-shifting by multinationals? Yes 89% No 11% Total votes: 196 In a landmark ruling, the European Commission has ordered Ireland to recoup what it says are €13 billion ($NZ20 billion) in illegal tax benefits extended to Apple. Apple chief executive Tim Cook responded in an open letter to customers: "In Ireland and in every country where we operate, Apple follows the law and we pay all the taxes we owe." However, the EU says Irish tax law falls foul of its rules, specifically with tax rulings in 1991 and 2007 that it says gave Apple selective treatment.  While €13 billion (or €4300 per citizen) might seem like a major windfall for Ireland, its government is eyeing closer relationships with US corporates as one way to compensate for the economic challenges posed by the Brexit vote – and its infamously low corporate tax is one way to woo them. Finance Minister Michael Noonan says, “I disagree profoundly with the commission’s decision." Mr Noonan is seeking permission from the cabinet to appeal the EU's decision and "defend the integrity of our tax system.” Brandishing his iPhone in front of media, the finance minister pointed to "Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China" message on the back. His government was not responsible for taxing revenue from either operation, he said. In a statement to investors, Apple says it will also appeal. It adds, "While we desire a resolution as soon as possible, the process will likely take several years." The company says it will place an unspecified amount of cash in escrow in the meantime. Cash mountain Apple could easily afford to pay the €13 billion. The US-based company makes a net profit of  $US8-10 billion a quarter, has $US212 billion in cash and short-term investments, much of it held outside the US (Mr Cook says his company would lose around 40% it attempted to repatriate the funds. Moody's estimates US corporates are now sitting on a $US1.6 trillion tax horde with just five tech companies – Apple, Google, Microsoft, Cisco and Larry Ellison's Oracle accounting for a third of that total). In a statement, EU commissioner Margrethe Vestager says the 1991 and 2007 Irish tax rulings “substantially and artificially” lowered the tax paid by Apple, giving the company a “significant advantage” over other businesses subject to the same national taxation rules. “Member states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies – this is illegal under EU state aid rules,” Ms Vestager said. “The commission’s investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years. “In fact, this selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1% on its European profits in 2003, down to 0.005% in 2014.” Apple responds In his open letter, Mr Cook says his company employs 6000 people in Ireland and has "helped create and sustain more than 1.5 million jobs across Europe" including jobs with suppliers, and third-party software developers who create apps. The 6000 are mostly employed at an Apple manufacturing plant in Cork, which most see as the "reward" for company's virtually-no-tax deal with the Irish government.  Ms Vestager's statement paints a different picture, saying Apple's “so-called” head office in Ireland has “no employees, no premises and no real activities." Both statements are true, reflecting the fact Apple has set up two subsidiaries in Ireland; one for its factory, the other for its "headquarters".  Test case The appeal mounted by Apple and the Irish government's appeal will serve as a key case. US tech companies have long booked revenue from around the world to fully-owned subsidiaries in Ireland. In recent years, Facebook, Google (which now charges to Singapore) and Twitter have been among those who have openly invoiced New Zealand customers to subsidiaries in Ireland and paid tiny amounts of tax here, while Vodafone NZ has minimised its local tax exposure by borrowing large amounts from its UK parent at a robust interest rate. While conservative governments in the UK and Australia have instituted so-called "Google tax" unilateral measures to crack down on revenue and profit-shifting by multinationals, New Zealand's government says it prefers to wait for a multi-country action being coordinated by the OECD, which has been under way for several years and could see changes from July next year. Apple shares [NAS:AAPL] fell around 2% as the market opened, but as investors digested the news that the Irish government would challenge the ruling, the stock recovered and, in late trading, it was down just 0.73%. Margrethe Vestager spells out the case against Apple & its $NZ20b tax bill. More + reaction: https://t.co/8JWEO9VVhv pic.twitter.com/iJfZYDuyvg — NBR (@TheNBR) August 30, 2016   POSTSCRIPT: Apple's New Zealand tax bill Its latest public accounts for its New Zealand operations detail that Apple paid $8.9 million or 50.28% of its $17.7 million profit in tax for the 12 months to September 26, 2015. Revenue rose 29% to $732 million. Purchase of hardware inventory from its US parent was easily the largest single cost for Apple's NZ business (run out of Sydney, with no staff on the ground here; distribution is handled by Ingram Micro). Was Apple's New Zealand profit kept low by charging to offshore subsidiaries? Hard to tell.  The accounts don't detail the level of iTunes and AppStore purchases from New Zealand, or where that revenue was invoiced.

Corporates seem to think it appropriate to pay virtually nothing in tax while their 'host' nations in which they make their sales provide all the infrastructure, the cost of property rights and the cost of the rule of law for free to them. Meanwhile the humble taxpayer has to carry an increasing share of the tax that the corporates have avoided. By the way it is not the Irish who should be receiving the back taxes - it is the various EU nations in which Apple sold its products in the first place, before shipping the proceeds offshore to Ireland. Reply Share Share   3 0 by Ricardo 4 months ago in reply to King of the whiners I'm currently here in the UK while this is playing out. Very simply the Irish government did a deal with Apple, virtually zero tax ( in fact 0.005%) in exchange for plant creation and jobs. If Ireland were not in the EU, there would have been no problem. But being in the EU, other countries who did not get the jobs for tax deal saw it as unfair to them, pretty much the core of the battle. In the interests of fairness and to stop under the table deals, the EU now wants Apple to pay fair tax. The Irish, who made the deal say no. Is this another nail n the EU coffin, who knows.

Back then Apple was a modest-sized computer company, in fact, you could argue it was struggling and almost on the rocks. And now the EU wants to rewrite history as does a number of New Zealanders going by the number of uninformed comments posted to this article.

I congratulate the EU of taking on this challenge, to bring back the integrity of the tax system. User pays, and Apple expect roads, infrastructure, education, health and welfare of the society to be maintained. Well guess what, this comes at a cost and a 0.005% tax rate doesn't cover it. Multi nationals export their profits, and have an unfair advantage over local business who pay their fair share of taxes. Ireland (politicians) were only fooling themselves this game of numbers was going to last. Lets hope to the EU achieve success; especially on the retrospective claw back, and bring back a level playing field and more fairness and equity to wider society.

Reply Share Share   0 0 by James 4 months ago in reply to Richard S I'm sorry, but how is the EU dictating to Ireland how it should manage its tax system "bringing back the integrity of the tax system"? The tax system's integrity is predicated on being what the demos has voted for - that is the reason for being a democracy. In this case the demos wanted a business friendly system as it provided much needed inward investment and jobs. They also felt that it was right that the economic activity taking place in Ireland was taxable in Ireland but the economic activity taking place elsewhere isn't; which seems like a sensible approach to me. Reply Share Share   0 0 #2 by James 4 months ago Most of the analysis that I've seen on this make it sound like Apple was dodging taxes that were legally due, which is why it is on the hook for so much money. Isn't the reality though that they asked Ireland what was legally due, Ireland said $X and they paid $X - exactly what they should have paid. Now the EU has come along and said that Ireland's law was incompatible with EU laws and as such they need to retrospectively change it and thus Apple has a massive tax bill. This should be a warning to all overseas companies looking to invest in the EU; even if you are abiding by the law as it stands the EU can decide that they don't like it and change it upon you. There doesn't seem any reason that this is limited to tax law - what about environmental law, employment law (your minimum wage is too low so now you owe every employee that has worked for you more money). As soon as you get lawmakers creating laws retrospectively you need to seriously worry about investing money anywhere near them, It is this sort of behaviour that demonstrates why we need ISDS in every trade treaty.

They should be fairly contributing to that. While I agree it seems harsh to change the tax rules in retrospect, I am sure Apple lobbied fairly heavily for the favourable tax treatment and Apple also should have used their army of tax lawyers to ensure they were in compliance with EU tax law in the first place.

The tax awaits payment, it is just a question of where it is paid From Apple "We have previously accrued U.S. taxes related to the income in question.

As Apple notes, it will put a (yet-to-be-determined) amount of cash in escrow. Agree with Apple's statement that the appeal process will take several years. Reply Share Share   0 0 by James 4 months ago in reply to Chris Keall - NBR Technology Editor | Head of Digital  Assuming that this goes to appeal, the appeal fails and the tax is payable then it will ultimately, be a hit to the US exchequer, rather than to Apple as the Irish tax rate is considerably lower than the US one. The US taxes all profits made worldwide by a US headquartered business, with a credit for foreign taxes paid. They do, however, only levy this tax when the profits are repatriated (which is a feature rather than a bug - the US wants its multinationals to expand overseas - so encourages them to reinvest their profits overseas). Ultimately though the profits will come back to the US, so, if the tax is paid, then Apple will get a credit for this Irish tax paid from the US tax that it will have to pay upon repatriation of those profits.

It enters into a tax agreement with a sovereign nation, Ireland, in full accordance with Irish laws, and with Ireland's blessing and then many, many years later an unelected EU official in Brussels says no no, we don't like that. Ireland that is all wrong. And the penalty, Apple you must pay Ireland US$15 billion even though you did what Ireland asked you to do in the first place, and they actually don't want the money! Oy vey. What company can do business like that? No wonder Britain voted for Brexit. Theresa May must be beaming like a Chesire cat in Downing street not believing her luck. Reply Share Share   2 0 #11 by Vince Schicker 4 months ago An excellent ruling, NBR readers might recall that Just a few months ago it was big news that we have the same problem in NZ in that a handful of large US ("origin") companies selling into NZ paying very little in tax in NZ relative to sales (I recall the figures were something like $100k tax paid in NZ on $1bn of sales which will become less under TPP I bet !) . The profits are declared in havens outside the US and reinvested into the corporate as loans to fund acquisition and growth ( Australia's BHP has been doing this - read NBR). All over the world too many large international corporations are not paying their fair share as they are able to take advantage of tax advantages set up by increasingly desperate Governments run by bought and paid for politicians trying to attract employers, and here in NZ we think having a company car is an unreasonable perk justifying a special tax - the tax laws are there for the workers not the wealthy. The tax advantages available to international corp orates are patently unfair, they only serve to impoverish private tax payers around the globe. Govts. are being played off against each other internationally to vie for their favor. Corporate greed is why real personal incomes are falling and economies are stagnating world wide, rich corp orates get richer and the the rest of us increasingly unable to afford the basics such as raise a family let alone by the corp orates products. Middle classes around the world are under increasing pressure as they are required to pay an increasing share of the cost of running their countries relative to business as business becomes increasingly foreign owned, tax bases are shrinking yet the cost of providing services to the citizens continue to increase. The current state of affairs is not sustainable. Across the globe wealth is accumulating in the hands of too few. I am more capitalist than socialist however it is apparent the international corporate model is failing us all. I doubt the corp orates pay much tax in their jurisdictions of "origin" ( as opposed to current tax residence), but I am sure they find enough to fund lobbying and pay contributions to parties that look after their interests. International corp orates typically headquarter themselves in tax free jurisdictions with the assistance of a bought and paid for political elite. It is no surprise why US voters are looking seriously at Mr Trump, they know more of the same isnt the answer. The corp orates and super wealthy own the game (and probably always have but more so now then before) the people of the US know this, they saw and suffered first hand the Bush corporate welfare bail outs and know vote for Trump is as much a protest vote as it is a rejection of Corporate backed (war is good for business) Hillary and the other bought and paid for politicians. Time for a re think, lets hope this decision is the start of a major change around the globe to more equitable tax systems where no group has a distinct advantage over others as regards duties to contribute to the cost of running a jurisdiction.

Reply Share Share   0 0 #12 by Fred Dagg 4 months ago Ireland finds itself in a tricky position where it has to support Apple and forgo the quite useful tax payment (which it could probably do with before the next bank bailouts happen) because it would be a red flag to all the other multinationals based in Ireland. These mostly US companies might up sticks to the soon to be non-EU UK, who can charge whatever (much lower) corporate tax rates they like - especially across the border in Northern Ireland. Ireland corporate tax is 12.5%, which has had the EU in a tizzy for a while as it is much lower than the rest of the EU - if the EU crack down on that rate AND the UK then offer say 15% (or less), then there will be mass exodus of multinationals and also thousands of jobs as well as millions in PAYE tax revenue...

Reply Share Share   1 0 #14 by Iain Hook 4 months ago Surprised no one has commented on the second par of this article - Apple in NZ - namely $732M revenue, $17.7m profit - REALLY - if these were anything like real profit numbers (2.4%) Apple would have pulled out of NZ market long ago. But they are still here, why ? its because the real profits (and we know the % based on international average for Apple is more around 40% so thats roughly $290m NZD) are being moved offshore. Should we care - of course. We need an equal tax distribution across businesses as well as consumers. We have a huge list of unfunded needs (think more police officers - the $ have to come from somewhere ( and no i do not recommend just printing dollar notes). Also we need a fair playing field - how can local companies compete against this sort of activity. Yes the solutions to make these international companies pay up are complex, theres no one silver bullet solution and we shouldn't be looking for one but rather it will take a lot of smaller actions. i'd be keen to see how much extra revenue Aust Govt has got from its 'google' tax in past year. As for the EU action my view is good on the EU. Ireland want to have the benefits of the EU club but no play by their rules, if the Irish Govt. seriously don't want the money, then as another reader said, share it around other EU member states. Reply Share Share   1 0 by Crackity  4 months ago in reply to Iain Hook Many things surprise me about Apple ( most revolve about how crap their batteries are but let's not go there now....) but in regards to the NZ operation I was actually surprised by the effective tax rate on their disclosed profit. ( Its latest public accounts for its New Zealand operations detail that Apple paid $8.9 million or 50.28% of its $17.7 million profit in tax for the 12 months to September 26, 2015. ) I'm pretty sure I could get their tax rate to 28% ( $4.96 million ) of disclosed profit and I would charge them much less than PWC..... Reply Share Share   0 0 by Sarki 4 months ago in reply to Crackity  No disrespect Crackety, but I suspect that even little ol' Apple NZ employs the best tax advisors (by that I mean most creative at dodging tax), so I very much doubt that you could achieve what you claim - I accept that you are probably much cheaper! I think that most accountants know their scam - massively inflated cost of sales/ licence fees paid to an overseas subsidiary; moving the real profit to a low/no tax jurisdiction. The reason why they pay such a high proportion of their disclosed profit in tax, is because a large amount of expense claimed is non deductible. I suspect a lot of entertainment (AKA parties) - given their real level of profitability. As a previous commenter said, they would not stay in NZ for the miniscule profit that they are claiming to have made. Go the EU! At least they have the courage to take on this global corporate giant. Frankly, Apple and several other predominantly US based corporates have taken the p1$$ for far too long.

So don't waste effort trying to get Ireland, Holland and all the other low tax countries in line..... From a NZ perspective, isn't the simplest solution for foreign controlled subsidiaries operating in NZ to apply the higher of a) an assumed industry PBT % of revenue (for the NZ sub) or b) reported PBT (excluding transfer charges). The transfer pricing regime seems too open to manipulation and too reliant on IRD resources to monitor / assess / control. In the circumstance where there is no local operation - apply a RWT of X% on sales. (Although I accept the technical aspect of incorporating that into the payments system might be very difficult.) Reply Share Share   0 0 by James 4 months ago in reply to Anonymous User  The point of transfer pricing is that your subsidiaries pay the same price as an independent third party business would pay for the same goods / services. No more, no less. The reason that Apple doesn't pay much tax in NZ even with large revenues is that the price of the goods that Apple Worldwide sells to Apple NZ is high and thus profits are higher for Apple Worldwide. But I can pretty much guarantee you that this isn't an abuse of transfer pricing rules as the prices that Apple Worldwide sell to Apple NZ will be the same as they sell to Harvey Norman, Noel Leeming etc etc. Why do you think that pretty much every annoying "flash the whole television screen and shout at you to tell you about the latest stupendous sale" advert always excludes Apple products? Put two and two together and it is very easy to see why Apple NZ doesn't make much profit - because it HAS (literally, has, by law) to be charged the same as everyone else - and there isn't much margin in everyone else's sales, which is why you can never get a discount! Reply Share Share   0 0 by Anonymous User  4 months ago in reply to James Your miss the point - it's not about what they charge Apple NZ v Harvey Norman or others, it's the NZ 'cost' price v other tax jurisdictions. Transfer pricing being the same cost structure as provided by third parties? Yeah. right.....nice in theory but rubbish in practice. The simplest test of that is to asses Apple's global PBT % on revenue. If transfer pricing is so exact, why should profit margins differ so significantly between countries? The main point, is that transfer pricing is being abused in order to shift profits to low tax jurisdictions. It's a bit naive to think otherwise. Applying an assumed rate of profitability seems a more sensible base and shifts the focus of proving actual cost onto the company rather than the taxpayer (by way of IRD). Reply Share Share   0 0 by James 4 months ago in reply to Anonymous User  Seriously it is entirely about what they charge Harvey Norman etc as Apple NZ has to, by law, be charged the same amount. The overseas profits that sit in low-tax jurisdictions are mostly royalty charges and brand development charges - which the IP companies pay Apple US towards the costs of, and then recoup through the equipment sales. But the amount recovered is, and has to be, the same if the the equipment is sold to Apple NZ as it is if it is sold to Harvey Norman.
