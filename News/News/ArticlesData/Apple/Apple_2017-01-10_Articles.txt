Credit: Apple More like this Apple Mac shipments take a beating in Q3 as PC shipments decline PC shipments predicted to return to growth in 2018 after six-year skid Pricey gaming desktops and laptops thrive in slumping PC market Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell Apple's new MacBook Pros have put the brakes on a free-fall of Mac shipments globally, though they haven't provided the significant boost the company was looking for. The company's Mac shipments totaled 5.3 million units during the fourth quarter of 2016, a decline of just 0.9 percent compared to the same quarter in 2015. That compares favorably to overall Mac shipments in 2016, which totaled 18.4 million units, a decline of 9.8 percent compared to 2015, according to IDC.  Apple launched the new MacBook Pros in late October, and it was considered a significant upgrade. Had the new MacBook Pros shipped for all three months, the quarterly growth may have jumped up to flat or positive territory. But that's still not an encouraging sign for MacBook Pros, which haven't provided an overwhelming boost to worldwide Mac shipments. Apple will share its Mac shipment numbers during an earnings call on Jan. 31. Apple's shipment numbers haven't always agreed with figures from research firms like IDC and Gartner. The MacBook Pros were met with mixed reviews. They had new features like the Touch Bar, which received a lukewarm reaction. The Macs were also criticized for including Intel's older Skylake chips and not the newer Kaby Lake chips. Windows PCs and Chromebooks are performing better. Apple was the fourth-largest PC maker in the world behind Lenovo, HP, and Dell, all of which recorded positive shipment growth during the fourth quarter of 2016. Nevertheless, Apple's Mac shipments are recovering, and it comes at a time when PC shipments are also stabilizing. PC shipments in the fourth quarter totaled 70.2 million, declining by just 1.5 percent compared to the same quarter in 2015, according to IDC. The numbers include traditional PCs and not devices with detachable keyboards, which are considered tablets. Competing analyst firm Gartner has predicted PC shipments will go through minor quarterly declines until returning to positive growth in 2017. One reason for the recovery was a clear delineation of product categories. Tablets aren't considered competition anymore, and many customers are returning to laptops and desktops for their primary computing needs. Gaming PCs have thrived in the last year as interest in virtual reality and eSports grows. Holiday deals boosted PC sales in the U.S. and Europe, and the consumer PC market is recovering, IDC said. Shipments also were robust in China as buyers moved to thin and light devices. Lenovo's PC shipments totaled 15.7 million, growing by 1.7 percent, maintaining a 22.4 percent market share. HP's shipments totaled 15.27 million, growing by 6.6 percent, a 21.7 percent market share. Dell recorded the biggest quarterly gain with its shipments growing by 8.6 percent to 11 million units. Asus was the fifth largest PC maker behind Apple, and its shipments declined by 11.3 percent to 5.1 million units. In 2016, shipments of PCs totaled 260 million units, declining by 5.7 percent compared to 2015.

No official numbers were given and if you thought that Cook was just putting on an optimistic front for investors, apparently that is not the case. According to the recent numbers by Slice Intelligence (via 9to5Mac), it turns out that sales of the AirPods have been pretty good. It seems that on the day that the AirPods were launched, it represented the largest sales of headphones in a single day for the year of 2016, where based on the graph it seems to have beat out both Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. The report goes on to add that combined with the sales of wireless Beats headphones, the number of Bluetooth headphones Apple has sold since the AirPods launched represents about 40% of the market. Of course we’re just looking a snapshot in the entire year of 2016 so it is possible that the hype and anticipation could account for the surge in sales. It will be interesting to see how well the AirPods fare in the following months or years now that more headphones makers are hopping onto the wireless bandwagon, but for now Apple can enjoy the fruits of their labor.

The new iPad Pro delivers incredible performance with the 64-bit A9X chip that rivals most portable PCs, along with a four-speaker audio system that is twice as powerful,¹ new 12-megapixel iSight® camera for shooting Live Photos™ and 4K video, 5-megapixel FaceTime® HD camera, and faster wireless technologies. And iPad Pro includes support for the breakthrough Apple Pencil™ and a new Smart Keyboard™ cover designed to fit the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro. “iPad Pro is a new generation of iPad that is indispensable and immersive, enabling people to be more productive and more creative. It’s incredibly fast, extremely portable, and completely natural to use with your fingers, Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard. And now it comes in two sizes,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “The 9.7-inch iPad Pro has a new Retina display with True Tone technology, four-speaker audio system, blazing fast A9X chip, 12-megapixel iSight camera, 5-megapixel FaceTime HD camera, faster wireless, and support for Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard. It is the ultimate upgrade for existing iPad users and replacement for PC users.” Designers, illustrators and businesses have quickly adopted iPad Pro and it’s changing the way they work: “People don’t realize how much hand drawing is needed to produce computer animation,” said John Lasseter, Chief Creative Officer, Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios. “iPad Pro and Apple Pencil are the closest we’ve ever been able to get in the digital world to actually drawing on paper.” “I’ve done everything including designing the latest cycling collection on iPad Pro,” said Alex Valdman, Head of Design for Rapha. “It goes with me everywhere, and has not only replaced my laptop, but my paper notebook as well. For the Rapha design team, iPad Pro will become standard issue.” “At Citi, iPad Pro is truly transforming how we work,” said Stephen Gates, U.S. Head of Design for Citi Global Consumer Banking. “iPad Pro and Apple Pencil have played a huge part in the new Citi Design team’s work to create new innovative customer experiences. We use iPad Pro for sketching out new design concepts, presenting our work, answering our emails, working with our design files on Adobe Creative Cloud and participating in FaceTime meetings with our other design teams all over the world.” Pro display The 9.7-inch iPad Pro features advanced display technologies, including a True Tone display, which uses new four-channel sensors to dynamically adjust the white balance of the display to match the light around you for a more natural and accurate, paper-white viewing experience. The advanced Retina display is 25 percent brighter and 40 percent less reflective than iPad Air® 2, making content even easier to see indoors and out. It uses the same wider color gamut as the iMac® with Retina 5K display, delivering 25 percent greater color saturation¹ for more vivid colors. A custom timing controller, photo alignment and oxide TFT deliver incredible color, contrast and clarity. Night Shift in iOS 9.3 uses iPad Pro’s clock and geolocation to automatically adjust the colors in the display to the warmer end of the spectrum after dark and may even help you get a better night’s sleep. Pro performance The new iPad Pro is just 6.1mm thin and weighs just under one pound, yet delivers groundbreaking performance, connectivity and versatility so you can tackle the most demanding tasks wherever you go. The powerful A9X chip with third-generation 64-bit architecture provides performance that rivals many laptops and console-class graphics, while also delivering all-day battery life.² Ultrafast wireless connectivity keeps you connected wherever you go with 802.11ac Wi-Fi with MIMO technology, support for even faster LTE Advanced with up to 50 percent faster cellular connectivity³ and the most LTE bands supported by any tablet.⁴ Now with Apple SIM embedded directly in the new iPad Pro, it’s even easier to connect to wireless data plans right from your device when traveling in more than 100 countries and territories.5 iPad Pro has an advanced 12-megapixel iSight camera sensor featuring Focus Pixels for fast focusing, an Apple-designed image signal processor, advanced noise reduction, third-generation local tone mapping and better face detection, all resulting in sharp, detailed images, 63-megapixel panoramas and Live Photos. A True Tone flash improves low light shots and document scanning. The new iSight camera shoots 4K video, making the new iPad Pro the perfect device to shoot, edit and share pro-quality video. The improved 5-megapixel, front-facing FaceTime HD camera makes the new iPad Pro perfect for videoconferencing or connecting with loved ones. Pro audio The four-speaker audio system provides powerful, clear and rich stereo sound for more than twice the audio output.¹ Built-in sensors automatically adjust and optimize the audio no matter which way you’re using it. iOS 9.3 also adds support for playing video encoded with Dolby Digital Plus audio streams with support for multichannel output using the Apple Lightning® Digital AV Adapter. Pro accessories Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard, available for purchase separately, bring breakthrough levels of precision and utility to iPad Pro. Advanced sensors in Apple Pencil measure both pressure and tilt for a natural drawing, annotating and note-taking experience. A new Smart Keyboard is custom-designed for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, offering a thin yet durable keyboard that never needs to be charged or paired over Bluetooth and is easily foldable into a protective Smart Cover®. The new Lightning to SD Card Camera Reader and Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter make it easy to download photos and videos from a digital camera to iPad Pro, while a new Lightning to USB-C Cable and Apple’s 29W USB-C Power Adapter enable faster charging.

The disclosure, along with news of the replacement of Laura McBain, the chief executive of Bellamy's, by another senior executive, Andrew Cohen, on an interim basis, came as part of a trading update to investors. The update appears to show a continued deterioration of Bellamy's financial position as sluggish sales has led to rising inventories. The chief financial officer has also been changed as the troubled group reviews all other senior executive positions. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Fonterra is the world's top dairy exporter and it has boosted its sway over Australia's dairy industry with a deal with Bellamy's. Photo: BRENDON O'HAGAN But a focus of Wednesday's trading update is the strengthening of Fonterra's sway over Bellamy's future with the disclosure of the tighter right to terminate supply agreements, which is a clear shot across the bow of shareholder Jan Cameron, who has teamed up with a group of Bellamy's shareholders that she claims may command 35 per cent of the capital to grab control of the struggling company's board via a spill motion to be voted on next month. Under the deal with Fonterra, the New Zealand company can decide to terminate its deal with Bellamy's if "a person or group of persons [who] acquires 30 per cent or more of Bellamy's voting shares and in Fonterra's opinion ... has effective control of Bellamy's". Advertisement Bellamy's chairman Rob Woolley refused to discuss the revised arrangement with Fonterra, although he did say there had not been any approaches that could lead to a change of control of the company. He also refused to disclose whether the troubled company would need to raise additional equity. The company has decided to "reset " its approach to China, as it seeks to move away from discounted sales through e-commerce platforms. "China is hard and a very opaque market. And one of the thrusts of the government is to get a balance of off-line and on-line approaches," he told BusinessDay. "We see what is important is to get reputable product going into the country." After Wednesday's trading update, Ms Cameron said she had not changed her mind on the need to force through board changes. "Today's announcement hasn't filled me with confidence," she said. "There's been a breathtaking lack of responsibility on the board's part for what has happened. The announcement today reinforces the need to change the board." The long-awaited trading update confirmed Bellamy's disclosed it was continuing to struggle to lift sales, with inventories forecast at $105 million to $110 million by June, when it rules off its books, which is well above the end-June level of $67 million. Bellamy's said it had renegotiated supply contracts with Fonterra and Bega Cheese that include "shortfall payments" if it did not take minimum volumes from these suppliers. The deal with Fonterra, for example, extends the arrangement for a further three years to eight years. Shortfall payments of up to $13 million a year are likely over the next two years. Bellamy's also said full-year revenue was expected to run at $220 million to $240 million, down from $244 million last financial year, while it signalled impairments might be needed since the shelf life for infant formula was two to three years. The interim chief executive, Mr Cohen, told analysts the focus was to reduce costs and rebuild cash flow to help to stabilise its finances. Cutting inventories and reviewing raw materials costs formed part of this, he said, with the aim of freeing cash to enable the company to lift its marketing efforts. Along with the need to guarantee fixed volumes sourced through Fonterra and Bega – or make top-up payments – Bellamy's conceded it had also been hurt by the rising cost of organic milk powder, which it largely sourced from Europe due to the lack of material available locally. "Increased cost of materials, shortfall payments, and adverse customer mix" were all factors weighing on the group's performance, Mr Cohen told the analysts, adding that Bellamy's was "rethinking its customer strategy". Industry sources said that while the near term threat to Bellamy's board independence might depend on the push by dissident shareholders to unseat the board, of equal concern to Fonterra was the potential for corporate rivals such as Bega or a2 Milk to make their presence felt on the Bellamy's share register.

According to Slice Intelligence (via AppleInsider), the £159 cable-free buds have accounted for a quarter of all wireless headphones sold since they became available last month. The research also claimed Apple-owned Beats racked up 15.49 per cent of the trade in that time, giving Cupertino over 41% of the market overall. Prior to the belated launch of AirPods, Beats had 24.1% of the market, according to the figures, so there is evidence the W1-enabled buds have cannibalised Apple’s other business somewhat. Related: Are AirPods any good? Meanwhile, there has been significant loss of market share for the likes of Bose, Jaybird and Plantronics during the last month. That, of course, is likely to even out once the initial rush to snap up Apple’s AirPods has died off. Interestingly, according to the data compiled from e-receipts, headphone sales on the day AirPods eventually arrived were the highest of 2016. They eclipsed Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Prime Day. The figures published this week appear to justify Apple’s decision to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 range. While not alone in ditching the century-old technology for a wireless or adapter driven solution, Apple’s profile means it took the brunt of the criticism. If that criticism hurt Apple in any way, the company is likely wiping those tears away with $100 bills right now. iPhone 7 vs iPhone 7 Plus Have you tried AirPods yet?

Continues to Slip in China At least iOS is growing in the U.S. and Europe. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Jan 11, 2017 at 5:57PM Local Chinese manufacturers continue to chip away at iOS. Image source: Apple. You win some, you lose some. Kantar has released its most recent estimates on numerous smartphone markets around the world, covering the three months ending November 2016 before the holiday shopping season picked up steam. Well, the news is mixed. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was able to chip away at Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) lead in key geographies in Europe as well as the U.S., but continued to slip in greater China, where local manufacturers are flooding the market with low-cost Android devices. Let's dig through the numbers. The good The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and iPhone 6s were the top three handsets within the U.S. for the period, grabbing a combined 31% market share. Samsung's Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge came in at the No. 4 and No. 5 spots and accounted for 29% of sales. Aggressive carrier promotions helped both the Mac maker and the South Korean conglomerate, as all the domestic carriers had various promotions to get a free flagship devices. Overall, iOS grew within the U.S. by 6.4 percentage points to grab a 43.5% market share. Interestingly, Google's decision to partner with Verizon as the exclusive carrier distributing the Pixel seems to be paying off, with the Pixel comprising about 1.3% of all smartphone sales; over half of those new phones were activated at Big Red. That may not sound like a whole lot, but it's actually impressive when you consider that Nexus and Pixel phones have never been high-volume devices, so 1.3% is actually pretty good within that context. In Europe, Apple did particularly well within the U.K., where it saw its market share jump 9.1 percentage points, and now has a 48.3% share in the country. iOS also jumped by 6.5 percentage points in France to a 24.5% market share. In the broader EU5 (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K.), Apple had 24.6% share of all smartphone sales. The bad Apple has seen its position in China deteriorate over the past year or so, while local players have been able to rise and chip away at both Apple and larger Android original equipment manufacturers. Android now accounts for 80% of smartphones sold in the Middle Kingdom, which is the largest smartphone market in the world. iOS fell from 25.3% of urban China to just 19.9%, although Apple was up modestly on a sequential basis. The only silver lining here is that the iPhone 7 was the single best-selling device in urban China, grabbing 6.6% of all sales. The problem is that there are so many other low-cost Android choices out there that make up the rest of the market (Huawei and Oppo now represent nearly 40% of the market). Apple's business in China is still on a long-term upward trajectory and I have little doubt that the company will recover, but it's definitely seen better days.

With the release of the new MacBook Pros, the latest data from research firms Gartner and IDC show Apple gaining ground in the PC industry, despite the market continuing to slow as a whole… The latest data from IDC reports that the worldwide shipments of PCs totaled 70.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. That’s a year-on-year decline of 1.5 percent, but represents the continued stabilization of the market. For the year, IDC says that PC shipments hit 260 million, down 5.7 percent compared to 2015. Worldwide, Apple saw its marketshare rise from 7.4 percent in Q4 2015 to 7.5 percent, though overall shipments fell by .9 percent for the year as a whole. Overall, Apple ranks as the fourth largest PC vendor worldwide, with Lenovo coming in at the top, followed by HP and Dell. Apple was boosted by the launch of new MacBook Pro models during the fourth quarter. The company moved back into fourth place and stabilized global shipments. The year started off slow for the industry, with the research firm blaming high inventory, free Windows 10 upgrades, and a lack of enticing hardware for consumers. Towards the middle of the year, however, the growth rate started picking up. However, mid-2016 and particularly the recent fourth quarter have moved beyond these inhibitors and seen stabilizing commercial demand. Contraction of the consumer PC market has also slowed as growth and competition from tablets and phones has eased up. Recent quarters have faced some tight supply of components such as SSDs, displays, and memory. Moving on, Gartner’s data shows a slightly different perspective on Apple’s performance. The research firm says that Apple’s market share increased from 7 percent in Q4 2015 to 7.5 percent in Q4 2016. Gartner’s data shows more growth in terms of shipments, as well, increasing worldwide by 2.4 percent year-over-year for a fifth place finish worldwide. Apple lags behind Lenovo, HP, Dell, and Asus. The data discrepancy is interesting but ultimately nothing that should be read into too much. IDC counts Windows-based tablets differently than Gartner does, which accounts for most of discrepancy. Ultimately, Apple continues to combat against a slowing PC market and the new MacBook Pros only further that, especially considering the fact that sales were slowing considerably at the end of Q3. As for what’s next for the Mac, read our full roundup here. View the full releases below: PC Market Stabilizes with Solid Fourth Quarter Shipments Despite Component Shortages, According to IDC 11 Jan 2017 FRAMINGHAM, Mass., January 11, 2017 – Worldwide shipments of traditional PCs (Desktop, Notebook, and Workstation) totaled 70.2 million units in the fourth quarter of 2016 (4Q16), posting a year-on-year decline of 1.5%, according to the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Personal Computing Device Tracker. The results continued the recent trend of stabilizing growth, which has been in decline since 2012. Annually, shipments of traditional PCs slipped to 260 million units, down 5.7% from 2015. The first quarter of 2016 was still constrained by high inventory, free Windows 10 upgrades, and difficult comparisons to commercial replacements in 2014 that were fueled by the end of support for Windows XP. However, mid-2016 and particularly the recent fourth quarter have moved beyond these inhibitors and seen stabilizing commercial demand. Contraction of the consumer PC market has also slowed as growth and competition from tablets and phones has eased up. Recent quarters have faced some tight supply of components such as SSDs, displays, and memory. The supply constraints did not significantly slow overall shipments, and in fact may have boosted growth slightly and accelerated market consolidation as the largest players moved to lock up supply. Mature regions continued to perform best. Japan and Canada extended positive growth from 3Q16, while volume in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region was stable. Shipments in the United States declined slightly, although the country performed slightly better than the global average. Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan)(APeJ) continued to improve with only a mild decline in shipments while Latin America continued to experience significant contraction. “The fourth quarter results reinforce our expectations for market stabilization, and even some recovery,” said Loren Loverde, vice president, Personal Computing Trackers & Forecasting. “The contraction in traditional PC shipments experienced over the past five years finally appears to be giving way as users move to update systems. We have a good opportunity for traditional PC growth in commercial markets, while the consumer segment should also improve as it feels less pressure from slowing phone and tablet markets.” “The U.S. PC market was able to pull off a strong last quarter of the year with impressive growth in the retail PC segment that surpassed expectations,” said Neha Mahajan, senior research analyst, Devices & Displays. “Although this might signal regained consumer confidence in the PC market, with most of the sales being driven by aggressive promotions in the holiday season, it needs to be seen how much of the real demand is carried forward in the coming quarters.” Regional Highlights The United States market witnessed a slight decline in shipments this quarter. Following inventory growth in the third quarter, the fourth quarter saw growth toning down. At the same time, the retail PC market in the U.S. came out strong, backed by aggressive promotions by top PC vendors in December. Overall, traditional PC shipments for 4Q16 stood at 17.0 million units. The EMEA market performed better than expected, fueled by strong holiday season sales of traditional PCs. While desktops performed in line with IDC’s expectations, notebooks grew above forecast across the region. However, component shortages are expected to have driven some of the vendors’ shipment towards inventory build-up. The Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan) traditional PC market continued to stabilize with only a slight year-on-year contraction. The demonetization crisis in India had a significant impact on the market, stifling demand and inhibiting shipments in the consumer and SMB segments, but recovery towards the end of the quarter allowed for more sell-in. In China, robust demand for consumer notebooks supported by a shift to thin and light devices continued. The commercial market in most APeJ countries remained soft. Projects in India have been delayed, while China saw weaker than expected commercial demand. A negative macroeconomic environment also inhibited shipments, particularly in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines. On the other hand, larger orders from the public sector pushed the commercial market above expectations in Korea. The Japan traditional PC market came in ahead of forecast, but still slowed from the third quarter, as expected. Consumer shipments remained under pressure while the commercial segment was resilient, driving overall growth in 4Q16. Vendor Highlights Lenovo continued to hold the top spot, though the competition with HP remains fierce. The top vendor still faced a tough climate in APeJ but made significant strides in the holiday quarter in Europe and the Americas with a stronger performance in notebooks and capped the quarter growing globally at 1.7%, ending six consecutive quarters of year-on-year declines. HP Inc. held the second position, growing 6.6% compared to 4Q15 for its third consecutive quarter of positive growth and shipping more than 15 million units for the first time since 4Q14. HP Inc. further consolidated its share in the United States market, growing its market share to 31%. The company also saw sizable gains in EMEA and APeJ. Dell Technologies also had a productive quarter with shipments of just over 11 million (the first time it has done so since 4Q11) and growth of 8.2%. The number 3 vendor managed positive year-on-year growth in every region with strong notebook volume as well as a positive desktop quarter. Apple was boosted by the launch of new MacBook Pro models during the fourth quarter. The company moved back into fourth place and stabilized global shipments. ASUS growth slipped in the fourth quarter, particularly in the U.S., but remained in the top 5 globally, ranking number four for all of 2016.     Top 5 Vendors, Worldwide Traditional PC Shipments, Fourth Quarter 2016 (Preliminary results) (Shipments are in thousands of units) Vendor Q416 Shipments Q416 Market Share Q415 Shipments Q415 Market Share Q416/Q415 Growth 1.

For the year, 2016 PC shipments totaled 269.7 million units, a 6.2 percent decline from 2015. PC shipments have declined annually since 2012. “Stagnation in the PC market continued into the fourth quarter of 2016 as holiday sales were generally weak due to the fundamental change in PC buying behavior,” said Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner. “The broad PC market has been static as technology improvements have not been sufficient to drive real market growth. There have been innovative form factors like 2-in-1s and thin and light notebooks, as well as technology improvements, such as longer battery life. This end of the market has grown fast, led by engaged PC users who put high priority on PCs. However, the market driven by PC enthusiasts is not big enough to drive overall market growth.” “There is the other side of the PC market, where PCs are infrequently used. Consumers in this segment have high dependency on smartphones, so they stretch PC life cycles longer. This side of the market is much bigger than the PC enthusiast segment; thus, steep declines in the infrequent PC user market offset the fast growth of the PC enthusiast market.” Ms. Kitagawa said that although the overall PC market will see stagnation, there are growth opportunities within the market, such as the engaged PC user market, the business market and gaming. However, these growth areas will not prevent the overall decline of the PC market, at least in the next year. Four of the top six vendors experienced an increase in worldwide PC shipments in the fourth quarter of 2016 (see Table 1). The top three vendors all increased their global market share in the fourth quarter. Lenovo maintained the No. 1 position, as the company experienced shipment increases in North America and EMEA, while Asia/Pacific and Japan continued to be challenging markets.

All data is estimated based on a preliminary study. Final estimates will be subject to change. The statistics are based on shipments selling into channels. Source: Gartner (January 2017) HP remained in the second position, and it has recorded three consecutive quarters of shipment growth. HP secured the top position in PC shipments in the U.S. and EMEA, growing faster than the regional averages. Dell also registered three consecutive quarters of shipment growth in 4Q16. Dell continued to place PCs as a strategic business segment in commercial and consumer markets during 2016. Asus suffered the steepest decline among the top six vendors in the fourth quarter of 2016. Asus has been shifting its PC strategy more toward the high-end market, which will allow it to maintain better profit margins. Gartner analysts said the falling shipment volume could be the cause of this strategy shift. In the U.S., PC shipments totaled 16.5 million units in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 1.3 percent decline from the fourth quarter of 2015 (see Table 2). Five of the top six vendors in the U.S. PC market experienced a shipment increase in the fourth quarter of 2016. However, this was offset by a 20.9 percent decline in the Others category, and a 48.3 percent decline in shipments by Asus. “Similar to low-key back to school sales in 3Q16, big sales events, such as Black Friday, Cyber Monday and holiday sales are no longer effective marketing opportunities for PCs since PC purchases are generally driven by a ‘need,’ rather than ‘want,’ motivation,” Ms. Kitagawa said. “PCs are not a preferred gift item any longer, as consumers gravitate toward other consumer electronics, such as virtual personal assistant (VPA) speakers, virtual reality (VR) head-mounted devices, and wearables. Vendors and channels did not have high expectations for the holiday PC sales, so the marketing campaigns remained relatively quiet.” Table 2 Preliminary U.S. PC Vendor Unit Shipment Estimates for 4Q16 (Thousands of Units) Company 4Q16 Shipments 4Q16 Market Share (%) 4Q15 Shipments 4Q15 Market Share (%) 4Q16-4Q15 Growth (%) HP Inc. 4,945 29.9 4,577 27.3 8.0 Dell 4,157 25.2 4,081 24.4 1.9 Lenovo 2,282 13.8 2,105 12.6 8.4 Apple 2,111 12.8 1,984 11.8 6.4 Acer Group 662 4.0 596 3.6 11.2 Asus 621 3.8 1,201 7.2 -48.3 Others 1,740 10.5 2,199 13.1 -20.9 Total 16,518 100.0 16,743 100.0 -1.3 Notes: Data includes desk-based PCs, notebook PCs and ultramobile premiums (such as Microsoft Surface), but not Chromebooks or iPads. All data is estimated based on a preliminary study. Final estimates will be subject to change. The statistics are based on shipments selling into channels. Source: Gartner (January 2017) PC shipments in EMEA surpassed 21.9 million units in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 3.4 percent decline year over year. PC shipments to the consumer market were driven by good Black Friday sales in Western European countries, such as the U.K. and France, especially on traditional notebooks, ultramobile clamshells, the hybrid form factor and gaming PCs. Gartner’s early estimates also show PC shipment growth in the business segment, led by Windows 10 deployments during the fourth quarter. The Asia/Pacific PC market totaled 24.8 million units in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 3.9 percent decline from the fourth quarter of 2015. The PC market was affected by two major events. First, the demonetization of the Indian currency in India led to weaker-than-expected consumer PC demand. Second, the success of China’s 11.11 (Singles Day on 11 November) online shopping event gave a boost to consumer notebook sales. For the year, worldwide PC shipments totaled 269.7 million units in 2016 (see Table 3). 2016 shipment totals were at the same levels as shipments in 2007. Market consolidation escalated in 2016 as the top three vendors (Lenovo, HP and Dell) accounted for 54.7 percent of worldwide PC shipments in 2016, up from 51.5 percent in 2015.

Continues to Slip in China At least iOS is growing in the U.S. and Europe. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Jan 11, 2017 at 5:57PM Local Chinese manufacturers continue to chip away at iOS. Image source: Apple. You win some, you lose some. Kantar has released its most recent estimates on numerous smartphone markets around the world, covering the three months ending November 2016 before the holiday shopping season picked up steam. Well, the news is mixed. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was able to chip away at Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) lead in key geographies in Europe as well as the U.S., but continued to slip in greater China, where local manufacturers are flooding the market with low-cost Android devices. Let's dig through the numbers. The good The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and iPhone 6s were the top three handsets within the U.S. for the period, grabbing a combined 31% market share. Samsung's Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge came in at the No. 4 and No. 5 spots and accounted for 29% of sales. Aggressive carrier promotions helped both the Mac maker and the South Korean conglomerate, as all the domestic carriers had various promotions to get a free flagship devices. Overall, iOS grew within the U.S. by 6.4 percentage points to grab a 43.5% market share. Interestingly, Google's decision to partner with Verizon as the exclusive carrier distributing the Pixel seems to be paying off, with the Pixel comprising about 1.3% of all smartphone sales; over half of those new phones were activated at Big Red. That may not sound like a whole lot, but it's actually impressive when you consider that Nexus and Pixel phones have never been high-volume devices, so 1.3% is actually pretty good within that context. In Europe, Apple did particularly well within the U.K., where it saw its market share jump 9.1 percentage points, and now has a 48.3% share in the country. iOS also jumped by 6.5 percentage points in France to a 24.5% market share. In the broader EU5 (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K.), Apple had 24.6% share of all smartphone sales. The bad Apple has seen its position in China deteriorate over the past year or so, while local players have been able to rise and chip away at both Apple and larger Android original equipment manufacturers. Android now accounts for 80% of smartphones sold in the Middle Kingdom, which is the largest smartphone market in the world. iOS fell from 25.3% of urban China to just 19.9%, although Apple was up modestly on a sequential basis. The only silver lining here is that the iPhone 7 was the single best-selling device in urban China, grabbing 6.6% of all sales. The problem is that there are so many other low-cost Android choices out there that make up the rest of the market (Huawei and Oppo now represent nearly 40% of the market). Apple's business in China is still on a long-term upward trajectory and I have little doubt that the company will recover, but it's definitely seen better days.

Casebolt was a high profile Senior Director of Design for Apple’s Mac lineup left the company last month to join Tesla as Sr. Director Engineering, Closures & Mechanisms. Over the past two and a half years, Casebolt lead the MacBook Pro team which lead to the new Touch Bar found in the latest update. Before that, he lead the team behind the design of the latest ‘trash can’ Mac Pro and played a huge role in the first iterations of the MacBook Air design. In recent memory, these are by far the most iconic designs from Apple. While this is good news for Tesla, it does look like Apple’s Macintosh team is shrinking at a fast pace. With this latest report, it does leave fear in what Apple has in store for the next generation of its Mac lineup.

Apple patent hints at iPhone with full-face display - Irish Sun Issue 016/15 Irish Sun        http://www.irishsun.com   Ireland News Breaking International News Breaking Business News Europe Sports News Dublin News Economics News Belfast News Breaking Internet News Web Site Development News Healthcare News Ireland News Utilities News Apple patent hints at iPhone with full-face display PanArmenian.Net Wednesday 11th January, 2017 PanARMENIAN.Net - Apple on Tuesday, January 10 was granted a patent detailing technology that allows for ear speakers, cameras and even a heads-up display to hide behind an edge-to-edge screen, a design rumored to debut in a next-generation iPhone later this year, AppleInsider reports. Awarded by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Apple's U.S. Patent No. 9,543,364 for "Electronic devices having displays with openings" describes a method by which various components can be mounted behind perforations in a device screen that are so small as to be imperceptible to the human eye. This arrangement would allow engineers to design a smartphone or tablet with a true edge-to-edge, or "full face," display. Until recently, smartphone aesthetics have been both defined and limited by their most dominant feature: the display. Conventional candybar designs made popular by iPhone put the screen front and center, with supporting hardware arranged along its periphery. For example, iPhone features a large central display flanked by sensors and physical controls located on the device's "forehead" and "chin," or the areas above and below the screen, and its sides. Certain components like the front-facing camera, ambient light sensor and proximity sensor can be hidden below a cover glass or co-located in an inactive portion of the display. Other elements like the ear speaker and home button require unhindered access to the user, especially in the case of Apple's Touch ID, meaning space for these parts is literally cut out of the front surface. With smartphones becoming increasingly more compact, there has been a push to move essential components behind the active - or light-emitting - area of incorporated displays, AppleInsider says.

Featured Story U2 tickets selling for whopping 900 euros each DUBLIN, Ireland - With epic rock band, U2 set to perform at a concert in Croke Park in July this year - a flurry of activity has been witnessed around ticket sales already.  Tickets are set to go on sale officially from tomorrow - however, a day before the official sales begin, tickets to watch the band perform live are already being sold and for nothing less than a whopping 900 euros each.  According to reports, fans that subscribed to the band’s official website were granted access to a pre-sale ticket portal last week and industry sources revealed that diehard fans with access to these tickets have chosen to sell them for a profit.  A set of tickets are said to have become available on official and black market websites since last week.  Tickets available currently on websites like Seatwave and Viagogo are being sold at prices higher than face value.  Officially, tickets for the Lower Davin Stand and pitch area of Croke Park have been priced at 76 euros, along with an extra charge of 3.30 euros for agent fees. Meanwhile, those in other parts of the Cusack and Hogan stands carry a value between 110 euros to 186 euros. But on these websites, the prices have been jacked up.   As of Sunday night, Seatwave, that is run by Ticketmaster, had advertised for 650 tickets that were available for sale.  Reports pointed ut that a pair of tickets was sold at 2,070 euros over the weekend and was for the standing section. It included extra charges and was priced at 13 times above face value.  A spokesperson for Ticketmaster defended the sale in a statement that said that Seatwave prices were set by the person selling the tickets and not the company. The spokesperson said, “The thing about Seatwave is that it is a safe and secure market so tickets would be genuine. The ticket prices are set by the seller, which in this instance is not Ticketmaster, but that price may not necessarily be secured by the seller. Ticketmaster is just facilitating the sale."

Tesla Motor’s director of autopilot programmes Sterling Anderson has reportedly left his job following the company’s appointment of a long time Apple executive to the division. However, Tesla did not disclose the nature of Anderson’s departure, who had been with the company since 2015. The exit was confirmed by people familiar with the matter, according to Bloomberg. The California-based electric car maker has appointed Chris Lattner, who worked for Apple for 11 years, as vice president of its autopilot software. Tesla said in a blog: “Chris’s reputation for engineering excellence is well known.” At Apple, Chris was primarily responsible for creating Swift, the programming language Chris Lattner, new Tesla recruit. for building apps on Apple platforms and one of the fastest growing languages for doing so on Linux. Before joining Apple, he was lead author of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, an open source umbrella project that is widely used in commercial products and academic research currently. The electric car maker said: “We are very excited that Chris is joining Tesla to lead our Autopilot engineering team and accelerate the future of autonomous driving. “As Chris joins Tesla, we would like to give a special thanks to Jinnah Hosein, SpaceX’s Vice President of Software, who has been serving a dual role as the interim Vice President of Tesla Autopilot Software and will now be heading back to SpaceX full-time. “We would like to thank Jinnah for the efforts needed to achieve excellence in both roles, David Nister, our Vice President of Autopilot Vision, and the team for their exceptional work in advancing Autopilot.” A change in management comes in the wake of a shift in Tesla’s focus to build full self-driving features for its electric cars. In the past, Tesla also hired several senior level executives from Apple, including Doug Field, Tesla’s senior vice president for engineering, and Cindy Nicola, vice president of global recruiting. Since October 2014, the company has been offering the Autopilot system on all its cars. Recently, it added a new feature to the hardware by including eight cameras and a dozen sensors. On the other hand, Apple reportedly axed jobs in the autonomous vehicle division last year, deciding quit in its plans to build self-driving vehicles. The technology giant had asked hundreds of members of the car team, which consists of about 1,000 people, to leave the company, while moving many to other divisions, people familiar with the project told Bloomberg in October last year.

What's going on? Image: AP On Tuesday, Tesla announced that it had hired Chris Lattner as its new Vice President of Autopilot Software. Lattner was at Apple for more than 11 years, most recently serving as its senior director of developer tools. Lattner is the creator of the Swift programming language, which Apple launched back in 2014, and which the company has been encouraging its app developers to build Mac and iOS apps in. As director of developer tools, Lattner was also responsible for Xcode (Apple's integrated development environment, that is, the software you use to build apps for Apple platforms) and the CPU and GPU compilers used within Apple and by third-party developers. In the words of John Gruber, he's a "holy shit" hire by Tesla. Lattner isn't the only high-profile engineer to leave Apple for Tesla. On Wednesday, 9to5Mac reported that Matt Casebolt, who was a director of product design at Apple, left the company in December to join Tesla. Casebolt's LinkedIn profile has the Mac Pro, the MacBook Pro with Force Touch trackpad, MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, Retina MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air on his resume. He had been at Apple for more than nine years and his name is on a number of patents. Business Insider suggests Lattner may have been on Jony Ive's close-knit team of designers and engineers, a team that typically has very low turnover. It would be the second high-profile departure from that group in recent months. In April, Danny Coster, a core member of Apple's design team under Ive for over 20 years, left to join GoPro. Coster, amongst other accomplishments, was the lead designer on the first iMac. Another new Tesla hire from within the last month is Timothy Hatcher, who spent 11 years at Apple on the WebKit team. WebKit is the rendering engine that powers the Safari web browser on iOS and macOS and an important piece of software at Apple. Hatcher is now at Tesla as a UI engineer. At a company with more than 100,000 employees, turnover is certainly going to happen. Still, losing longtime engineers who by all accounts were not working on automotive software at Apple to a company like Tesla could be cause for concern. It isn't just engineers leaving for car companies, either. As The Verge reported in November, three members of Apple's PR team have left for car companies in the last few months. Additionally, there are signs that not everything is rosy inside Apple. Apple reportedly cut production of the iPhone — its marquee product — by 10 per cent for the first quarter of 2017. In an annual SEC filing last week, Apple revealed its profit and revenue fell short of its own internal goals — the first time the company has missed since 2009. Apple also reportedly pivoted Project Titan — the Apple Car project — away from building a car itself and more towards software. As a result, hundreds of hardware and software engineers left the company. Tesla, which has been actively poaching Apple employees for years, could be a natural fit. Elon Musk, Tesla's founder and CEO, has said that Tesla's "design philosophy" is "closely aligned" with that of Apple. We reached out to Apple for comment on its engineering departures but had not heard back at time of writing. Here is a list of some of the high level employees who have left Apple since January 2016 and where they have gone, if that information is available: Bob Kupbens, VP Apple online store - eBay Hiroki Asai, VP global marketing communications Yoky Matsuoka, Health at Apple Danny Coster, director of product design (member ofJony Ive's industrial design team) - Go Pro Sarah O'Brien, PR - Tesla Colin Smith, PR - Ford Michaela Johndrow, PR - Ford Chris Lattner, director of developer tools - Tesla Matt Casebolt, director of product design - Tesla David Erhart, director of reliability engineering - Tesla Chester Chipperfield, special projects - Tesla Charles Kuehmann. director of product design - Tesla Steve Zadesky, Project Titan (Apple car) boss Sal Soghoian, product manager of automation technologies Daniel Gross, software director- Y Combinator Thomas Zwingman, senior staff reliability engineer - Tesla Sankarshan Murthy, product manager, worked on Apple Watch and iPhone 5C - Tesla Timothy Hatcher, software engineering manager on WebKit - Tesla Teresa Brewer, PR - SurveyMonkey Bart Nabbe special projects - Faraday Future David Finkelstein, manager of cryptographic security - Google Ryan Walsh, senior product for media - Floodgate Andrew Graham, motion sensors engineer - Tesla Brooke Michael Kain, head of digital marketing for Apple Music and iTunes - AEG Live Now obviously, we can't say for sure what's going on, or why. Maybe everything is normal and this is all a big coincidence. But it certainly doesn't look good. Additional reporting by William Turton.

Apple is far and away the most popular brand, but it's not the most popular platform. 50.1 per cent of all phones sold in Australia in the middle three months of 2016 ran the Android operating system, just beating out Apple's iOS. But Blackberry or Windows Phone? Hardly worth writing home about. Kantar Worldpanel's just-released research for the the three months ending November last year shows 50.1 per cent sales market share for Android in Australia, a slight edge on the 46.4 per cent sales market share of iOS. Now, with the only smartphone running iOS being Apple's iPhone, we know straight away what the most popular single handset was, with Android's share split between dozens of different handsets at different price points. But it's an interesting stat nonetheless to see Android tip the scales at more than half of all sales. Those numbers, though, actually paint more bleak a picture for Google's operating system and the smartphones that run it than you'd think. Android sales declined in share in the US, the UK and France, with those drops being gained by iOS. In the US, the iPhone 7, 7 Plus and 6s were the three most popular handsets, with Samsung's Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge taking fourth and fifth spot respectively. Google's late entry into the market with the Pixel was a bright point in the US. In the other big move worldwide, China loves Android — 80 per cent of phones sold ran it — with homegrown heroes like Huawei and Oppo taking the lion's share of sales. You can take a look at Australia's data below, and compare it to the rest of the world. [Kantar Worldpanel] Comments barry @barry Jan 12, 2017, 10:00am One of the reasons is there is almost nothing expect for Android phones available. iPhones you have to purchase from select sites or Telco shops like Win10Mobile. Android phones are available almost everywhere. Plus Android phones are a lot cheaper than all others Last edited January 12, 2017 10:01 am Reply 2 abscott88 @abscott88 Jan 12, 2017, 10:58am How many of those 50.1% of Android Phones that were sold where in a price category that Apple doesn't offer anything in I wonder? You'd have to think that iOS would be in the lead if Apple offered something in the $100-$300 range. Reply 1 rocwurst @rocwurst Jan 12, 2017, 3:00pm Indeed abscott88. Creative Strategies reports that 190m premium Android phones worth 500 dollars or more were sold in 2015 - that’s only 17% of all Android phones sold that year. Likewise, Counterpoint Research reports that 60% of the phones 400 dollars or greater sold last year were iPhones meaning only around 154M Android phones were 400 dollars or greater. Compare this to the 230 million iPhones sold that year and you can see the vast majority of Android phones are cheap plastic devices that are thrown away all too quickly as witnessed by the fact that Google reports there are only 1.4 billion active Android devices (tablets AND phones) plus only 400m AOSP forked Android devices compared to Apple's almost 1 Billion active iOS devices. Reply 0 StuckWithIt Guest Jan 12, 2017, 3:17pm Big part of the reason cheap droids are throw away is that most of them will never get a software update. In fact most were probably versions behind when they shipped. Reply 1 namarrgon @namarrgon Jan 12, 2017, 12:09pm That data above is just for the month, though? (i.e. "M/E NOV 2016") - Edit: ah, 3 months ("3 M/E"), I get it. It's still down a little from November 2015 (53.7%), but will pick up again - Android sales always dip around Oct-Dec when Apple releases their yearly iPhone, and are highest around Apr-Jun. Last edited January 12, 2017 12:10 pm Reply 0 rocwurst @rocwurst Jan 13, 2017, 1:07am And yet Android has been dropping market share for several years now according to Kantar's figures. In Nov 2013 Android was at 58% market share which dropped to 50.1% in Nov 2016 and in June 2014 was at 68% which dropped to 57.2% in June 2016. 50.1% doesn't sound so good now does it? Last edited January 13, 2017 2:55 am Reply 0 M0F0 @m0f0 Jan 13, 2017, 7:56am That would be because (unfortunately) Android’s rise and fall depends solely on Samsung. Their flagship release month is always April, so the Kantar m/e value around May is typically the strongest month for Android. Conversely Xmas time is always strong for Apple. If anything the Android numbers were slightly on the rise, but we won't know the full effect of the Note 7 debacle until the May 2017 are released on Kantar (post Galaxy S8) Last edited January 13, 2017 8:11 am Reply 0 rocwurst @rocwurst Jan 13, 2017, 9:28am While it's true that the Note 7 debacle hasn't done any favours for Android as a whole, the fact remains that Android was already dropping market share in Australia prior to that event. In June 2015 Android's marketshare had already plummeted to 57.2% from 68% in June 2014. Also, by Nov 2015 Android had plunged to 53.7% from 58% in Nov 2014. Last edited January 13, 2017 9:29 am Reply 0 M0F0 @m0f0 Jan 14, 2017, 9:36am If you go back to the previous 2 years you can see the peak Android season was spread out across later in the year as well. You gotta remember there used to be multiple other large OEM's releasing popular phones back then too. Plus they were never released here the same time as other countries. These days HTC, LG, Motorola, etc sell stuff all phones compared to Samsung (in Australia at least). So the old model of multiple spikes has shrunk to basically whenever Samsung releases a new S model phone. Which is why I was saying we aren't going to see an accurate representation of how Android is doing in Aus until the S8 is released. The drop in Nov 2016 would also coincide with the 2nd Note 7 recall/Samsung officially halting production. Hence the spike in Apple phones as well. Last edited January 15, 2017 8:40 am Reply 0 rocwurst @rocwurst Jan 15, 2017, 2:37am No, the Note 7 debacle was in 2016, not 2015. Mofo, my point is that even before Samsung's troubles in the latter part of 2016 with the Note 7, Android had been losing market share to the iPhone. The highest market share Android managed in ANY quarter was that 68% in June 2014 and during the rest of 2014 hovered mostly between 57% and 66%. In contrast, the highest Android managed in 2015 was 57.2%, the rest of that year Android marketshare hovered around 50-54%. In the case of the iPhone, it is even more marked - the iPhone has never hit 46.4% before. Even when iPhone 6 popularity was at its height in 2014, the iPhone only ever managed a maximum of 45.1%. The iPhone 7 is quite obviously far more popular that many commentators admit. Reply 0 M0F0 @m0f0 Jan 15, 2017, 10:28am Clearly I meant Nov 2016. Original comment updated. I'm not doubting the last 3 iPhones were popular. But you continue to focus on singular data spikes. If you want a somewhat accurate representation of growth then look at the normalised data for the year on each, which shows both OS's have been growing over the past few years (though if iOS didn't have a strong December it'll be an average decrease on the previous year). Reply 0 dknigs @dknigs Jan 12, 2017, 2:54pm I don't know why you would buy a Windows Phone. Microsoft have rebooted it so many times they clearly have no focus whatsoever, and the app gap is just ridiculous. To top it off, after killing Nokia, there aren't even any real worthwhile flagship phones. My mother picked up a Lumia 950XL, great camera, plagued with issues, and then with a smashed screen near impossible to repair. Microsoft took three goddamn months to replace the screen, and then when they gave it back the GPS is stuffed, and it overheats and turns off constantly. Not having much luck in getting it fixed under warranty, plus she's not exactly keen to give it back to them for another three months. Reply 0 rocwurst @rocwurst Jan 12, 2017, 2:57pm Campbell, why have you not titled this piece "Apple captures the largest market share EVER in Australia"? Or "Android plunges in market share in Australia"? With iOS surging almost 6% to capture a massive 46.4% marketshare, this is the huge news out of Kantar's figures as the next highest market share Apple has ever had in Australia was after the iPhone 6 launch when the iPhone captured 45.1% market share. In contrast Android has plunged from a high of 68% way back in June 2014. Why have you obfuscated this fact with a title implying these figures are good for Android? Reply 0 ApplesAndOranges Guest Jan 12, 2017, 3:31pm The figures don't mean much. Apple doesn't compete against most of the android market. Reply 0 rocwurst @rocwurst Jan 13, 2017, 12:45am While Apple only really competes against higher end Android phones, that would make Apple's smartphone market share figures even more astonishing - in those terms Apple absolutely obliterates Android in Australia. Quite extraordinary. Last edited January 13, 2017 9:32 am Reply 0 ross_co @ross_co Jan 12, 2017, 3:40pm I feel like you and Campbell are talking about two different lot of figures. He is talking sales per year and your facts are total user base in June 2014. It was only in 2015 that Android had over 50% of the market share, so your facts are incorrect in this context. Last edited January 12, 2017 3:41 pm Reply 0 rocwurst @rocwurst Jan 13, 2017, 12:43am Hi Ross, no I'm referring to Kantar's quarterly sales market share figures - exactly the same figures that Campbell is referring to in this article. Have a look at Kantar's Worldwide Smartphone tracker to see that Android hit 68% sales market share in Australia in June 2014, but now barely manages 50.1%: http://www.kantarworldpanel.com/global/smartphone-os-market-share/ If I was talking about active installed base, then Apple's iOS figures would be even higher. Last edited January 13, 2017 1:01 am Reply 0 hamish77 @hamish77 Jan 12, 2017, 5:16pm so android split over multiple companies' devices and Apple takes a whopping 46% on it's own.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) Share Written by Mike Murphy January 11, 2017 The wireless headphone market is starting to look a lot like the early smartphone market. Between Apple’s AirPods wireless headphones, and its subsidiary Beats Audio, the company has accumulated 41% of the wireless-headphones market, based on revenue, according to a report released today by market analysis firm Slice Intelligence. Apple unveiled its AirPods at its iPhone 7 press event in September last year, but only finally started shipping them to customers in December, after weeks of production delays. In the few weeks since then, which included Christmas, Slice’s calculations suggest that Apple’s headphones have managed to capture over a quarter of the entire US wireless headphone market, based on the amount of money that people are spending on these types of headphones. It’ll be interesting to see what effect Apple’s self-branded headphones has on Beats, which it bought for $3 billion in 2014. The largest drop in market share that Slice reported after the launch of the AirPods was from Beats (24% down to 15%), seemingly because Apple cannibalized some of its own market share there. While there were a range of smartphones before the iPhone, and even a few touchscreen models, it wasn’t until Apple launched its simple, well-designed model that the smartphone market truly exploded. In the first few years after its launch, Apple dominated the market, but eventually other competitors, offering cheaper models, or differentiating features from Apple, started to spring up. But even after 10 years and over 1 billion smartphones sold, Apple still holds over a 40% market share in the US, as it now does with wireless headphones. Apple’s AirPods cost $159, which sits in the middle of the price range for wireless headphones. While many of its competitors’ products are on the more expensive side, such as the Bose QC35 headphones, which cost $350; and Beats’ wireless headphones, which all cost over $200; others, such as the Sennheiser RS 120s cost $70, and the Jaybird line of wireless headphones cost around $150 and less. Slice’s data come from the digital receipts of a panel of 4.4 million US online shoppers, which it analyzes anonymously to look for representative trends in US purchases. So the market share it mentions is derived from the amount of money consumers are spending on a company’s products, rather than the number of products sold. As its data are not based on raw unit shipments, Apple could theoretically reveal completely different numbers, if it reveals any numbers at all, during its earnings call later this month. Either way, after a relatively rough 2016, which saw Apple’s year-over-year profits and revenue fall for the first time in 15 years due to relatively uninspiring product releases, it’ll be encouraging for Apple investors to see that the AirPods seem to be a hit right from the start.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search iPhone 8 release specifications point to 2 massive release options Chris Burns - Jan 11, 2017 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Apple’s iPhone 8 will be released at some point, but the data we’re looking at today suggests that it wont be out in the year 2017. Apple won’t be skipping a year for iPhone releases – there’s no good reason for them to do so. Instead, one of two major possibilities is that the next iPhone won’t be an iPhone 8 at all, but an iPhone 7s. Imagine that – Apple following the same release schedule they’ve been on for over six years – madness! While we’ve seen – and published – out fair share of articles with “iPhone 8” in the title, our most recent analysis suggests that there’ll be no such phone this year. Apple’s iPhone 7s is far, far more likely, with an iPhone 7s Plus released right beside it. This new set of iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus devices would look and feel much like their predecessors, improving both their ability to take nice photos and run smart home products with HomeKit. The image you see above comes from 3D illustrator Veniamin Geskin. This fellow has illustrated what he believes the “iPhone 8” will look like sitting next to the (also hypothetical) Samsung Galaxy S8. These devices – needless to say – seem to look more and more like one another as time goes by (and more leaks and renderings and such appear). As recent as early December of 2016 sources on the possibility of an iPhone 7s and iPhons 7s Plus launch were reported from sources like Mac Otakara. Our most recent bit of intelligence (from an anonymous source with information on the subject) suggests that the iPhone 7s naming convention has certainly been under consideration for some time – if not approved outright already. And with the iPhone 7s comes the iPhone 7s Plus – inevitably. At the same time, more than the average amount of high-end renders of conceptual iPhones of all sorts have appeared over the past year and a half. We’ve seen some really, really awesome ideas pop up in the Apple Concepts environment, and not all of them looked like the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. Several of them, in fact, looked a lot more like the iPhone 4 – flat sized and all. The second possibility with the next iPhone is that, in addition to the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, Apple could reveal an iPhone Pro. The naming convention spans back at least a couple of major products – iPad Pro and MacBook Pro included. The timing is right, too, for a more powerful iPhone meant to compete directly with the Samsung Galaxy Note series. With what Apple revealed in the newest MacBook Pro late last year, rumors of an “all-glass” iPhone Pro don’t feel out of place. These rumors don’t feel out of place anymore, that is to say – this device used to seem like an absurd idea. When the MacBook Pro 2016 was revealed with far fewer ports than ever before and a touchscreen display above its keyboard, Apple opened the doors to all manner of possibilities. The possibility of a majorly upgraded set of features for the iPhone SE could be in order. That’d require the iPhone SE to keep its name – much like the entire iPad line does now, year after year. It’d also suggest that the iPhone would stop using its yearly tick-tock upgrade naming setup. If we’re going to stay entirely realistic on iPhone 8 expectations, not many changes are going to be made to the main two models this upcoming iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus release season. The third model – we’re crossing our fingers for something above and beyond expectations in that arena. One of the best clues suggesting this three-phone schedule is a set of two images appearing this past December. These images showed three iPhone model drawings which – while scant on industrial design clues – showed how the devices might be set up inside. If an iPhone Pro exists, Apple is doing an extraordinary job of keeping its external design a secret. A third device would lead the way to what analysts at NOMURA have suggested. This group of analysts predict that this year will show Apple to run with a “supercycle” release – that’d go against the tick-tock of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7s. Within and because of this supercycle, NOMURA suggests that Apple’s release year will supplant the release of the iPhone 6 – a record-blasting release in and of itself what with its new design and 2-size release setup. Credit Suisse has predicted a super cycle with the next iPhone, as well. They suggested that Apple would hit up a September 2017 reveal and/or release date with an iPhone that’d come with an OLED display, “full glass” display, no more home button, wireless charging, and (as always) a better camera. This sounds well within the bounds of reason for the third device, but to us seems doubtful in a single-device-release. No matter what Apple reveals in the iPhone universe this year, we’ll be there with bells on. Stick around SlashGear’s Apple hub for more early info, event coverage, and reviews, too!

In the U.S., Apple’s iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 6s were the three most popular smartphones and accounted for 31.3 percent of smartphone sales for the three months ended Nov. 30. Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge were the next two best-selling phones, giving the Korean firm 28.9 percent of the market, according to data released Wednesday by Kantar WorldPanel. The iPhone also did well in the major European countries, Kantar said, accounting for nearly a quarter of the market. Android also gained market share, to 72.4 percent, as Windows continued to fade, now accounting for just 3 percent there. China continued to be a challenging market for the iPhone, with its market share dipping below 20 percent, down from more than 25 percent in the same period of 2015. While Android continues to grow its share of the global smartphone market, it is actually losing share in the U.S. Kantar’s data shows Android phones making up 55 percent of U.S. smartphone sales compared with more than 60 percent in the same period a year ago. Google’s Pixel phone accounted for 1.3 percent of smartphones sold, Kantar said, with more than half of its sales coming through Verizon. It’s worth noting that Apple tends to gain market share in the holiday quarter, though Kantar notes that Android has lost share in the U.S. for the past six quarters. Apple’s full quarterly results, which should provide a fuller picture on how the iPhone did in the final quarter of the year, are set to be released on Jan. 31.

What's going on? On Tuesday, Tesla announced that it had hired Chris Lattner as its new Vice President of Autopilot Software. Lattner was at Apple for more than eleven years, most recently serving as its senior director of developer tools. Lattner is the creator of the Swift programming language, which Apple launched back in 2014, and which the company has been encouraging its app developers to build Mac and iOS apps in. As director of developer tools, Lattner was also responsible for Xcode (Apple's integrated development environment, i.e. the software you use to build apps for Apple platforms) and the CPU and GPU compilers used within Apple and by third-party developers. In the words of John Gruber, he's a "holy shit" hire by Tesla. Lattner isn't the only high-profile engineer to leave Apple for Tesla. On Wednesday, 9to5Mac reported that Matt Casebolt, who was a director of product design at Apple, left the company in December to join Tesla. Casebolt's LinkedIn profile has the Mac Pro, the MacBook Pro with Force Touch trackpad, MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, Retina MacBook Pro, and the MacBook Air on his resume. He had been at Apple for more than nine years and his name is on a number of patents. Business Insider suggests Lattner may have been on Jony Ive's close-knit team of designers and engineers, a team that typically has very low turnover. It would be the second high-profile departure from that group in recent months. In April, Danny Coster, a core member of Apple's design team under Ive for over 20 years, left to join GoPro. Coster, amongst other accomplishments, was the lead designer on the first iMac. Another new Tesla hire from within the last month is Timothy Hatcher, who spent eleven years at Apple on the WebKit team. WebKit is the rendering engine that powers the Safari web browser on iOS and macOS and an important piece of software at Apple. Hatcher is now at Tesla as a UI engineer. At a company with more than 100,000 employees, turnover is certainly going to happen. Still, losing longtime engineers who by all accounts were not working on automotive software at Apple to a company like Tesla could be cause for concern. It's not just engineers leaving for car companies, either. As The Verge reported in November, three members of Apple's PR team have left for car companies in the last few months. Additionally, there are signs that not everything is rosy inside Apple. Apple reportedly cut production of the iPhone-its marquee product-by ten percent for the first quarter of 2017. In an annual SEC filing last week, Apple revealed its profit and revenue fell short of its own internal goals-the first time the company has missed since 2009. Apple also reportedly pivoted Project Titan-the Apple Car project-away from building a car itself and more towards software. As a result, hundreds of hardware and software engineers left the company. Tesla, which has been actively poaching Apple employees for years, could be a natural fit. Elon Musk, Tesla's founder and CEO, has said that Tesla's "design philosophy" is "closely aligned" with that of Apple. We've reached out to Apple for comment its engineering departures and will update if we hear back. Here is a list of some of the high level employees who have left Apple since January 2016 and where they have gone, if that information is available: Bob Kupbens, VP Apple online store - eBay Hiroki Asai, VP global marketing communications Yoky Matsuoka, Health at Apple Danny Coster, director of product design (member ofJony Ive's industrial design team) - Go Pro Sarah O'Brien, PR - Tesla Colin Smith, PR - Ford Michaela Johndrow, PR - Ford Chris Lattner, director of developer tools - Tesla Matt Casebolt, director of product design - Tesla David Erhart, director of reliability engineering - Tesla Chester Chipperfield, special projects - Tesla Charles Kuehmann. director of product design - Tesla Steve Zadesky, Project Titan (Apple car) boss Sal Soghoian, product manager of automation technologies Daniel Gross, software director- Y Combinator Thomas Zwingman, senior staff reliability engineer - Tesla Sankarshan Murthy, product manager, worked on Apple Watch and iPhone 5C - Tesla Timothy Hatcher, software engineering manager on WebKit - Tesla Teresa Brewer, PR - SurveyMonkey Bart Nabbe special projects - Faraday Future David Finkelstein, manager of cryptographic security - Google Ryan Walsh, senior product for media - Floodgate Andrew Graham, motion sensors engineer - Tesla Brooke Michael Kain, head of digital marketing for Apple Music and iTunes - AEG Live Now obviously, we can't say for sure what's going on, or why.

It is believed Apple has joined forces with German lens specialist Carl Zeiss to create AR/mixed reality smart glasses that will arrive on the market sometime this year. This is according to tech evangelist Robert Scoble, who claimed a Zeiss employee confirmed the partnership at this year's CES. "A Zeiss employee confirmed the rumours that Apple and Carl Zeiss AG are working on a light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year.," he wrote on his Facebook page. "That explains why there was no augmented reality in Zeiss's booth even though it was right in the middle of the AR area." Photos View Photo Gallery   Augmented reality differs from virtual reality as it superimposes a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, instead of creating a fully immersive new world. The most popular example of the technology has been seen with Pokemon Go, which saw computer generated Pokemon appearing in the real world. Photos View Photo Gallery   CATCH UP WITH OUR COVERAGE OF CES 2017 HERE This isn't the first time the company has been rumoured to be entering into the world of AR, with Apple's chief executive Tim Cook being vocal about his interest. "[AR] gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present, talking to each other, but also have other things - visually - for both of us to see," he told ABC News last September. "There's a lot of really cool things there." Nick Verreos talks FashionWare at CES 2017: Nick Verreos, of Project Runway fame, talks about the FashionWare high-tech fashions at CES 2017 in Las Vegas. Cook went onto say the "present" nature of AR made it more commercially viable than VR. "Virtual reality sort of encloses and immerses the person into an experience that can be really cool, but probably has a lower commercial interest over time," he said. "Less people will be interested in that." Additionally, Apple has filed a number of AR patents with the US Patent and Trademark Office, including a "transparent electronic device". apple Read More Login to follow augmented reality Read More Login to follow ces 2017 Read More Login to follow editors picks Read More Login to follow pokemon go Read More Login to follow virtual reality Read More Login to follow Topics:  apple augmented reality ces 2017 editors picks pokemon go virtual reality 0 PRINT Just In Four children injured in single-vehicle highway smash OPINION: Tomizawa feeds the flames Help special athletes reach their goals SPER: Govt cracking down on Ipswich's $40M debt Search on after couple kidnapped, locked in container Suburban shooting may have been mistaken identity: Police Top Stories Help special athletes reach their goals Program for special need athletes in desperate need of coaches News 16th Jan 2017 1:00 PM Comment SPER: Govt cracking down on Ipswich's $40M debt Search on after couple kidnapped, locked in container Police call interpreter for probe into kidnapping claim Suburban shooting may have been mistaken identity: Police Police puzzled over motive for attack 'Shattered': Single dad victim in morning hit and run Ipswich man's parked car, house badly damaged Local Partners Community Your Story Local History More Community What's On Gatton family claims game show success A GATTON family walked away with more than $11,000 after an exciting three-night run on game show Family Feud.

Dubbed the Travel Power Bank, the accessory is one the of the first battery packs we’ve seen for Apple Watch and it comes in a bitesize package. The Travel Power Bank is keychain-sized and includes an inductive charging pad for powering your Apple Watch when it is running low on juice. The pack includes 800mAh of extra power, and while that seems a bit small, it’s enough to recharge Apple Watch four times, The Travel Power Bank charges via microUSB and features a single power button for turning the device on and off. Carrying around an Apple Watch charging dock on your keychain seems a tad cumbersome, but the idea is that it’s small enough to not add too much weight to your keychain yet be useful in emergency situations. You’ll also obviously have to have the pack on somewhat of a level and stable surface for the inductive charging feature of Apple Watch to work consistently. Nevertheless, it’s better than carrying around Apple’s own charger and wall adapter all of the time. Griffin’s Travel Power Bank will be available in the second quarter of this year for $69.99. It doesn’t appear that the Travel Power Bank is capable of charging anything aside from Apple Watch at this point. Furthermore, Griffin has also introduced a pair of Apple Watch bands today. The Trainer Watch Band is a sweat-proof silicone band that runs $39.99 and is made for 42mm Apple Watch models. The Trainer Watch Band will be available in black, white, red, and blue in Q3 2016. The Uptown Leather Band is a more professional option and will run $59.99 when released in Q3. It will be available in toffee/gold, black/silver, ecru/rose gold, and seafoam/silver.

Dave Robeson - 1 year ago Reply I’ll be excited about this Watch charger once they ship the PowerBlock 3 they announced a year ago. Not being snarky; I will buy this, but I don’t believe they’ll ship it when they say they will. Keith R Thompson - 1 year ago Reply Nine months to bring a watch band to market? Seriously? JBDragon - 1 year ago Reply $70 for this 800 mAh Apple Watch charger? To me, that just seems silly. I sure don’t want a bulky thing as this dangling on my keychain. By the way, you can actually screw up the ignition key slot in your car from to much weight. People have these keychains with a bunch of keys on and it weighs quite bit. over time, that’s a failure waiting to happen! If you need to charge your Apple Watch because you’re away on a trip, maybe not near a power source, don’t you need to charge up your iPhone also? it generally only lasts a day. My Apple Watch can last 2 days. So you now need another power pack for your iPhone to charge. OR You get a single power back, I got one for under $15 on sale at Amazon, a 10,000 mAh with duel USB ports for under $15. I can plug a lighting cable into one and a Apple Watch puck into the other and charge both at once. It’s cheaper, does both, and I can get a number of charges from it for both. A new Apple Watch charger is $30 from Apple and you know that’s already over priced as Apple things are, so $70? I mean really? That is crazy. Myron Marvin - 5 days ago Reply I just bought one of these to replace the much larger TOPVISION 4000 mAh Portable Charger that has been to India and South Africa with me. I’ve been on a number of long distance flights spanning up to 36 hours when counting change of planes and lounge time, so I need something small to keep the watch charged. However, there is a mystery button on the device and even Griffin tech support doesn’t know why it’s there. It doesn’t seem to actually do anything.

The company's Mac shipments totaled 5.3 million units during the fourth quarter of 2016, a decline of just 0.9 percent compared to the same quarter in 2015. That compares favorably to overall Mac shipments in 2016, which totaled 18.4 million units, a decline of 9.8 percent compared to 2015, according to IDC.  Apple launched the new MacBook Pros in late October, and it was considered a significant upgrade. Had the new MacBook Pros shipped for all three months, the quarterly growth may have jumped up to flat or positive territory. But that's still not an encouraging sign for MacBook Pros, which haven't provided an overwhelming boost to worldwide Mac shipments. Apple will share its Mac shipment numbers during an earnings call on Jan. 31. Apple's shipment numbers haven't always agreed with figures from research firms like IDC and Gartner. The MacBook Pros were met with mixed reviews. They had new features like the Touch Bar, which received a lukewarm reaction. The Macs were also criticized for including Intel's older Skylake chips and not the newer Kaby Lake chips. Windows PCs and Chromebooks are performing better. Apple was the fourth-largest PC maker in the world behind Lenovo, HP, and Dell, all of which recorded positive shipment growth during the fourth quarter of 2016. Nevertheless, Apple's Mac shipments are recovering, and it comes at a time when PC shipments are also stabilizing. PC shipments in the fourth quarter totaled 70.2 million, declining by just 1.5 percent compared to the same quarter in 2015, according to IDC. The numbers include traditional PCs and not devices with detachable keyboards, which are considered tablets. Competing analyst firm Gartner has predicted PC shipments will go through minor quarterly declines until returning to positive growth in 2017. One reason for the recovery was a clear delineation of product categories. Tablets aren't considered competition anymore, and many customers are returning to laptops and desktops for their primary computing needs. Gaming PCs have thrived in the last year as interest in virtual reality and eSports grows. Holiday deals boosted PC sales in the U.S. and Europe, and the consumer PC market is recovering, IDC said. Shipments also were robust in China as buyers moved to thin and light devices. Lenovo's PC shipments totaled 15.7 million, growing by 1.7 percent, maintaining a 22.4 percent market share. HP's shipments totaled 15.27 million, growing by 6.6 percent, a 21.7 percent market share. Dell recorded the biggest quarterly gain with its shipments growing by 8.6 percent to 11 million units. Asus was the fifth largest PC maker behind Apple, and its shipments declined by 11.3 percent to 5.1 million units. In 2016, shipments of PCs totaled 260 million units, declining by 5.7 percent compared to 2015. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Club MacStoriesWeekly Extras MENU ABOUT CONTACT NEWSLETTER ADVERTISE SECTIONS APP REVIEWS LINKED STORIES iOS 10 WWDC 2016 App Extensions Are Not a Replacement for User Automation 3D Touch for Power Users My Favorite iMessage Apps and Sticker Packs of 2016 App Extensions Are Not a Replacement for User Automation By Sal Soghoian Here’s a thought experiment. Let’s imagine that Apple decided to combine their engineering resources to form app teams that delivered both iOS and macOS versions of applications. In such a scenario it may seem logical to retain application features common to both platforms and to remove those that were perceived to require extra resources. Certainly Automation would be something examined in that regard, and the idea might be posited that: “App Extensions are equivalent to, or could be a replacement for, User Automation in macOS.” And by User Automation, I’m referring to Apple Event scripting, Automator, Services, the UNIX command line utilities, etc. Let’s examine the validity of that conjecture, beginning with overviews of App Extensions and User Automation. What are App Extensions? App Extensions (often called simply “extensions”) are essentially application (or framework) plugins that provide the functionality to perform specific tasks, such as manipulate an image, post media items to social services, share items and documents, or filter an audio stream. There are many types of extensions, and you control their use in the Extensions preference pane of the System Preferences application. But the most important ability of App Extensions is that they can be used by apps other than the one in which they are contained. For example, an application that creates QR codes may also contain an app extension that enables other applications to use the containing application’s functions to create and place QR codes within their own documents. Extensions physically exist as bundles (with the file extension “appex”) placed within their containing application’s bundle. However, macOS will make them available while you are using other applications by placing them at “extension points,” such as in the Share Menu, or in the Photos application when it is in edit mode. In the example shown above, extensions included in the Pixelmator application are available as filter and editing options in the Photos application. When an extension is chosen, the Photos interface changes to display the image and extension controls. You can make edits to the image using the tools provided by the extension, click the “Save Changes” button, and you will be returned to the standard Photos interface. Extension Points are exposed in multiple locations in macOS, from additional data sharing options added to the Share Menu, to inline content such as the Markup extension in Mail. The chart below lists some of the macOS extension points (types): How do App Extensions work? By design, most App Extensions follow specific rules governing how they function. In general: Some app extensions, like content blockers, can run without user interaction. But other extensions, like those that manipulate images, are triggered only by direct user action, such as selecting a menu item, or pressing a button. Once triggered by the user, the extension is provided a copy of the current object or data selected in the hosting application. The extension may display a user interface (if needed), then processes the data, and returns the edited data to the hosting app. Untitled Replay By design, App Extensions have restricted access to resources outside of their bundle, and have restrictions placed upon them in regard to their access to the macOS frameworks, networks, and the user environment. Who creates App Extensions? App Extensions are created by Apple developers in Xcode using either the Swift or Objective-C programming languages. Non-programmers are not the target audience for developing app extensions. App Extensions Summary App Extensions are developer-created application plugins, exposing powerful functionality within multiple applications at pre-determined “Extension Points,” such as in the Share Menu, or in the Today view of the Notification Center. App Extensions are executed within a defined set of parameters and restrictions, and their scope is often limited to processing the selection in the host application. What is User Automation? The term User Automation represents multiple technologies and architectures whose purpose is to enable the user to create simple or extended workflows for editing documents, processing data, and performing repetitive tasks. The technologies of User Automation operate with the user’s level of authority and are not restricted in the scope of their abilities: whatever the user can do, they can do. They have unrivaled access to the frameworks of the operating system, and to the extensive library of UNIX tools that ship with macOS. And most importantly, AppleScript, JavaScript (JXA), and Automator can directly query and control scriptable applications using Apple Events, the inter-application communication technology that has existed on the Mac since System 7. macOS applications that support Apple Events are said to be “scriptable,” in that they allow the built-in Cocoa scripting frameworks of macOS to communicate with and control the application and its elements. Every “scriptable” application includes a “dictionary” providing detailed information about every scriptable object in the application and the commands used to interact with them. As an example, the dictionary excerpt shown below is from the Keynote application’s dictionary, and describes the slide object of a Keynote presentation document. slide n : [inh. iWork container; see also Compatibility Suite] : A slide in a presentation document. elements contains audio clips, charts, iWork items, lines, movies, shapes, tables, text items; contained by document. properties base slide ( master slide ) : The master slide this slide is based upon. body showing ( boolean ) : Is the default body text item visible on the slide? default body item ( text item r/o ) : The default text item container for the body text of the slide. Its visibility is determined by the value of the body showing property. default title item ( text item r/o ) : The default text item container for the title text of the slide. Its visibility is determined by the value of the title showing property. presenter notes ( rich text ) : The presenter notes for the slide. skipped ( boolean ) : Is the slide skipped? slide number ( integer r/o ) : The index of the slide from the beginning of the document. Note: skipped slides have a slide number value of -1. Un-skipped slides have a positive slide number value. title showing ( boolean ) : Is the default title text item visible on the slide? transition properties ( transition settings ) : A list of key/value pairs for the properties of the slide’s transition. responds to get, set, delete, exists, make, move, duplicate Using this dictionary, scripts written using the macOS scripting languages can create, move, duplicate, and delete slides, as well as change their master slide, read, set, and edit their displayed text, add images and video elements, and even adjust whether they are skipped or shown. No other architecture or framework in macOS offers the ability to query and control the internal workings of applications like Apple Events. And most of the important productivity applications, such as Microsoft Office, Adobe InDesign, and the excellent suite of apps from the Omni Group, include robust and extensive scripting support, and are the “go-to apps” for implementing powerful user automation workflows. Apple Events are used to communicate with applications. For communication with the OS and its tools, the User Automation technologies of AppleScript and JavaScript (JXA) have integrated code “bridges” that provide them access to all of the Cocoa frameworks, some of which are listed in this graphic. Using these frameworks as well as the default UNIX tools of macOS, the scope of what scripts can do expands to an impressive range of abilities. And since User Automation can freely work between applications and frameworks, creating workflows that involve multiple apps and the transformation of data are common practice. For example, the workflow shown in the animation below begins with converting a table in a Numbers document into a chart in Keynote, then adding text, generating a QR code, and finally sending the completed Keynote document in an email message. All of these actions are possible with user automation. Untitled Replay Below is the AppleScript script code used to transfer and transform Numbers table data into a new chart in Keynote. As you can see, scripting support (Apple Events) provides direct access to the internal workings of the iWork applications. An Apple Events-based script can deep query the selected table object in Numbers to retrieve a range of data, and then use the retrieved data to create a new slide and chart in Keynote. tell application "Numbers" tell the front document set aTable to the first table of active sheet whose class of selection range is range set aRange to cell range of aTable tell aTable copy {column count, row count} to {columnCount, rowCount} copy {header column count, header row count, footer row count} to {headerColumnCount, headerRowCount, FooterRowCount} set dataColumnCount to columnCount - headerColumnCount set dataRowCount to rowCount - headerRowCount - FooterRowCount if headerRowCount is 0 then set columnNames to {} repeat dataColumnCount times set the end of the columnNames to "" end repeat else set columnNames to the formatted value of cells (headerColumnCount + 1) thru -1 of row headerRowCount end if if headerColumnCount is 0 then set rowNames to {} repeat dataRowCount times set the end of the rowNames to "" end repeat else set rowNames to the formatted value of cells (headerRowCount + 1) thru (FooterRowCount - 1) of column headerColumnCount end if set topLeftRangeCellID to the name of cell (headerColumnCount + 1) of row (headerRowCount + 1) set bottomRightRangeCellID to the name of last cell of row ((FooterRowCount + 1) * -1) set tableDataRange to range (topLeftRangeCellID & ":" & bottomRightRangeCellID) set cellValuesArray to value of every cell of tableDataRange set chartData to {} set x to 1 repeat ((count of cellValuesArray) div dataColumnCount) times set the end of chartData to items x thru (x + (dataColumnCount - 1)) of cellValuesArray set x to x + dataColumnCount end repeat end tell end tell end tell tell application "Keynote" activate tell front document set aSlide to make new slide with properties {base slide:master slide "Blank"} tell aSlide add chart row names rowNames column names columnNames data chartData type vertical_bar_2d group by chart column end tell end tell end tell Open in Script Editor And if you prefer using a scripting language other than AppleScript, the same Apple Event functionality could be delivered via a JavaScript (JXA) script… var Keynote = Application('com.apple.iWork.Keynote') Keynote.activate() var frontDocument = Keynote.documents[0] var aMasterSlide = frontDocument.masterSlides["Blank"] var newSlide = Keynote.Slide({baseSlide:aMasterSlide}) frontDocument.slides.push(newSlide) Keynote.addChart(newSlide,{rowNames:rwNames, columnNames:colNames, data:chartData, type:"vertical_bar_2d", groupBy:"chart row"}) Excerpt shown here, open in script editor to see the full script. …or by using Automator actions for Keynote. Automator And then there’s Automator. The unrivaled tool for creating your own “automation recipes” using a simple drag-and-drop process of stringing together nuggets of predefined functionality (Automator actions) into “workflows.” Saved workflows can be executed at integrated extension points throughout macOS, including: as contextual System Services, as Image Capture and Print to PDF plugins, as Folder Actions, as Script Menu items, as Calendar alarms, and even as stand-alone applets or droplets. There’s a common misconception that Automator is “visual-AppleScript,” but Automator is actually language-agnostic. Its “actions” can be written in nearly every macOS-supported automation language: AppleScript, AppleScriptObj-C, JavaScript, Shell, perl, python, ruby, and Objective-C. Automator can drive Apple Events, the UNIX utilities, and the Cocoa frameworks, within a single workflow. Automator also has an extensive variable architecture for capturing, generating, and reusing data during the execution of its workflows. Automator is unprecedented in its scope and abilities in macOS. No application or system service comes close to matching what it can do. But the most amazing thing about Automator is that powerful automation tools can be created by users without writing a single line of code—like this contextual system service that combines the PDF files selected in the Finder: Who creates User Automation tools? Which brings up the question: who creates User Automation tools? In my 23-years of working with customers and businesses around the globe, it is my observation that the majority of automation solutions are created in-house by customers and employees, motivated to address the challenges, complexities, and redundancies they face in their day-to-day work. Of course this is not to say that I have not witnessed numerous solutions created by professionals for businesses, some of which involved very elaborate and powerful codebases, but much of the time an automation solution is as simple as a script or collection of scripts created by someone who is not a programmer or developer. Automation tools aren't limited to scripts and some may display interfaces (such as Automator actions) for interacting dynamically with the user. These tools are usually written in Xcode, using the provided AppleScript application and Automator actions templates. Xcode automation projects can incorporate all of the standard UI elements, outlets, actions, and bindings used in the creation of traditional macOS and iOS applications. For writing AppleScript or JavaScript (JXA) scripts, you can use the Script Editor application that ships with every copy of macOS, or for composing and editing AppleScript and AppleScriptObj-C scripts you can use feature-rich 3rd-party editors like Script Debugger that include code-completion and step-by-step debugging. Summary User Automation involves a variety of languages and technologies. The native Apple Events architecture of macOS provides the means for communicating with applications via scripts or code. The Objective-C bridges for JavaScript (JXA) and AppleScript (AppleScriptObj-C) provide access to the Cocoa frameworks that are the foundation of macOS. And specialized scripting additions (OSAX) deliver access to the UNIX command line and the numerous utilities that come with being a UNIX-based OS. And then there’s Automator, which has access to practically everything. But putting the technicalities aside, the whole purpose of User Automation is to serve the user of the computer, to enable a motivated customer to use and create automation tools, like scripts, workflows, and applets, without restrictions or the requirement of being a developer proficient in Xcode and Objective-C or Swift. User Automation is for the rest of us. Ah, remember that old chestnut? Conclusion Tubes and Wires. I came across this quote the other day: AppleScript has survived and remained relevant during a turbulent decade-long transition, despite its unbeloved language syntax and technical hurdles, for the simple reason that it solves real-world problems in a way that no other OS X technology does. In theory, AppleScript could be much better; in practice, though, it’s the best thing we have that works. It exemplifies the Mac’s advantages over iOS for tinkerers and advanced users. —John Gruber, Macworld, Dec 12, 2012, The unlikely persistence of AppleScript App Extensions and the User Automation technologies have some similarities but many differences. App Extensions are written by developers. User Automation is often written by customers. App Extensions provide restricted manipulation of selected data, while User Automation enables open query and control of applications and frameworks. App Extensions represent a habitat of “approved” developer-created tubes, while User Automation is about connecting wires to application and framework APIs to create a flow. App Extensions exist as app plugins. User Automation technologies are manifested as scripts, workflows, applets, droplets, applications, services, and plugins, available globally and at extension points throughout macOS. Based upon the information presented in this overview, it is clear that App Extensions do not provide the same abilities and functionality as the User Automation technologies of macOS, and objectively should not be considered a comparable replacement for them. Of course, this conclusion assumes that customers should retain the same level of control over their devices as provided by the current User Automation in macOS. Such is the foundation of the credo that the power of the computer should reside in the hands of the one using it. But let’s take a step back, and think about this topic differently. Why not have both? Perhaps it is time for Apple and all of us to think of User Automation and App Extensions in terms of "AND" instead of "OR." To embrace the development of a new cross-platform automation architecture, maybe called “AutomationKit,” that would incorporate the “everyman openness” of User Automation with the focused abilities of developer-created plugins. App Extensions could become the new macOS System Services, and Automator could save workflows as Extensions with access to the Share Menu and new “non-selection” extension points. And AutomationKit could even include an Apple Event bridge so that it would work with the existing macOS automation tools. App Extensions could become another type of User Automation. What a concept.

I’d like a “less is more” approach. HealthView offers exactly that – rather than providing you information scattered throughout the app, you choose what you want to see, how you want to see it, and when it appears. Although it’s not as robust as Apple’s Health, HealthView may just be a better fit for your needs. Choose Your Data Between the iPhone’s built-in tracking features and those you might get from third-party accessories, you likely have some data that you do – and, sometimes more importantly, don’t – want displayed in a health dashboard. When setting up HealthView, this process is broken down into two easy steps. When you launch the app for the first time, HealthView will ask you what metrics you’d like to include. By scrolling through the options and flipping switches, you can select anything that might interest you. I’ve chosen steps, distance, burned calories, stand hours, flights climbed, sleep, and heart rate; since Health integrates with a variety of third-party apps, it's easy to get measurements on hydration, caffeine, and even Nike Fuel. Once you’ve made your selections, HealthView will ask you to confirm that it’s okay to import this data from Health. Turning all categories on is simple, but if you want to go one-by-one to review what you previously chose, that can be done too. View Your Health One aspect that immediately struck me about HealthView is that it displays your information in a much more glanceable way than Apple's Health. The app will show data in two formats: list view and goal view. The former is a more numerical display, putting the raw data right in front of you with an array of digits and bar graphs. The goal view, however, is more focused on glyphs and rings (like you’d find in the Activity app). I’ve been primarily using the goal view – I find it more visually appealing and it doesn’t require me to scroll through the data. More detailed information, like a larger bar graph or goal progress, can be found by tapping into a metric. I’ve fallen in love with the decision to put data behind a tap this way because it lets me access more information only when I want it and, as it turns out, I don’t want it that frequently. Along the top of the activity page lies a menu bar for shifting between different time spans. You’ll probably spend most of your time in the day view, but there are also options to see an overview of your week, month, and year. HeathView for Apple Watch HealthView lives on your Apple Watch through a complication and a standalone app. The complication, depending on your watch face, will display the data of your choosing – for example, the bottom right complication slot on my “Simple” watch face is my step counter. To change this, you’ll want to head over to the settings in HealthView on the iPhone. The HealthView app for Apple Watch does much of what its companion does on the iPhone, showing you a pre-chosen set of information in glanceable and in-depth ways. Again, configuration for what is displayed on the Apple Watch is done in settings, and you can choose from a long list of metrics to show. 3D Touch and the Widget HealthView for iPhone supports 3D Touch, meaning you can peek and pop into your data sets for quicker mobility around the app. The peek action is exceptionally useful – it gives you just enough information to be worth it, but doesn’t clutter up your screen. HealthView also offers a nice widget that will show three measurements of your choosing for the day. I’ve kept the default (steps, distance, and burned calories), but this is fully customizable to your preference. Conclusion For those turned off by the complexity of the stock Health app, HealthView is a superb alternative. I’ve been enjoying the ability to customize my data, glance at my step counts, and get more information when I see fit. From my perspective, even people who like Health should give HealthView a shot; I haven’t experienced any true downsides to making the switch. And with its presence on the Apple Watch, I can have more health data whenever I want. If you’d like to try HealthView, you can find it on the App Store for $1.99 (iPhone only).

One video from Sonny Dickson, showing what looks like an iPod interface with a virtual click wheel, has attracted a ton of attention, since the longstanding story has been that two teams inside Apple competed to make the iPhone — one to turn the iPod into a phone, and the other to shrink OS X to work on a mobile device. Not so, says Tony Fadell, who led the iPod team at Apple and then the iPhone team. He called me from the Detroit Auto Show, where he’s presenting on panels related to autonomous cars, to clarify what we’re seeing here. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. So there’s this video floating around, and a bunch of stories about the early days of the iPhone project, and the two competing approaches to the phone at the beginning. There was tons and tons of different UI development, between both software and hardware development. It was a competing set of ideas, not teams, and we were all working on it. “There were probably 16, 17 different concepts.” Sometimes stupid things only seem stupid at first, but if you break through, it actually becomes smart. Like, "Oh, everyone would want to type on a hardware keyboard, no one wants to type on glass.” Those kinds of things. You had to keep pushing people so that their first knee-jerk reaction isn't the answer. There were probably 16, 17 different concepts. So tell me, this thing that we're seeing right now looks completely bonkers. There's a touchscreen clickwheel, there's an iPod interface... what is that thing? So there were two different types of prototypes. There's one, a prototype for the UI team, and typically, because UI teams are using Director — back in the day — and quickly mocking things up on a screen. One team is doing it like it's an iPod, and another team is doing it like it was a touchscreen. The teams were working together. So it wasn't like there were two different people trying different things. And then there was the development board prototypes where we’d rewrite the UI on the hardware to try things like touchscreen and hardware buttons. So there were two tracks in hardware and software UI development running at all times. And so the thing that you're seeing [in that video] was just what the UI guys were doing, devoid of any hardware, doing it on a Mac. That thing's running on hardware in the latest videos. They're not running Director on that prototype. Somebody ported something to actual iPhones. So, somewhere along the way, somebody decided to port it just for fun. There were no hardware demos. It first started on the Mac. And then we did the clickwheel, because we had a clickwheel iPod, so we were trying to build on the clickwheel iPod. But that’s too hard to edit the UI on, so you'd do it on the computer and move it over to the iPod. That explains why there's that Aqua interface element — what we're looking at here is a Mac app for iPod emulation. It's a Mac app, exactly. It could have been Director, it could have been something else. But yeah. So how did it end up on an iPhone prototype? Somebody ported it later. Someone in Apple, or somewhere else? I have no idea. Someone, somewhere ported that thing, and that's why it's shown side by side. It was never, we never had anything like that at Apple when we were making decisions. So clearly there had been work done. The top half of that prototype we're seeing is a bunch of iPod menu trees for a phone. The bottom half is some weird emulation thing. So you clearly got pretty far down the line of "Let's make the iPod a phone." How did the decision to go the other way come about? Let's back up a little bit. The first thing was, we wanted to make an iPod Video product work better. So let's put a big screen on an iPod, remove the wheel, and make the wheel virtual, so you can look at widescreen videos and pictures. Because the clickwheel was getting in the way, and we wanted to not make the device bigger, but we wanted to just add a bigger screen, we wanted to try to figure out. So that's the virtual wheel, that was another offshoot that we tried. "Let's look at a multitouch thing." Then there was the iPod phone, which would keep the screen small — a lot like that Nokia small screen design. Then we'd just use the wheel as the interface because that's so iconic. Let’s not lose the wheel — all the marketing people's minds will blow up. So let's try that one. But what really failed at the end of the day with the iPod Phone was that you couldn't dial a number. Like, 1, 2, 3, like a rotary phone. Everything else was working but the one main thing that didn't work was dialing a regular number — it was so cumbersome. So we said, "This isn't working either." And then there was a third thing, and this was what led us down the road to the virtual clickwheel, of "let's look at a multitouch thing." And then let's change the interface entirely, to where it came today, which was the tiles. So we started with the wheel and then we went to the tiles, both virtual and physical. So when you're in the room with Steve and whoever else, what are you advocating for, and what are they advocating for? A lot of us saw very early on that you couldn't make the clickwheel work for dialing a phone really quickly. So we’d say, “Steve, we don't want to spend time on this.” And Steve would go, "No, I want you to do it. Go and do it. You have to try it. Try." The Nokia 3650. This was not a good idea. We tried everything. We tried having little buttons on the clickwheel so you could click. There was a Nokia phone where they had a circular pattern for the numbers, in hard buttons, and Steve was like "Go make that work." So we tried that. And we went, "Steve, give it up, it's going to be too hard. It's not going to work." So we were halfway through, like four weeks or five weeks into it, and we said "This is not working." We pushed this for like another four, five weeks to keep trying, and we're saying, "This is a waste of time." But we had to be ready, because that's what he wanted. It was the same thing with the hardware keyboard. Steve said, "No, we're going to make this keyboard work, on the glass." So tell me what ended up happening with the iPod OS version of the iPhone. Before I took over the division, Jon [Rubinstein] was running the division. There was a Linux-based OS that Jon and a couple of other people had started, and then there was the reduced OS X that Avie [Tevanian] had started with Scott [Forstall]. They were competing to see which one was better. He and Jon had that battle. I took over and we had a few conditions to make sure it could work on the hardware, since macOS was so big at the time. And then I killed the embedded Linux project, because I knew that was the much better way to go. And Steve was happy and all that stuff. It was a couple of weeks from the time I took over the division to the time I was convinced that we would be able to move forward with the Purple OS. Purple was the codename of what we now know as iOS? It was never the code name of the other thing? Correct. Sure. In terms of choosing the hardware, how did you land on the ARM processor? It came from the iPod. We took all the stuff from the iPod onto that. Ultimately, later after the iPhone was successful, then Steve was trying to do the switch to Intel, and that's where the Isaacson book and that whole scene about Intel vs. ARM [came from]. But it was always ARM from the beginning, it was not even a decision, because we were building up from the iPod. “It was a brutal slog to execute it all and ship it, but the design was so good.” What was the moment that you knew that you had the winner product? Well, I don't know if we had the winner product, I think we had the winner design. There's a distinction. It became immediately clear when we had enough of the touch working on the real hardware and the software working on the real hardware, compared to the other one, it was so galvanizing, it was so immediate, when we passed enough of those hurdles that we knew we had the winning design. It was a brutal slog to execute it all and ship it, but the design was so good. The design and the whole idea and vision of what we were trying to do, that no one had any questions. It was just, let's burn down all the rest to get this thing to ship.

(AP) As of Wednesday, January 11, 2017 Sign in to favorite this Discuss Comment, Blog about Share this Email, Facebook, Twitter Few people realised it at the time, but the world shifted fundamentally a decade ago when Steve Jobs pulled the first iPhone from Apple’s bag of technological tricks. “Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything,” Jobs declared as he paced across a San Francisco stage. It obviously wasn’t an empty boast. We all know now that Jobs’ “magical product” has reshaped culture, shaken up industries, put computers in billions of pockets and made it possible to do just about anything with a few taps on a screen. Besides its then 3.5-inch touch screen, the first iPhone featured a browser for on-the-go web surfing and built-in apps to check email and get directions. GOING MOBILE Apple has sold more than 1 billion iPhones since its debut, spawning millions of mobile applications and prodding other technology companies to make similar smartphones that have become like phantom limbs for many of us. We use iPhones and their copycats to instantly share video and pictures with friends and family from almost anywhere. We use them to figure out where we are going. We use them to find the best deals while shopping in stores and to pay for stuff at the checkout stand. We use the phones to a hail ride, to tune instruments, to monitor our health and help find our next jobs. Phones have gotten so smart that they even talk back to us via helpful digital concierges such as the iPhone’s Siri and the recently introduced Assistant on Google’s Pixel phone. “IPhone is an essential part of our customers’ lives, and today more than ever it is redefining the way we communicate, entertain, work and live,” Apple’s current CEO, Tim Cook, boasted in a retrospective that the Cupertino, California, company posted on its website. ROADKILL IN ITS WAKE The iPhone’s revolutionary touch screen doomed the BlackBerry, another once-popular internet-connected phone. Mobile phones and their tablet cousins triggered a downturn in personal computer sales that is still unfolding. An estimated 219 million desktop and laptop computers shipped worldwide last year, down from 264 million in 2007, according to the research firm Gartner Inc. Meanwhile, nearly 1.9 billion mobile phones shipped last year, up from 1.15 billion in 2007. All told, Gartner estimates about 5 billion mobile phones are currently in use around the world compared to 1.3 billion PCs. The eroding popularity of PCs spurred shake-ups at powerful tech companies such as Microsoft, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Dell, none of which adapted nimbly to the mobile world unleashed by the iPhone. Then-Microsoft’s CEO Steve Ballmer scoffed at Apple’s glass-and-metal gadget, telling USA Today in April 2007 that “there’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance.” Microsoft wound up squandering the $7.6 billion that it spent to buy phone maker Nokia in a futile attempt to catch up to the iPhone. Ballmer stepped down as CEO three years ago and was replaced by Satya Nadella, who introduced versions of Microsoft’s popular Office programs that worked on Apple’s iPad — a tablet based on the iPhone. A HUGE HIT ... AND THEN A STALL The iPhone’s success helped make Jobs a revered figure for many, and one whose October 2011 death was mourned around the world. The device has established Apple as the world’s most profitable company with earnings of $45.7 billion on sales of $216 billion during its latest fiscal year. (Prior to the iPhone’s release, Apple posted an annual profit of $2 billion on sales of $19.3 billion.) Its stock-market value is hovering around $635 billion, thanks to a split-adjusted stock price that’s risen by nearly a factor of 10 since the iPhone’s debut. Lately, though, the iPhone appears to be losing some steam. People are keeping older models for longer before upgrading or switching over to competing phones that run on Google’s Android software. Apple suffered its first-ever decline in iPhone sales in its last fiscal year, causing the company to miss its revenue projections and hitting Cook with a 15 percent pay cut . Most smartphones now run on Android, partly because Google gives away the software. That has helped iPhone rivals woo price conscious consumers, especially outside the U.S., with phones that are much cheaper than the iPhone, whose latest models now cost more than $649 to $849. In his statement, though, Cook promised the iPhone is “just getting started. “The best is yet to come.” MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Technology Writer More like this story Google’s Duo app joins the crowded field of video calling Google hits renewable energy goal in quest to pare pollution Google plays catch-up with new products THE ROBOTS ARE COMING Goodbye Note 7, hello Pixel Comments Use the comment form below to begin a discussion about this content.

But Google's Android continues to dominate overall. In September, October and November 2016, Android phones sold far better than iPhones in China, Germany, France, Italy and Spain -- and edged Apple's iPhones in the US, the report said. But Apple is catching up. iPhone sales in late 2016, following the release of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, accounted for 43 percent of the US market compared with 37 percent during the same period in 2015. In the UK, iPhone market share rose from 39 percent in 2015 to 48 percent in 2016. That's puts iPhone neck and neck with Android's 50 percent share in the UK for that three-month period. In the US, Android's hold is slipping, Kantar said, marking the sixth consecutive period of decline. Android accounted for 55 percent of smartphone sales in the US, down from 60 percent during the same holiday period in 2015, the report said. It's hard to say whether sales of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 would have stopped the Android slide had reports of its exploding battery not caused Samsung to recall --and retrieve -- the phone. Still, Samsung's Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge accounted for nearly the same amount of sales during the holiday period as the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 6S -- 29 percent for Samsung compared to 31 percent for Apple. And in China, Huawei alone commanded 25 percent of sales for the three month span, out of 80 percent of Android sales total. China has been a key market that Apple has been anxious to crack. And while Android still holds sway in many countries around the world, Apple still has room to grow -- and continues to do so.

MANHATTAN BEACH - In our family, my son has been a dedicated Mac user since 2001. But recently, he just ditched Apple for Windows. The decision came down to one word--touchscreen. Sam Graham displays his new Microsoft Surface Pro--he just switched from Apple to Windows after 15 years of using Macs.  (Photo: Jefferson Graham) You know those ads Microsoft has been running talking about the joy of creating animation on the Surface tablets? That resonated. Sam produces cartoons for his YouTube.com Heysamgraham channel, usually remotely from a coffee shop, where he likes to work, on his Mac laptop, using Adobe Flash, Photoshop and After Effects software to produce the cartoon, with editing on Apple's Final Cut Pro software. But for the past few months, he started wondering aloud about getting a computer he could draw on directly, with a pen/pencil type, instead of a mouse. Sam, say hello to Surface. Father and son discuss the change on a #TalkingTech podcast, and how he feels that Apple has "turned its back," on artists and animators by declining to offer touchscreen support to them. (Click the link below to listen.) Yes, you've got a great touchscreen with the iPad, but as Sam notes, you can't use pro programs like Photoshop and After Effects on the tablet, just "lite" apps that for him, won't do the trick. So Sam recently bought the Surface Pro 4 , which sells for around $1,500. Beyond the drawing, he loves how light it is, and how he can take pictures of his dad with the built-in webcam and add mustaches to the image. Father and son doodles, via the Surface Pro 4 webcam and stylus  (Photo: Sam Graham) Sam started his computing life on a Windows computer, an old Packard Bell (remember those?) before switching to Apple in middle school with a classic green shaded iMac. Dad uses Macs as well, both MacBook Pros and an iMac, which he loves primarily for editing video and audio on Final Cut. Vintage Apple iMac computer  (Photo: Jefferson Graham) Getting used to Windows again produces a few challenges for Sam, he notes. He's still getting used to the operating system again and misses the keyboard shortcuts he's come to know all these years from AppleLand. He just produced his first cartoon on the Surface--drawing the images into Photoshop, via the Surface stylus, and animating them in Flash and After Effects. He still did the video edit on his 2012 MacBook Pro, in Final Cut software, since that's what he's familiar with, but he expects to shift to Premiere Pro eventually on the Surface. Take a look at the latest cartoon, part of his Shark Attack series. Meanwhile, Microsoft recently lent us a Surface Book to us to review, to see what it would be like to ditch Mac (for me) and live in a Windows world for awhile. We'll be back at you shortly with our report.  Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jwv6h5 Most Popular Big Yahoo changes: Marissa Mayer to depart; company to be renamed Altaba 4.6k Shares Nintendo's Reggie Fils-Aime: Why Switch is different from Wii U 115 Shares Voice-controlled devices shift tech industry 90 Shares Tech rewind: iPhone @10, Lily, YouTube DMs 46 Shares The 5 biggest reveals from Nintendo's Switch event 77 Shares Amazon says it will create 100,000 full-time jobs in U.S. by 2018 9.1k Shares

By: Samden Sherpa Updated: Tuesday, November 22, 2016, 17:07 [IST] The "fake iPhone" market has become a very lucrative business for deceitful phone manufacturers. While many of the earlier iPhone duplicates were poorly made, however, with the passing of time, some fake iPhones are being cloned so well that they are physically very similar to the genuine iPhone. You might actually think it's the real deal. Nowadays, these fake iPhones are really good imitations taking into account the size of the device, the buttons placement, the Apple logo, and other physical indicators of an original iPhone.

Regardless of where they appear, they're out there, and people who buy them are being cheated. At the same time, the attempts made by the police have also failed to eliminate fake iPhones business from the market. So, as an alternate solution, the best thing that can be done is to educate people and prevent them from falling victim and purchase an iPhone from these unethical manufacturers. SEE ALSO: 5 Reasons for Drop in Reliance Jio Subscription Rate by 50 Percent So, in the future, if you want to purchase an iPhone from the used market, a classified ad or some other dealer that is not an Apple dealer, you can use this guide to determine if the phone you are buying is, in fact, a real iPhone or not. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! # The Apple Logo Firstly, make sure that the phone has the Apple Logo at the back. Most makers of fake iPhones try to replicate the logo sometimes but there is always some error that you can spot if you look closely. Many of the fake iPhones may have a recessed logo or a mirror finish.   # Penta Lobe Screws To identify the fake iPhone, the second thing to check is its screws. Apple uses the Penta lobe screws in the original iPhone whereas the fake iPhone has normal cross screws. # External SD Card Distinctively, Apple iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus have no external memory card slot like their predecessors. So if you have an iPhone 6S or iPhone 6S Plus or any other model of iPhone with an external SD card slot. It is a fake iPhone. Click Here for New Android Smartphones Best Online Deals # Charging Port Examine the charging port and if you notice a plastic border around it, the iPhone is basically a fake one. # Camera Usually, the height of the camera on the back of the fake phone is less compared to that of the original iPhone. The quality also differs. The fake one probably delivers a poor quality and blurry image. # Welcome Logo A fake iPhone will have a welcome screen like the word "Welcome," while the original one will show you the logo of the iPhone. # IMEI Number The IMEI number of the iPhone is found when you tap about on your screen in the general settings of the iPhone or it will be given on the cover. That number can be verified from the Apple official website, which will confirm the phone's originality. # iTunes and Apple Store You can easily check if your iPhone is fake or original by connecting it with iTunes. If it does not connect, then it's definitely not an original iPhone. Additionally, when using the iPhone, when you tap the Apple store icon, if it does not open the Apple store then the phone is probably fake.   # Packaging The original iPhones box does not have a phone pic on top. Usually, the packaging is of low quality on the fake one with a cheap quality plastic. Looking at the back, the original iPhone box will have all the details regarding the model, description of the phone, the country name where it is manufactured, serial number and a bar code that ensures the originality of the product inside it. The fake one will not have the details. Click Here for New Smartphones Best Online Deals Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

The company's Mac shipments totaled 5.3 million units during the fourth quarter of 2016, a decline of just 0.9 percent compared to the same quarter in 2015. That compares favorably to overall Mac shipments in 2016, which totaled 18.4 million units, a decline of 9.8 percent compared to 2015, according to IDC.  Apple launched the new MacBook Pros in late October, and it was considered a significant upgrade. Had the new MacBook Pros shipped for all three months, the quarterly growth may have jumped up to flat or positive territory. But that's still not an encouraging sign for MacBook Pros, which haven't provided an overwhelming boost to worldwide Mac shipments. Apple will share its Mac shipment numbers during an earnings call on Jan. 31. Apple's shipment numbers haven't always agreed with figures from research firms like IDC and Gartner. The MacBook Pros were met with mixed reviews. They had new features like the Touch Bar, which received a lukewarm reaction. The Macs were also criticized for including Intel's older Skylake chips and not the newer Kaby Lake chips. Windows PCs and Chromebooks are performing better. Apple was the fourth-largest PC maker in the world behind Lenovo, HP, and Dell, all of which recorded positive shipment growth during the fourth quarter of 2016. Nevertheless, Apple's Mac shipments are recovering, and it comes at a time when PC shipments are also stabilizing. PC shipments in the fourth quarter totaled 70.2 million, declining by just 1.5 percent compared to the same quarter in 2015, according to IDC. The numbers include traditional PCs and not devices with detachable keyboards, which are considered tablets. Competing analyst firm Gartner has predicted PC shipments will go through minor quarterly declines until returning to positive growth in 2017. One reason for the recovery was a clear delineation of product categories. Tablets aren't considered competition anymore, and many customers are returning to laptops and desktops for their primary computing needs. Gaming PCs have thrived in the last year as interest in virtual reality and eSports grows. Holiday deals boosted PC sales in the U.S. and Europe, and the consumer PC market is recovering, IDC said. Shipments also were robust in China as buyers moved to thin and light devices. Lenovo's PC shipments totaled 15.7 million, growing by 1.7 percent, maintaining a 22.4 percent market share. HP's shipments totaled 15.27 million, growing by 6.6 percent, a 21.7 percent market share. Dell recorded the biggest quarterly gain with its shipments growing by 8.6 percent to 11 million units. Asus was the fifth largest PC maker behind Apple, and its shipments declined by 11.3 percent to 5.1 million units. In 2016, shipments of PCs totaled 260 million units, declining by 5.7 percent compared to 2015.

Apple mostly gained in the U.K., where it went up by 9.1 percentage points. The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and iPhone 6s were the three most popular smartphones in the U.S. at the beginning of the holiday season, together making up 31.3 percent share. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge came in at fourth and fifth place among best-selling phones in the country, with Samsung taking 28.9 percent of smartphone sales. Early holiday sales helped out Apple against Samsung in the U.S., especially with Verizon promos, say Kantar. "Verizon booked nearly a quarter of all US smartphone sales during the Black Friday period, playing a vital role for all brands, including Apple and Samsung," said Kantar’s Consumer Insight Director Lauren Guenveur. Related Stories iPhone 7 Tips: 5 Ways To Conserve Battery Life iPhone 10 Year Anniversary: Relive Steve Jobs' Captivating 2007 Presentation "The holiday period is always strong for Apple, but it remains to be seen if demand for the latest devices will level out in the first quarter of 2017," said Kantar’s Business Unit Director Dominic Sunnebo. Android sales decreased in the U.S, U.K. and France, while iOS gained. The latest numbers show the sixth consecutive period of decline for Androids in the US, at 55.3 percent of all smartphone sales, down from 60.4 percent in the same period a year before.

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News iPhone Apple iPhone 8 Updates: Patents & Leaks Confirm Radical Edge-to-Edge Display, AR-Enabled iPhone By Gurmeet Singh Pandher on January 12 2017 06:32 AM Share Tweet Share Share Email While rumors of iPhone 8 featuring Edge-to-Edge OLED display have being doing rounds, Apple’s latest patent confirms the same. The patent that was recently discovered was granted for an iPhone with full frontal display that occupies the entire front face of the device. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office awarded Apple Patent No 9,543,364 for “Electronic devices having displays with openings.” The patent describes a potentially new feature that will allow sensors such as a camera, speaker, or microphone beneath the display. Apple iPhone 8 Edge-to-Edge Display This arrangement would help Apple create an iPhone with a true Edge-to-Edge bezel-less display. The feature is rumored as part of the re-designed premium iPhone 8 codenamed “Ferrari.” The said iPhone will launch later this year as part of Apple iPhone’s 10th anniversary celebrations. HUD Display The patent also reveals plans for a built-in “heads-up display” system which would mark Apple’s first step into augmented reality, reports Mirror UK. “One or more openings in the display may form a window through which a user of the device may view an external object,” says the patent. “Display pixels in the portion of the display in which the window is formed may be used in forming a heads-up display.” Essentially, this describes an iPhone with one or more transparent regions in front and rear of the device. This might be possible with transparent OLED in front and clear glass structure at the back. When users look through these windows, they would see digital images overtop the real world physical objects. The window based HUD might be used by Apple to foray into AR technology. Apple is also recently rumored to develop AR-enabled smart glasses with German optics giant, Carl Zeiss. The AR features will not necessarily get inducted in the upcoming 2017 iPhone models. Glass Sandwich Design Meanwhile, a recent leak also confirms a glass sandwich design for Apple’s 2017 flagship iPhone. Citing Taiwanese sources from Apple’s supply line, Forbes said the company will bypass its main manufacturer Foxconn. This is in order to attain forged steel iPhone chassis from supplier Jabil. With the chassis Apple will sandwich together front and rear glass panels. This would give the upcoming iPhone 8 a design similar to that of Samsung’s Galaxy series. It would also help with the introduction of the long rumored wireless charging feature to the company’s flagship.

Apple's $5 billion 'spaceship' campus is covered in mud Kif Leswing Jan. 11, 2017, 4:06 PM 469,049 facebook linkedin twitter email print City of Cupertino Last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly told Apple employees that the company planned to start moving into its new $5 billion Campus 2 in January 2017. But right now, the campus is still a work in progress. Although landscaping and interior work have started, there's still a lot to do, as shown in a new drone video from photographer Matthew Roberts filmed on Monday. Since Northern California has seen a lot of rain since last Saturday, lots of Apple's beautiful dirt piles have turned into mud. But Apple has started planting trees and doing landscaping on the interior, and it's over halfway done installing the solar panels that will cover the roof. In October, the city of Cupertino updated its public construction schedule for the building. Currently, building and construction are supposed to wrap up in the first quarter of 2017, landscaping in the second quarter. Take a look for yourself. View As: One Page Slides Roberts estimates that 60% of the roof is covered with solar panels. Matthew Roberts/YouTube Major construction and landscaping are happening inside the ring.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | January 11, 2017 -- 20:19 GMT (12:19 PST) | Topic: Security Developers can now build end-to-end encryption into CareKit, Apple announced on its CareKit blog, adding more security and a faster track to HIPAA compliance for developers building healthcare apps on the open source platform. While CareKit was built with "security at its core," according to the blog post, Apple has partnered with the security firm Tresorit to offer ZeroKit for CareKit developers. In addition to offering end-to-end encryption of health data, it offers user authentication via PAKE (Password-authenticated key agreement) technology, which does not store password hashes. It also offers "zero knowledge" key management. The combination of PAKE user authentication, zero knowledge key management, and CareKit's default file system encryption "protects [protected health information] from breaches, while providing a seamless experience to your end-users," Apple said. ZeroKit is available for iOS, Android, and web browsers and requires no previous knowledge of security, according to Apple. Personal health information, of course, has been a major target for hackers. Last year, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), business and health care were the hardest hit vertical industries.

(Stephanie Matteis) Related Stories GTA man expected a gaming headset for Christmas — but got a dirty T-shirt instead Cheaper flights and mail scams: CBC's Marketplace consumer cheat sheet Geoff Lu decided the new Apple iPhone 7 Plus, touted as one of the hottest high-end tech gifts for the holidays, was the perfect gift for his wife. At more than $1,200, the phone was going to be an expensive purchase for the young couple, so Lu consulted with his spouse. She was thrilled with the prospect, so they ordered it online at the Apple store. And that's where things started going wrong. GTA man expected a gaming headset for Christmas, but got a dirty T-shirt instead Today, Lu still doesn't have the phone he purchased despite a months-long ordeal that's still ongoing, even though he has followed all of the recommendations provided by consumer advocates. Here's how it all happened. Neither Lu nor his wife were at their Mississauga home when the package arrived in mid-November, he said. His wife then went to the UPS access point at 201 City Centre Drive to sign for it on Nov. 15. With no intention of waiting for Dec. 25, she opened the package and was shocked to find the phone itself missing. "She said, 'There's no phone inside.' At first I thought she was joking," Lu said. He joined her at their kitchen table and surveyed the box, which still had the charger and headphones but no iPhone. Who's to blame? What happened next prompted Lu, 32, to contact CBC Toronto. He says he got the idea after seeing the CBC story about a GTA man who bought a Sony VR headset and said he got a dirty shirt instead. 'I went through all the routes trying to see if there is someone who can help me, but I'm hitting dead ends everywhere.' - Geoff Lu In addition to going public with his issue, Lu also followed the steps most consumer advocates recommend. Lu contacted Apple and UPS and explained what happened, and  put everything in writing. He also went to the Apple store at Square One Shopping Centre, where a manager told him there's nothing the brick and mortar store can do about what happened with the online purchase. Lu's credit card company, Capital One, said it will only refund the purchase if Apple reverses its charge. "I went through all the routes trying to see if there is someone who can help me, but I'm hitting dead ends everywhere I go," Lu said. Lu is hoping to get a refund or a replacement, but on Nov. 27, without elaborating, an Apple representative wrote to him to say the investigation is "completed" and there would be "no further action" taken by the company. When CBC Toronto contacted Apple this week, a representative said the company is reviewing the situation and is in the process of responding to Lu. After this story was published, Lu contacted CBC Toronto to say that he's since been asked to report the situation to police. He's then supposed to contact Apple and provide a police report number, but Lu said the customer service agent didn't tell him what — if anything — would happen next. UPS says its hands are tied Lu said his dealings with UPS were equally confusing.  At first a "UPS preferred customer associate" wrote Lu to arrange a damage report and inspection of the package, which had the phone's serial number information on the outside of the box. Lu said looked like it may have had a flap lifted on an end that wasn't taped. UPS does have guidelines for damage and loss, but nothing that describes what a customer can do in case a package's contents are missing. After asking where he should bring the package for the report and inspection, the associate wrote on Dec. 7, that the delivery company was "unable to investigate further" because "Apple has closed the inquiry that they sent to us regarding your package." "I don't know why Apple closed the investigation before UPS can get all the information," Lu said. Steve Vitale, a UPS spokesman, said his company is responsible to its client, in this case, Apple. Unless Apple files a claim, he said, nothing can be done. Final decision will come down to Apple, expert says Ken Whitehurst, executive director of the Consumers Council of Canada, said this is a tough situation. "Apple in this case clearly has a problem of, how did they know it really wasn't delivered?" he said.  However, Whitehurst said the company may be in position to help Lu.  "I would think after some period of time Apple will know where that device is." Whitehurst said he was right to document everything that's happened. Next time, Whitehurst advised Lu and his wife to verify the contents of the package before signing for it, or consider shopping for such a big-ticket item in person. "There have been concerns around e-commerce but generally when you're dealing with large companies they deal with these friction points to retain confidence in the system." Whitehurst said if Apple doesn't provide a refund, Lu will have to consider small claims court.

I judged too early, and they are actually perfect for my two-hour daily commute. By Matthew Miller for The Mobile Gadgeteer | January 11, 2017 -- 20:15 GMT (12:15 PST) | Topic: Mobility Using Apple AirPods on a Sounder commuter train I'm sorry. I made fun of all of you with Apple AirPods sticking out of your ears and thought Apple made a ridiculous accessory that would only price gouge consumers when there are other Bluetooth headsets available for much less. It turns out they really are magic, and in some situations, they are absolutely perfect for iPhone users. Jason wrote in his ZDNet full review that the AirPods blew away the competition, but I still wasn't convinced. iPhone 7 Plus review Perfecting the 6s Plus with water resistance, dual cameras,lightning performance The iPhone 7 Plus is the best iPhone, as it should be. Read More I have several sets of Bluetooth wireless earbuds, primarily designed to accompany me on runs. I've used these during my daily commute as well. But, tired of having to deal with cables, finger gymnastics to insert them, and various charging attachments, I always ended up going back to wired headsets for my 90-minute round-trip train commute and 30+ minutes of walking. iMore's Rene Ritchie posted a tweet link to Best Buy having AirPods in stock, so I ordered a pair and had them two days later. Apple still has a six-week estimated ship date for AirPods, so I was shocked I was able to get them so quickly through Best Buy. After a week with the Apple AirPods, here's why I think they are perfect for the commuter: Wireless: Just about everyone on my train carries at least one bag of some type, with many carrying multiple along with other things, such as umbrellas. It's annoying to deal with a cable leading down into your pocket or bag as you listen to music or podcasts. Having to deal with unraveling cables and then securing them in a pocket can also be annoying. Volume: Most Bluetooth headsets I've tried in the past are just too quiet for my train commute, which is one reason I always went back to a wired solution. The AirPods have good volume. I can't even turn them all the way up during my commute. Secure fit: Apple's wired EarPods fall out of my ears. The AirPods do not, even when I shake my head. I walk more than two miles during my commute through various terrain and the AirPods have never fallen out. Convenience: Apple made the AirPods magical by eliminating the hassle of Bluetooth management. The AirPods simply connect when you remove them from the case, every single time. Pop them out, use them, and pop them back in the case at the end of the commute. Simple, quick, and easy. Power: The AirPods easily last me through a full daily commute and with the carrying case also serving as a charger you should always have charged up AirPods. I am also very pleased that Apple uses a Lightning port to charge up the case. Many other Bluetooth headsets use microUSB, which is being replaced by USB Type-C, but neither of these standards are used to charge up an iPhone. There is something to be said of a single universal cable system. Call quality: While phone calls may be rare today, they can still be important, and with most Bluetooth headsets I have tested, the recipient states I sound like I'm in a tunnel or something. The AirPods aren't perfect and people can tell you are on a headset, but the incoming call performance is nearly perfect, while the outgoing is higher than most every other headset I have tested. Awareness: The Bluetooth headsets I typically use have foam or silicone ear tips that fit deep into the ear and block out nearly all external sound. This may be fine in the gym, but I walk through a few sketchy areas of the city and near moving trains so I like to still have some awareness of my surroundings. The AirPods fit well into my ear, but they don't block out all outside sound. I can also ride my bike with one AirPod in one ear and still have full awareness of cars and bikes around me. After realizing how great the AirPods are for commuting, I was thinking of using them for running. While the AirPods never fall out on my commute, I know they would if I sweated, so I then saw that some companies, such as Earhoox, have the perfect solution. I almost bought some. However, there is no water- or sweat-resistant rating for the Apple AirPods, so I will continue to use Bluetooth headsets from Jaybird, Bose, and BlueAnt for running. Hopefully, AirPods version 2.0 is launched with some level of water resistance so I can go running with them. Until then, I have no regrets paying nearly $200 (tax and shipping on top of the $159 price) for the perfect commuter headset.

The results align with the “run away success” that Tim Cook claimed shortly after their launch and the strong sales helped push wireless headphone sales to 50% of all headphones sold online in 2016. This new data shows that Apple’s AirPods sales on December 13 were ten times more than the 2016 average (pre-holiday). The AirPods launch also beat the online headphone sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, making December 13 the largest day of online headphone sales of 2016. Not only did AirPods increase 2016 wireless headphones to 50% of total online headphone sales, but also boosted the December numbers to 75%. Before last month, Apple’s Beats headphones had about 25% of the wireless market followed by Bose at 10.5%. Slice Intelligence’s new report also shows that AirPods have become the clear leader in wireless headphones for now at 26%. Between AirPods huge success and Beats still holding on to second place, Apple currently has an impressive 40% of all wireless headphone sales since the AirPods launch. Interesting enough, Bose increased their market share over 5% while most other brands declined. Also, similar to the data they have reported about Apple Watch and MacBook Pro purchasers, most people who have purchased AirPods are male, while female buyers tended to be older than male buyers. Eighty-five percent of shoppers who’ve purchased the AirPods since December 13 are male, similar to the gender breakdown we reported for the MacBook Pro release in October. Taking a closer look, data shows that male buyers are younger than their female counterparts. Over one-third of the men who bought a pair of AirPods were Millennials. Among female buyers, Boomers are the largest population, with a share of 38 percent. Time will tell if Apple will continue to be the leader in wireless headphones as AirPods become less constrained, more customers can try them out, and competitors bring more compelling products to market.

KOLKATA: Eight senior managers at the local operations of Apple have resigned in the past two months. Industry executives cited dissatisfaction among some employees, with new country head Sanjay Kaul giving more emphasis on recruiting talent from consulting background and huge pressure on sales target, for the series of rare exits at the managerial level of the iPhone maker. Among the exits, two executives were in the select group of Apple’s country leadership for the Indian market. V Anandkumar was the head of sales planning and support, while Vickram Bedi was heading sales with focus on consumers, small and medium businesses, corporate resellers and distribution. Anandkumar has taken an early retirement, while Bedi is serving notice period, two senior industry executives said. Two national business managers, Pavan Kareti and Samidha Gupta, have also quit. Kareti used to manage all the franchisee partners for Apple Premium Resellers, which is a global initiative wherein select Apple exclusive stores are designed and operated as per global parameters and benchmarks. Gupta was responsible for accessories and the Apple TV business. Others who have put in their papers include Vineet Kumar, who was account manager for monobrand retail that includes the franchise-led Apple exclusive stores, and Raja Basu, who was heading sales for South and North. Rajesh Marwaha, the head of mentor training that involves training sales staff at the store level, and Aparna Sareen who led new store development and marketing programmes for the Apple exclusive brand stores, have also quit. The industry executives said some six more people at the mid-management level had resigned and several others were looking for a change. “Apple is one of the good pay masters in the Indian consumer electronics sector. While some more senior executives are on the lookout, the problem they are facing is matching salary levels, more so now when the market itself is down,” one of them added. Apple India didn’t respond until press time Wednesday to an email seeking comment. The company currently employs around 60 people at the managerial level while another 75-odd people are in field sales, managing and monitoring sales in the partner outlets from regional offices. The executives said while attrition of field sales staff is generally high, that at the managerial level for Apple India used to be low. Apple became the country’s second largest smartphone vendor by revenue in 2015-16, piping the largest home grown brand, Micromax, as sales grew 54% to Rs 9,997.1 crore in last fiscal year. An executive said the bulk of sales was driven by entry-level handsets, such as iPhone 5s, due to lower price. Kaul has been pushing the team to deliver volume sales so that India can figure among the top growing markets for Apple. The company has plans to set up an assembling operation in Bengaluru in partnership with Wistron and thereafter open its companyowned stores by being able to comply with the local-sourcing rules.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Audio The best way to find AirPods in stock just got even better Zach Epstein @zacharye January 11th, 2017 at 11:51 AM Share Tweet If you want to score yourself a pair of Apple’s white-hot AirPods, you essentially have three options. First, you can pay a premium and order AirPods on Amazon. You’ll have them shipped to your door in two days, but it’ll cost you. The second option is to just order a pair on Apple’s website. At the time of this writing, Apple was quoting an estimated delivery time of six weeks for new AirPods orders. So, with any luck, you’ll have them in your hands — and in your ears — by mid-February. Your other option is to use one of several different AirPods inventory websites that have popped up since Apple’s hot new truly wireless earbuds debuted. And on that front, we have some good news: Our favorite site among them was recently updated with several great new features. Don't Miss: Exclusive: This image could be the world’s first look at the Galaxy S8 “AirPods Is In Stock” emailed BGR last week to let us know about a few important site updates. What’s more, at the time the company sent us the email, 115 different Apple stores across the United States and Canada had received AirPods inventory during the previous 10 hours. They were all sold out practically as fast as stock had arrived, but there’d an important takeaway here: AirPods are shipping to Apple stores with increasing frequency, so now is the perfect time to register for notifications. This particular site works two ways. You can use the Locations page to see a world map that plots out each and every Apple store across the globe. An example of a portion of the map can be seen at the top of this post. Stores with AirPods in stock are marked with green pins, which stores without any inventory are marked in red. Checking the map constantly is a pain, so AirPods Is In Stock also lets you enter your email and location, and you’ll receive a notification as soon as any nearby stores receive AirPods.

Tesla hires Apple’s creator of Swift as new VP of Autopilot Software Posted Jan 10, 2017 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story ‘AI-powered’ is tech’s meaningless equivalent of ‘all natural’ Tesla has a new vice president heading up Autopilot efforts — Chris Lattner, whose departure from Apple was reported only earlier today. Lattner worked at Apple for 11 years, where his chief contribution was creating Swift, Apple’s most recent programming language, which is relatively easy for beginners to pick up and begin using to create apps for macOS, iOS and beyond. The role at Tesla had been filled by SpaceX VP of Software Jinnah Hossein, who was doing double-duty at both companies (much like Elon Musk himself does in the CEO spot). Tesla says they’re “excited” about Lattner’s ability to help them “accelerate the future of autonomous driving,” in a blog post announcing the move. Lattner’s history includes creating the Clang compiler and designing the LLVM compiler optimization infrastructure. He was also a key contributor to the evolution of Objective C and worked on Apple’s Xcode software development tool during his time at the iPhone maker. He also apparently builds beautiful raw-edge wood furniture: A late 🎁 for @tonic888, finally finished building her 8' long claro walnut 🌳 dining table. pic.twitter.com/gE9i6eCM64 — Chris Lattner (@clattner_llvm) January 9, 2017 Tesla’s poach of Lattner is a significant win for Tesla, given the breadth of his influence on software development and his expertise. Tesla announced late in 2016 that all of its vehicles going forward would have all the hardware on board necessary for full self-driving capabilities, and Elon Musk said that he’s aiming to have a fully autonomous coast-to-coast test drive of a Tesla car ready for the end of this year. Lattner could be a big help in achieving those ambitious goals in Musk’s typically aggressive timelines. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Tesla Motors Founded 2003 Overview Tesla Motors was started by a group of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and strives to create a revolution and accelerate the world’s transition to electric mobility with a full range of increasingly affordable electric cars.

Committee Chairman John Thune and ranking member Bill Nelson said they decided to push the hearing to Jan. 18 because they had yet to receive the billionaire investor’s ethics agreement, which he is working on with the Office of Government Ethics and the Commerce Department, and wanted to give officials enough time to review it” [Politico]. “Prep for the USTR hearing does seem to be going forward as planned, however, and Lighthizer began making the rounds on Tuesday to meet with Finance Committee members and talk about the incoming administration’s trade agenda.” Politics Readers, this section today will be straight prose and few links. Sorry. Apple’s irredeemably sucky iOS Mail program screwed up my Outbox again, so an entire day’s research is gone where the woodbine twineth — including everything I was planning to aggregate on the latest Trump flap — it having never reached the mailbox on the Mac I use for writing. (Yeah, I could change my workflow, but I find it hard to accept that Apple’s crack engineering team could actually screw up email, so I keep hoping Mail will improve, even though it’s remained crappy over several upgrades. I guess they want to force me to use iCloud or something.) If it’s not a full moon, it certainly looks and feels like one. So, on the Trump flap, from memory, my thoughts: 1. Readers will remember from election coverage Chris Arnade’s notion of the “volatility voter”; the idea that a voter trapped in a losing game might as well kick over the table to improve their chances. Well, the elites can exploit volatility, too. Naomi Klein labeled the opportunistic elite production and manipulation of crises the “shock doctrine”: In one of his most influential essays, Friedman articulated contemporary capitalism’s core tactical nostrum, what I have come to understand as the shock doctrine. He observed that “only a crisis—actual or perceived—produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable.” Some people stockpile canned goods and water in preparation for major disasters; Friedmanites stockpile free-market ideas. And once a crisis has struck, the University of Chicago professor was convinced that it was crucial to act swiftly, to impose rapid and irreversible change before the crisis-racked society slipped back into the “tyranny of the status quo.” He estimated that “a new administration has some six to nine months in which to achieve major changes; if it does not seize the opportunity to act decisively during that period, it will not have another such opportunity.” A variation on Machiavelli’s advice that injuries should be inflicted “all at once,” this proved to be one of Friedman’s most lasting strategic legacies. Readers will also remember that I thought volatility after the election would not decrease and might increase. If I am correct that some elite factions are employing “capitalism’s core tactical nostrum,” then we can expect more crises. What is unique about our 2017 situation, however, is that it’s not “the new administration” that’s employing the tactic, but a defeated faction that’s about to lose power (if democratic norms are adhered to). This does not preclude the Trump administration from employing shock doctrine tactics on its own later, but that does not appear to be the case now.) What is it that seems “politically impossible” now but may become “politically inevitable”? 2. Since November 8 we’ve had four crises of legitimacy of escalating intensity, each one pointing to a change in the Constitutional order. First, we had Stein’s recount effort, justified in part by a(n unproven) theory that “Russian hacking” had affected the vote tallies. (Recall that 50% of Clinton voters believe this, although no evidence has ever been produced for it, it’s technically infeasible at scale, and statistically improbable.) Since the “Russian hacking” theory was derived from intelligence not shown to the public, the change to the Constitutional order would be that the Intelligence Community (IC) would gain a veto over the legitimacy of a President during a transfer of power; veto power that would be completely unaccountable, since IC sources and methods would not be disclosed. Second, we had the (hilariously backfired) campaign to have “faithless electors” appoint somebody other than Trump to be President. Here again, the change in the Constitutional order was exacty the same, as (Clintonite) electors clamored to be briefed by the IC on material that would not be shown to the public, giving the IC veto power over the appointment of a President after the vote tallies had been certified. Third, we had the IC’s JAR report, which in essence accused the President-elect of treason (a capital offense). Here again the publicly available evidence of that quite sloppy report has been shredded, so in essence we have an argument from IC authority that secret evidence they control disqualifies the President elect, so the change in the Constitutional order is the same. Fourth, we have the “Golden Showers” report, which again is an argument from IC authority, and so again gives the IC veto power over a President appointed by the Electoral College. Needless to say, once we give the IC veto power over a President before the vote is tallied, and before the electoral college votes, and after the electoral college votes but before the oath of office and the Inaugural, we’re never going to be able to take it back. This is a crossing the Rubicon moment. Now, you can say this is unique, not normal, an exceptional case, but “sovereign is he who decides on the exception” (Nazi legal theorist Carl Schmidt). And who then is the sovereign? The IC. Is that what liberals want? 3. To the “Golden Showers” case itself. If I have this right, CNN published a rumor, whose source is a former British MI5 operative, who now owns his private firm. (How nice for him.) There is a two-page summary including the rumor (shown by the IC to Trump and Obama as part of the compartmentalized version of the JAR), and there is a 45-page (IIRC) memo with the rumor in all its glory. CNN having published the rumor, Buzzfeed published the memo (with a disclaimer saying in essence “We can’t vouch for the authenticity of any of this; you figure it out,” a remarkable statement similar to WaPo’s non-retraction of its defamatory propornot story. In any case, the firm shopped the material around as oppo, first to the Republicans, then to the DNC, but nobody bit (although the memo became a “legend” in the political class). The only reason the memo became news was — tada — not that there was any corroborating evidence, but that the IC said it was trustworthy (see #2 above). I skimmed the 45-page version, and it looked pretty sketchy to me; interestingly, it contained a suggestion that there is a DNC mole, which supports the “leak not hack” account of the Podesta memo. 4. On “golden showers,” this is a family blog, so you’ll have to look up the details for yourself. Back in the day, I worked in the Personals section of a weekly alternative newspaper taking ads, and since customers paid by the letter (rather like tweets), “GS” was the abbreviation. Now, there were rather a lot of abbreviations, human nature being what it is. My point is that GS is, apparently, not a “protected class” of sexual practices among good-thinking liberals, although [this is a family blog1] and [this is a family blog2] obviously are, and Goldman Sachs and everybody on Wall Street [this is a family blog3]s, like, all the time, and especially with important clients. Therefore, my Twitter feed is full of plays on “uro-” (you can imagine). This is snark, and in particular sexual snark, for which I was present at the creation, in the blogosphere in the early 2000s: Sexual snark was the épater le Christian Right of its day, since the Christianists were a dominant faction in the Bush administration, and oh so stuffy. And an entire generation of the political class, especially the “progressive” factions in that class, including me, came up practicing that snark. It’s easy! It’s fun! It’s performative discourse! And — like everything else these clowns have done — utterly ineffective. So we’re doubling down on failure again, aren’t we? The “progressive” (Clintonite) Twittersphere is full of jokes about p*ssing while Sanders wanders around the country holding town halls and defending Social Security and Medicare. What a maroon! Head, desk. 5. Trump held a news conference at my press time. Since coverage of Trump has been so wildly distorted, we can only go by the transcript. Here it is. On Russia: [TRUMP:] If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks? That’s called an asset, not a liability. Well, not if you want a war with Russia. And on the GS thing, quoting in its entirety: TRUMP: Lemme just tell you what I do. When I leave our country, I’m a very high-profile person, would you say? I am extremely careful. I’m surrounded by bodyguards. I’m surrounded by people. And I always tell them — anywhere, but I always tell them if I’m leaving this country, “Be very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you’re gonna probably have cameras.” I’m not referring just to Russia, but I would certainly put them in that category. And number one, “I hope you’re gonna be good anyway. But in those rooms, you have cameras in the strangest places. Cameras that are so small with modern technology, you can’t see them and you won’t know. You better be careful, or you’ll be watching yourself on nightly television.” I tell this to people all the time. I was in Russia years ago, with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well — Moscow, the Moscow area did very, very well. And I told many people, “Be careful, because you don’t wanna see yourself on television. Cameras all over the place.” And again, not just Russia, all over. Does anyone really believe that story? I’m also very much of a germaphobe, by the way, believe me. The Fiscal Times from 2015 says that Trump is, indeed, a germaphobe. I suppose that Trump could have had the hookers wrapped up in latex onesies Trump could have taken protective measures, but still… There’s plenty more in the transcript, but that’s what’s relevant to the IC’s ongoing efforts. “Very much of a germaphobe.” No wonder nobody bought the oppo. 6. I forgot to say: If the 45-page memo is to believed, international real estate is a hairball of conflicted relationships and a cesspit of corruption. No different, that is, from New York real estate. And no different in essence from the business dealings of any other oligarch, I would guess. Stats Watch Atlanta Fed Business Inflation Expectations, January 2017: “Inflation expectations at the business level are falling back this month after spiking in November and December” [Econoday]. “These results stand in direct contrast with the consumer side where expectations have been falling, not rising.” MBA Mortgage Applications, week of January 6, 2017: “Purchase applications for home mortgages rose a seasonally adjusted 6.0 percent” [Econoday]. “[D]espite the weekly increase in purchase applications, the year-on-year decline points to weakness in future home sales.” Housing: “People who make offers on homes have started to find that appraisals well above these offers have triggered a large number of busted deals. California, home to some of the nation’s most expensive home markets, leads in cities with these broken deals. Another reason for these problems is appraisals that show major problems with red flags” [247 Wall Street]. Retail: “On the news that Macy’s is shuttering 68 stores and cutting 10,000 workers and Limited is closing all 250 locations impacting 4,000 workers, a new report released Tuesday further indicates the industry’s inexorable shift to online” [Econintersect]. “Retail clocked the fewest holiday job gains since 2010, as the accelerating shift toward online shopping continued to take a toll on job opportunities in traditional brick-and-mortar stores.” Retail: “Apple AirPods are all but impossible to recycle, which makes them a Herculean environmental challenge.” [Wired]. Shipping: “The number of container lines with an operating capacity of over 200,000 teu has reduced to 17 from 20 in the past year, and is set to shrink to 13 in the next 18 months as the industry experiences unprecedented consolidation” [The Loadstar]. The Bezzle: “Baidu Inc. and state-owned Beijing Automotive Group Co.’s collaboration on telematics and autonomous driving is almost ready for its coming-out moment, as industry and government join hands to push for self-driving vehicles within China” [Bloomberg]. “A BAIC-built model equipped with Baidu technology will debut in April at the Shanghai auto show, BAIC Chairman Xu Heyi said in interview Friday at the CES 2017 trade show in Las Vegas. The two companies also plan to conduct road testing of a car that will be autonomous in limited environments by the end of this year.” That is, not autonomous. Co-ops: “Organic Valley’s rising tide continues to lift all of its producer pools. Coming off of its second billion-dollar year and passing the 2,000-member mark, the La Farge-based co-op is cultivating a venture to put its dairy products on the shelves of as many as 140,000 more stores nationwide” [LaCross Tribune]. “Organic Valley, which George Siemon and a handful of other farmers founded in 1988 and now is the largest cooperative of organic farmers in the country, also hired 110 new employees last year.” Co-ops: “[Edgar Hicks] has worked for more than 40 years in the agricultural business and had a multitude of leadership roles in rural organization. Most recently, he traveled to Africa to share his expertise. He said the greatest agricultural experience for his family as a whole was the initial one living in small co-op communities in Merrick County, Nebraska, followed by working for Ag Processing in Omaha” [Omaha World-Herald]. “Hicks was excited to be invited by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to go to Toubakouta, Senegal, to help farmers start a co-op. Through his interpreter, he shared that for every one of their co-op members, he could envision a successful Merrick County farmer. He gave them a background of the National Grange cooperative using the well-known Rochdale Principles, formed by a successful cooperative in Rochdale, England, in the 1800s.” Hicks is African-American, and grew up in Louisiana. Amazing bio. Co-ops: “Is the Cooperative Economy Next in a Post-Consumer World?” [P2P Foundation]. “”So what is the alternative if the ability of people to support themselves and their families with wage income is collapsing, and there’s not much chance of substantial help from the government?” [Professor Maurie Cohen of NJIT’s Department of Humanities] asks. One possibility is rooted in the evolution of a concept that garnered significant interest in the past — mutual economic cooperation at the local or regional level.” Political Risk: “The World Bank predicts that among advanced economies, growth in the United States is expected to pick up to 2.2%, as manufacturing and investment growth gain traction after a weak 2016. But if Trump’s stimulus plans are fully implemented, it could lift GDP growth to 2.5% this year and to 2.9% in 2018” [Mining.com]. Political Risk: “President-elect Donald Trump has so far named exactly one person with an economics doctorate to a prominent post in his administration” [Bloomberg]. As the punchline to the old joke goes: “It’s a good start.” Today’s Fear & Greed Index: 61 Greed (previous close: 67, Greed) [CNN]. One week ago: 86 (Extreme Greed). (0 is Extreme Fear; 100 is Extreme Greed). Last updated Jan 10 at 11:38am. Big drop. Imperial Collapse Watch “THE CRIMES OF SEAL TEAM 6” [Intercept]. “But hidden behind the heroic narratives is a darker, more troubling story of “revenge ops,” unjustified killings, mutilations, and other atrocities — a pattern of criminal violence that emerged soon after the Afghan war began and was tolerated and covered up by the command’s leadership.” We tortured some folks… Gaia “Tanzanian Farmers Face 12 Years In Prison For Selling Seeds As They’ve Done For Generations” [TechDirt]. “”If you buy seeds from Syngenta or Monsanto under the new legislation, they will retain the intellectual property rights. If you save seeds from your first harvest, you can use them only on your own piece of land for non-commercial purposes. You’re not allowed to share them with your neighbors or with your sister-in-law in a different village, and you cannot sell them for sure. But that’s the entire foundation of the seed system in Africa”, says Michael Farrelly [from an organic farming movement in Tanzania].” Class Warfare “”To the very considerable extent that inequality is generated by rent seeking, we could sharply reduce inequality itself if rent seeking were to be somehow reduced,” said Angus Deaton, recipient of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Economics. Deaton described inequality in the U.S. as being primarily driven by industry rents, and rejected proposals to increase taxes on the rich as a way to reduce rent seeking” [ProMarket]. “”I don’t think that rent seeking, which is incredibly profitable, is very sensitive to taxes at all. I don’t think taxes are a good way of stopping rent seeking. People should deal with rent seeking by stopping rent seeking, not by taxing the rich,” [Deaton] said.” “Such [Trump] policies aren’t merely a repudiation of Obama. They would amount to a smash-and-grab raid on the social-democratic notion of government that [Obama] sought to protect and extend [(!!)]. If Trump and his team’s proposed policies were enacted in their entirety and maintained, we could well come to look back on the last eight years as but a temporary stopping point on the road to full-on plutocracy” [John Cassidy, The New Yorker]. “Full-on plutocracy,” as opposed to the “plutocracy with some mitigating factors,” as we have had so far. If you re-read this piece while mentally flagging the qualifiers like “full-on,” it looks quite different from the hagiography it intends to be. For example, “ virtually halving the percentage of Americans who don’t have health coverage” is a two-fer: First, what’s “virtually” doing in there? Second, “health coverage” as a very neat conflation of “health insurance coverage” and “health care,” very typical of liberal goodthinkers who generally, themselves, don’t have to cope with narrow networks, high co-pays, Kafka-esque bureaucracies, and liberal gatekeeping and meantesting processes generally. News of the Wired Readers, I would like to formally thank the commenter who turned me on to the Opera browser. Opera is not from Google or Apple, which is great, it’s significantly zippier than FireFox, and best of all, it’s got a built-in free VPN that is speedy and reliable. I couldn’t be more pleased to have my workflow improved. So, whoever you are, take a bow! “Families are getting online by borrowing simple cellular devices from their local libraries. After some initial success in big cities, researchers are testing the program in rural settings” [Daily Yonder]. The ceaseless creativity of our public llbraries never ceases to amaze me. “With a cast of characters including Lawrence Welk, Phyllis Diller, Frank Zappa and Jimi Hendrix, the wah’s glide through American pop culture can be traced back to the muted cornets in 1920s Chicago speakeasies and, thanks to an ambitious young guitarist named Del Casher, came to fruition 50 years ago in a Hollywood Hills garage” [LA Weekly]. “Tetheradick” [Haggard Hawks]. Not a scandal…. “Nasa to visit mysterious metal asteroid which could be core of lost planet ” [Telegraph]. “The strange chunk of metal, named 16 Psyche, is made of iron and nickel, similar to the Earth’s core, and scientists think it could be the remnants of a Mars-sized planet which existed just a few million years after the birth of the Sun.” “Researchers at Johns Hopkins and New York Universities are giving psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, to ordained ministers in the hopes that they can help provide some answers [about the relationship between their spiritual qualities and healing potential]” [Quartz]. “So far, they have enrolled thirteen religious leaders including an Orthodox Jewish rabbi, a Zen Buddhist roshi, an Episcopalian, a Greek Orthodox priest, and a Reform Christian for their FDA-approved clinical trial. (They’re also seeking Catholic priests, Imams, and Hindu priests to join the study.)” “$89 Pinebook Linux Laptop Expected to Launch in February” [PC Magazine].

This is a memo that was in the emails released by wikileaks in which the Clinton Foundation admits that Ira Magaziner misappropriated $23 million in restricted donor funds at CHAI sometime before June of 2008. The funds in question appear to be government donations specifically earmarked to be used only for funding AIDs drugs in Africa. http://imgur.com/a/D3Rhw This never came out in the press because the foundation covered it up by transferring money from their endowment. When I originally saw this memo, I started to look at the Clinton Foundation financial statements and noticed something strange. While the foundation claims they have posted their financial statements every year on their websites, when I actually looked all I was able to find was excepts of the financial statements with most/all of the supplemental info and all the footnotes scrubbed. While I wasnt able to find the complete financial statements for 2008, wikileaks did leak the audited financial statements for 2010. From the auditors report, I was able to learn how Ira was able to misappropriate $23 million without one of the bean counters knowing about it or notifying the people who were allegedly running the foundation. (From the memo we know that the people “in charge” didnt know anything about the missing $23 million until after it happened.) As it turns out, roughly 2/3 of the hundreds of millions that flow through the Clinton Foundation actually are tracked outside of their standard accounting process. Apparently Ira Magaziner has an excel spreadsheet called “income model” that he manually updates periodically and uses to track the hundreds of millions of dollars the foundation is spending on CHAI. Shockingly (or not considering the auditors are from a local Arkansas CPA firm with close ties to the Clintons) the auditors didnt seem to find any issues with this unique accounting method and gave the financial statements an unqualified report (unqualified = passing grade in auditing). Here is the page from the report where the auditors claimed that this wasnt even a material weakness, but rather only a significant deficiency.. https://www.scribd.com/document/336302505/IRA-Magaziner-CHAI Note: the audited financial statements can be found in the podesta leaks. Inside the zipped attachment are various files, one of which is the audited financial statements. https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46848 Reply ↓ Waldenpond January 11, 2017 at 6:28 pm Criticizing Streep might be done more effectively by looking at Streep’s foundation she runs to hide her wealth from taxation.

Reply ↓ fresno dan January 11, 2017 at 2:36 pm Needless to say, once we give the IC veto power over a President before the vote is tallied, and before the electoral college votes, and after the electoral college votes but before the oath of office and the Inaugural, we’re never going to be able to take it back. This is a crossing the Rubicon moment. Now, you can say this is unique, not normal, an exceptional case, but “sovereign is he who decides on the exception” (Nazi legal theorist Carl Schmidt). And who then is the sovereign? The IC. Is that what liberals want? ============================================================= The evolution of the two party system into a duopoly that merely reflects whether one likes one’s sugar water in a red can (coke) or in a blue can (pepsi) means that real questions about how the constitution, DESPITE that CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR and NOBEL prize winner being president, mean that we have had 16 years of unremitting diminishing of the power of the individual against the state. “The IC. Is that what liberals want?” Trump is elected and days before he takes office the President signs the fake news law. Its kinda like shooting someone in the head with four different kinds of guns, taking a chain saw and cutting some one up into pieces, and than dissolving the pieces in acid, and than claiming it was an accident…if they don’t want it, it is the best bluff I have EVAH seen…. Reply ↓ Uahsenaa January 11, 2017 at 3:12 pm Trump is a cretin and a buffoon, but I am genuinely worried about how blindly liberals (as well as many on the “Left,” whatever that means these days…) are following the letter agencies down the rabbit hole. DNI Clapper lied under oath to the committee that oversees his activities, and… nothing. I mean how many straightforwardly criminal things does the CIA have to do before liberals finally think to themselves, “hey, maybe we should take what these guys say with a grain of salt?” You don’t have to read Thucydides to know that allying yourself with someone purely out of expediency will always bite you in the [family blog].

Reply ↓ RUKidding January 11, 2017 at 4:05 pm No kidding! I agree that Trump is dangerous, a fool and woefully incompetent for this job. Maybe the DNC shoulda let the Primary happen without any interference, and there woulda been a different outcome to this election. Here’s a conundrum: Is the left’s newfound fealty to the Alphabets better/worse/the same as the right’s newfound fealty to Julian Assange and Wikileaks? Clinton ran a craptastic campaign. In truth, she shoulda beat Trump easily, but she didn’t. It’s due to her hubris, ignorance, incompetence and much much more. She lost fair & square, but I’ve never seen such a sore loser, and that includes all of the Republicans & Tea Partiers & Birthers combined after Obama won in 2008. It just amazes me that the masses in the USA put up with this insanity and somehow think it’s normal. It’s not. I guess the MIC is benefitting from this insanity, but I’m not really sure about that, either. I say: look out bc there’s loads of smart people worldwide who’re probably right now working on how to take advantage of the USA, and as usual, it’s the proles who’ll suffer.

Opportunities will present themselves quickly, and if you examine it, Osama bin Laden’s attack on the World Trade Tower was cheap, effective, and remarkably simple. As to the right’s sudden interest in Assange and Wikileaks. Purely tactical. It won’t last long.

Maybe Team Trump started this rumour, which his many lady friends know is false, to see which MSM organs would run with it, so he knows where his enemies are. Reply ↓ craazyboy January 11, 2017 at 7:05 pm The context is this is supposed to be “blackmail” the Russians have on Trump, to compel Trump to become Prez and make America, and we would have to assume Russia, great again.

Urine typically becomes contaminated during usual micturation, but most people are familiar with the cleaning precautions at a doctors office to assure a “clean catch” or urinating without contaminating the urine. Of course, the evidence shows that a lack of exposure to germs can have a deleterious effect…. For me to comment authoritatively on the Trump hookers, and germs, you’d have to hook (heh-heh) me up with them, they’d have to be really gorgeous (not that that has anything to do with germs, just getting me to do it), and than let me reproduce the circumstances as closely as possible…..

The last two deals I have had come apart did so because of condition issues that came to light during the inspection period. In both cases the buyer asked for a credit toward paying for the repairs and in both cases the seller refused. The credit amounts requested were very reasonable and in one case the home sold for less than what my client had offered and in the second case the home is still on the market and it is unlikely to bring as much as my client offered. Keep in mind that the issues revealed by the inspections must be disclosed to any potential buyer and also that a home that comes back on the market very seldom achieves the original asking price “Because there must be something wrong with it”.

So one of my favourite daily reads — and I did post now and again — was alt.showbiz.gossip (I wish I could remember what these alt.thingies were called; they weren’t proper websites I don’t think, if I recall accurately (hey, give me a break, it was all 25 years ago, what can I say, memories fade) you read the posts in a special piece of software which wasn’t like a browser, but anyway, that’s what it was).

Okay, you asked for it, following — like a confused mutt chasing after the garbage truck — the current Trump story, I got the same sensation in a Proustian memory kind of a way as I always had when reading alt.showbiz.gossip all those years ago. Some of the “news” posted was so outrageous you knew it couldn’t possibly be true. Some seemingly had a grain or two of truth but had been blown out of all proportion. But the ones which I could not resist were those bits of gossip which had some basis in reality that would have been salacious enough, but the poster could not resist adding unnecessary tidbits to embellish the story even though it didn’t need any embellishment. Like putting the sparklers on a banana splits. I always wondered what happened to all my alt.showbiz.gossip compadres. Well, now I know. They went off and joined the IC.

Had to look up what that means- Astrology King says: it adds seriousness to the emotions and can lead to distance in intimate relationships…one may have to deal with some challenging situations and negative attitudes which will feel worse than they actually are. Reply ↓ 3.14e-9 January 12, 2017 at 12:00 am I was typing a comment to that effect but thought I should check first to see if someone else already mentioned tomorrow’s full moon. I didn’t think anyone would mention Mercury Rx, though. My comment was almost word-for-word Jim Haygood’s, except that I used the exact time of 6:34 AM EST. It always cracks me up when I see references to astrology on NC. I’ll add my two cents with the observation that WaPo called for the end of the label “fake news” the day Mercury returned direct. Also, every time Mercury goes retrograde (three times a year, for roughly three weeks), astrologers typically predict more and bigger mistakes than usual, e.g., the typo in the tweet about Trump’s “much bigger Navy” and WaPo’s Express cover using the symbol for Mars for the women’s rights march. Annotherone: Did Astrology King also mention that DT is experiencing a Saturn-Moon conjunction? That’s a longer-term transit that occurs only once every 28-29 years, and it reaches a critical phase this summer — right around the “Great American Eclipse,” which peaks over the middle of America and will be conjunct DT’s Ascendant. I don’t have any links handy, but imagine that you’ll find several if you do a search. Reply ↓ Annotherone January 12, 2017 at 1:15 am 3.14e-9 ~ Probably he did somewhere among his writings. Astrologers, generally, seem to think DT is “in the cross-hairs” one way or another astrologically, this year. LOL! DT’s Moon is conjunct my natal Venus, so maybe I’ll receive some of the flak going his way. ;-) Reply ↓ 3.14e-9 January 12, 2017 at 2:59 am Annotherone: What incoming president hasn’t been “in the crosshairs?” Wouldn’t matter if it was Clinton, Bernie, or Jesus. Maybe you mean that some astrologers are predicting dire events that will end his presidency? The charts are extreme, for sure. However, most of what I’ve read is based on a few major aspects, when what’s needed is a thorough analysis. I haven’t seen one, but I haven’t looked lately. Saturn transits to the Moon and Venus have some overlapping themes but work on different levels. Besides that, Trump has a close Sun-Moon opposition — he was born during a total lunar eclipse — which modifies the interpretation. Reply ↓ Anne January 11, 2017 at 3:36 pm I have no interest in Trump’s sex life (mainly because the very thought just makes my skin crawl), though I do remember reading somewhere that he once said he really didn’t care about his partner’s satisfaction; seems pretty consistent with someone who thinks it’s okay to grab women by their genitals…am guessing he’s not very good at it, and that’s why he says he doesn’t care about his partners’ satisfaction. What I do have some interest in is that we may be close to having no credible IC at all. I was already skeptical of an FBI that could only ever seem to break up terror rings it gaslighted not-very-bright young men into joining, and then there’s the CIA…seems like it is less about gathering intelligence for the good of the nation/world, and more about cherry-picking it to carry out the political agenda of whoever’s in the WH, and stirring up major shit around the world so we can keep the MIC gears grinding. My fear is that the more credibility the IC loses, the worse this will get. And I seriously have no confidence that Trump is going to change this, as much as he is going to add to the general instability of the entire structure. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef January 11, 2017 at 3:50 pm Trump wants to change this at the CIA – more people on field posts. Another change, initially at least – the CIA will not cherry pick intelligence to carry out the political agenda of the whoever’s in the WH (in the case, Trump, initially). They will focus on resisting Trump’s restructuring, instead his political agenda. Reply ↓ TK421 January 11, 2017 at 4:03 pm someone who thinks it’s okay to grab women by their genitals At the risk of nit-picking, what Trump said in that video wasn’t that he does such grabbing, but that–in his estimation–he could do such grabbing, if he wanted to, and get away with it. That is not a praiseworthy statement, but it is a world away from an admission of sexual assault. Reply ↓ Anne January 11, 2017 at 5:47 pm Uh, no – what he said was: Trump: Yeah, that’s her. With the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Bush: Whatever you want. Trump: Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything. I stand by what I said: he does think it’s okay to grab women. Further, he thinks it’s okay to just move on them, kiss them – because he just can’t help himself. How many women came forward to talk about Trump moving on them?

While East and West Coast access to seas may seem to be a distinct advantage, the waterways of the interior USA provide for a more connected community. https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/geopolitics-united-states-part-1-inevitable-empire/ Some excerpts: “It is worth briefly explaining why Stratfor fixates on navigable rivers as opposed to coastlines. First, navigable rivers by definition service twice the land area of a coastline (rivers have two banks, coasts only one). Second, rivers are not subject to tidal forces, greatly easing the construction and maintenance of supporting infrastructure. Third, storm surges often accompany oceanic storms, which force the evacuation of oceanic ports. None of this eliminates the usefulness of coastal ports, but in terms of the capacity to generate capital, coastal regions are a poor second compared to lands with navigable rivers….” “Thus, the Greater Mississippi Basin is the continent’s core, and whoever controls that core not only is certain to dominate the East Coast and Great Lakes regions but will also have the agricultural, transport, trade and political unification capacity to be a world power — even without having to interact with the rest of the global system…” “So long as the United States has uninterrupted control of the continental core — which itself enjoys independent and interconnected ocean access — the specific locations of the country’s northern and southern boundaries are somewhat immaterial to continental politics…” While fairly obvious to anyone who has lived and traveled in the USA for a long time, it’s a good read for presentation of those facts. “Even without having to interact with the rest of the global system…”: I emphasized that one line because it makes clear why what has been defined as the “coastal elites” appear far more concerned with globalization than the interior of the USA, while at the same time have always been more enthusiastic about centralized control of the entire USA.

Reply ↓ Jim January 11, 2017 at 4:06 pm Lambert, in a fine summary of our increasing legitimacy crisis, ended his analysis with the following comment: “This is the crossing of the Rubicon moment. Now you can say this is unique, not normal, an exceptional case but “Sovereign is who decides the exception.” (Nazi legal theorist Carl Schmitt) And who then is the exception? The IC is that what liberals want.” I am still an old fashioned supporter of liberal democracy and a genuine liberal should be highly critical of Schmitt’s paradox of sovereignty(the idea that the sovereign can be conceived as falling both inside (for purposes of evoking his compliance) and outside(for purposes of warding off an infinite regress in accounting for how sovereignty came to be established). This paradox is not immediately “given” or generated by the notion of sovereignty but results from a prior act of conceptual slicing that is geared in a certain way. If you enlarge the framework of analysis, a paradox does not have to result. If you consider both the institution of sovereignty and its effect, the “institution” requires or presupposes an institutor and the effects that become apparent, later in time than the moment of institution, can encompass the institution as well as the other members of society. If you enlarge the framework of analysis to include how sovereignty operates once it is established as well as the process of establishment itself, then there is nothing inconsistent in noting that the sovereign has to precede sovereignty at the moment of institution while coming under its rubric once it is established. Schmitt’s paradox emerges only if you “cut” the horizon of analysis much more narrowly. If you focus exclusively on the moment of institution, then it looks like the sovereign is both “inside” and “outside” sovereignty–that the sovereign’s situation is paradoxical. But the crucial point to notice is that there is a choice or a decision made by Schmitt as to where to “cut” the topic conceptually. If you “cut: sovereignty” at the moment of institution then you confront the paradox. If you cut the topic at a later stage in its unfolding there is no paradox. There was a decision on the part of Schmitt, to have this problem in the first place. The fact that there is a choice involved in order to situate a problem to begin with suggests that the language of problem identification is metaphoric and does not transparently reflect a situation that exists independently of our formulations. This dispelling of the Schmitt paradox of sovereignty is also a function of a different “conceptual slicing” maneuver on my part– as a believer in liberal democracy and the sovereignty of the people. Schmitt was not such a believer–he is an anti-liberal. He cuts off the philosophical analysis of sovereignty as the moment of institution for his own political purposes. Again, expanding the framework of analysis beyond the moment of institution makes the Chief executive more fully intelligible. While he might enjoy certain privileges and immunities stemming for his status within the political community, he comes within the purview of the state’s system of laws and is vulnerable to its penalties as any private citizen. The nature of the conceptualization of sovereignty will become a key issue as the process of delegitimization accelerates. Who rules–the people or the State and its sovereign head? Reply ↓ cocomaan January 11, 2017 at 4:41 pm I see where you are coming from, but it seems to me that Schmitt chose the crisis moment as the point at which sovereignty is revealed. It’s the moment in which a choice is made for which a lot of problems are attached to it. Choices where there are not many problems attached are more easily solved and don’t require a reveal by the sovereign. So, for instance, if the sovereign makes an exception for the law when it comes to whether tomato is a fruit or a vegetable, it’s not a revelatory moment, because there are not many problems attached to that choice. Whereas, when the sovereign makes a choice about exceptions when it comes to killing US citizens without due process, there are many many more problems attached to that choice, and therefore it’s revelatory.

How many BS stories have been fed to date? More than can be counted. How many feckless and self-serving wars, foreign interventions, and foreign election meddling. All that and their train keeps moving. If the legitimacy of these institutions was tied to moral culpability they would have been dismantled decades ago. Presidents and voters come and go, the Pentagon and CIA/NSA do not. It looks more like the legitimacy of the institution should have been called into question years ago.

It isn’t just taxis; it’s also contractors and doctors. However, in cases where the public’s safety is at stake, it’s difficult to come up with a good alternative. I was a landscape contractor; the test they make you take was a joke. The real purpose is to require contractors to be insured and bonded, which protects the public. In my case, the Legislature upped the demand about the time I turned 65, so I refused to start taking their ridiculous yearly classes – landscaping is not a field that changes a whole lot. That was just a ploy to squeeze out the little guys, like me, and it succeeded. So my partner, 10 years younger, took over that burden, because he does a lot of installations (he’s a permaculturist) and needed the license. Now technically I work for him. I suppose you could just require anyone doing certain kinds of work to have the insurance without going through all the licensing foofaraw. Enforcement would be tricky, though. And then there are doctors.

Staton’s refusal last year to grant immunity to the bureaucrats in Preslie Hardwick v. County of Orange, a lawsuit seeking millions of dollars in damages. In short, judges Stephen S. Trott, John B. Owens and Michelle T. Friedland were not amused. They affirmed Staton’s decision. ================================================================ My first inkling is that this story, if in fact published in a “real” newspaper, was published as “too good to check.” However, there is a link to a court opinion, and it looks like a legitimate court opinion. Google tells me Stephen S. Trott, John B. Owens and Michelle T. Friedland are in fact Federal judges – so it seems like its not fake news…. Which begs the question: how is it that a number of local officials are not being prosecuted – civil damages are not enough. Reply ↓ Waldenpond January 11, 2017 at 8:03 pm Ok, read that and several other items. Questions by lawyers and judges are not testimony nor fact. Family law disputes are the worst. For me, the lawyers don’t seem to be arguing that the workers lied (although they did when they claimed the children were doing well when a therapist described them as upset… is that doing well under the circumstances? I didn’t read the exact testimony.) and should have immunity but that they didn’t lie and should have immunity. Their employers still argue that the employees did not lie and one retired, the other is still employed and even promoted and that they can’t release the data. It should be released if the adult children demand it, although I imagine the state will attempt to block it even then.

Team B was an experiment in competitive threat assessments approved by then-Director of Central Intelligence George Bush. Teams of “outside experts” were to take independent looks at the highly classified data used by the intelligence community to assess Soviet strategic forces in the yearly National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs). NIEs are authoritative and are widely circulated within the government. U.S. national security policy on various issues as well as the defense budget are based on their general conclusions. Although NIEs represent the collective judgment of the entire intelligence community, the lead agency is the CIA. There were three “B” teams. One studied Soviet low-altitude air defense capabilities, one examined Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) accuracy, and one investigated Soviet strategic policy and objectives. But it is the third team, chaired by Harvard professor Richard Pipes, that ultimately received considerable publicity and is commonly referred to as Team B. The Team B experiment was concocted by conservative cold warriors determined to bury détente and the SALT process. Panel members were all hard-liners. The experiment was leaked to the press in an unsuccessful attempt at an “October surprise.” But most important, the Team B reports became the intellectual foundation of “the window of vulnerability” and of the massive arms buildup that began toward the end of the Carter administration and accelerated under President Reagan. How did the Team B notion come about? In 1974, Albert Wohlstetter, a professor at the University of Chicago, accused the CIA of systematically underestimating Soviet missile deployment, and conservatives began a concerted attack on the CIA’s annual assessment of the Soviet threat. This assessment–the NIE–was an obvious target. Reply ↓ Hana M January 11, 2017 at 4:45 pm From the newsconference. This is Sheri Dillon who is working on the hand-off of Trump’s business interests: DILLON: Through instructions in the trust agreement, President-elect trust — President-elect Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated. This impacted more than 30 deals, many of which were set to close by the end of 2016. As you can well imagine, that caused an immediate financial loss of millions of dollars, not just for President-elect Trump, but also for Don, Ivanka and Eric. DILLON: The trust agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals. No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump’s presidency. New domestic deals will be allowed, but they will go through a vigorous vetting process. The president-elect will have no role in deciding whether the Trump Organization engages in any new deal and he will only know of a deal if he reads it in the paper or sees it on TV. Because any new deal could — and I emphasize could — be perceived as causing a conflict or as exploiting the office of the presidency, new deals must be vetted with the ethics adviser, whose role will be to analyze any potential transactions for conflicts and ethics issues.

But that information isn’t free. Those of us with a high-deductible health plan (and that’s a few of us) may worry less about what’s wrong, than what it will cost to find out. Most people with a plan through Obamacare have a high-deductible, and more employers are putting their workers on this type of plan. Which means more questions. This being January, the start of a new health care year, it’s the perfect time to provide answers. … • Know your plan. … • Understand insurance terms. … • Even though you are responsible for all or part of the bill, your doctor’s office can’t tell you what you’ll pay until after your appointment. Lots of reasons for this when even a simple visit has a complexity that makes rocket science look like child’s play. You need to know that every medical procedure has a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code, which has a dollar value attached. While you made an appointment for a specific complaint, your doctor/physician assistant/nurse/nurse practitioner/therapist doesn’t know what you need until the person sees you. The office visit, even if the provider did nothing but talk with you, can be coded at one of five levels. Even if the staff knew ahead of time what your visit would involve, they don’t know whether you’ve met your deductible. You may not know because it can take a while for doctors to submit bills and insurers to process claims. … [Got that? There will be a quiz at the end.] • You’ll discover that it’s hard to compare prices for health care. … [But, but … markets!] • Even if you didn’t know the amount going in, you may be asked to pay on your way out. Doctors’ billing staff have access to different price information than do patients. … [Information asymmetry is cool.] • You may be asked to pay a deposit. Not all offices have the staff necessary to contact all the different insurers and go through the dizzying number of plans. Also, the rise in high-deductible plans has led some patients to stiff their doctors. So you may be asked for partial payment. … [For example, a first born child. Or the thumb from your dominant hand.] • Even if you can’t shop around for prices, you can minimize your expenses. [Don’t get sick.

Pasture fed is just labeling (not regulation) stuck on what is still factory farming. It means ‘access’ to the outdoors (which can mean one small door opened between warehouses and the outdoors may be a dirt paddock) and the days when cows are on pasture vary to a current 120 days. In some areas, simply offering the cows cut grass suffices. Grass fed is better, and you will pay an extreme mark up for grassfed only products but it still contains the ‘usually indicates cows are not confined’ disclaimer. Organics are increasingly moving to shelf stable (tastes horrible, toxic plastic boxes even worse if processed IN the box) by marketing it as ‘green’ by reducing savings on refrigeration. I remember Organic Valley specifically for being outed by drone cameras for their fake bucolic imagery…. photos showed warehouses and one front yard sized tiny patch of green. We’re spoiled here, it’s temperate so we can find grass fed dairy and meat… but it’s expensive.

Because of Michigan rules, when they checked and found that over a a third of Michigan precincts had reported more votes than there were ballots in the sealed boxes, the original, clearly incorrect and illegitimate count stood — they didn’t correct the report to reflect the reality of the physical ballots. That’s part of why there are all those uncounted ballots in those Democratic strongholds — not because of Republican cheating, but Democratic cheating. I’m not blaming Stein for this, per se. My understanding is that electoral integrity advocates came to her because she had standing, and she said she’d help.

Reply ↓ dk January 11, 2017 at 7:15 pm I think calling the various attacks on Trump’s legitimacy ineffective is an incomplete analysis. The effect these attacks have is to further antagonize Trump (a finalist in the Year’s Most Antagonistic stakes since the 80’s). Which many find satisfying, as it confirms their opinion of him (doubly). But it’s a poor tactical choice. Further antagonizing Trump drives him into the hands of his flatterers, which are the most aggressive elements of the Republican/alt-con fringe. The press’s handling of Trump in the recent news conference is a case in point. Aggressive questioning on exaggerations of fairly valid issues leading to 1) aggressive/exaggerated/dismissive responses, and 2) Trump hates the press even more. Net result, poor disclosure and detail from Trump (he’ll always have Twitter…), disinclination for Trump to hear anything not presented in the context of fawning and flattery; poor communication across the board. I think these are poorly chosen behaviors, by a culture that likes to consider itself intelligent and sophisticated. Trump may not be a pussy cat, he may indeed be odious in some ways (okay, a lot of ways); but these stone-casters are not without sins of their own. When we indulge our own preferences and biases, especially at the expense of others, we weaken our objections to the vagaries of others, and loose opportunities to influence their choices. One should consider: does one want to be right/morally pure/virtuous/etc, or does one want to win (or at least survive to continue)? The means shape the end, so precision and proportion are called for. Strident moral purists need not apply.

Ask Brad Friedman or Greg Palast, who was involved in the latest attempt. Another factor is that Trump lost th epopular count by such a wide margin; it would be worthwhile to correct that travesty, little as I want to see Hillary as President. All three states were close enough to justify a recount. “Foreign hacking,” without mentioning Russia (Guccifer was supposed to be Romanian), was invoked only in one court case, because a good lawyer throws in everything. What IS a challenge to constitutional order is that paid-for recounts were blocked by partisan interests. That didn’t happen in Ohio in 2004. Instead, they just cheated on the recounts. it’s unfortunate that they started at the very last moment; apparently it took that long to collect the information and get it to someone who cared. It isn’t only that we don’t have a democracy because votes have little to do with policy; it’s also because the counts themselves are so unreliable. Overall, I think you have 3 instances of the IC changing the Constitutional order, not 4. Personally I’m inclined to chalk it up to Democrat shock, denial, and sour grapes. But the IC exploiting the event to assert power is genuinely dangerous, and so is liberals’ willingness to go along with it just because they didn’t like th eoutcome. Also, majorleague hypocrisy.

On switching from Mac to Windows, or Windows to Mac Posted on 12-Jan-2017 06:42 by Bill Bennett. | Filed under: News : Bill Bennett. At the Guardian Alex Hern writes: Is it time to swap your Mac for a Windows laptop? 1 You don’t have to look hard to find similar stories elsewhere. A number appeared after Apple launched the MacBook Pro in late October. Other Apple users used social media to wonder out loud about jumping to Windows or to announce an actual move. And Windows users are thinking of moving to Mac. On one level moving is easyThis level of fluidity is unprecedented. In many respects it has never been easier to move from Mac to Windows or Windows to Mac. Yet switching from one to the other or for that matter to Linux or a Chromebook can be trouble. It can be so much trouble that you need powerful reasons to move. A missing HDMI port is not enough reason.2 At least not on its own. Wrenching…Wrench number one is that most long-term computer users have invested in one or more expensive apps that don’t make a good journey to the alternative operating system. This is less of a problem now that many apps are cloud-based or purchased as a subscription. It’s not going to worry anyone who uses, say, Xero. If, say, you move from a Mac to a Windows machine, and use Microsoft Office then you can kill the MacOS account and download the applications to your new Windows computer in a matter of minutes. CloudYou can keep your iCloud account active long after moving to Windows. Likewise, Microsoft OneDrive works well on Macs. More specialist applications and games can be more troublesome. There aren’t many third-party hardware devices still limited to only Apple or Windows. Printers, back-up drives, routers and so on can make the switch in minutes. If you like a big screen or typing on a mechanical keyboard your old devices will all work with your new computer. Although you may need to buy a dongle to connect them to the ports on the new machine. PhonesYou may run into unforeseen compatibility problems between devices like phones or tablets. iPhones and iPads play nice with Windows PCs and Macs, but the experience is much better when you are all Apple. Likewise, the flow between your Android phone and your Windows laptop will be different if you switch to a Mac. Maybe not worse; different. There will be minor niggles. Standardisation and convergence mean from a hardware and software point of view moving from Windows to Mac or Mac to Windows isn’t a big deal. BrainHowever, moving your brain from one way of thinking to another is harder. This isn’t so much of a problem for casual users who don’t dive too deep into their operating system. There will be frustrating mysteries in their new system, but there already are in the old one. More sophisticated users can struggle. All of us who work many hours each day with computers develop habits, learn shortcuts and productivity hacks to get more done in less time. These rarely translate from one operating system to another. You’d be surprised how many you have accumulated over the years. Peak productivityIt can take hours to get used to the basics of a new operating system, it can take months to get to peak productivity. This is why moving can be trouble. Within hours of firing up a new computer with a different OS you’ll take delight in features that were missing from your old one. Not long after you’ll start to wonder why simple things that were so easy with your old computer are suddenly hard  or even seem impossible. You have to build this learning curve into your planning before moving. If you are unhappy with what you have, if your frustrations have reached boiling point or if you like the look of that fancy new computer then by all means move to another operating system. While changing may be rewarding in the long-term, in the short-term it could be harder than you expect. This story was first posted at billbennett.co.nz Spoiler alert: After testing the Surface Book Hern is not moving. ?? If you’re a disgruntled MacBook Pro user you’d have to be crazy to spend up to NZ$6000 on a Surface Book because of a missing port. In comparison dongle costs are nothing. ??

Apple designed the Safari Technology Preview to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari. Safari Technology Preview release 21 includes bug fixes and updates for JavaScript, Fetch API, IndexedDB 2.0, CSS, Rendering, Web API, Accessibility, and Web Inspector. The Safari Technology Preview update is available through the Software Update mechanism in the Mac App Store to anyone who has downloaded the browser. Full release notes for the update are available on the Safari Technology Preview website. Apple's goal with Safari Technology Preview is to receive feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. Safari Technology Preview can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.

 More signs Apple will launch an AR device BI Intelligence Jan. 11, 2017, 2:03 PM 2,093 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Samsung Gear VR pulls ahead of competition Lenovo just unveiled a $400 VR headset The Oculus split signals the increasing division in the VR market This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. More evidence that Apple may be working on a Google Glass-like augmented reality (AR) device has surfaced, according to tech evangelist Robert Scoble. Scoble noted that employees from German lens and optics manufacturer Carl Zeiss AG seemingly confirmed at CES 2017 that the company had partnered with Apple.    The is just the latest indication that Apple is doubling down on AR technology. It was reported last November that Apple had been exploring building a digital glasses product, similar to Google Glass, and was already in talks with potential suppliers, according to Bloomberg. If Apple were to move forward with the product, it wouldn't release it until 2018 or later, the report said. While the company has yet to confirm this rumor, its validity is likely for several reasons: The tech giant has been trying to diversify its revenue sources for several years, since the iPhone makes up such a large bulk of its revenue. That has led to ventures in wearables like the Apple Watch, services like Apple Music, and entry into the automobile industry with Apple CarPlay. However, the urgency has intensified as global smartphone shipments continue to decelerate. In 2016, Apple reported its first year-over-year decline in annual revenue. Apple needs to put a horse in the AR race, or it risks falling behind the competition. Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Snap have all launched technology that's either AR and VR ready or, in Snap's case, well positioned to integrate the technology. And while Apple CEO Tim Cook noted his bullish stance on the technology, the company hasn't announced any new products. The AR/VR market is projected to reach $80 billion by 2025, according to Goldman Sachs estimates. Nevertheless, Apple will need to be careful with whom it markets these AR devices to, or it could find itself with another Apple Watch. When it first launched, the Apple Watch was marketed toward everyone with an iPhone. However, after 12 months, global device shipments flatlined. A big reason for this was that there were too many shared features and apps between the iPhone and Apple Watch. Considering that Apple is already adding AR tech into the iPhone 7 and future iterations, it would make sense for Apple to target a new AR device to a specific segment of consumers or industries, such as healthcare or manufacturing, rather than implementing a consumer-wide launch. Taking this approach could help distinguish the new product and mitigate the cliff dive in shipments seen with the Apple Watch. The virtual reality (VR) market made significant strides throughout 2016. New VR headsets like the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive debuted amid great consumer anticipation, while VR content launches kept pace, with Batman: Arkham VR and Chair In A Room garnering encouraging download totals. At the same time, industry groups and conferences brought developers, investors, and content producers together, helping to further ramp up buzz in this nascent space.    BI Intelligence, Business Insider’s premium research service, forecasts shipments of VR headsets to spike by 1047% year-over-year (YoY) to 8.2 million in 2016. This growth will help propel the virtual reality space to exceed $1 billion in revenue for the first time, according to research by Deloitte. Powering that growth is an estimated 271% increase in investment in AR (augmented reality) and VR companies from 2015, according to estimates from CB Insights. But while 2016 has indeed been an important year for the VR market, it hasn’t necessarily been a big one — at least not compared to its future growth potential. VR headset shipments will continue to grow in the years ahead, driven by the introduction of new content that will appeal to a broad swath of users.  Jessica Smith, research analyst for BI Intelligence, has compiled a detailed report on virtual reality that explores the highly fragmented and volatile VR market that emerged in 2016, lays out the future growth potential in numerous key VR hardware categories as driven by major VR platforms, and examines consumer sentiment and developer excitement for VR, presenting which headset categories and platforms are most poised for success in the near- to mid-term. Here are some key takeaways from the report: This has been an important foundational year for the VR market. New hardware and content have brought more options to market to appeal to a wider set of consumers.  But the growth seen this year is merely a foreshadowing of the future. The highly fragmented VR market today will eventually narrow as the market grows and matures. After considerable progress in 2016, the VR market is ripe for transformation in 2017. Developers, consumers, investors, and hardware makers have a host of options from which to choose, each with their own strengths and shortcomings. The environment is poised for the first killer VR app to hit the market sometime in 2017, which will be a major catalyst for consumer adoption of VR hardware. Not all headset categories and platforms will emerge as winners in the near future. More immersive headsets that offer the best VR experiences are too expensive for most consumers. Alternately, affordable headsets that rely on smartphones as processors offer sub-par experiences that can induce sickness. In full, the report: Identifies the major players in today's VR hardware and platform markets. Estimates future growth of each of the major VR categories. Explores barriers to mass market consumer adoption for each of the VR hardware categories.

Steve Jobs ultimately picked the full-blown touchscreen interface (right) instead of an iPod-based UI (left) for the iPhone. Image: screenshot: sonny dickson/youtube By Raymond Wong2017-01-11 13:52:04 -0500 The iPhone we know and love today could have been very different, and maybe even a total flop, if Steve Jobs had picked a different interface for it. A new video published by Apple leaker Sonny Dickson shows off an early-stage version of "Acorn OS," an iPod-based interface for the iPhone that Apple was working on before deciding to go with the now-ubiquitous icon-based interface. SEE ALSO: The iPhone's remarkable 10-year history, in pictures The story goes like this: Apple had two teams working on what would eventually become iOS (née iPhone OS).  One team, under Tony Fadell, the "father of the iPod" was working on an operating system based on the iPod interface and controlled with a click wheel. Meanwhile, another team, under ex-Apple senior vice president of iOS software Scott Forstall, was tasked with creating an icon-based interface. While a click wheel-based UI may have seemed like a good idea at the time, given the meteoric success of the iPod, it just didn't translate very well for a phone. "We were turning it into a rotary phone from the sixties," Fadell told the BBC. "We were like, 'This doesn’t work! It's too hard to use'." Jobs, too, eventually decided he wanted the iPhone to have an entirely touchscreen-based interface and threatened to kick Fadell and anyone else off the iPhone project if they disagreed. In Dickson's video, we see two prototype iPhones labeled "P1" and "P2". Dickson says these "P" model iPhones are amongst the hardest prototypes to obtain (they don't even have finished home buttons). "P1" shows an iPhone running the iPod-based OS, whereas "P2" runs a proof-of-concept interface showing the feasibility of an interface with tappable, on-screen buttons. In hindsight, it's clear Apple made the right decision to not go with the iPod interface. Nonetheless, the video is still an interesting look at what could have been, as the iPhone celebrates its 10th anniversary.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)    5416874 A longtime Apple executive is leaving the company at the end of the month and heading to Tesla to become its new vice president of autopilot software. Chris Lattner, who since 2005 has worked with Apple, is most famous for creating Swift, the programming language for building apps on Apple platforms. Lattner switching from Apple to Tesla goes against business magnate Elon Musk’s brazen belief that “if you don’t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple.” Employees at Tesla irreverently call Apple the “Tesla Graveyard,” according to Musk himself. “Prior to Apple, Chris was lead author of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, an open source umbrella project that is widely used in commercial products and academic research today,” according to an official Tesla announcement. Lattner’s resume is fairly extensive, working on a multitude of projects for Apple, including iPhone and Mac technology development. Lattner is set to take over for Jinnah Hosein, who was simultaneously serving as SpaceX’s vice president of software, as well as vice president of Tesla autopilot software. SpaceX and Tesla are both large enterprises founded by Musk. (RELATED: Elon Musk’s Failed Ball Of Fire Made Mark Zuckerberg Look Bad, And Zuck Is Not Happy) Tesla’s autopilot technology, which hypothetically allows cars to partially function autonomously, was discovered to contain flaws after a vehicle using the much-hyped advanced technology crashed in May, killing the driver. (RELATED: Tesla Autopilot Technology Under Investigation After Fatal Crash) Musk explained that the company urges drivers using autopilot technology to always remain alert. A few months after the crash, Musk stated that new updates to the autopilot technology would probably have prevented the original crash. (RELATED: Germany Forbids Tesla From Using Misleading Term ‘Autopilot’) “We are very excited that Chris is joining Tesla to lead our Autopilot engineering team and accelerate the future of autonomous driving,” Tesla’s announcement concluded.

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Tuesday awarded Apple a patent on "Electronic devices having displays with openings." The patent describes a technology in which a smartphone would come with a display with "one or more openings" that might look like a "window through which a user of the device may view an external object." The patent, which was earlier reported on by AppleInsider, describes a wide array of ways the openings in the device could be used to enhance a smartphone's functionality. In addition to looking through the device to see other objects, the openings could be used to view a secondary display, deliver sound through a speaker or voice through a microphone attachment, and even as a heads-up display. Still, the holes don't need to be all that big. In fact, they can be small perforations that could be imperceptible to the human eye.

In fact, the patent suggests that by using the holes to offer certain features, like the microphone and speakers, it could allow design engineers to create a true "full face" display. For years, smartphones, including the iPhone, have been marching towards designs that could deliver an all-display face. Currently, popular smartphones come with prominent displays but have large bezels at the top and bottom to house ear receivers on top and the home button on the bottom. Companies like Samsung have already eliminated the left and right bezels with curved screens that spill over the sides. The top and bottom, however, have still proven difficult to overcome. Still, reports are swirling that Apple is considering an all-display face in the iPhone 8. Those reports suggest Apple will bake its Touch ID fingerprint sensor into the device's screen, allowing it to deliver more display real estate. Apple is also reportedly planning a curved display in its next flagship handset. It's unclear whether the patent Apple was awarded will find its way to the company's next handset or any other future smartphone. Apple, like other companies, files for patents all the time on technologies it might never use in its devices. But if it does deliver the feature, look for some holes -- and maybe lots of them.

The SmartDeviceLink Consortium, as they’re styling it, is apparently all about muscling around Google and Apple’s forays into the automobile, and is based on Ford’s existing “AppLink” software project, which has been around for several years. I’ve written about smart dashboards before for TTAC. Particularly, in 2013 after Apple’s original announcement, I was amazed automakers were willing to cede so much control over the precious dashboard real estate. I later noted people are likely to be more loyal to their phones than cars and to make buying decisions around what cars support their phones “properly,” especially because Apple and Google fundamentally know a lot more about you and can do a much better job of knowing what you want to listen to and where you want to go. But what exactly is the SmartDeviceLink Consortium all about? You might think it sounds like it’s a rejection of your smartphone driving the screen in your car, as with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Curious as to what was really going on, I then dug into the giant pile of software and specifications they’ve posted on Github. What’s really going on here isn’t as much in opposition to what Google and Apple are up to as it’s an attempt to standardize it and refactor it. Consider the following diagram: HMI, on the left, is the big touchscreen in your dashboard. SmartDeviceLink (SDL) is a computer somewhere behind that screen running many different software components, which then interacts with your device, pictured on the right. Hey, can you zoom into that SDL diagram? Sure, happy to oblige: What I hope is plainly visible to any TTAC reader, whether or not they’ve ever written a line of code, is that there’s a whole lot of stuff going on here, replicating many of the features and services already present inside your phone. So how is all of this different from what Apple and Google are doing? Primarily, Apple and Google’s designs are all about keeping it simple. The car provides access to the screen and maybe a few other handy things like wheel telemetry or a compass, and then the phone does all the rest of the work, saying “here are a bunch of pixels, draw them.” Dumb car, smart phone. Apple and Google’s designs are conceptually similar to a long-established class of remote desktop software applications (think: Microsoft Remote Desktop Services, Citrix, VNC, and other such things). What’s the ostensible benefit of SDL having all of this functionality refactored into the car rather than resident solely in the phone? Let me give an example and zoom in on one proposal (dated August 2016, written by a Ford employee) for handling “turn by turn mobile managers”: The idea is to provide an API in the mobile libraries to app developers to navigate to a desired destination. On the other side suppliers of navigation SDKs can develop against APIs and create a [turn by turn] proxy to accept requests to navigate to a destination. Furthermore these navigation SDKs can provide notifications for instructions, a maneuver icon and a map view to be shown inside the lock screen. In between SDL can receive the information from the navigation SDKs and send them to the HMI of the head unit. Implementing the HMI related work inside the mobile libraries would unify the behavior of different navigation SDKs and make it very easy for app developers to integrate a navigation feature into their apps. In a nutshell, SDL is all about having the car collaborate with the phone rather than being a dumb display terminal for it. This gives the automaker an opportunity to customize how things work, to add their own layers, to mix-and-match native and remote applications, and so forth. Sounds great, right? Computer security and keeping it simple. A legendary computer scientist, Sir Tony Hoare, once said: “There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.” Apple and Google’s approaches are all about keeping the car side relatively simple with the heavy lifting happening inside the phone. Conversely, SDL is trying to do more of the work inside the car itself. Not only does this imply many more problems with software bugs, integration issues, and long-term maintenance, it’s also going to be a nightmare for computer security. Yes, computer security. In the modern era, when cheap Chinese webcams have been used to mount massive denial of service attacks, it’s legitimate to consider how our cars should be resistant to external exploitation. Consider the last time you rented a car; you had no idea where it’s been. The prior driver’s poor taste in music or incomprehensible seating position is only the start of your problems when we’re talking about the car’s computers. Would you connect your phone with that car? The magic of having a standardized connection between your phone and the car, if it’s done right, is that you have a narrow interface between the evil, sharp, dangerous world of smartphones and the safe, fluffy, every-component-is-a-special-snowflake world of the automotive CAN bus, wherein any component can issue nasty commands to any other; see for example this lovely security analysis of J1939 communications used in big trucks and other heavy equipment. The car-side support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay can be small and carefully engineered. It can shield the car from evil phone behaviors. At the same time, the car/phone communication protocol can be sufficiently full-featured to pass along screen touches, wheel telemetry, and other goodies to make your smartphone nav work better than it could do alone. Likewise, the security-sensitive software on the phone can and will be updated all the time. Software in the car, at least for most cars, is rarely updated. Computer security is a process. No software is ever perfect out of the gate, and carmakers don’t generally have the processes or mindset to deal with this. After all, it took GM five years to fix the security vulnerabilities reported to them by a joint UCSD / U. Washington team. (Check out our TTAC coverage from 2011.) In short, everything about SDL seems to fly against Hoare’s keep it simple maxim. Inside the car, SDL places a full-blown web browser supporting the HMI. SDL includes a giant pile of C++ implementing the SDL Core. And how aggressive will the automakers be at rolling out monthly security patches for decade-old cars? How well do you trust them to debug and test their internal software against all the external phone apps that will be communicating with it now and in the future? In computer security lingo, SDL has a massive attack surface. In military lingo, SDL is a target-rich environment. Keep it simple! It’s the only way. Dan Wallach is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and a Rice Scholar at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Houston, Texas. His research concerns computer systems security, he harangues Rice CS sophomores to “write beautiful code,” and he’s really bothered the new Honda Civic Hatchback doesn’t let you get a manual transmission and Android Auto at the same time.

Recommended Back to Top End of Comments 19 Comments on “SmartDeviceLink Introduces ‘Target-Rich Environment’ for Car Hackers...” sirwired January 11th, 2017 at 2:00 pm The reasoning behind automakers wanting to push Android Auto / CarPlay to the side is obvious. If every entertainment system looks alike (because Android/Apple is running the thing), that’s now not a point of differentiation between automakers. It’s perfectly natural for automakers to want to make themselves distinct from the competition and sideline companies they view as nothing more than outside suppliers that aren’t beholden to them. The problem? They suck at it. With very few exceptions, what Google and Apple have put together is superior to what the automakers have devised for themselves, and the automakers have the disadvantage that they don’t have the massive infrastructure available to leverage the capabilities of the “mothership” in some distant data center. Google and Apple can respond intelligently and accurately to all sorts of voice commands because they can farm your request out to a distant server farm and leverage immense amounts of computing power and knowledge about you to compute the answer. In addition, they have all sorts of UI engineers that have some faint clue how to do their jobs, which apparently is not a job requirement designing OEM infotainment GUIs. Speaking for myself (the proud owner of a ’17 CR-V), AA/CarPlay was on my list of “must-have” features for whatever car I purchased. Login to reply psarhjinian January 11th, 2017 at 2:34 pm Dear christ, this looks like an attempt to make the same mistakes as we made when we allowed cars to just slurp phones via BT OBEX (and get, quite literally, everything utterly wrong), combined with the mistakes we made when we thought that RPC & DCOM were just fantastic. Great article, by the way. Login to reply wristtwist January 12th, 2017 at 11:32 am Logged in to say this. I’d love to see more of this type of article, especially considering how much software is driving everything now. Login to reply 5280thinair January 11th, 2017 at 2:54 pm For an analogy, look at the the mobile phone market back when the carriers controlled what software you could put on your phone (pre iPhone). The carriers had little interest in updating the capabilities of the software because they made their money selling the devices. Want newer/better software? You’ll have to buy a new phone. If manufacturers push more of the capabilities into the cars hardware and built-in software, and rely less on the phones, then they can push that same paradigm: gaining new features means buying new hardware (in this case, a new car). I suspect that’s the real incentive here. Login to reply 28-Cars-Later January 11th, 2017 at 3:00 pm “Want newer/better software? You’ll have to buy a new phone.” This is still true. “If manufacturers push more of the capabilities into the cars hardware and built-in software, and rely less on the phones, then they can push that same paradigm” This was already happening to an extent (i.e. feature X misses the product launch and you have to buy it again two years in to get it). We’ve already discussed the concept of a permanent leasing society and planned obsolesce, it benefits you very little and industry very much. Login to reply 5280thinair January 11th, 2017 at 3:14 pm “This is still true.” Not nearly as much as it used to be. Buy a Pixel phone from Google, or an iPhone from Apple, and you’re typically able to install the next 2-3 major OS upgrades and get the majority of the new features without paying more money*. Contrast that to the pre-iPhone days when getting any new capabilities pretty much required a new phone. I agree other features are already like this with cars. I suspect the mfgs want that to happen with infotainment systems as well rather than let Google/Apple get you upgrades for free or by buying a newer device from them where no money goes to the car maker. *Yes some new features are tied to the hardware, but typically those are in the minority. And yes, with a lot of cheaper Android phones the carrier never makes OS updates available; you need to do your homework to determine which carriers/phones will get updates. Login to reply Dan Wallach January 12th, 2017 at 8:26 am “Want newer/better software? You’ll have to buy a new phone.” Sure, but a new phone is a few hundred bucks, and many people upgrade every two years. A new car is a whole lot more money and you upgrade much less frequently. So far, only Tesla seems to be serious about adding new features to older cars. Sure, they’re not retrofitting AutoPilot hardware into the cars made beforehand, but all of the software upgrades that run on older cars are released for them. Note that it’s not just about “features”. It’s also about bug-fixes, security-related and otherwise. It helps immensely that every Tesla connects home regularly to download updates.

I was at Motorola when the iPhone first was launched, and honestly, for a year or two we were excited because it was a seismic tilt in the power balance between carrier and device maker that we assumed would also benefit us. Note that when Moto came out with the OG Droid, it also was famed for being naked unskinned Android, instead of coming with all the VZW/ATT bloatware. But, Moto being Moto, we got our lunch eaten anyways, and I left years ago. Login to reply epsilonkore January 12th, 2017 at 6:53 pm You have to keep in mind that cars should stay on the road an average of 8 years (I think I read that somewhere) and the software should remain relevant during that time. Static hardware/software isn’t the way to go. I have had Apples CarPlay in my 2013 FR-S (Via Pioneers NEX headunit) since CarPlay 1 and my iPhone 5. Every iOS update bugs were squashed, features added, and performance improved. Every new iPhone (on iPhone 7+ now) resulted in even better CarPlay performance. Now my screen is instant in response (vs pretty fast on my iPhone 5 and 6) and the App library keeps expanding (I have over 30 CarPlay apps available, though only 10 are regularly used). Apples Maps went from crap compared to Pioneers built in, to vastly superior within 3 years. Comparing my parents 2013 Edge (complete with the latest Sync Firmware updates) that is still useful, but sluggish in comparison to my 2013 Pioneer head unit with CarPlay is night and day. Expensive map updates hurt the argument as well. Add to that Siri, now reaching into my home with HomeKit… I can turn on my climate control, unlock my locks, and turn on the lights from the dash of my car or from my voice. Sync and its voice recognition, is stuck where it was (despite updates), with zero outside connectivity. Leave the software to Apple/Google/Amazon (Ford and Hyundai using Alexa is a GOOD idea… though I wish it was powered by a regularly upgraded phone instead of a static in dash system). Just give us big screens to project to, and API’s that allow Siri/OK Google/Alexa to control the cars climate/locks/lights/NAV (but not safety systems, brakes, steering… yet…) and let the cloud be leveraged to keep everything super fast in a way that static hardware can’t keep up with. Login to reply S2k Chris January 11th, 2017 at 3:13 pm Didn’t see it addressed here, but I’ve heard/read that a lot of the fight is actually about who owns the mineable data resulting from usage. If Apple/Google use the car as a display, all of the data stays on the Apple/Googled device for viewing/mining/use by A/G. If the work is done in the car, then all of the sudden the car makers own this data and can do what they will with it. Right Wrong Indifferent? Login to reply 5280thinair January 11th, 2017 at 3:23 pm I hadn’t thought about that, but it’s likely correct. Login to reply JMII January 11th, 2017 at 3:31 pm I would guess this is a driving (no pun intended) factor behind it. Remember its ALL about the data! The current business model (that everyone learned from the Google) is: this service is free, in exchange for free we record/track everything you do, since you do lots of stuff we then have lots to sell to others thus ensure this service stays free, plus these others can sell you more stuff allow the loop to go on forever. Honestly car OEMs have proven to be terrible at doing this kind of thing (OS, GUI, NAV, etc). So the CarPlay model seems 1,000 times better. So what is the smart OEM to do? I suggest they work on model specific apps and provide hooks into those via the car level connection. For example a “My Honda” app tells me when to change my oil, what my tires pressures are, current and past gas mileage, etc. Then using the phone’s push notification system interact with the customer that way. Instead it appears they are just going to make an over complicated mess that will never work and become abandon-ware as soon as the next model is released. Login to reply sgeffe January 11th, 2017 at 7:29 pm Just as navigation upgrades are in systems tied to the car. Empty wallet into plate alongside you, drop your pants. Login to reply Dan Wallach January 12th, 2017 at 2:37 pm I’ll probably need to write a whole new essay on this point, but here are the broad outlines of the issue. The name of the game is, of course, how to make money out of adding a car into the mix of information that’s already floating around in your phone. Here’s a simple example: how about radio advertisements customized to you? Just based on what you’re driving and where you are, an advertiser can infer an awful lot about who you are. If all the audio is streaming from your phone, then the carmaker gets nothing. Even without the customization, I’ll bet Pandora pays some kind of royalty to have their Pandora button built into your car. In the Apple/Google universe, Pandora does the integration work exactly twice (once for iOS and once for Android), and every automaker does the work twice (again, once for iOS and once for Android), and then poof, Pandora works in every car rolling down the road. No need to strike a royalty agreement with each automaker. No fuss, no worries. That’s something that Pandora would almost certainly prefer, although it does put Apple and Google in a central position to mediate what’s going on. If those two companies say “no GPS for you!” then Pandora can’t do location-specific advertising. If they hide the make/model of the car, then Pandora can’t use that to infer other things about you. Login to reply Frylock350 January 13th, 2017 at 9:36 am Fortunately as users in both iOS and Android we can say “no GPS for you” for any app. Login to reply schmitt trigger January 11th, 2017 at 8:51 pm “And how aggressive will the automakers be at rolling out monthly security patches for decade-old cars?

Login to reply zamoti January 12th, 2017 at 1:53 pm I for one, don’t believe that we should just accept this progression that’s being thrust upon us by a group of people that presume to know better than everyone else. As noted earlier, there is a ton of data to mine from cars, but it doesn’t serve the end user in any meaingful way. Sure we get cute apps that give us navigation and music, but what about something actually useful? In most modern cars, the infotainment system (aka, radio) is integrated into and has access to a variety of critical systems that reside on the CAN bus. WHY?!?! Why on earth does the radio need to talk to the ABS/traction control systems, or the ECU or any other non-infotainment (excepting HVAC maybe)? For many years we’ve had cars with complicated drive systems, transmisions, active suspension and they’ve had their own SEPARATE interfaces, that is a button or knob on the console somewhere. Now we need to shove all of this into a bright pretty toy for what reason? What problem is being solved with this? Worst of all, even with all of this information being fed to the dash computer, we STILL rely on a stupid check engine light! No clue as to what is wrong, some cars have some info, but usually nothing with any amount of detail. If there were a real benefit to the user, the carputer would provide a detailed narrative of what an issue is and even offer to send that data to a service center for advice. We could have remote diagnosis cost tracking (dollars per mile) but we don’t. Instead we’re all worried that our stupid phone won’t play music or share an address book in just the right way. I believe that there should be a full and hard separation of CAN bus systems from the infotainment system. Given that there has been no move toward benefit to the user and a LOT of risk for remote exploitation and unwanted surveillance, I don’t see any reason why they should communicate at all. Furthermore, there should be a common interface for these in-dash systems that will allow users to have them removed and/or updated and (God forbid) even changed for a different unit as the user sees fit. Instead of just being used to having our collective skin crawl, it seems that the media at large should be on point to call out these issues and question the WHY of what is happening instead of just asking useless questions like “will it connect to my old iPhone?” Login to reply Dan Wallach January 12th, 2017 at 2:41 pm Why not use completely separate buses? Two reasons: 1) Money. It’s all about the money. The more you integrate things, the lower your costs. 2) Features. Let’s say everybody decides to follow Tesla’s lead, and do everything on a giant touchscreen. That means HVAC controls, audio, phone, external networking, never mind various car controls like suspension settings, acceleration limits, and more. If you want all those features, that means your computer is going to be issuing CANbus requests to all the appropriate devices. Even in cars where you’ve got separate physical buttons for HVAC, stereo, etc., they’re probably still going with integrated electronics, since it saves money.

Tesla has announced that Chris Lattner – an eleven-year veteran at technology giant Apple – will be joining the electric car company as its new vice president of Autopilot software. Lattner’s eleven years at Apple saw him oversee and participate in several major projects, and the former Cupertino Director was primarily responsible for the creation of Swift – the coding language used to develop apps across many of the technology firm’s most popular devices. In a blog post on Tesla’s website, the company explained that Lattner will be tasked with leading the Autopilot engineering team. • Everything you need to know about Tesla Autopilot The move comes at an interesting time given Apple’s recent bid to refocus its auto industry efforts into developing self-driving technology instead of creating a car outright. The computer giant revealed its position on self-driving cars in a letter to the US’ National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in December 2016, revealing that it is “investing heavily” in the technology and is “excited by the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation”. It also comes as Tesla begins its push towards creating fully-autonomous vehicles. Late in 2016 all new Teslas received new hardware ready for full-autonomy, and the firm began introducing some of the so-called Enhanced Autopilot features in December. • Apple Car: All the latest news Tesla boss Elon Musk has set an ambitious target of the end of 2017 for full-autonomy from Autopilot, claiming one that of his cars will be able to drive from one US coast to the other without human intervention in a publicity stunt. It could be a few years more before the technology becomes available for motorists though. 2017 will be a big year for Tesla on two fronts. Alongside the continued development of Enhanced Autopilot, the firm will launch the Model 3 – its cheapest car yet with a waiting list of some 400,000 buyers. While we’ve seen pre-production versions of the car, we expect a full reveal of the final Model 3 to take place in Spring, ahead of first deliveries towards the end of the year.  Will Tesla be the first company to crack self-driving cars?

Smartphones running Google's Android operating system didn't exactly log stellar holiday sales, new data from Kantar Worldpanel ComTech shows. The research firm on Tuesday reported that Android sales dropped in the US, Great Britain, and France in the three-month period ending November 2016. At the same time, Apple's iOS "continued to make gains across most regions," Kantar said. This marks the sixth consecutive period of decline for Android in the US, the firm said. Google's mobile OS now accounts for 55.3 percent of all smartphones sales, down from 60.4 percent a year earlier. Apple, on the other hand, was sitting pretty at the beginning of the holiday period. Its iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and iPhone 6s were the three most popular smartphones in the US, accounting for a combined 31.3 percent share of the market. In the midst of its exploding smartphone gaffe, Samsung had the fourth and fifth most popular handsets in the US—the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge—and captured 28.9 percent of smartphone sales. Verizon helped peddle a lot of Apple and Samsung phones in the US, partly thanks to its attractive free phone promotion. "Verizon booked nearly a quarter of all US smartphone sales during the Black Friday period, playing a vital role for all brands, including Apple and Samsung," Kantar Worldpanel ComTech Consumer Insight Director Lauren Guenveur said in a statement. "Buyers were motivated by Verizon's promotions on both Apple and Samsung's top phones, including offers of free iPhone 7, 7 Plus, and Galaxy S7 phones after trade-in and purchase requirements were met." Related The Best Upcoming Phones of 2017 The Best Upcoming Phones of 2017 While overall Android sales decreased in the US over the past year, the new Pixel phone "made strong gains, rising to 1.3 percent of sales" during the period, Kantar reported. Things played out differently in China, where Android continued to dominate the market, accounting for nearly 80 percent of all smartphone sales during the period, according to Kantar Worldpanel ComTech Asia's Strategic Insight Director Tamsin Timpson. Apple's iOS dropped to 19.9 percent share in urban China from 25.3 percent a year ago, but saw a 2.8 percentage point uptick over the previous three month period, thanks to iPhone 7 sales. Meanwhile, across Europe's big five markets — Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain — both iOS and Android made gains. Android accounted for 72.4 percent of smartphone sales there during the period while iOS captured 24.6 percent — "a strong year-on-year uptick for both ecosystems," Kantar Worldpanel ComTech Europe Business Unit Director Dominic Sunnebo said.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Cars Image Source: Sessions/Future/REX/Shutterstock Tesla poached two of Apple’s top engineers in just one week Yoni Heisler @edibleapple January 11th, 2017 at 12:06 PM Share Tweet One of the more interesting challenges currently facing Apple centers on its ability to retain top talent. Apple may have billions of dollars in the bank and no shortage of hit products, but there’s no denying that many of the company’s best and brightest engineers, by their very nature, are always on the lookout for interesting and new opportunities. Don't Miss: Apple’s biggest new product since the iPhone may have just been uncovered That said, Tesla over the past few years has become an absolute haven for literally hundreds of engineers, designers, research scientists, marketers and publicists who previously put in time working for Apple. As a prime example, Tesla yesterday announced that it recently hired Chris Lattner to serve as the company’s VP of Autopilot development. Lattner may not have the name-recognition that, say, Scott Forstall had, but as the man in charge of Apple’s Swift and Xcode teams, Lattner was widely regarded as a software superstar within Apple. Now comes word via 9to5Mac that Tesla has poached yet another top Apple engineer. According to the report, Tesla recently hired Matt Casebolt, a mechanical engineer at Apple who previously helped develop the MacBook Air, the beloved and seemingly forgotten cylindrical Mac Pro, and the recently released MacBook Pro with the TouchBar. At Tesla, Casebolt will serve as the company’s Senior Director of Engineering, Closures & Mechanisms. It may seem like ancient history now, but Tesla and Apple for a while were engaged in a high-stakes back and forth poaching war, though that has seemingly died down amid rumors that Apple is re-thinking its plans in the auto space. At one point, it was even rumored that Apple was offering Tesla employees a 60% bump up in salary if they opted to jump ship. Tesla, though, never seemed outwardly concerned with Apple’s poaching efforts. You might recall that Tesla CEO Elon Musk in 2015 jokingly said that Tesla folks view Apple as a Tesla Graveyard. “If you don’t make it at Tesla,” Musk said at the time, “you go work at Apple. I’m not kidding.” Tags: Apple, Tesla View Comments Trending 1 Accessories This portable Wi-Fi router is smaller (and smarter?) than your smartphone 2 Mobile Watch this disgruntled customer drive her SUV through a T-Mobile store 3 Entertainment 9 new movie trailers you need to watch from this past week 4 Entertainment DirecTV Now is seriously broken 5 Retail The NES Classic Edition was in stock at Best Buy for just 20 minutes Picked For You Former Android chief Andy Rubin to release a high-end iPhone competitor this year By Yoni Heisler January 14th at 3:19 PM $40 device doubles the storage of your 32GB iPhone 7 or 7 Plus By Maren Estrada January 14th at 10:30 AM Whatsapp bug allows viewing of encrypted messages By Chris Mills January 13th at 11:01 PM Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use ad

Tresorit’s security technology, ZeroKit will pair up with CareKit to protect patient data in the cloud, Apple’s CareKit blog says. Beginning Wednesday, CareKit developers can use ZeroKit in their apps. CareKit helps developers create apps that allow health professionals monitor medical symptoms, send images of injuries and keep up on medication schedules. Related Stories CES 2017: You Will Soon Use Apple Pay At Vending Machines These Are The Best and Worst Health and Fitness Apps For 2017 “Apple designed the iOS platform and CareKit with security at its core,” a post on Apple’s CareKit blog said. “When building apps where data is shared across devices and with other services, developers want to extend this security to the cloud. This is exactly what ZeroKit does.” ZeroKit will bring user authentication to patients and healthcare workers, as well as end-to-end encryption, which will allow developers to protect PHI (protected health information). Encryption keys are protected, and if there is as a breach records would be visible only in unreadable for. The encryption security feature promises “Zero Knowledge,” which enables secure sharing of patient data without exposing information or keys. With the new partnership, developers will be able to reach the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance easier, in hopes that it will bring in more customers.

Matt Casebolt, who had worked on the Mac Pro and the new MacBook as a director of product design, said on his LinkedIn profile that he started as a director of engineering for closures and mechanisms at Tesla on his LinkedIn page in December. 9to5Mac first reported the news, and said he actually led the team working on the Mac Pro. Casebolt, judging by his patents, was a member of Apple’s elite design team, which historically has very low turnover. The small group used to be headed by Apple’s chief design officer Jony Ive, but has apparently been going through leadership changes recently. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has famously called Apple “the Tesla graveyard” based on its supposed proclivity to hire Tesla employees that didn’t work out. But the talent movement goes both ways, especially after Apple reportedly retrenched and downscaled its electric car project. One of the key goals of Apple’s electric car project was reportedly to retain top talent. Casebolt’s job change comes a day after Chris Lattner, one of Apple’s most visible directors as its head of developer tools and creator of its programming language, Swift, announced that he was headed to Tesla to head self-driving car software. Y Combinator, Silicon Valley’s premier startup incubator, also announced on Monday that Daniel Gross, who had worked on machine learning at Apple after it bought his startup, will be joining Y Combinator as a partner. A big company Bill Pugliano/Getty ImagesTesla CEO Elon Musk After Lattner’s announcement on Monday, Apple observers predictably started to speculate as to what it means for the company, and whether Apple may have a talent retention problem. Casebolt’s newly-publicized move will only add fuel to the fire. While highly-paid directors and managers leaving a company is never a good sign, it’s important to understand that Apple is a huge company, which has predictable turnover. Out of 116,000 employees, some are bound to leave from time to time. But there are signs that Apple’s approach to talent may be hitting a strained point. Apple announced through an SEC document last Friday that it had missed internal, still-secret targets for 2016. Apple executives lost compensation because of the missed targets. And there are signs that Apple, which has grown prodigiously over the past five years, may be slowing its growth on the rank and file and preventing managers from building teams as large as they were even a few years ago. In 2016, Apple only added 6,000 full time employees, according to SEC documents. That was down from 2015, when it added 17,4000 employees. Apple reportedly scaled back its contract recruiting too, according to a Venturebeat source. Message boards around the internet are filled with unconfirmed speculation about hiring freezes, and stories about successful interviews without job offers because Apple has significantly slowed hiring. Apple is still a coveted place to work, and most of the Apple people who I have spoken to love their jobs and the company they work for. It’s too early to say that Apple may be having trouble retaining important engineers. But Apple’s not the only game in town, and it has lots of employees that other Silicon Valley companies would love to have. Apple is expected to move its executives and lots of employees into its new “Spaceship” campus early this year.

Of the 3.2 Gigawatts of renewable energy purchased in 2015, more than two-thirds of that was from internet companies, Greenpeace notes. Some vendors are better than others at going green though. Apple, Google and Facebook have led the field in years past and do so once again in Greenpeace’s 2016 wrap-up report. Switch, the Las Vegas-based data center and collocation provider, is named a leader for the first time. Greenpeace calls out AWS for needing to do more. The Canadian-based environmental advocacy group says AWS has taken “important steps” in recent years, but they haven’t gone far enough. “Given AWS’s continued lack of transparency and its rapid growth in Virginia and other markets largely served by dirty energy, it remains unclear whether the AWS cloud is actually on a path to becoming renewably powered,” the Greenpeace report notes. Greenpeace says AWS, along with Asian data center provider Tencent, LG CNS and Baidu are each leaders in their respective markets, which “(makes) their lack of movement toward more transparency even more egregious.” Greenpeace AWS, for its part, has committed to being 100% powered by renewable energy, and it most recently said it hopes to be half way to its goal by the end of this year. “AWS has to date enabled 10 renewable energy projects in the United States that will deliver a grand total of 2.6 million MWh of energy annually onto the electric grid powering AWS data centers and four of these projects are already online,” an AWS spokesperson said. “That said, we are nowhere near done. We will continue to make progress toward our 100 percent goal and have many exciting initiatives planned.” Greenpeace gave AWS an overall grade of “C”, but gave it an F for energy transparency and C grades for energy efficiency and mitigation and renewable procurement. Meanwhile, AWS’s biggest competitors in the IaaS public cloud market are leaders in Greenpeace’s report. ALSO ON NETWORK WORLD: Whatever happened to Green IT? Google received and overall “A” grade, with a B in transparency and A's for mitigation and renewable procurement; Microsoft meanwhile got an overall B grade, with B's for mitigation and procurement. By comparison, some of Asia’s largest web services vendors like Baidu and Tencent got overall failing grades. See the full list of Greenpeace’s scores for Internet companies here. Greenpeace says one of the most disturbing trends is the growth of data centers in areas like Asia and Virginia, where there are limited options to power those operations from green energy. Greenpeace While some IaaS cloud vendors argue that a shift to using public cloud resources is good for the environment – because it consolidates workloads into providers who have a better opportunity to use green energy – Greenpeace questions this claim. “The transition to the cloud could in fact increase the demand for coal and other fossil fuels despite significant gains in energy efficiency and adoption of a commitment to 100% renewable energy because of the dramatic growth in new data center construction by cloud and collocation companies such as AWS and Digital Realty in Virginia and other hot spots that have some of the lowest percentages of renewable electricity in the U.S.” Tech vendors have an opportunity to drive toward a green energy future: Greenpeace estimates that the IT sector consumes more energy than Russia, Japan and India; only the U.S. and China consume more energy than the aggregate IT international sector.

In his first post for the publication, Soghoian shares his thoughts on Automator, AppleScript and similar services versus app extensions. Soghoian spent almost 20 years leading AppleScript, Automator and related technologies at 1 Infinite Loop. In the post titled “App Extensions Are Not a Replacement for User Automation,” Soghoian contemplates if Apple should decide to combine their engineering resources to form teams that delivered both iOS and macOS versions of apps. Although iOS and macOS app extensions could be a replacement for the full suite of user automation services in macOS (Apple Event scripting, Automator, Services, the UNIX command line utilities, etc.), Soghoian proposes that Apple think of user automation and app extensions in terms of “AND” instead of “OR.” To embrace the development of a new cross-platform automation architecture, maybe called “AutomationKit,” that would incorporate the “everyman openness” of User Automation with the focused abilities of developer-created plugins. App Extensions could become the new macOS System Services, and Automator could save workflows as Extensions with access to the Share Menu and new “non-selection” extension points. And AutomationKit could even include an Apple Event bridge so that it would work with the existing macOS automation tools. App Extensions could become another type of User Automation. What a concept. During his tenure at Apple from 1997 to 2016, Soghoian advanced a wide range of user automation technologies including UNIX CLI, JavaScript, AppleScript, Automator and scripting support for several stock apps. His profound belief is that “the power of the computer should reside in the hands of the one using it.” Even after being informed that his position as Product Manager of Automation Technologies was eliminated for business reasons, Soghoian still believes his credo to be as true today as ever. “If you have any questions or concerns about the future of user automation, ask Apple,” he said at the time. Apple’s boss of software engineering Craig Federighi responded by saying that his company has “every intent to continue our support for the great automation technologies in macOS”. While being an Apple employee, Soghoian blogged about automation over at macosxautomation.com. His work is greatly appreciated among the broader Mac community. Consequentially, having him leave the company is a loss for Apple and a major win for MacStories, which is one of my favorite Apple-centric websites.

A new video posted on Dickson’s website pits a pair of early iPhone prototypes against each other: Tony Fadell’s “P1” device based on the click wheel UI and ex-iOS chief Scott Forstall’s “P2” project. “To understand the iPhone today, and how it has shaped Apple and pushed the world forward, it’s important to have a sense of perspective,” said Dickson. Back in the beginning, there were two iPhone projects internally at Apple as Steve Jobs pitted Scott Forstall and “iPod Godfather” Tony Fadell against each other in a competition to see who could create a more compelling smartphone OS. Both project teams were extremely competitive because they wanted to impress Jobs. This is Apple’s standard practice as it often explores multiple device prototypes like many other technology companies do. For its next iPhone, for example, Apple is thought to have as many as ten different iPhone prototypes in its labs. The video embedded below pits “P1” and “P2” prototypes against each other. Although both devices run a prototype OS, code-named “Acorn OS”, the “P1” prototype runs faster because it uses a slimmed down version of Acorn OS while “P2” takes a significantly longer to load because it actually has a real OS. As you can see from the video, “P1” loads the classic iPod logo while “P2” shows the octopus logo. “These P unit prototypes are so early in the development process that they rely on a custom process to be turned off, and can only be powered down during a certain step of the boot process,” he explains. Although it may not seem like it, deciding between the two prototypes was no easy task for Jobs & Co. Tony Fadell had the clout of being the creator of the iPod and Scott Forstall had been working with Steve since the NeXT days. Fortunately for us, Forstall’s “P2” prototype won out. I say “fortunately” because as efficient as that click wheel-based interface is for browsing music, putting it on a phone would have resulted in a user experience nightmare. “The iPhone P2 is what came to be known as the original selling model of the iPhone, paving the foundation of where we are today, 10 years in the future,” said Dickson.

This sketch marked where the buttons would come, what features the phone would have etc. Also, as far as I know, there were 2 separate iPhone teams: 1 team worked on the hardware, which was looking like a real iPhone (like the phones form the video) but ran dummy / ugly software. The other team designed the software. They tested with ugly looking devices (bricks?), but these units ran the real iPhone OS software.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Wallpapers of the week: geometry pack Jailbreak tweaks of the week: OnceMore, Photicon, & more… The top stories of the week on iDB Photicon replaces your Photos app icon with a preview of your most recent picture AdaptiveColorAlerts colorizes all your alert messages to match anything behind them   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: OnceMore, Photicon, & more… Photicon replaces your Photos app icon with a preview of your most recent picture AdaptiveColorAlerts colorizes all your alert messages to match anything behind them Why to avoid third-party Cydia Substrate “patches” for the iOS 10 beta jailbreak OnceMore lets you repeat iPhone timers right from the Lock screen iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2017.

Photo / AP Apple could be set to make its biggest new product announcement since the iPhone, with the tech giant set to be entering into the world of augmented reality. It is believed Apple has joined forces with German lens specialist Carl Zeiss to create AR/mixed reality smart glasses that will arrive on the market sometime this year. This is according to tech evangelist Robert Scoble, who claimed a Zeiss employee confirmed the partnership at this year's CES. "A Zeiss employee confirmed the rumours that Apple and Carl Zeiss AG are working on a light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year.," he wrote on his Facebook page. "That explains why there was no augmented reality in Zeiss's booth even though it was right in the middle of the AR area." Augmented reality differs from virtual reality as it superimposes a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, instead of creating a fully immersive new world. The most popular example of the technology has been seen with Pokemon Go, which saw computer generated Pokemon appearing in the real world. This isn't the first time the company has been rumoured to be entering into the world of AR, with Apple's chief executive Tim Cook being vocal about his interest. "[AR] gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present, talking to each other, but also have other things - visually - for both of us to see," he told ABC News last September. Continued below. Related Content Summer Job: Spark chief executive Simon Moutter Your views: Readers' letters National election promise to create recreational fishing-only zones running behind schedule "There's a lot of really cool things there." Cook went onto say the "present" nature of AR made it more commercially viable than VR. "Virtual reality sort of encloses and immerses the person into an experience that can be really cool, but probably has a lower commercial interest over time," he said. "Less people will be interested in that." Additionally, Apple has filed a number of AR patents with the US Patent and Trademark Office, including a "transparent electronic device". - news.com.au By Matthew Dunn Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

 Blackberry is quietly trying to make a comeback — but not with phones Danielle Muoio Jan. 11, 2017, 12:30 PM 5,414 facebook linkedin twitter email print Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visits Blackberry's autonomous research center.Reuters/Blair Gable Blackberry has had quite the fall from grace. What was once the world's biggest smartphone maker is now out of the phone manufacturing business altogether. Since 2009, its market share has fallen from 20% to just .1%. But Blackberry is looking to stage a comeback, just not with smartphones. Blackberry has been quietly ramping up its self-driving car software efforts to compete with the likes of Apple down the line. Before you completely dismiss the old handset maker, it's worth remembering that Blackberry owns the QNX Operating System. That's the operating system Ford's Sync 3 infotainment system runs on, as well as General Motors' new OnStar system and the Audi TT virtual cockpit. It also supports Apple's CarPlay. Blackberry QNX is running in more than 60 million vehicles as of the end of 2014, with over 40 automakers relying on the software platform, Grant Courville, senior director of product management at QNX, told Business Insider.  Colin Bird, senior analyst of automotive technology at IHS Markit, told Business Insider that Blackberry QNX is currently the leader in the connected car space, which includes infotainment, navigation, telematics, and rear-seat entertainment. QNX has a market share of about 47% and its closest competitor is Linux with 20% market share. Blackberry is now modifying its QNX platform so it can run self-driving car tech as well. The idea is to give automakers a secure platform to run their self-driving car software. Since self-driving cars are still in their early days, many automakers are running the software on massive computers sitting in car trunks.  Blackberry is looking to get a slice of the self-driving car space by offering a secure, integrated platform to support self-driving car software later on. (Doing so also gives Blackberry some cushion to ensure its product stays in cars as they evolve.) "We’re not building a car and we’re not building hardware," Courville said. "Our ultimate goal is to provide a software platform for the car... become essentially the OS for the car." The self-driving Lincoln MKZ running on Blackberry QNX.Blackberry As part of that aim, Blackberry has opened an Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Centre in Ontario, where it was also approved to test self-driving cars on public roads. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made an appearance on the center's opening day. A self-driving Lincoln MKZ running on Blackberry QNX software also drove itself on a test track at CES this year.  "It’s us planting a stake in the ground in a much more public way than we’ve traditionally done and showing people we are absolutely committed to this and we do want to be that software platform for the car," Courville said. Blackberry CEO John Chen.AP It looks like Blackberry's focus on software is starting to pay off. Although the company missed on revenue in the third quarter, Blackberry posted a profit and raised its earning outlook for the 2017 fiscal year. Blackberry gets more than half of its total revenue from its software products and plans to increase its software revenue by 30% this fiscal year. Blackberry does not break out its QNX financials. But Bird said Blackberry gets anywhere between $5 to $15 in royalties per vehicle with the system. Blackberry is expected to deliver 36 million QNX licenses this year, Bird said. “I don’t consider ourselves in a turnaround anymore,’’ Blackberry CEO John Chen said during the company's earnings call, according to Bloomberg. “We’ll make money this year. Nobody believed us in the beginning.’’ But Blackberry is likely to face mounting competition from the likes of Apple. Bloomberg first reported in October that Apple is building an operating system for its car project in Ottawa, where Blackberry is located. Apple is looking to build the operating system for its own self-driving software to run on. Per the report, Apple poached two dozen engineers from Blackberry for the project. Apple also hired Dan Dodge, the former CEO of QNX, earlier in 2016. Blackberry But Blackberry does have two advantages over its current and mounting competition: speed and security. Blackberry's QNX Neutrino RTOS is an operating system that powers time-sensitive tasks, like driver assistance systems. Unlike Linux and Microsoft, QNX is able to handle these tasks in milliseconds, something that will become increasingly important as self-driving cars have to make quick decisions on the best course of action. Bird said that the QNX Neutrino operating system is a "significant" reason why Blackberry has had an edge over competitors already. Additionally, Blackberry QNX has an advantage when it comes to security. "One of the big benefits that we’re getting from Blackberry is all about security expertise, security software, intellectual property. And that’s what we’re bringing into automotive," Courville said. QNX is ISO 26262 compliant, which is an international standard for safety for electronics systems in automobiles. Bird said Windows is not compliant with the standard, nor are most Linux distributions. Having an operating system that can run self-driving software securely will only become more important as autonomous cars are prone to hacking. But what may truly determine which companies win out is their willingness to work with automakers when it comes to data ownership. "There will be a bit of tug of war between how much access the automakers provide to the vehicle and all the information that can come from vehicle," he said. "How much they allow, how much they monetize, and how much they keep to themselves."

Since its launch, over one billion handsets have been sold, giving rise to millions of apps and a new generation of mobile-based media. Steve Jobs introduced the very first iPhone on January 9, 2007, at Apple's Macworld conference in San Francisco. Back then, the iPhone was a relatively simple device. Its limitations ranged from the lack of an app store to the inability to customise the background wallpaper. From the start, Apple designed the iPhone to be a new kind of device. Jobs described it as a three-in-one handheld, combining the iPod's multimedia prowess with the data processing power of a computer and communications facilities of a phone. The idea quickly caught on, gaining momentum after 2008's App Store launch and then growing exponentially since. Only recently has Apple begun to find it more difficult to shift new hardware, forcing a divergence into new iPhone sizes and styles. Amid growing analyst uncertainty around the iPhone's future, Apple CEO Tim Cook sought to allay any fears in a statement for the iPhone's tenth anniversary. Cook promised Apple still has more innovation to unveil, claiming the company is "just getting started" on the iPhone concept. People looking at an iPhone handset Apple "iPhone is an essential part of our customers' lives, and today more than ever it is redefining the way we communicate, entertain, work and live," Cook said. "iPhone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started. The best is yet to come." In an interview with the BBC, former Apple executive Tony Fadell related how the first iPhone was built. Apple realised that high-speed data networks were the future of mobile connectivity. It also recognised it needed a new design to unlock the advanced functionality that data would deliver. It developed a variety of interface concepts before settling on the touchscreen form factor, including a bizarrely clunky design that lifted the iPod's interface onto the iPhone. It didn't last long before the company settled on the far more intuitive iPhone Operating System, later to be launched publicly as iOS. The debate over whether to include a physical keyboard took longer to be settled. Jobs was famously against it, insisting touchscreens were the future. Some engineers and executives were sceptical though. At the time, BlackBerry led the industry with its infamous keyboard-equipped devices. Jobs refused to listen to his critics though. The iPhone ended up being the all-touch experience we know today. A selection of iPhone handsets Apple At ten years old, the iPhone has achieved more than anyone could have imagined at its launch. For many people, it’s the most important device in their life, an entertainment portal, personal assistant, fitness tracker, productivity aid and gateway to the wider world. The iPhone remains the device by which many other flagship smartphones are compared against, the benchmark for what makes a revolutionary computing experience. It's still far from perfect and recent launches have exposed Apple's stagnating innovation. It remains the device that made "smartphone" a household term though. "It is amazing that from the very first iPhone through to today's newest iPhone 7 Plus, it has remained the gold standard by which all other smartphones are judged," said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. "For many of us, iPhone has become the most essential device in our lives and we love it."

Apple may have billions of dollars in the bank and no shortage of hit products, but there’s no denying that many of the company’s best and brightest engineers, by their very nature, are always on the lookout for interesting and new opportunities. Don't Miss: Apple’s biggest new product since the iPhone may have just been uncovered That said, Tesla over the past few years has become an absolute haven for literally hundreds of engineers, designers, research scientists, marketers and publicists who previously put in time working for Apple. As a prime example, Tesla yesterday announced that it recently hired Chris Lattner to serve as the company’s VP of Autopilot development. Lattner may not have the name-recognition that, say, Scott Forstall had, but as the man in charge of Apple’s Swift and Xcode teams, Lattner was widely regarded as a software superstar within Apple. Now comes word via 9to5Mac that Tesla has poached yet another top Apple engineer. According to the report, Tesla recently hired Matt Casebolt, a mechanical engineer at Apple who previously helped develop the MacBook Air, the beloved and seemingly forgotten cylindrical Mac Pro, and the recently released MacBook Pro with the TouchBar. At Tesla, Casebolt will serve as the company’s Senior Director of Engineering, Closures & Mechanisms. It may seem like ancient history now, but Tesla and Apple for a while were engaged in a high-stakes back and forth poaching war, though that has seemingly died down amid rumors that Apple is re-thinking its plans in the auto space. At one point, it was even rumored that Apple was offering Tesla employees a 60% bump up in salary if they opted to jump ship. Tesla, though, never seemed outwardly concerned with Apple’s poaching efforts. You might recall that Tesla CEO Elon Musk in 2015 jokingly said that Tesla folks view Apple as a Tesla Graveyard. “If you don’t make it at Tesla,” Musk said at the time, “you go work at Apple. I’m not kidding.” Trending right now: There will soon be a new bright spot in our night sky Exclusive: This image could be the world’s first look at the Galaxy S8 This rugged battery case doubles your Google Pixel’s battery life See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next 9 tech-friendly gifts for people obsessed with travel Yahoo Tech Is OJ Innocent?

Once you are there, log in to your account with Discover and open the "Shop Now" link, which will take you to the Apple store.

AFP Relax News•January 11, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Tim Cook is a firm believer in the future potential of augmented reality technology.More Apple is reportedly working on a pair of connected augmented reality in collaboration with German precision optics specialist, Carl Zeiss, according to the website 9to5Mac. The rumor comes from American blogger Robert Scoble, who reportedly spoke to Carl Zeiss employees at the recent Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. They apparently confirmed that Apple is working on a pair of lightweight augmented reality glasses. Although the information remains unconfirmed, it isn't the first time that the Cupertino tech firm has been linked to such a project. In fact, Bloomberg reported in 2016 that Apple was developing this kind of device. In reality, the augmented reality glasses are likely to function via connection to an iPhone. The Apple CEO has already spoken up as a greater believer in augmented reality technology than in virtual reality, adding further weight to the project's existence, even if it remains pure speculation. Robert Scoble even claims that the product could land as soon as 2017. Note that Carl Zeiss has already developed and launched a virtual reality headset, the VR One, which connects to a smartphone (Android or iOS). Currently, the connected glasses market is still in very early days. Following the failure of Google Glass, it was Microsoft that caused a sensation in 2015 with its Hololens glasses, allowing wearers to interact with virtual reality elements in a real-world environment. Hololens is out now in selected countries priced $3,000 in the form of a developers' kit for professionals. In a completely different genre and on a smaller scale, Snaps has launched Spectacles glasses that can film and share short videos online on Snapchat. CES 2017 brought a host of product announcements, notably the R8 and R9 glasses presented by Californian firm Osterhout Design Group. These use Qualcomm technology, making use of the latest Snapdragon 835 processor, and are due on sale in summer 2017, priced around $1,000 for the R8 and double that for the R9. Israeli start-up Lumus presented Maximus at the Las Vegas event. This prototype lets wearers experience virtual reality with a wide 55° field of view, and can be added directly to regular glasses. Maximus could also come to market soon.

First, you can pay a premium and order AirPods on Amazon. You’ll have them shipped to your door in two days, but it’ll cost you. The second option is to just order a pair on Apple’s website. At the time of this writing, Apple was quoting an estimated delivery time of six weeks for new AirPods orders. So, with any luck, you’ll have them in your hands — and in your ears — by mid-February. Your other option is to use one of several different AirPods inventory websites that have popped up since Apple’s hot new truly wireless earbuds debuted. And on that front, we have some good news: Our favorite site among them was recently updated with several great new features. Don't Miss: Exclusive: This image could be the world’s first look at the Galaxy S8 “AirPods Is In Stock” emailed BGR last week to let us know about a few important site updates. What’s more, at the time the company sent us the email, 115 different Apple stores across the United States and Canada had received AirPods inventory during the previous 10 hours. They were all sold out practically as fast as stock had arrived, but there’d an important takeaway here: AirPods are shipping to Apple stores with increasing frequency, so now is the perfect time to register for notifications. This particular site works two ways. You can use the Locations page to see a world map that plots out each and every Apple store across the globe. An example of a portion of the map can be seen at the top of this post. Stores with AirPods in stock are marked with green pins, which stores without any inventory are marked in red. Checking the map constantly is a pain, so AirPods Is In Stock also lets you enter your email and location, and you’ll receive a notification as soon as any nearby stores receive AirPods. In addition to Apple store locations, the site is now also tracking Best Buy stores, AT&T stores and Verizon stores. This means you now have an even better chance of finding your precious AirPods before someone else snaps them up.

Apple Man follows Wilson’s Chasing Crows, first published in 2013 and reprinted in 2015. Together, both printings of Chasing Crows raised more than $6,000 for the MS Society of Canada, a figure Wilson hopes to surpass with Apple Man. “Apple Man, like Chasing Crows, is an eclectic mix of accessible poems set in and around Victoria, South Yorkshire, UK, and elsewhere or anywhere,” Wilson says. “The poems in Apple Man are in the main, developed in the narrative style in which I am most comfortable,” he writes in his introduction. “They are meant to be accessible and amenable for reading out loud. They are diverse and some are more serious than others. Some have a ‘home’ on the west coast of British Columbia and some are rooted in the foothills of the Peak District of South Yorkshire and Derbyshire.” Readers will recognize some of the faces and places, such as Tea Room, Willows Beach Victoria, Ted, about longtime Oak Bay artist Ted Harrison, and Public Piano: “She is not Lang Lang, Clara Schumann, Billy Joel or Carole King, but she can play/Painted pianos appeared in our suburban, crow-chasing, gull-splattered village and one, by the ocean-side, demands a visit whenever she paddles that way...” An award-winning writer, Wilson grew up in the Loxley valley to the west of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. The son of a dairy farmer, he worked as an agricultural economist in Kenya and Zambia and later in Samoa in the South Pacific. Retiring from academic work, Wilson turned first to magazine writing, then poetry and short stories. His first collection of poems, Blackberries, was privately published in 2008 to support those with MS in the UK. 2013’s Nowt to do with Me – Rural Stories from the North England was followed in 2015 with a second short-story volume, Nowt To Do With My Wife. He is currently working on a third collection of stories drawing on his international work and travels and has other writing projects in process. Printed by Scott Wingfield of Art Ink Print, with the financial assistance of the Chadwick Foundation, all proceeds go to the MS Society, supporting research and programs for those living with multiple sclerosis. Illustrations accompany many of the poems, a collaboration with present and former members of the MS centre’s art therapy group in Victoria, plus three guest illustrators who donated pieces from their portfolios. “Of course we wish to raise much-needed funds to assist those who live with MS but also to make a positive signal about what can be achieved by those who work through the difficulties which MS brings to produce illustrations of beauty and charm,” Wilson says. Response to the new collection has been strong. “(I’ve had) very encouraging response to Apple Man so far,” he says, noting the launch will continue over the next few months, including in the UK and elsewhere overseas. Apple Man is available at a number of Oak Bay outlets, including Taste coffee shop on Cadboro Bay Road, Crumsby’s in Estevan village, Casey’s on Central Avenue and the Uplands Golf Club pro-shop. Alternatively, email Frank Wilson at mailto:Arnalw17@gmail.com or call 250-370-0774.

Mr. Casebolt was a Senior Director of Design at Apple, and we are sure you are familiar with his work. Among his creations are the MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar, the Mac Pro, and the first generation MacBook Air. Anyone can agree that these products have attracted the interest of tech aficionados, and the Mac Pro’s design is considered an iconic look. The Touch Bar is a widely disputed feature, but he turned into reality whether you like it or not. According to 9to5Mac, Casebolt’s new role is Senior Director of Engineering at Tesla Motors. His job title also includes Closures and Mechanisms, which means that the Falcon doors of the Model X are nothing when compared to what will come in a few years from Tesla under the imagination of Matt Casebolt. This is not the first time when Tesla Motors recruits a top level Apple employee, as Chris Lattner also departed the Cupertino giant last month to join the electric vehicle company. Tesla has not done that many high-level hires for quite a while now, but its competitors at Faraday Future snatched a few notable names from the automotive industry to handle its projects. Mr. Casebolt will join other former Apple employees at Tesla, including Doug Field, the former Vice President of Mac Hardware Engineering, who is currently the Senior Vice President of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla. The automaker started by Elon Musk has a public relations representative that used to work for Apple, and it also hired the Reliability Director of the Cupertino giant. We must note that the latest Apple hire from Tesla, Matt Casebolt, is listed on over 52 patents that were filed and granted to Apple, which is not something negligible for any company. In a way, it is not surprising to see that Tesla is hiring people that used to work for Apple, especially since their products are similar in design philosophy and desirability. Let’s hope that this collaboration will bring automobiles that are even more attractive from Tesla.

Read More . It’s a thoughtfully designed app where you create automation flows using blocks of actions that happen one after the other. I like to think of Workflow as n apps in one, where n is a variable limited only by your use cases and imagination. When you go in deep enough, it can be mind-numbingly complex. And as this is iOS, automation starts when you do something. The initial action required can come in the form of a Share sheet extension, widget shortcut iOS 10 Widgets Are Great: Here's How to Put Them to Good Use iOS 10 Widgets Are Great: Here's How to Put Them to Good Use Apple's new widgets in iOS 10 might not seem like a big deal, but developers have already made great use of this new function. Here's how to use them. Read More , or an app shortcut placed on the Home screen. So if you’ve yet to dip your toes into the wonderful world of iOS automation, here are 10 workflows to get you started. Workflow Is What You Make It Workflow ($2.99) lets you integrate system actions, IFTTT recipes IFTTT Applets Are Finally Here: What You Need to Know IFTTT Applets Are Finally Here: What You Need to Know Now, you can connect multiple apps with IFTTT applets. Find out all you need to know about them and enhance your productivity. Read More , and even web APIs to create stellar flows. But that’s not why we’re here. Today we’ll only look at simple yet useful, shortcut-based workflows created by the community. You can just add them and use them without doing anything at all. But I would suggest you use this time to notice how the workflows use different blocks and features. See if it sparks any ideas for a workflow that can solve a problem that’s personal to you. Using Workflow Gallery Once you’ve downloaded Workflow and set it up, tap on the Gallery tab to switch over. This section is dedicated to discovering workflows. This is where you’ll be able to browse top community workflows based on categories, actions and what’s currently trending. Tap on a workflow and you’ll see a preview of all the blocks and the flow. Tap on Get Workflow and it will be added to your library. You can then go in and edit it. Now that you’re familiar with the app, let’s talk about the workflows that you can just pick up and go. If you’re on your iPhone or iPad, tap on the titles to view the workflows, or just search for them in Gallery later. 1. Play Beats 1 Radio I don’t know about you, but I love listening to Beats 1. It’s what usually plays in the background when I’m writing (as it is right now). And the easiest way for me to start listening to it is using this workflow. I just swipe over to the Today view, and tap on Play Beats 1 from the Workflow widget. 2. Play Playlist You might not be a Beats 1 person, but you can use a similar widget shortcut to start playing a playlist of your choosing. This is handy when you’re ready to work out, or when you’re starting your morning commute. When setting up the workflow, you’ll be asked to select the playlist you want to launch. You can duplicate this workflow to create shortcuts for different playlists. 3. Speed Dial You can use this as a really quick way to call someone, right from the widget on your iPhone or even the complication from your Apple Watch. It might be marginally quicker than asking Siri to call someone for you The Master List of Every Siri Command and Question The Master List of Every Siri Command and Question Siri can do a lot for you, but did you know she could do this much? Here's an exhaustive list of commands Siri will take. Read More . 4. Log My Weight There’s no simple weight tracking app on iOS anymore (I’ve looked). This workflow lets me quickly record my weight, right from the Lock screen or the Apple Watch and adds it to the Health app. I can then go in the Health app to see how I’m doing over time. 5. Open URLs When you find yourself in a situation where you’ve got a link in your clipboard you want to open, this workflow lets you skip a couple of taps. Tap on Open URLs from the widget and the page from the clipboard will open in Safari directly. Pair it with macOS Sierra’s Universal Clipboard 5 Reasons to Install macOS Sierra Right Now & How to Upgrade 5 Reasons to Install macOS Sierra Right Now & How to Upgrade After a few months of public beta, the latest version of Apple's desktop operating system is ready for prime time. Read More to copy web links on your Mac and quickly open them on your iPhone. 6. ASCII Clipboard You don’t need to download an entire app just so you’ll always have the table flipping emoticon handy. This workflow creates a shortcut on your Home screen that gives you a list of ASCII emoticon that you can quickly copy to your clipboard. 7. Live Photo to Video This workflow lets you choose a Live Photo and convert it into a video, without ever needing an app. This makes it easy to post Live Photos to platforms like Instagram and Snapchat. 8. Download File Safari on the iPhone is not a sophisticated download manager. You could get a third party download manager or just use this workflow. You’ll be able to download a file using the link in your clipboard easily. Once the download is done, you’ll be able to save it directly to iCloud Drive or Dropbox. 9. Music Timer If you like listening to music when you go to bed, you can use this workflow to automatically pause the music after a couple of minutes (that you can define). 10. Make PDF This is a great example of a simple thing that Workflow does, that mitigates the need for a specific app. Just use the Share sheet extension from Safari to create a PDF for the current page you’re on. Becoming a Workflow Pro Once you’ve explored the blocks you’ll start coming up with ideas for workflows of your own. I, for example, have a workflow for creating screenshot images, like the ones you see in the article above. It stitches the screenshots together, resizes the image, converts it to JPEG and compresses it. Workflow does all four actions, one after the other, on its own. I just have to select the photos and select the workflow. It’s pure magic. If you’re looking for inspiration or help, check out the Workflow subreddit. If you want to look at even more community created flows, there’s a website dedicated to that. Also, check out Federico Viticci’s articles about Workflow, he’s a Workflow ninja who uses automation to get work done on the iPad. There’s also a series on using Workflow on the Canvas podcast that’s worth checking out. How do you use automation on your iPhone or Mac? Share with us in the comments below.

Now Soghoian has resurfaced online with a new guest series covering automation at MacStories. In his first entry, Soghoian argues in favor of continued automation services on the Mac versus relying on app extensions that work across iOS and macOS. Here’s a thought experiment. Let’s imagine that Apple decided to combine their engineering resources to form app teams that delivered both iOS and macOS versions of applications. […] Certainly Automation would be something examined in that regard, and the idea might be posited that: “App Extensions are equivalent to, or could be a replacement for, User Automation in macOS.” And by User Automation, I’m referring to Apple Event scripting, Automator, Services, the UNIX command line utilities, etc. Blogging as an advocate for automation on the Mac isn’t totally new for Soghoian who published at macosxautomation.com during his tenure at Apple. Still, it’s notable to see Soghoian resurface with a guest series after the news in November. Soghoian’s exit from Apple prompted a 9to5Mac reader to ask iOS/macOS chief Craig Federighi about the future of automation on the Mac which brought this response: We have every intent to continue our support for the great automation technologies in macOS! Whether that means maintaining current automation technologies or creating new that works across iOS and macOS is still up in the air, but it seems Soghoian will remain an advocate for power automation on the Mac. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Thu, Jan 12, 2017 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Tesla taps Apple engineer for its Autopilot software Reuters Electric automaker Tesla Motors Inc has hired a key Apple Inc software engineer to oversee its Autopilot self-driving software efforts, Tesla said in a blog post on Tuesday. Chris Lattner, who served at Apple for more than a decade, said in a online message to Apple developers on Tuesday morning that he would “leave Apple later this month to pursue an opportunity in another space,” without saying which company he planned to join. Later in the day, Tesla posted a message on the company’s Web site saying that Lattner had been hired as vice president of Autopilot software, but did not say when he would start work at the company. Tesla declined to comment beyond the announcement. Apple confirmed the departure, but would not comment beyond Lattner’s posted message. The move is a significant win for Tesla, bringing a high-profile figure in the world of software development for a position that previously did not have a full-time leader. Tesla’s Autopilot was overseen on an interim basis by software chief Jinnah Hosein of SpaceX, which is also headed by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk. Autopilot is the hardware and software system on Tesla vehicles that allows self-driving in some situations, but still requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. Federal safety regulators in the US are examining whether Autopilot played a role in a fatal crash in Florida last year. Lattner most recently served as a senior director in the developer tools department at Apple and was best known for introducing Swift, a programming language that made it easier for software developers to write apps for iOS, the operating system that powers iPhones and iPads. In addition to developing Swift at Apple, Lattner also led a successful push to make the programming language “open source,” meaning that developers could incorporate it into their applications without having to pay fees to Apple. The move was a first for Apple, which until then had typically tightly controlled the technology it created.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest MobileAppPage Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email With the introduction of Amazon Music Unlimited Amazon Launches Music Unlimited as a Spotify Killer Amazon Launches Music Unlimited as a Spotify Killer After months of speculation, Amazon has launched its own ad-free, on-demand music streaming service. So, what's the deal with Amazon Music Unlimited? Read More , there has never been a better time to introduce yourself to paid music streaming services, which continue to gain in popularity Why The Beatles Embraced Streaming and Why You Should Too Why The Beatles Embraced Streaming and Why You Should Too Music fans got an early Christmas present when, on December 24th, 2015, all of The Beatles' major albums were released on Spotify, Apple Music, and other streaming services. Here's why that matters. Read More . In this article, you’ll learn more about Amazon Music Unlimited and see how it compares to Spotify and Apple Music. Amazon Music Unlimited Not to be confused with Amazon Music (formerly Amazon MP3), Amazon Music Unlimited is a music streaming service that offers “tens of millions” of songs with new releases from today’s most popular artists. Like other premium music streaming services on the market, Amazon Music Unlimited allows you to listen to your favorite songs on-demand. You can also download your songs to your devices for offline use. Isn’t This Amazon Prime Music? If you’re an Amazon Prime member Is Amazon Prime A Good Deal? Is Amazon Prime A Good Deal? Amazon Prime seems like a great deal, but is it? We dig into the benefits to figure out if they're worth the $99 per year. Read More , you already have access to over 2 million songs at no additional cost. You also receive a thousand playlists and stations programmed by Amazon’s music experts. A membership to Amazon Music Unlimited, by contrast, increases the number of songs available considerably. You also gain access to new genres and styles of music. The best way to explain the difference between the two services Amazon Music Unlimited vs. Prime Music: What's the Difference? Amazon Music Unlimited vs. Prime Music: What's the Difference? Amazon recently unveiled a paid music product called Music Unlimited. How is it different from Prime Music? How much will it cost you? What will you get for your money? Read More (in additional to the library size) is how each handles new music releases. Amazon Music Unlimited will almost certainly have the newest album from your favorite artist on day one of its release. Amazon Prime Music probably won’t. Alexa Not surprisingly, Amazon Music Unlimited works with Amazon Alexa voice controls, found on devices such as the Echo, Dot, and Tap. For example, you can say “Alexa, play the new song by One Republic” or “Alexa, play the latest album by Rihanna.” You can also try commands like “Alexa, play the most popular rock from the 80s” or “Alexa, play music for a dinner party.” Availability Amazon Music Unlimited is available on multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, Mac, PC, Fire TV, Fire tablets, and on the web. Additionally, it works with home entertainment products such as Sonos, Roku, and Bose. The service is also coming on new cars from Ford, BMW, and Mini. At the time of this writing, Amazon Music Unlimited is only available in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Austria. Exclusivity Offering exclusive content is one of the ways music streaming services hope to keep customers. Despite being the newest service on our list, Amazon Music Unlimited got a huge exclusive to end 2016. It’s the first streaming service to feature Garth Brooks’ entire 16-album collection. The best-selling solo artist in US history had never allowed digital downloads for any of his music until now. Costs Amazon Prime members can subscribe to Amazon Music Unlimited for $7.99 per month, which is $2 off the standard monthly price. You can save a little extra by paying $79 per year upfront. Amazon also offers a family plan for $14.99 per month or $149.99 per year. With the family plan, you and your family can stream music on up to six devices at the same time. If you only want to stream music from your Amazon Alexa device, the company offers a low-cost option for $3.99 per month. New users can try Amazon Music Unlimited free for 30 days. Apple Music Given that iTunes brought digital music to the mainstream way back in 2001, it’s surprising that it took so long for Apple to offer a music streaming service of its own. First launched in June 2015, Apple Music provides a combination of on-demand music and curated playlists. As with Amazon Music Unlimited, Apple Music allows you to download music for offline use 10 Essential Apple Music Tips You Really Need to Know 10 Essential Apple Music Tips You Really Need to Know Since its launch in 2015, Apple Music has come a long way, baby. Unfortunately, it's still not the easiest or most intuitive service to get to grips with. Which is where we come in... Read More as long as you continue being a subscriber. When it first launched, Apple Music placed great emphasis on the service’s Beats 1 internet radio station and a blog platform called Connect. Featuring live broadcasts 24 hours a day, Beats 1 features anchors Zane Lowe, Ebro Darden, and Julie Adenuga, among others. Connect is for artists to share their posts, photos, videos, and tracks with subscribers. Apple Music still hosts Beats 1 and Connect, although the two features have taken on far less importance in recent months. In September 2016, Apple began rolling out two new personalized music playlists called “My New Music Mix” and “My Favorite Mix.” The former is similar to Spotify’s popular “Discover Weekly” playlist. Both offer music based on your listening history. Availability Not surprisingly, Apple Music is available How to Import Spotify, Rdio and More to Your Apple Music Collection How to Import Spotify, Rdio and More to Your Apple Music Collection What if you already have playlists on other services like Spotify and want to replicate those on Apple Music? Read More across all of Cupertino’s key products, iOS devices, Apple TV, and Apple Watch. It’s also available through iTunes on Mac/PC and Android devices. You can also stream Apple Music through CarPlay and Sonos systems. Apple Music is available in over 100 countries around the world with more coming online each month. If you’re reading this article, it’s likely that Apple Music is available where you are. Exclusivity With iTunes, Apple was a master at offering content before anyone else. The company has had similar success with Apple Music. In its short life, Apple Music has been the home to exclusive music from Taylor Swift, Lil Yachty, Usher, Frank Ocean, among others. These exclusives usually have a short window, allowing the music to spread to other services after a period of time. Costs An individual Apple Music plan costs $9.99 per month. A family plan, which is good for up to six people, is priced at $14.99 per month. Student plans are available at $4.99 per month. New subscribers can try Apple Music free for three months. Spotify Premium With 40 million paying customers worldwide, Spotify is the world’s top music-streaming service. First introduced in Sweden in 2006, the service is available in all corners of the world, including most of Europe, the Americas, and parts of Asia. Unlike Apple Music, Spotify offers a free plan that includes ads. Though highly restrictive, this program allows would-be subscribers to experience Spotify without paying a dime. Offering this type of availability seems to be working, as there are currently 100 million Spotify total users worldwide. Like the other services on our list, Spotify Premium gives you the ability to play any song, both on-demand and offline. Where Spotify Premium excels is with its “Discover Weekly” feature, which suggests music based on your music preferences and listening history. You also have access to custom playlists, which are put together by theme, decades, and genre. Availability You can find Spotify nearly everywhere, including iOS, Android, Amazon devices, Samsung Smart TVs, Roku, PlayStation, Sonos You Can Now Control Your Sonos With Spotify You Can Now Control Your Sonos With Spotify If you own a Sonos speaker, today is your lucky day.

You can also use Spotify on the web 7 Reasons to Start Using the Spotify Web Player Today 7 Reasons to Start Using the Spotify Web Player Today Spotify is about to shake things up by making the desktop and web app experiences more similar. So, it's about time many of us asked ourselves, Why not just use the web app instead? Read More . To date, Spotify is available in nearly 60 countries with more coming online each year. New subscribers can try Spotify Premium free for 30 days. Exclusivity Spotify isn’t known for offering many exclusives. The biggest news on this front, in fact, has been when artists have withheld new albums from the service due to royalty issues. Where Spotify does excel, however, is when it comes to curation. It offers lots of artist information, making it very easy to find songs to enjoy. It also does an excellent job of recommending additional artists based on your earlier preferences. Cost Spotify Premium is available for $9.99 per month for an individual subscription and $14.99 per month for a family plan. Students can purchase a subscription for $4.99 per month. Which Music Streaming Service Is Best? In general terms, Amazon Music Unlimited, Apple Music, and Spotify Premium offer the same underlying features, on-demand music and the ability to download songs for offline listening. From there, each provides unique extras worth considering. Amazon Music Unlimited is a great choice for Amazon Prime subscribers because of the extra discount it provides. Hardcore Amazon Alexa users can also benefit from selecting this service. By contrast, if your world revolves around Apple products, Apple Music is probably the one for you. One of the biggest advantages of going this route is that Apple Music automatically merges your streaming content with what you’ve purchased from iTunes. This feature is a big deal if you’re looking to expand your current library across multiple devices. Spotify Premium, meanwhile, is the best service for music discovery Discover New Music with Spotify's Automagic Playlists Discover New Music with Spotify's Automagic Playlists Spotify has recently released several new ways of generating unique playlists that will help you discover awesome new music. We're here to guide you through these automagic playlist makers. Read More . This is an important point to consider if you’re the type of person that appreciates finding new music and artists. As you can see, all three premium music streaming services have their advantages. You should therefore choose the one which best caters to your specific needs. However, I personally consider Apple Music the best option right now, unless of course you’re averse to all things Apple. Besides offering iTunes integration, Apple Music is the only one of the three premium music streaming services being compared here offering a 90-day free trial. Which will give you plenty of time to determine whether it’s the service for you. What music streaming service do you currently use? What made you choose that music streaming service over the competition? Are you happy with your current choice or are you considering switching?

While none of the services are perfect, GPM has been the best for me, and I've been a (paid) subscriber for years. I dumped Spotify when they couldn't get their act together with radio. I could be listening to jazz for an hour, and they'd suddenly give me a rap song... Hours into Beethoven & Bach, and they'd randomly inject hip-hop. Google seems to really have their act together when it comes to understanding my likes, and moods, and they figured-out (the first few days) that I'm not into rap or hip-hop -- something that seems to confound Spotify. Add to that the fact I can upload up-to 50,000 of my own tracks, and listen anywhere, on a ny device (it's completely platform-agnostic) and the service is a no-brainer. Reply likefunbutnot January 12, 2017 at 10:15 pm My problem with more or less all streaming services is the incredibly poor way they handle classical music. The services themselves have incorrect meta-data or use non-uniform sources, so it's very common to find albums or tracks misidentified because the services don't discriminate between the "Artist", "Album Artist" and "Composer" information, or because there's no official album title or a title that's entirely duplicated like "Herbert von Karajon Conducts Beethoven's 9th Symphony" (classical albums are really more accurately discussed by their publisher's catalog number; what we computer people like to call a "primary key") and every music database calls it something different. This is endlessly aggravating and renders more or less all mainstream streaming music services useless. It's also not going to be fixed, because the people who run the services and the databases they rely on don't give a shit what classical music people want. Services that cater to classical music fans on the other hand are incredibly expensive and will pretty much never have the support of mainstream devices, so we're left with our nerd options of maintaining a giant, self-organized library as a solitary pursuit or just giving up and accepting that everything sucks and is wrong. Reply Dan Fein January 12, 2017 at 8:41 pm It's about time Spotify will fix their shuffle play. It doesn't really shuffle your Playlist. Spotify neglects hundreds of requests to fix it in their support forum. This is very disturbing. Reply Erin January 12, 2017 at 8:29 pm I also use Google Play Music. I enjoy it a lot, especially since it also comes with YouTube Red. I also have tons of my own music uploaded to Google. I used the free version for a long while, but I got tired of the ads. Google Play Music also has a free 90-day trial. I'll be honest, I had every intention of cancelling after the free trial, but the lack of ads on Google Play Music and YouTube convinced me to pay for it. Plus, I like to listen to the music through my Chromecast. Reply Dimitri January 12, 2017 at 12:17 pm You should mention that either Apple or Amazon doesn't support Chromecast, and it's a deal breaker for me. I personally use the new Napster app from Rhapsody and it's fantastic. Same 9.99$ Reply Mediamark January 12, 2017 at 4:31 am I recently stumbled upon Amazon Prime Music and so far am enjoying it. I had been using Pandora, which is blocked by my new employer's security settings. Reply Aleks January 11, 2017 at 11:36 pm Google Play Music! Surprised it wasn't mentioned. Reply Sheldon January 11, 2017 at 11:00 pm We use Spotify Premium and we absolutely love it. Fantastic selection, high quality sound and terrific playlist recommendations. No reason to switch. Reply Ghazaros January 11, 2017 at 10:36 pm Get your facts right: apple music does have an android app, it just sucks. Reply kringler January 11, 2017 at 7:52 pm I'm still shocked that Google Play Music isn't included in the article. It comes with YouTube Red, which is a nice bonus, is essentially the same price, has a free, nifty 3rd party desktop app, has a music selection that doesn't seem far off from Spotify, and I greatly, greatly enjoy it's playlists—far more than Spotify's. I tried Amazon's since I have Prime, but the whole user experience is truly dreadful. Reply Matt Mauer January 11, 2017 at 7:20 pm Best one = Google Play music Reasoning: It does what the other ones do (all are roughly equal) but also has youtube red. How did this service get missed?? Reply Khai January 11, 2017 at 6:14 pm I use Google... but that seems to be invisible on here.. Reply Frank January 11, 2017 at 6:06 pm Spotify lists Rammstein. Amazon doesn't. Reply Frank January 11, 2017 at 6:05 pm In Germany Spotify lists Rammstein. Not to be found on Amazon. Reply Davin Peterson January 11, 2017 at 4:46 pm Hey, what about Google Play Music, which existed before Apple Music and can do the same things Apple Music can? Reply Gary January 11, 2017 at 4:29 pm Since I have Prime I started using the basic Amazon music. Previously used Pandora and podcasts. I switched to the new Amazon music unlimited recently when they were offering the $20 credit and free month. Get a lot more music that I could not get before. I prefer to download all to my SD card rather than stream. This way, my entire family(up to 10 devices) can use the service, since only one device is allowed to stream at a time. Is this the best service? Maybe, maybe not. It suits my needs and I already have it included anyhow and the extra $70? per year for more music isn't a big hit.

When he was at Apple, designer Matt Casebolt worked on revolutionary Mac products like the Mac Pro PC and the new MacBook in his position as director of product design. He has now decided to try his hand at electric cars over at Tesla. Going by the patents to his name, it appears that Casebolt was a member of Apple’s elite design team that’s made up of a select few and reports directly to Apple’s design guru Jony Ive. He’s not the only notable employee that has decided to make the move from Apple to Tesla. The news about Casebolt’s move comes merely a day after it was revealed that one of Apple’s most prominent directors and the creator of its Swift programming language Chris Lattner was joining Tesla to work on self-driving car software. Some market observers have already started speculating about a possible talent retention problem over at Apple. It goes without saying that Casebolt’s move is only going to fan the flames on these observations. To be fair, though, Apple is a pretty big company that employs tens of thousands of people. It’s only normal that some would decide to look for another opportunity. Filed in General. Read more about tesla.

Think that you'll have Apple-branded AR glasses attached to your face before 2017 is out? I wouldn't hold my breath. By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | January 11, 2017 -- 16:19 GMT (08:19 PST) | Topic: Apple Apple is working with renowned optics firm Carl Zeiss to develop AR (Augmented Reality) glasses that could hit shelves before the year is out. This is what tech industry insider Robert Scoble claims, based on claims made by loose-lipped Zeiss employees: What's Hot on ZDNet Microsoft rolls out second Windows 10 Creators Update test build in a week House bill aims to block tech giants from building "Muslim registry" With the rise of global instability, can ceramic storage save our digital culture? CES 2017 recap video: Big trends, top products, and wackiest tech A Zeiss employee confirmed the rumors that Apple and Carl Zeiss AG are working on a light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year. (I thought it was next year but now that I saw this I believe it will happen this year). Both Apple and Carl Zeiss have, predictably, declined to comment. However, we know that Apple is interested in AR because CEO Tim Cook has himself talked openly about it. This isn't the first time that Scoble has claimed that Apple was working on AR with Zeiss. There was the time that he claimed that he was "100% sure the next iPhone is clear." I've extensively debunked this transparent iPhone thing here. OK, back to the AR glasses/goggles. Will these be the big thing in 2017? Rather than dismiss the claims out of hand, let's look instead at the pros and cons (although it's hard to come up with any really compelling "pro" arguments). Pros: Apple needs a new hit product to take up some of the slack from iPhone sales. We know AR is on Apple's radar based on past comments made by Cook. It's a hot area that companies are flocking to. AR would open up a new app market. Cons: AR doesn't have to mean glasses or goggles. A heads-up display in a car or holding up a smartphone and having the display show information on your surroundings are both AR. It is important to remember this. The products that have launched into the AR marketspace haven't been overwhelmingly successful. How big of a market is there really for AR/VR (Virtual Reality) at present? Apple's ecosystem right now revolves around the iPhone (yes, iPhone, not Mac). A new class of product that sits outside of this would be a distraction unless Apple was almost guaranteed of its success. Strategically, it doesn't make much sense for Apple to crowd the marketplace with a new product. Apple's lineup is arguably already cluttered. Apple's big 2017 product will be the iPhone 8 (or whatever it ends up being called). Anything that distracts from that this year could be a bad move for Apple. It's likely that Apple's response to the growing VR/AR trend will be to add that capability to the iPhone because that makes sense on a number of fronts (it's a new feature to sell the iPhone, it's not a whole new class of product to push, it helps keep the ecosystem tight). The bottom line: It's all a balancing act. On the one hand, it's easy to think that Apple needs a new product to take the edge off the iPhone sales slump, and AR wearables are what the cool kids are all taking about, so it seems logical. The flipside is that new products move the focus away from existing products, and this might not be such a clever move given that Apple wants people to be buying iPhones, since that's where the company's biggest chunk of dollars still comes from. The most logical move would be for Apple to make the iPhone the center of its AR aspirations. Top Windows 10-powered alternatives to the...

Apple was trailed by Facebook and Google, which, with scores of 67 and 56 per cent respectively, were also awarded A grades. But the report’s authors looked less favourably upon Amazon and Netflix, whose progress was described as “lagging”. Noah Berger / Reuters The Apple Campus 2 is seen under construction in Cupertino, California. The campus is set to be powered by renewable energy sources.  Apple scored As for energy transparency, renewable energy commitment and sitting policy, energy efficiency and mitigation and energy procurement. It only fell down in one category – advocacy, for which it scored a B. Apple, Facebook and Google are racing to become the first tech companies to be 100% renewably powered.  Apple hit 93% in 2015, but has not yet set a date for when it will be fully powered by renewables. It could be overtaken by Google this year, which has plans to buy enough wind and solar energy to offset all its electricity usage in 2017. Netflix also has plans to fully offset its carbon footprint, but Greenpeace said it is “likely” turning to carbon offsets or unbundled renewable energy credits, which “do little to increase renewable energy investment”. The firm accounts for one third of internet traffic in North America. Meanwhile, Amazon’s clean energy index rating fell after the firm grew its data centre capacity in Virginia, where Greenpeace said there are few renewable energy options.  “Given [Amazon Web Service’s] continued lack of transparency and its rapid growth in Virginia and other markets largely served by dirty energy, it remains unclear whether the AWS cloud is actually on a path to becoming renewably powered,” the report said.  Greenpeace is calling on firms to make a number of pledges, including to hit 100 per cent renewable power, to greater energy transparency and to develop a strategy for increasing the supply of renewable energy. The report’s authors stressed that tech firms have the power to influence others in the industry. Apple was described as playing a “catalytic role within its IT supply chain, pushing other IT data centers and cloud operators who help deliver pieces of Apple’s corner of the internet to follow their lead in powering their operations with renewable energy”.  HuffPost UK has approached Netflix and Amazon for comment.  Update: An Amazon spokesperson told HuffPost UK: “In November 2014 AWS made a long-term commitment to achieve 100 percent renewable energy and in just two years we’ve made strong progress towards that goal. By April 2015 we hit 25 percent renewable, closed 2016 at 45 percent renewable, and have set a goal to reach 50 percent by the end of 2017. “AWS has to date enabled 10 renewable energy projects in the United States that will deliver a grand total of 2.6 million MWh of energy annually onto the electric grid powering AWS data centers and four of these projects are already online. That said, we are nowhere near done.

James Martin/CNET Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email When the FBI revealed it was able to hack into an iPhone used by one of the terrorists involved in the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, people wanted to know just how the agency did it. In fact, three news organizations sued the FBI in September for just this information. And because of that lawsuit, the agency released 100 pages of documents Friday. The problem is they’re heavily censored, according to the Associated Press. The documents don’t reveal who the FBI hired to hack into the phone or how much it paid that vendor. The FBI labeled those files “secret” before they were released. The iPhone was at the center of a legal back-and-forth between the government and Apple last year after the December 2015 attack that left 14 people dead. The government wanted Apple to write new software that would unlock the phone and make its data readable. Apple refused, saying that weakening the encryption would potentially leave other iPhone users at risk. In a surprise revelation in March, the Department of Justice said an unnamed outside party helped agents break into an iPhone 5C that was used by shooter Syed Farook. However, the agency wouldn’t disclose how the hacker got into the phone.

A governme... The lawsuit against the FBI was filed by the Associated Press, Vice and Gannett, the parent of national newspaper USA Today. The three news organizations sought details about the hacker the FBI used and associated costs. The FBI reportedly refused to provide that information to the organizations under the Freedom of Information Act. In the lawsuit complaint, the news organizations argued the public has a right to know how the government spent taxpayer funds to obtain the hacking technique. They also argued the existence of a secret flaw in the iPhone could leave the public in danger. While the most critical information remains unknown, the FBI’s released documents do reveal that the agency received three submissions from companies to hack into the phone and that it signed a nondisclosure agreement with the vendor it chose, according to the Associated Press. An FBI spokeswoman said the agency is not commenting beyond what was released to the three news organizations. This article originally appeared on CNET.com.  © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc..

Lattner is, notably, the mind behind Apple’s “newest” programming language, Swift. The timing of this is interesting, as Apple only just announced Lattner’s departure today (January 10th). I’d be curious to know how long the two have been talking/negotiating. What’s also notable is that Lattner worked for Apple for so long (11 years), but Tesla was able to steal him away anyway. Maybe he wanted a new challenge? (Or maybe he thinks that Apple is now on the decline and Tesla on the rise? This is pure speculation on my part of course.) Here’s more from Tesla regarding who has been holding down the fort while waiting for Lattner to come on board: “As Chris joins Tesla, we would like to give a special thanks to Jinnah Hosein, SpaceX’s Vice President of Software, who has been serving a dual role as the interim Vice President of Tesla Autopilot Software and will now be heading back to SpaceX full-time. We would like to thank Jinnah for the efforts needed to achieve excellence in both roles, David Nister, our Vice President of Autopilot Vision, and the team for their exceptional work in advancing Autopilot.” Elon provided a short addendum on Twitter: @TeslaMotors Tesla's approach to building an autonomy platform is focused on high compute efficiency machine learning. Primarily vision w radar & sonar. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 11, 2017 Tech Crunch provides more context on Lattner: “Lattner’s history includes creating the Clang compiler and designing the LLVM compiler optimization infrastructure. He was also a key contributor to the evolution of Objective C and worked on Apple’s Xcode software development tool during his time at the iPhone maker. He also apparently builds beautiful raw-edge wood furniture.” On a related note, Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently announced via Twitter that the company could begin rolling out the software update enabling Autopilot functionality in HW2 vehicles within the next week. If all looks good, HW2 Autopilot functionality will switch from shadow to active mode by end of week for cars beyond initial 1000 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 8, 2017 Photo via Chris Lattner’s website Buy a cool T-shirt or mug in the CleanTechnica store!   Keep up to date with all the hottest cleantech news by subscribing to our (free) cleantech newsletter, or keep an eye on sector-specific news by getting our (also free) solar energy newsletter, electric vehicle newsletter, or wind energy newsletter.

The small group used to be headed by Apple's chief design officer Jony Ive, but has apparently been going through leadership changes recently.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk has famously called Apple "the Tesla graveyard" based on its supposed proclivity to hire Tesla employees that didn't work out. But the talent movement goes both ways, especially after Apple reportedly retrenched and downscaled its electric car project.  One of the key goals of Apple's electric car project was reportedly to retain top talent. Casebolt's job change comes a day after Chris Lattner, one of Apple's most visible directors as its head of developer tools and creator of its programming language, Swift, announced that he was headed to Tesla to head self-driving car software.  Y Combinator, Silicon Valley's premier startup incubator, also announced on Monday that Daniel Gross, who had worked on machine learning at Apple after it bought his startup, will be joining Y Combinator as a partner.  A big company  View photos Elon MuskMore (Tesla CEO Elon MuskBill Pugliano/Getty Images) After Lattner's announcement on Monday, Apple observers predictably started to speculate as to what it means for the company, and whether Apple may have a talent retention problem.  Casebolt's newly-publicized move will only add fuel to the fire.  While highly-paid directors and managers leaving a company is never a good sign, it's important to understand that Apple is a huge company, which has predictable turnover. Out of 116,000 employees, some are bound to leave from time to time.  But there are signs that Apple's approach to talent may be hitting a strained point. Apple announced through an SEC document last Friday that it had missed internal, still-secret targets for 2016. Apple executives lost compensation because of the missed targets.  Apple, which has grown prodigiously over the past five years, may be slowing its growth on the rank and file and preventing managers from building teams as large as they were even a few years ago.  In 2016, Apple only added 6,000 full time employees, according to SEC documents. That was down from 2015, when it added 17,400 employees. Apple reportedly scaled back its contract recruiting too, according to a Venturebeat source. Message boards around the internet are filled with unconfirmed speculation about hiring freezes, and stories about successful interviews without job offers because Apple has significantly slowed hiring.  Apple is still a coveted place to work, and most of the Apple people who I have spoken to love their jobs and the company they work for. It's too early to say that Apple may be having trouble retaining important engineers. But Apple's not the only game in town, and it has lots of employees that other Silicon Valley companies would love to have.  Apple is expected to move its executives and lots of employees into its new campus early this year.  Know anything about hiring at Apple?

(Monica Davey/European Pressphoto Agency) Owners of Apple's wireless AirPods might now have a tougher time finding a missing earbud. “Finder for AirPods,” an app designed to help users who have misplaced their wireless ear buds, was removed by Apple from the App Store late last week, MacRumors reported. The app, which uses the AirPods' built-in Bluetooth technology to locate the missing buds, only survived several days on the App Store before its removal. Deucks, the developers responsible for creating the app, said in an email interview that Apple did not give a specific justification for removing their app. The smartphone giant told them that they determined that “the 'concept' of people finding their AirPods with the app was deemed 'not appropriate for the App Store,'" Deucks said. Apple has not yet responded to a request for comment. The app works by displaying a bar that fills up if the buds are close by and drain if the user moves away. The Bluetooth locator only works if the AirPods are turned on, meaning that if the ear buds run out of battery, the app won't be of much use. MacRumors tested the app when it was released last week to positive results, though they noted that the Bluetooth signal isn't strong enough to help a user find AirPods that are located on a different floor. AirPods, which have faced criticism for being easy to lose, can run for about five hours before losing battery charge. A replacement will run $69 for one and $159 for an entire new set, which comes with two AirPods and a charging case. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

Famed tech blogger and entrepreneur Robert Scoble broke the tip on his Facebook page. According to Scoble, the German optics manufacturer might announce a “light pair of augmented/mixed reality glasses” this year as part of a collaboration with Apple. Scoble said that he pressed Zeiss representatives to tip their hand. Previously, Apple was rumored to be preparing AR tech for a 2018 launch, but Scoble is confident that the set will release later this year. Rumors about an Apple-made version of the Google Glass or Microsoft’s HoloLens have been floating around for a couple years now, so it’s probable that the company’s been working on smart glasses for some time and could be nearing a release-ready gadget. If Apple’s patent filing from last June is any indication, we could be getting a flexible, AMOLED-driven translucent screen that wraps around the user’s head. Alternatively, the patent includes a process which would allow a lens to deform and then return to its original shape. That means we may even see eye glass frames that will accept modified lenses that could popped in and out as needed without damaging the transparent AMOLED display. While a good chunk of people on earth have readily adopted smart phones, other wearables have been slow to pick up steam. Google Glass didn’t do super well, and its users took a lot of flak for being a bit out of touch. Like it or not though, Apple’s been something of a trendsetter, and while they’re often among the last to get some things to market, when Apple does launch a new device, it tends to do pretty well. So it’s possible that Apple’s move could be the big push AR glasses need to go mainstream. Technically, this is all rumors and hearsay, but given how these things tend to go, I’d say it’s a good bet Apple’s got something cooking. For now, I’m just wondering how weird and pretentious the company will get with the name. Maybe iSpecs? Or iS (said “eyes”)? WHO KNOWS.

CLOSE Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Sunday, January 15, 2017 Insider K Street Lifestyle Opinion Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Home Headline Comparing Apples to Apples: Banning Smartphones Increases the Digital Divide Headline Comparing Apples to Apples: Banning Smartphones Increases the Digital Divide By Kristal High - 9:19am February 27, 2015 2122 4 SHARE Facebook Twitter There seems to be a growing sense of exceptionalism going around Silicon Valley these days – what’s good for the goose isn’t good for the gander. Large tech companies are trying to manipulate laws and regulations to get a competitive edge while regular folks are left to deal with the fall out. The latest example of the “X law should only apply when it benefits me” logic comes by way of the on-going patent wars between smartphone providers Apple and Samsung. In 2011, Apple filed suit against Samsung claiming the company made smartphones that infringed on patents currently held by Apple.  Today, the companies remain embroiled in several lawsuits with billions of dollars on the line. Apple’s main gripe is that Samsung has apparently infringed on various patents in the production of its Android smartphones. Ironically, a federal jury in Texas just found Apple liable of patent infringement to the tune of $532.9 million for willfully using another company’s patents in its iTunes software.  Even still, Apple has been granted monetary damages for Samsung’s infringement of three patents.  Now, the company is seeking to prevent Samsung from “making, selling, developing, or advertising” smartphones containing “infringing features in its products.” Apple made $182.35 billion last year, resulting in $39.51 billion in profits being added to the company’s bottom line for 2014. It was ranked the most successful company in the world…ever…based on its fourth quarter performance. Yet, it’s claiming that Samsung should be effectively banned from making and selling several models of its smartphones so as not to place in jeopardy Apple’s competitive position. A bit of Shakespeare is apropos for these theatrics: “the lady doth protest too much, methinks.”  The lady, of course, in this instance is Apple. Not only are Apple’s actions ludicrous, but they are very dangerous and run the risk of increasing the digital divide.  According to the Pew Internet & American Life Project, 90% of American adults own cell phones while 58% own smartphones.  People of color slightly over-index the national averages with 59% of African Americans and 61% of Hispanics owning smartphones, and 90% and 92%, respectively, owning cell phones. Even though a pervasive digital divide means far too many people of color and members of low-income communities don’t have broadband at home, 60% of cellphone owners use their mobile devices to get online. Of all American smartphone owners, 52% own androids while 42.7% own iPhones. So what does this tell us? Smartphones, with their ability to enable the use of varied applications and word processing programs, make all the difference in the world between the digitally connected and those who are on the wrong side of the digital divide. Even still, not everyone can afford a $600 iPhone, and so the Android market has become essential to ensuring that people not only have a choice in the kind of smartphone devices they purchase, but also that they are able to affordably access the web. The potential for smartphones to bridge the digital divide countered against the cost of obtaining a smartphone device makes Apple’s law suits against Samsung over the past four years all the more ridiculous.  It’s one thing to claim a competitor is infringing upon your patents.  It’s quite another to seek injunctive relief (meaning that the android phones containing the allegedly infringing patents would have to be taken off the market) disconnecting people from the affordable technology that allows them to get online in the first place. United States District Judge Lucy H. Koh, authoring the opinion of the Court in Apple v. Samsung in 2014, got it right when she determined that “the principles of equity do not support a permanent injunction” in this case. Even assuming Samsung did, in fact, infringe on three patents held by Apple, she said, Apple has not and cannot demonstrate that it suffered any irreparable harm from the exploitation of these patents, it did not experience any loss to its sales or reputation because of any patent infringement, and it didn’t make the case that Samsung was the actual cause of any such harm. There are certainly those instances in which patent infringement, especially in the tech sector, harms the public interest and places a company and its intellectual property in danger. This, however, is not such a case. Not only would the public interest be harmed if Samsung couldn’t produce or sell its smartphones – the average cost of an Android is $254, while the average cost of an iPhone is $687. But it’s incredibly hard for Apple, which just had the most profitable quarter of any company in the world in the recorded history of mankind, to seriously argue that the production of competitive smartphones containing portions of ostensibly infringing patents somehow damages its reputation and financial standing. The tech game almost inevitably breeds overlap in products and ideas. While some sort of action may be required to compensate parties from having their ideas coopted and exploited by others for profit, people would suffer if the standard Apple is trying to promote in its dispute against Samsung was allowed to stand. As a society that increasingly relies on smartphones to conduct just about every facet of our lives, we cannot afford to allow behemoth corporations to pretend that law and equity require a specific result that, in truth, only maximizes that company’s bottom line.  Apple is no innocent bystander here, and the real balance of equity we should be focused on is the impact on real people who would truly lose out and fall deeper in the cracks of the digital divide if options for affordable smartphones are taken out of production.     TAGS Android apple apple v. samsung cell phone digital divide iPhone lacy h. koh patent patent troll pew internet samsung smart phone smartphone u.s. district court SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleOpen Carry Gun Laws Won’t Work for Black People Until Racial Bias Abates Next articleLeelah Alcorn’s Story Rings True for Everyone Who’s “Different” Kristal High http://www.politic365.com Kristal Lauren High co-founded and serves as Editor in Chief of Politic365.

San Bernardino County Sheriff-Coroner officials said Mindy Thorp, 37, of Lucerne Valley, was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash. Coroner officials also said Ethan Cutuli, 29, of Apple Valley, succumbed to injuries at a local hospital nearly two hours after the collision, reported at 4:47 p.m. California Highway Patrol spokesman Matt Hunt said the cause of collision was under investigation. But according to the preliminary investigation, Hunt said Thorp was traveling westbound on Dale Evans Parkway in a 1997 Toyota Corolla at an unknown speed when for reasons unknown “allowed her vehicle to enter the oncoming traffic lane.” The Toyota then collided head-on with a 2003 Chevrolet Malibu, driven by Cutuli, who was extricated from his vehicle and transported to St. Joseph Health, St. Mary, where he was pronounced dead at 6:41 p.m. Both vehicles sustained major damage and the impact launched the Corolla's motor over 50 feet away from the crash site. Authorities shut down Dale Evans Parkway from the Interstate 15 off-ramp to Morro Road due to the crash. Jose Quintero may be reached at 760-955-5332 or JQuintero@DesertDispatch.com.

Image: Angelus_Svetlana/Shutterstock A veteran of Apple, engineer Chris Lattner has left the tech giant to join Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company Tesla, ending an 11-year stint at his previous workplace. Mere hours after Chris Lattner announced plans to leave Apple and “pursue an opportunity in another space”, the engineer, credited as an ‘open-source programming guru’ in parts, popped up at Tesla. In a blog post by Elon Musk’s electric car company, Tesla welcomed Lattner, who is taking up his role as VP of the organisation’s Autopilot software. Senior role This software might ring a bell, as it’s the area that made headlines last year when a person died in a Model S after it hit a trailer while in autopilot mode. With Lattner now taking a senior role, it means that Jinnah Hosein, SpaceX’s VP of software, no longer has to double-job. “Chris’s reputation for engineering excellence is well known,” said Tesla, noting his work on Apple’s Swift programming language, a tool allowing developers to build products for the App Store. Tesla is set for a busy 12 months, with global expansion continuing at pace and hundreds of thousands of car orders filed ahead of the company’s first ‘affordable’ product roll-out. In March last year, just 24 hours after announcing, the Model 3 (at $35,000) was taking orders ahead of a late 2017 release. The number of those putting down deposits exceeded 232,000 worldwide. At $1,000 per deposit, the company raised almost $250,000 on the back of one statement, with many more orders following. Spread thin Now the race is on to get the vehicles ready for shipping, not an easy task due to the company’s relatively light footprint across global markets. Late last year, plans finally emerged for an Irish base, with the first of the Tesla-branded charging points appearing at the Powerscourt Hotel, Co Wicklow. The number of dedicated ‘destination charging points’ is expected to be in double figures soon. Ireland isn’t alone, as a network of charge points and Tesla showing rooms are clearly a requirement throughout this year. To help with the actual software that will support the subsequent customers, Lattner was recruited. “We are very excited that Chris is joining Tesla to lead our Autopilot engineering team and accelerate the future of autonomous driving,” said the company.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     Consumer Reports Retests New MacBook Pro Posted: Jan 11 2017, 7:45am CST | by Noel Diem, Updated: Jan 11 2017, 9:02pm CST, in News | Apple   Photo Credit: Getty Images   Consumer Reports, which previously gave a scathing review to the new MacBook Pro, has agreed to give the computer a second look after meeting with Apple and figuring out a software bug that caused inconsistent battery life. Those battery problems had caused the magazine to withhold a recommendation, a first for the MacBook name. Don't Miss: The Hottest CES 2017 Highlights In December, they reported that after testing three different MacBook Pro models, they found that battery life ranged anywhere from 3.75 to 19.6 hours. There was no rhyme or reason to the timing. Yesterday, the magazine said that its testing methods actually turned off a browser's cache, which triggered a software glitch that may have been the caused of the inconsistent battery life. The magazine will retest now that the problem has been discovered and will report back about any changes in the laptop's battery life. Apple said that the bug is "obscure" and that it will only occur if users change the developer settings to turn off Safari's browser cache, according to Recode. “This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage,” Apple said in a statement. “Their use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab. After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life.” The company also said that the bug has been fixed in the most recent beta version of Sierra. Here’s Apple’s full statement on the issue: “We appreciate the opportunity to work with Consumer Reports over the holidays to understand their battery test results. We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache. This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage. Their use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab. After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life. We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test. This is the best pro notebook we’ve ever made, we respect Consumer Reports and we’re glad they decided to revisit their findings on the MacBook Pro.” Comments The Author Noel Diem Noel passion is to write about geek culture.     Advertisement Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Share this Story Follow Us Read the Latest from I4U News iPhone 8 Will Exhibit a More Effective IP68 Water Resistance 10 hours ago, 10:10am CST 64GB Apple TV: It Might Be Useful After All 11 hours ago, 9:51am CST iOS Makes Apple $1 trillion in Revenues 3 days ago, 7:57am CST Apple Has Released Statement Over Consumer Reports MacBook Pro Battery Tests 4 days ago, 11:19am CST Apple’s MacBook Saves A Man’s Life in Lauderdale Airport Shooting 4 days ago, 10:44am CST Concussions may Accelerate Alzheimer’s Disease 7 hours ago, 1:03pm CST 2015 Middle East Dust Storm was Triggered by Changing Climate, Study Reveals 9 hours ago, 11:14am CST Is This Our First Glimpse Of The Samsung Galaxy S8? 10 hours ago, 10:04am CST Andy Rubin Is Working On A High-end Bezel Less Modular Smartphone 11 hours ago, 9:43am CST Wearable Sensors can Tell When you’re Getting Sick 12 hours ago, 8:14am CST New Technology can Diagnose Diseases using Cell Phone Photos 14 hours ago, 6:48am CST Sulphuric Acid Clouds caused Darkness, cold, killing Dinosaurs 17 hours ago, 3:51am CST Why Uber is bullish on Carpooling, Ride-sharing in India 17 hours ago, 3:41am CST Top Science Stories This Week 18 hours ago, 2:50am CST Instagram Maybe Promoting Hookah Use: Study 22 hours ago, 10:14pm CST Featured News $299.99 Nintendo Switch On Sale March 3, Pre-order Now Pre-order of Nintendo Switch Starts Friday at Nintendo Store   The Best Super Bowl TV Deals 2017 New Gibbon Species is Named after Star Wars’ Luke Skywalker Apple iPhone 8 Will Exhibit a More Effective IP68 Water Resistance 10 hours ago, 10:10am CST 64GB Apple TV: It Might Be Useful After All 11 hours ago, 9:51am CST iOS Makes Apple $1 trillion in Revenues 3 days ago, 7:57am CST Apple Has Released Statement Over Consumer Reports MacBook Pro Battery Tests 4 days ago, 11:19am CST More Apple Stories Latest News Concussions may Accelerate Alzheimer’s Disease 7 hours ago, 1:03pm CST 2015 Middle East Dust Storm was Triggered by Changing Climate, Study Reveals 9 hours ago, 11:14am CST iPhone 8 Will Exhibit a More Effective IP68 Water Resistance 10 hours ago, 10:10am CST Is This Our First Glimpse Of The Samsung Galaxy S8? 10 hours ago, 10:04am CST More Latest News Your Deals on Amazon The Latest ...

It wasn’t too long ago that we were discussing the merits of having a camera strapped to your face. Apple is reportedly working on a similar solution, and while we don’t have a catchy moniker quite yet, they do have a solid partner. Google Glass may be dead in the water as we knew it, but those Snapchat Spectacles have definitely picked up some steam. They went from being the butt of many jokes to having folks purchase prescription lenses, so there is certainly something to this particular trend. According to a new report, Apple will be teaming up with Carl Zeiss for an eyewear solution of their own. Apple is reportedly working with Carl Zeiss on a pair of digital glasses that may… or may not be announced this year. The spectacles are said to be of the AR variety and will connect to your handset via Bluetooth to give you a heads-up-display of sorts. The report states that nothing is “solid” and they are currently exploring the idea of a device although it could arrive sooner than later. Especially considering Apple has been leaning towards AR and away from VR for quite some time. 2017 will be a banner year for Apple regardless of any digital eyewear. The iPhone 8 with its rumored Edged panel will be the hottest seller of the year and we may get a matching iPad to boot. If Apple dropped a pair of AR eyeglasses next year it would certainly be a surprise as the usually move at a snails pace when it comes to new devices.

The Spigen Apple Airpods charging dock and stand accessory has been neatly designed to provide a stable base that keeps the Airpods upright. Interested buyers can pre-order the new Airpods accessory now with availability from February. Apple’s Airpods have had a mixed reception and the Finder for Airpods app was recently pulled, probably because Apple is working on an official idea of its own. There will be plenty of people who have invested in them though, so the new Spigen Airpods Stand for Apple Airpods should be well received. That’s especially the case as the accessory is reasonably priced at $11.99. Buyers who pre-order will have to wait a little time to get them, as the date for first expected stock is currently listed as February 15. The Spigen Airpods Stand Charging Case Dock could be worth waiting for though, as it will solve the problem of the Airpods charging case being rounded. Spigen’s dock enables the Airpods to be stored upright in their case on flat surfaces, and this lends itself to convenient and easy accessibility. It’s worth noting that the design melds nicely with the Airpods themselves. The white protective stand is made of Thermoplastic Polyurethane with a Polycarbonate internal structure for durability, and the base features non-slip Nanotac technology. The accessory also serves as a charging dock, and a Lightning cable (not included) can be inserted at the back via a handy cutout. It’s nicely compact as it measures just 1.1-inch by 1.5-inches and is a lightweight 0.96-ounces. Please note that this charging and docking station has been designed specifically for Apple Airpods and is only compatible with Apple’s authentic original Lightning cable. The convenience and the reasonable price are likely to make this new accessory rather tempting. Maybe you’ve already placed a pre-order for the Spigen Apple Airpod charging dock and stand accessory? If so, why not let us know what you think of it when it arrives?

We round up all of the rumours about a proper update for the MacBook Air in 2017, including its likely UK release date and tech specs, as well as rumoured new features. Here's everything you need to know about the new MacBook Air in 2017 by Ashleigh Macro | 11 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents UK release date Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? When was the MacBook Air last updated? Price Dimensions  Specs & new features When will the new MacBook Air 2017 be released in the UK? What tech specs and new features will the new MacBook Air get? Is the 'Air' brand being killed off? Will the new MacBook Air get a Retina display at last? The MacBook Air had an update in 2016, but it was such a minor and frankly disappointing update - merely including an optional RAM upgrade in the standard package for the 13in model - that we're looking ahead to the next MacBook Air update. Will 2017 see a proper update to the MacBook Air lineup? Or will the MacBook Air lineup be killed off for good? In this article we round up all the rumours, hints and clues about the new MacBook Air for 2017, including the new MacBook Air's UK release date, tech specs, new features, design, along with speculation that Apple may be phasing out the 'Air' lineup completely. Read next: Best MacBook buying guide | Best Mac buying guide | Best cheap MacBook deals New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: UK release date Apple hosted a special event on 21 March 2016, and ahead of the event we (quite naturally) expected new MacBook Air and MacBook models. After all, the spring event represented one year since both were last updated (or one year since it was first launched in the MacBook's case) and before that new Air models arrived in April of 2014. But instead, Apple used the event to show off the iPhone SE and the iPad Pro with 9.7in screen. Instead, we had to wait until 19 April for Apple to release new MacBooks and the updated MacBook Air. But the MacBook Air update was underwhelming, to say the least. While the MacBook got a power boost and a new Rose Gold colour option, the MacBook Air simply got a new 8GB onboard memory standard, and that's only for the 13in model. So when will we get a proper update to the MacBook Air line-up? If the lineup isn't getting the chop, we assume that Apple will stick to its yearly upgrade cycle and should release the new MacBook Air at some point in early 2017, possibly between March and May as has been the case in previous years. See also: New MacBook Pro release | New MacBook release | New iMac release | New Mac Pro release | New Mac mini release New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? After the March event and its derisory MacBook Air update, and the subsequent Apple event that took place on 27 October 2016, it's unclear if the MacBook Air line will ever be updated again. No new MacBook Air was announced in October and the new MacBook Pro 2016 was compared in size, performance and weight to the MacBook Air. The new MacBook Pro is smaller in dimensions, and is also thinner than the existing MacBook Air, which was launched with portability in mind. It should also be noted that the 11in MacBook Air has now been discontinued, with the 13in variant receiving a £100 price bump - taking the basic model from £849 up to £949 and the 256GB model up from £999 to £1,099. (This price increase is most likely due to Brexit.) Some have taken this as gentle way of bringing the Air product line to a close, as not many people will want a costly Air with more powerful, and thinner, Mac laptops available. Following the October 2016 Mac event, there are strong suggestions that the MacBook Air line will be completely discontinued. This does mean that the entry level MacBooks are now a little more appealing, but does mean that a 11in MacBook Air will now be missed by some who were hoping for it to be replaced by a similar variant - we presume Apple didn't see a huge market for 11in laptops and thus decided to axe the product line. However, the 11in may not be the only MacBook Air to be discontinued. We think that Apple is about to discontinue the MacBook Air line altogether. Tech Blogger Jack March claims to have spoken with a source close to the situation who says that Apple is about to ditch the Air brand completely, including the MacBook Air and iPad Air products in its lineup. Right now, we think that Jack could be absolutely right. There are rumours that Apple won't release an iPad Air 3 now that the iPad Pro has a 9.7in option, and the MacBook Air doesn't seem to fit naturally in Apple's line-up now that the new MacBook is here and is thinner and lighter than ever. With the advent of the 12in MacBook and the 12.9in iPad Pro, it's no surprise that rumourmongers are starting to predict that at least the 11in MacBook Air, with a smaller screen than either of those devices, will be discontinued. The iPad Pro may indeed be viewed by Apple as a replacement for the 11in MacBook Air if Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments to the Telegraph are taken into account (published on 1 December 2015). Following the launch of the iPad Pro, Cook told the Telegraph: "I think if you're looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC any more? No really, why would you buy one? "Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones." However, should Apple discontinue the 11in MacBook Air, it does remove the lower price of entry from the line-up. But as mentioned, it may not just be the 11in MacBook Air that is discontinued. When the new MacBook launched on 9 March 2015, analysts began to suspect that the MacBook Air might not be around for much longer. "This wasn't the MacBook Air, but instead leaped past the Air," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. "They kept the MacBook Air around just as they do with older iPhones, but the MacBook is now in the same position as the newest iPhone. That makes me wonder if the Air will go away over time." Carolina Milanesi, chief of research and head of US business for Kantar WorldPanel Comtech, also predicted a contraction of Apple's line-up. "All [notebooks] need to be more mobile, so something like the Air doesn't need to be branched out any more," she said of the differentiation Apple made for the line since its introduction more than eight years ago. "And it's to Apple's benefit not to have so many 'families' of Macs." More recently, KGI Securities analyst and Apple guru Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple is planning on launching a 13in MacBook to sit alongside the 12in MacBook, which would serve as a replacement to the MacBook Air going forward. In a note obtained by AppleInsider, the analyst forsees an end to the meaningful development of the MacBook Air. Apple won't remove the line from its stores just yet, though - it'll serve as an entry-level device for Apple adopters, much like it did with the original MacBook before it was discontinued in 2011.  Over time, it seems likely that the MacBook Air range could be discontinued and eventually replaced by a Retina MacBook range at a lower price. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: When was the MacBook Air last updated? We originally expected the MacBook Air to be updated with a Retina display back on 9 March 2015 at Apple's Spring Forward event. And were quite surprised when we got something else: a Retina MacBook, yes, but one with a 12in display and a USB-C port (and very few other ports), a new strand of products for Apple's MacBook laptop line-up. Less glamorously, Apple's MacBook Air did get an update at the same time, with new, faster processors, faster flash storage and better graphics, and was updated more recently in April 2016 with increased RAM, but the screen and overall design remained the same, with no Retina display for the Air line. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Price The last time that there was a Mac laptop that had more advanced specs than a more expensive model was the old MacBooks (aluminium, then white and black, and then eventually aluminium again). These older MacBook models were eventually discontinued and the price of the MacBook Air was reduced to make it the new entry level (when the MacBook Air initially launched it was quite overpriced for the specs, just like the current Retina MacBook). It seems likely that the same will happen with the new MacBook models eventually replacing the MacBook Airs, at a lower price, but for now that seems a long way off. The 11in MacBook Air started at £749, while the entry level 13in model was £849 - this has now changed with the 11in axed - making the new 13in model, with a £100 price hike start at £949. If the 11in MacBook Air is removed from the line up perhaps the cost of entry of the 13in model will reduce to the level that the 11in model is currently, with a rumoured 15in model coming in at a higher price at some point in the future. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Dimensions  If Apple does update the MacBook Air range, what dimensions should we expect? As mentioned above, rumours suggest that the 11in MacBook Air will be discontinued, after all, the 11in MacBook Air is both smaller than the MacBook and the new iPad Pro, and didn’t receive an update when the 13in model did. However, 9to5Mac points out that the new 13in and 15in MacBook Air models could be additional sizes to the MacBook range. That site predicts that some time in 2017 we will have just two ranges of Mac laptops: the MacBook at the ultraportable level, and the more advanced MacBook Pro. Maybe the 17in MacBook Pro will make a comeback too, with a 4K display. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Specs & new features These new MacBook Air models are said to be thinner and lighter, with internal spec enhancements. Apparently, the new MacBook Air will feature new batteries, cooling modules, and chassis, according to the Economic Daily News. We also expect to see USB Type-C across the range, especially now that Intel has integrated Thunderbolt 3 into USB-C - more on that below. Processors The next-generation MacBook Air is likely to feature next-generation Intel processors, as well as graphics and RAM upgrades. Intel has started shipping its Kaby Lake processors - that's the generation of chips after Skylake, and offers support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. But here's a leftfield alternative. The Dutch-language site Techtastic has posted a reference in the kernel of macOS Sierra to "ARM HURRICANE", a chip family that is now supported. This isn't a chip that anyone has heard of, but it would make sense for this to be an Apple custom ARM chip, fitting in as it does with the company's previous naming conventions: the A7 (in the iPhone 5s) was codenamed Cyclone, the A8 Typhoon and the A9 Twister. Those are iPad/iPhone chips, of course, so does this mean Apple is going to let iDevices run macOS Sierra? Certainly not - but it might be about to put ARM chips in the MacBook Air. Image courtesy of Techtastic New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: E-ink keyboard Rumours are rife concerning Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro and, more specifically, its OLED touch bar. The OLED touch bar is rumoured to provide contextual shortcuts to the user based on the application that they're using at the time - but the most recent report suggests Apple isn't happy enough with the feature. 9to5Mac and TrustedReviews report that Apple has been in talks to use a laptop variant of Sonder Design's dynamic keyboard technology. Sonder Design is famous for developing an E-ink keyboard, using E-ink to change the key labels on the fly. This means that the entire keyboard is customisable, providing multiple languages as well as contextual shortcuts from a single keyboard. It allows users that are, for example, editing in Final Cut Pro to look down at the keyboard and see exactly which tool they need to use without having to memorise them before hand. What isn't clear is how Apple is planning on implimenting the software, or which laptop it could be featured on, leading us to believe that it could possibly make an appearance on the 2017 MacBook Air. Sonder has confirmed that talks between Apple and the company has taken place, although it won't comment on whether or not it's a deal - it has only confirmed that it's "closing B2B procurement contracts" with three laptop makers. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Retina display When Apple updated its MacBook Air in March of 2015, we had been convinced that the company was about to give the laptop a Retina display. Instead, it launched a brand-new MacBook line that's super-thin, super-light and does offer that high-resolution display, but does that mean Apple won't enhance the MacBook Air with a Retina display in the future? With the 2016 update only adding more RAM to the basic 13in model, it may be the case. The suggestion that the MacBook Air will feature a Retina display has been long running but those rumours were prior to the launch of the 12in Retina MacBook and the iPad Pro - suggesting the sightings of the Retina display some thought was destined for the MacBook Air was instead for these models. Does this mean that there will be no Retina display on the new MacBook Air when (or if) it launches? If Apple wants to keep the price down maybe not. Or perhaps the newly rumoured 15in Macbook Air will feature a Retina display, while the 13in model will lack the high-res display, but come in at a lower price, one similar to the current price of the 11in MacBook Air. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: MacBook Air to feature USB-C port While we assumed the next MacBook Air would feature USB-C ports, a recent report from Taiwanese website DigiTimes seems to confirm our theory - if believed, anyway. The publication claims that Apple is planning to release a MacBook Air with USB-C ports in future, but doesn't provide a launch timeframe for the upgraded laptop.  "Currently, Apple has decided to adopt the USB Type-C interface for its MacBook Air, while Asustek Computer and Hewlett-Packard (HP) are upgrading one of their notebooks' regular USB port to the Type-C. Lenovo, Acer and Dell are still evaluating the option." The issue with DigiTimes is that it isn't always accurate - the site has previously claimed that Apple would start shipping ultra-thin 13in and 15in MacBooks by the end of Q2 2016, which ended in June with no appearance, although the site's sources have proven reliable at times in the past. So, how accurate is this report? We're not 100 percent sure, but we imagine that if Apple wants to keep the MacBook Air alive, this is the road it'll be headed down.  However, Bloomberg reported in August 2016, one week before the reported iPhone 7 launch, that Apple is preparing a MacBook Air update "as soon as October". This might mean that the MacBooks are announced at the 7 September event, but won't ship until the following month. This seems a logical step; the MacBook has just one USB-C port and the rumoured new MacBook Pro will also feature this connection type. It would still represent a bold move overall for Apple however - it'd mean all of its laptops would no longer support standard USB-A connections, a move sure to annoy a few people, but ultimately shape the future of mobile computing.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Apple Pencil-enabled Trackpad While this isn't a new patent (it was originally filed back in 2014), a patent application has recently been granted that allows the Apple Pencil to work with Mac trackpads. What is most interesting about the patent is that it depicts a more sophisticated Apple Pencil than the one currently available, suggesting that the accessory is due to get an overhaul at some point in the future. It even goes as far to describe the Pencil being used as a general input device like a joystick or an 'air mouse'. "Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes." What isn't clear is if the upgraded Apple Pencil will only work with certain trackpads - if this is the case, we imagine that the technology would make its way to the next-gen MacBook Air. Although with this being said, Apple has a habit of applying for a patent and then doing nothing with it, so it isn't set in stone that we'll be seeing this featured on the next MacBook Air - but we can sure hope.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Touch ID and Force Touch We expect this feature to come on the Air model - if it isn't already discontinued!  There are also reports to suggest that it'll boast Touch ID within its Trackpad, which may also get the Force Touch upgrade that was given to the 13in MacBook Pro back in March 2015, and comes with the new MacBook. Touch ID is the fingerprint sensor that's built into the Home button of the iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. It's also used to make Apple Pay more secure and with the recent announcement of Apple Pay coming to Mac as part of macOS Sierra, this rumour makes a lot of sense. According to an Independent report, Touch ID for the Mac line would require a dedicated chip to be built into the device. The rumour started with Taiwanese blog AppleCorner, which cited sources in the supply chain. Apparently the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad may get a biometric update too, enabling users to make Apple Pay payments on the web, but both those accessories were updated alongside the launch of a new 4K iMac so that seems unlikely to happen any time soon.  We'll be updating this article as more information about the rumoured Retina MacBook Air emerges so check back from time to time for the latest news.

In a fray that saw technology companies like Apple grow to be world’s most valuable companies, the fight for market dominance has been fought as much in the marketplace as in patent courts — starting with Nokia attacking Apple in a series of lawsuits in 2009 and 2010. Nokia filed its first patent case against Apple, igniting the so-called smartphone patent wars, on October 22, 2009 in the US District Court for Delaware. Nokia was visibly seething from the loss of its earlier prominence on the industry and as it became evident Nokia could not compete with the iPhone’s rise, it looked over to its huge patent portfolio to take as big a bite from the apple as it could. In this first complaint, Nokia accused Apple of infringing on 10 patents covering essentials of the GSM, UMTS and WLAN standards. In its complaint, Nokia stated that it has not only committed billions of dollars into research and development (including helping formulate industry standards) but also has been committed to licensing its standard essential patents under Fair, Reasonable And Non Discriminatory (FRAND) terms. Nokia had declared at least some of the ten patents as being essential to the GSM, UMTS and WLAN standards – all of which were implemented in the iPhone – and was entitled to royalties from Apple, even if under FRAND terms. The questions whether the ten patents were in fact standard-essential and whether Nokia was genuinely seeking fair and reasonable royalties were hotly debated and never fully answered. As was expected, Apple responded to the first case in equal measure shortly afterward with its own patents – filing a one-up case covering 13 patents on December 11, 2009. What followed then was a series of tit-for-tat cases between Nokia and Apple – in all covering over 60 patents across 6 district cases, 2 ITC complaints and at least 3 cases in Europe, running concurrently and none betraying any sense of who had the better of the other. While Nokia and Apple battled it out in the court, however, sales continued to grow for the iPhone as well as for Android phone manufacturers such as Samsung, Motorola and HTC – and Nokia slipped further behind. Torn between its own Symbian OS and Microsoft’s new Windows Phone OS, Nokia made one wrong decision after another – giving up market share to its rivals not only in the US and Europe but in the developing world as well. Sensing rightly that marketplace competition from the new Android players was far greater threat than a patent war with Nokia, Apple shifted gears as well. Having already got a taste for battle from Nokia, Apple started targeting the major Android OEMs (HTC, Motorola and Samsung) with its own patent lawsuits in late 2010 and 2011 while simultaneously pursuing settlement negotiations with Nokia. Nokia and Apple buried their disputes in June 2011 for an undisclosed (but presumably big) settlement including a one-time payment to Nokia – and Apple could then focus on the larger fight with HTC, Motorola and the even larger fight with Samsung, the new dominant player across the globe. The fight between Apple and Samsung would rage on in multiple courts for the next 5 years – and continues even today after the recent Supreme Court ruling vacating the damages calculation by lower courts in favor of Apple – and setting new precedent for calculating damages in design infringement cases. Over the subsequent years, the smartphone patent wars drew swords from virtually every industry player – Apple, Microsoft, HTC, Motorola, Google, LG, ZTE, Ericsson, Qualcomm and Blackberry (RIM) individually as well as in cohorts like Rockstar Consortium and RPX Corporation which pumped billions of dollars in buying telecom and smartphone patents on behalf of the companies. Nokia, while relatively absent from the fray after its settlement with Apple, had not been sitting idle. It sold its dwindling phone business rather richly to Microsoft in 2015 for $7.9 billion. The overpriced acquisition is seen by industry analysts as a $10 billion mistake by Microsoft. Regardless, it bought Microsoft a place in the smartphone roster that may have cost more had Microsoft chosen instead to enter the smartphone market from scratch. Having lost its core competence, i.e. handsets, Nokia has no doubt been aching and preparing to get back into the fight. It seems to have taken two parallel approaches: First, Nokia grew its patent portfolio by over a half in a merger with another telecom powerhouse Alcatel Lucent. While staying little more than a footnote in the smartphone marketplace, Alcatel Lucent is credited with a wide number of component technologies that make smartphones a reality – as well as a sizable number of standard essential patents. Second, with its own patents, Nokia has allegedly been fighting a proxy war against Apple and Android manufacturers by transferring patent rights to multiple patent assertion entities (PAE) like Acacia Research and Conversant Property Management. These PAEs alone have sued Apple more than 12 times using former Nokia patents. Being targeted by PAEs is nothing new for Apple — but in an anti-trust complaint dated December 20, 2016, Apple finally said enough was enough. Pulling no punches, Apple accused the PAEs of “conspiring with Nokia in a scheme to diffuse and abuse [standard essential patents] and, as the PAEs and Nokia fully intended, monetize those false promises by extracting exorbitant non-FRAND royalties in way Nokia could not”. Using PAEs for direct attacks against Apple would be a smart, albeit sneaky, strategy for Nokia. Since PAEs do not themselves sell any products, there would be little risk of a countersuit from Apple – as well as a general lack of commitment to FRAND licensing terms that spell lower royalties. Apple’s anti-trust complaint was exactly the flag Nokia had been waiting for. Over the very next couple of days, after five years of sitting on the sidelines, Nokia fired new shots directly at Apple – at least 12 new cases across the globe, covering 40 patents ranging from H.264 video encoding to RF and power management technologies used in Apple products. Regional Court, Dusseldorf, Germany – 8 patents Regional Court, Mannheim, Germany – 4 patents Regional Court, Munich, Germany – 2 patents Market Court, Helsinki, Finland – 3 patents High Court, London, UK – 3 patents Court of Turin, Italy – 4 patents Patent and Market Court, Stockholm, Sweden – 3 patents Commercial Courts, Barcelona, Spain – 1 patent District Court, The Hague, Netherlands – 3 patents High Court, Paris, France – 1 patent High Court, Hong Kong – 1 patent Tokyo District Court, Japan – 2 patents International Trade Commission, US – 8 patents US District Court for Eastern District of Texas – 18 patents For at least some of these patents-in-suit, Nokia alleges that it has been trying to negotiate FRAND royalties with Apple – which Apple believes to be unreasonable and excessive. The timing and range of the cases two days after Apple’s anti-trust complaint show that Nokia was all but ready with a finger on the trigger to file the complaints that undoubtedly required months of due diligence and research beyond what Nokia would have performed as part of the FRAND negotiations. Apple has so far not filed a countersuit against Nokia, but has pulled all Withings (owned by Nokia) products from its stores. A fresh slew of tit-for-tat cases are no doubt on the way as well, as these things usually go. It seems unlikely that all of these different cases will reach trial and a wide-ranging settlement would be the most likely the endgame for both companies however long it takes. For its own sake however, Nokia will not only have to come out a winner in these cases but also manage public perception of its intentions – as a number of industry analysts start drawing parallels between Nokia (or what remains of it) and patent assertion entities. The proxy war approach if indeed it was a well thought-out strategy on Nokia’s part can undermine the otherwise respectable position Nokia has long held in the evolution of telecommunications technology across the world. But tides can change quickly and public opinion has continued to shift against patent holders in the last few years. Whether that trend continues or reverses by the time Nokia and Apple get into the thick of these various cases remains to be seen. In the end, the human civilization is and always has been in a constant state of war with only intermittent periods of peace. The smartphone industry has had relative peace for the last year – the next few might not be as forgiving.

Valuationguy January 11, 2017 10:32 am Purva, While you are framing the dispute in terms of the public (or specifically the media) perception….the reality of this dispute is over valuation. Apple is unwilling to sign for a license at royalty rates much higher than its previous settlement even though the patent basket is changed and (more importantly and the key to the large differences in the two parties’ negotiating positions) Nokia receives NO VALUE BENEFIT currently from a cross-license of Apple’s patent portfolio. Because Nokia sees no value in a cross-license as an NPE (where before as a manufacturer, it did), it is now asking for a higher royalty than what Apple and Nokia agree upon in its settlement years ago when they directly competed against each other. This dispute is actually likely to be highly important in setting down the principals by which the courts can examine the legitimate differences in royalties owed to NPE’s vs. direct market competitors who are willing to accept value via a cross-license. Most patent owners overvalue their own patents (but don’t monetize them well) and undervalue others’ patents….which is why almost every direct competitor will demand to cross-license (as a way to keep royalty (and cash flow) expense low) with their competitors. angry dude January 11, 2017 12:12 pm If Nokia has trouble monetizing their patents they spent many years of R&D on then what about some little mom and pop workshop working out of garage ? Right now apples and googles and pretty much every other big (tech) company use USPTO database as a free public library… Something needs to change here – either shut down the USPTO and be done with patents once and for all OR start valuing patents with all attached rights of exclusivity To start valuing patents the USPTO should at the very least do proper examination in the first place – adjusting the threshold of novelty and unobviousness depending on the industry in question. (Hint: in smartphone industry that threshhold must be very high to avoid dealing with huge junk portfolios like Motorola patents and Nokia patents too – for the most part) What a mess! Just find me another planet… ProHacVice January 11, 2017 12:20 pm Valuationguy: That’s a great point re cross licensing – I hope the courts do not differentiate royalties owed to NPEs vs direct competitors. A patent is a patent regardless of who owns it. It would be akin to telling homeowners or housing rental companies they can only charge half the rent if the renter is a real estate agent. If the patents are disclosed as standard essential – then that’s a different quid pro quo, since a lower royalty would be offset by the larger market. PatLit January 12, 2017 10:13 am How is Nokia an NPE with its Network Business, Withings and lot’s of other stuff? angry dude January 12, 2017 11:32 am PatLit @4 By this reasoning there are no NPEs at all – every patent holder has some other “business” outside of suing for patent infringement “NPE” used to mean that patent holder is not using particular patent he is suing for in some product/service on the market, but of course this whole NPE concept is a bunch of bs a patent is a patent – a private property with attached exclusive right no matter who currently owns it Valuationguy January 12, 2017 2:58 pm ProHacVice, The issue I was trying to convey is that royalty rate owed to NPEs (who derive no value from cross-licensing….which reduces the nominal royalty rate) SHOULD typically be different (higher than) from a direct competitor which derives value from such a cross-license. The difference is in the type of currency used and how that affects the nominal royalty rate the licensee needs to pay. NPE’s get ZERO value from a cross-license while the a direct competitor typically will get SOME value (else they wouldn’t agree to reduce their royalty rate in exchange for such license.) Overall…the VALUE derived should be the same….but the licensor receives it in different currency. Royalty Rate(NPE) x volume EQUALS (Royalty Rate (Direct Comp) x volume) + Value of Cross License. If the direct competitor doesn’t see any reason to sign a cross-license…his royalty rate should be the same as that of an NPE. In my view, the courts have essentially ignored this basic value equation when examining the ‘in their words’, exorbitant rates which many NPE’s demand. Courts (lead by infringer’s lawyers) typically point toward royalty rates for “similar” portfolios which involve significant cross-licensing without adding back the value of the cross-license. Since the value of the cross-license is typically too opaque to objectively challenge….the courts have agreed with the defendants to keep damages low.

Apple claims to have fixed one of the bugs affecting battery life on the MacBook Pro. But it’s clearly “a” bug, and not “the” bug. Unfortunately. At the end of 2016, Consumer Reports caused controversy and consternation amongst the Apple faithful by deciding not to recommend the new MacBook Pro. Consumer Reports loved several aspects of the new MacBook Pro Apple Unveils New Touchy-Feely MacBook Pro Apple Unveils New Touchy-Feely MacBook Pro Apple has taken the wraps off of its brand new MacBook Pro. It's a beautifully designed piece of hardware, with several innovative touches and some annoying caveats potential buyers will have to beware. Read More , but couldn’t abide the inconsistent battery life. During testing of the new MacBook Pro, Consumer Reports found that the battery life varied massively. The 13-inch model with Touch Bar lasted between 3.75 hours and 16 hours. While the 13-inch model without Touch Bar lasted between 4.5 hours and 19.5 hours. Apple Slams Consumer Reports Testing At the time, Apple didn’t really address this issue, merely suggesting that, “Any customer who has a question about their Mac or its operation should contact AppleCare”. However, Apple did investigate the issue, and has now reported its findings back to Consumer Reports. In a new statement, Apple claims: “We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing websites which turns off the browser cache. This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage. Their use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab.” Apple has asked Consumer Reports to retest the new MacBook Pro “using normal user settings”. The company also claims to have fixed the bug it blames for the inconsistencies. The fix will be rolled out to all MacBook Pro owners within the next few weeks. MacBook Pro Battery Life Still Sucks While Apple should be applauded for identifying and then fixing this particular issue, it clearly doesn’t mean the battery life of the new MacBook Pro is now perfect. Consumer Reports is currently retesting the MacBook Pro (with and without the Touch Bar How to Get the New Touch Bar on an Old MacBook for Free How to Get the New Touch Bar on an Old MacBook for Free Want to try out the pricey new MacBook's Touch Bar for free? There's an app (or two) for that. Read More ), and the results will be interesting. However, they won’t tell the full story, as Consumer Reports was far from alone in making these complaints. Other reviewers, plus numerous users on Apple’s own message boards, experienced similar issues. And we very much doubt this software bug in Safari’s developer mode is responsible for all of these problems. Do you own a new MacBook Pro? Have you found the battery life to be consistent? Or have you experienced similar swings between stellar and shocking? What do you think is ultimately to blame for the variable battery life? Please let us know in the comments below!

However the battery life, with just web browsing was 4,5 hours on average. So after a week of testing I sent it back. Really hoping for an updated version this fall. Otherwise: maybe a good opportunity for Google to repeat their iPhone 7 vs Pixel stunt? Could be interesting. Reply Phillip January 11, 2017 at 5:16 pm I bought a new 13 inch MBP with TB and struggled with the battery for days. It just went down at a rate that was unacceptable for such an expensive laptop promising 10 hours of "normal" use. I don't use any of the Elements, or video editing software. I browse, check emails, watch the occasional video, etc. Very normal stuff... and was getting 4 or 5 hours of life, which just isn't right. Then I went online and found that it wasn't just me, but lots of people. I buy these laptops as an investment (at £2.4K, they need to be!) with a vision of having them for a fair few years. If the battery is bad now, it's only going to get worse. Needless to say I returned it and will simply wait until they build a better laptop (they know fine well they released an inferior product so as to not miss the holiday shopping period). Either that or I'll move on to another system. P. Reply Josh January 11, 2017 at 3:56 pm I love how it is never Apple's fault. It's always the user.

There is no end to the rumours about the Apple iPhone 8. Now a new report from Taiwan claims Apple might ditch the aluminum chassis for a stainless steel one in the next-generation iPhone 8. A fresh leak from DigiTimes reveals the next version of the Apple iPhone — we are still not certain it will be called the iPhone 8 — will be made using a stainless steel frame to hold together two glass panels similar to the iconic iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s designs. However, this time around the chassis will be made of forged stainless steel. As Apple Insider explains, forging stainless steel is a machining method that essentially squeezes a metal alloy between two halves of a mold to form a finished part, resulting in a better rigidity and reduction in costs and manufacturing time. The stainless steel used in the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s was CNC-machined. DigiTimes further revealed that Apple has already placed orders for the stainless steel parts with Foxconn and US-based Jabil expected to supply the new components. Also read: Apple working on iPhone 8 with bigger display, Samsung to be supplier: Report The report seems to confirm that Apple is in favor of ditching the aluminum back cover for a return to the “glass sandwich” design. Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities first revealed Apple’s plans for an all-new “glass-backed” iPhone 8 back in April. Kuo has further predicted changes such as an OLED display, wireless charging, an invisible home button and more. Apple is rumoured to be working on three new iPhone models for this year, including the supercharged iPhone 8, as well as the successors to the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. Japanese blog Macotakara reports that all three iPhones will boast identical specifications, citing sources within Apple’s Taiwanese supply chain. Meanwhile, a recent report in the Wall Street Journal claimed Apple is currently testing more than 10 different prototypes of the next-generation iPhone. At least one of the prototypes is said to feature a curved OLED display with no bezels — similar to that of Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. Also read: Apple’s next-gen flagship ‘iPhone 8’ is internally codenamed ‘Ferrari’, says report 2017 marks the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, and without any doubt Apple is allegedly planning a major design overhaul for the iPhone 8.

 Tesla nabs another Apple employee — this time, it's one of the key designers on the Mac team Kif Leswing Jan. 11, 2017, 9:44 AM 18,016 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook. Apple One of the key designers behind some of Apple's most daring Mac products in the past few years has moved to Tesla to work on electric cars. Matt Casebolt, who had worked on the Mac Pro and the new MacBook as a director of product design at Apple, said on his LinkedIn profile that he started as a director of engineering for closures and mechanisms at Tesla in December. 9to5Mac first reported the news, saying he had actually led the team working on the Mac Pro. Casebolt, judging by his patents, was a member of Apple's elite design team, which historically has very low turnover. The small group used to be headed by Apple's chief design officer, Jony Ive, but it has apparently been going through leadership changes recently. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has previously called Apple "the Tesla graveyard" based on its supposed proclivity to hire Tesla employees who didn't work out. But the talent movement goes both ways, especially after Apple reportedly retrenched and downscaled its electric-car project. One of the key goals of Apple's electric-car project was reportedly to retain top talent. Casebolt's job change comes a day after Chris Lattner, one of Apple's most visible directors as its head of developer tools and creator of its programming language, Swift, announced that he was headed to Tesla to head software for self-driving cars. Y Combinator, Silicon Valley's premier startup incubator, also announced on Monday that Daniel Gross, who had worked on machine learning at Apple after it bought his startup, would be joining Y Combinator as a partner. A big company Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Bill Pugliano/Getty Images After Lattner's announcement on Monday, Apple observers predictably started to speculate about what it meant for the company and whether Apple may have a problem retaining talent. Casebolt's newly publicized move will only add fuel to the fire. While highly paid directors and managers leaving a company is never a good sign, it's important to understand that Apple is a huge company. Out of 116,000 employees, some are bound to leave from time to time. But there are signs that Apple's approach to talent may be hitting a strained point. Apple announced through a Securities and Exchange Commission document last Friday that it had missed internal, still-secret targets for 2016. Apple executives lost compensation because of the missed targets. Apple, which has grown prodigiously over the past five years, may be slowing its growth on the rank-and-file and preventing managers from building teams as large as they were even a few years ago. Apple added 6,000 full-time employees in 2016, according to SEC documents. That was down from 2015, when it added 17,400 employees. Apple reportedly scaled back its contract recruiting as well, according to a Venturebeat source. Message boards around the internet are filled with unconfirmed speculation about hiring freezes and stories about successful interviews without job offers because Apple has significantly slowed hiring. Apple is still a coveted place to work, and most of the Apple people whom I have spoken with love their jobs and the company they work for. It's too early to say that Apple may be having trouble retaining important engineers. But Apple's not the only game in town, and it has lots of employees whom other Silicon Valley companies would love to have. Apple is expected to move its executives and lots of employees into its new campus early this year. Know anything about hiring at Apple? Email the author at kleswing@businessinsider.com.

Tresorit is offering end-to-end encryption for Apple's CareKit apps. Image: Tresorit By Emma Hinchliffe2017-01-11 05:36:58 UTC Apple's health apps now have a higher-tech security option.  The security firm Tresorit came out Tuesday with a tool to offer increased privacy options to developers using Apple's open-source CareKit platform. Those options will help apps — including apps run by hospitals — reach HIPAA compliance.  Tresorit's security technology, called ZeroKit, will offer user authentication for patients and healthcare workers, end-to-end encryption of health data, and "zero knowledge" sharing of health data, in which data isn't shared with any service as it transfers. SEE ALSO: Apple's India woes continue, government denies giving any special tax concessions End-to-end encryption is used for cloud storage, messaging and other services but hasn't been widely adopted in healthcare apps, Tresorit senior vice president David Szabo told Mashable. Data is encrypted before it is uploaded to the cloud and that encryption key never leaves the user's device. "Our mission is to give the ability to developers to give privacy to you," Szabo said. "Developers don't want to see patients' passwords."   CareKit is an open-source platform that allows developers — or even healthcare professionals with a little coding knowledge — to create patient-focused apps. The platform has been used for home care, diabetes care and other health projects.  With enhanced cloud security, the platform is intended to be of better use to hospitals beholden to the government's privacy rules around patient information. Healthcare professionals developing an app through CareKit can opt into ZeroKit's security offerings. Consumers won't choose whether to apply these encryption tools to their personal accounts.  "Apple designed the iOS platform and CareKit with security at its core. When building apps where data is shared across devices and with other services, developers want to extend this security to the cloud. This is exactly what ZeroKit does," the ZeroKit team wrote in a blog post on Apple's CareKit blog.  ZeroKit's founders approached Apple about integrating their security system into CareKit about four months ago.  BONUS: This robot can probably fold clothes better than you Topics: Apple, Apps and Software, Business, CareKit, encryption, healthcare and medicine, security About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

KGI Securities analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, who is renowned for making accurate claims around Apple products prior to their launch, suggest that the company will announce a cheaper 9.7-inch iPad, an approximately 10-inch large iPad and a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Kuo has predicted that the 12.9-inch iPad Pro will be the second generation to the current iPad Pro, with the 10-inch model featuring a narrow bezel design, while both will feature Apple’s A10X chip. The cheaper 9-inch iPad will purportedly feature the A9 chip and will be a lower-cost option. Kuo has predicted that the next iPads will be launched in the second-quarter of 2017. He has previous predicted colours, models and features of the iPhones and iPads including the release of the 12-inch iPad Pro, Force Touch feature and Rose Gold colour of the Apple Watch. Meanwhile, Apple on Monday celebrated the 10th anniversary of the release of the first iPhone announced by Jobs. Since the initial release, 15 iPhones have been launched to the current iPhone 7.

What to expect from Apple in 2017 Video Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! We’ve learned a lot more about the iPhone as it celebrates its tenth anniversary this week, blogger Sonny Dickson shared some interesting details about the two main prototypes for the iPhone user interface. This morning, ex-Appler Tony Fadell has taken to Twitter to share a whole bunch of new insights into how the iPhone was born. Exactly! No doubt in anyone's mind which was the right path. Those on the iPod based UI knew is was doomed. SJ pushed us, "Make it work!" https://t.co/LHq6jQaAew — Tony Fadell (@tfadell) January 11, 2017 Made on a Mac Apparently the user interface variants were designed on Macs and only “years later” ported to work on iPhones. The thing is all the teams involved in the project had a feeling that the right user interface would be the one that eventually won, Fadell explained in a Tweet. “No doubt in anyone’s mind which was the right path. Those on the iPod based UI knew it was doomed. Steve Jobs pushed us,” he wrote. “Steve asked us to test all the possibilities. There were many competing UI ideas - both physical & virtual clickwheels. The clickwheel was very iconic & we were trying to leverage that. https://t.co/pgs12H8Qm9 — Tony Fadell (@tfadell) January 11, 2017 All about the Clickwheel If you ever used an iPod you will remember the Clickwheel user interface you had to control music (and later podcasts and video) playback on the device.  “We’re gonna use the best pointing device in the world. We’re gonna use a pointing device that we’re all born with – we’re born with ten of them. We’re gonna use our fingers.” Steve Jobs, iPhone launch 2007 This was a brand new paradigm in user interfaces when it first appeared – we’d never had something so intuitive. That’s why Apple wanted to take a closer look at the UI while developing it. “The Clickwheel was very iconic and we were trying to leverage that,” Fadell wrote. Incredibly hard to work on something you didn’t believe in - especially when I used a rotary dial phone growing up. The push button won! https://t.co/TiwWOrVi9i — Tony Fadell (@tfadell) January 11, 2017 Make it so History shows us that in the end the iPod Clickwheel was destined to pass into history – MultiTouch won out. That’s why Apple CEO, Steve Jobs, was able to say the iPhone used the world’s simplest user interface: touch and was able to amuse his audience by showing a picture of an iPod dressed up as an phone that was equipped with a rotary dialer. Given their gut feeling that touch would win through, the teams had to work extra hard to develop a ClickWheel interface. “Incredibly hard to work on something you don’t believe in – especially when I used a rotary dial phone growing up,” Fadell says. “The push button won”. (We know from a New Yorker report that design of the interface took a great deal of effort. Even as late as 2004 the essential technology behind the interface hadn’t been invented. “The studio hadn’t invented the essential technology - nor, indeed, had Apple engineers - but the designers helped guide it to market, over years,” the report claimed.) There were many variations as we co-evolved the designs - both HW UI and SW UIs. Good design process doesn't follow a straight line... https://t.co/0rtFpABoBT — Tony Fadell (@tfadell) January 11, 2017 There were lots of designs Apple works very hard on design. That’s one of the reasons the company became so incensed when the entire industry decided to “draw inspiration” from its iPhone design. These days it seems every phone is a rectangle with a Multitouch interface and a big display. It need not have turned out that way, Fadell reveals. He says there were “many variants” as the company co-evolved the smartphone design. “Good design process doesn’t follow a straight line.” The need to iterate and iterate one again led to some interesting contrasts. For example, at point there was an iPod with a larger display for watching video that used a virtual Clickwheel and an iPod phone with a physical wheel. Wrong!!! There was never a competition. We, together, were searching for the best solution. Steve asked us to test all the possibilities... https://t.co/DNkT2WZnqV — Tony Fadell (@tfadell) January 11, 2017 Cooperation, not competition There have been some reports characterizing the effort made by the iPhone design teams as competitive, but that’s not how Fadell sees it. “The ideas were competing, not the teams,” he explained. “We, together, were searching for the best solution. Steve [Jobs] asked us to test all the possibilities.” Did they know it was special? There are still some industry pundits who don't seem to recognize the transformative nature of the iPhone. Not only did the device set the template for every smartphone since (though you may want to watch this movie trailer for a unique slant on this), but the teams involved in creating the device knew that what they were doing was transformative. That’s also why Apple’s Steve Jobs was able to say his company had been “lucky to have brought a few revolutionary user interfaces to market in our time” when announcing iPhone.

A job meant for a man named Casebolt … Over the past two and a half years Casebolt led the development of the MacBook Pro with its standout and sometimes controversial Touch Bar feature. Before that, he led the team working on the iconic ‘trash can’ Mac Pro and was previously instrumental in the design of the first generations of MacBook Air. These are some of Apple’s most iconic Mac products over the past decade. At Tesla, Casebolt will be joining a growing hoard of Apple Alumni including former VP of Mac Hardware Engineering Doug Field who is the Sr. VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla. At Apple, where he was VP of Mac Hardware Engineering, Field may have crossed paths with Casebolt as well. In fact, the halls of Tesla are probably starting to feel like the good ol’ days at Apple. More recently, Tesla snagged Apple’s Reliability Director to scale up production with iPhone-like dependability and the automaker’s new Head of Communications was also poached from Apple’s PR team. Casebolt and Lattner appear to be the latest examples of the so-called “poaching war” between the automaker and the consumer electronic giant, which Tesla appears to be winning. The departure follows reports of departures and downsizing in the wake of de-prioritization of the Macintosh groups at Apple. Casebolt is listed on at least 52 patents at Apple. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Cheap iPhones: Will Apple's bargaining tricks in India lower prices of iconic smartphone range? Apple is more Indian than we thought as it bargains with the government before making phones in India. Sami Khan   January 11, 2017 17:44 IST Apple iPhone 6sCreative Commons Apple may have fought (and mostly won) many battles, but the tech titan is finding it hard to convince the Narendra Modi government to allow local manufacturing of its iPhones. The Cupertino-based tech giant revealed its plans to make iPhones in India as early as April 2017, but it looks like it won't be as simple as it sounds. Apple plans to replicate its success in China in India with its local manufacturing plans. But the tech giant wants some incentives to do so. The company has handed a list of demands it seeks from the government to start manufacturing in India. It is, however, going to be a challenge considering no other company has been given such privileges for making their products in India. Will Apple be an exception? We are currently in pursuit for an answer to that question, but the government is not being of any help. But first, here's what Apple seeks: Custom duty exemption for 15 years Concessions Tax incentive Local assembly of used iPhones What do they mean? The Indian Express reported that the iPhone-maker has sought exemption on customs duty for manufacturing and repair materials, components, main equipments and consumables for smartphone manufacturing and servicing for domestic and export markets for a long duration of 15 years. Apple has also requested the government to relax its labelling rules, so that the company doesn't have to print product info on its devices. The tech giant has asked for tax incentives in return for setting up a manufacturing unit in India. Finally, the Cupertino-based tech giant has asked the government to allow it to bring used smartphones and assemble them locally, a proposal which has already been rejected by the government. Quite frankly, Apple is pushing a bit too far here. There are several other companies such as Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo and Huawei that are locally manufacturing their devices in India, but haven't sought any special treatment. Despite that, the government seems patient and will review the demands before giving a final verdict. "We are discussing that ... no other mobile manufacturer has sought any extra concessions ... we have not taken any decision," Union Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was quoted as saying by the Business Standard. "I am not saying that we have said yes, I am not saying that we have said no," she added.

Credit: Thinkstock More like this Both Apple and Microsoft take tumble in Gartner's latest device forecast PC shipments predicted to return to growth in 2018 after six-year skid Windows comes up third in OS clash two years early Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Apple will steal a march on Microsoft this year when for the first time this century shipments of devices powered by its operating systems outnumber those running Windows, research firm Gartner said today. In 2017, Apple's combination of iOS and macOS -- the former on iPhones and iPads, the latter on Macs -- will take second place from Windows on the devices shipped during the year. The gap between the two will widen in 2018 and 2019, with Apple ahead of Microsoft both years. According to Gartner, which provided Computerworld with its latest device shipment forecast broken out by operating system, in 2016 Windows powered about 260 million devices of the 2.3 billion shipped during the year. Windows accounted for approximately 11.2% of the total devices, which overwhelmingly ran Google's Android. Meanwhile, iOS and macOS -- the latter was formerly dubbed OS X -- sank to 248 million devices in 2016, a 10% drop from the year prior. The cause: Slackened sales of the iPhone, Apple's dominant device and biggest money maker. Gartner predicted that iOS + macOS, unlike Windows, will recover in 2017. Apple's OSes will climb 8% to 268 million this year, add 3% in 2018 to reach 276 million, then increase another 3% in 2019, with that year's device shipment forecast at 285 million. Windows will dip this year, then stagnate for the following two years. Microsoft's operating system will power about 252 million devices shipped in 2017 -- the bulk of them personal computers -- for a year-over-year decline of 3%. Windows will account for 253 million devices in 2018 (for a near-zero growth rate) and 257 million devices in 2019 (an annual growth rate of 1.8%). The gap between Microsoft and Apple -- 12 million last year, with Microsoft atop -- will widen to 27 million by 2019, advantage Apple. Gartner's forecast was another gloomy report on almost every device category, with shipments flat this year compared to last and growth not projected until 2018. "The global devices market is stagnating," said Gartner analyst Ranjit Atwal in a statement Wednesday. Mobile phone shipments are growing only in emerging markets in the Asia and Pacific markets, Atwal added, and noted that, "The PC market is just reaching the bottom of its decline." The PC industry's troubles have affected Microsoft most of all; Windows is almost entirely dependent on PC shipments, which have been stuck in a protracted slump. Future shipments were further hit when Microsoft walked away from the smartphone business last year. Gartner pegged total shipments of PC-like devices at 268 million for 2016, a 7% contraction from the year before, and contrary to an October forecast, now says shipments would again decline in 2017, dropping 0.7% to 266 million. Circumstances will improve only marginally in the two years following, as shipments rise to 272 million in 2018 and 278 million in 2019. The new normal is a sub-300 million market. PCs will not disappear -- something some pundits fretted about as the sales and shipment downturn extended past earlier records -- but the business has been hard hit: In 2012, for instance, more than 350 million PC-like devices shipped globally. Gartner is still betting that a PC replacement cycle will boost shipments, even if only slightly. But this week's forecast -- unlike the one in October -- predicted a delayed growth. In October, Gartner had said the PC business would claw its way back into the black in 2017; this month's prognosis is that growth won't occur until 2018. Most analysts have essentially written off growth in the consumer portion of the PC market; instead, they expect that any gains will come from commercial customers, who still rely on personal computers, as they try to transition from Windows 7 to the newer Windows 10 before Microsoft retires the former in three years. Computerworld (Data: Gartner) Microsoft's decades-long operating system supremacy over Apple will end in 2017, according to Gartner Research, as iOS and macOS power more devices shipped than does Windows.

Ogg January 11, 2017 7:50 am EST Print Email Tweet Now that 2016 and its post-election rally are in the past, it is important to look forward. Investors are expecting gains to continue in 2017, which would make the bull market go well more than eight years old. 24/7 Wall St. has released its own 2017 DJIA outlook calling for 21,422 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year, an implied gain of more than 8,0%, after 2016’s 13.4% gain. Now we have gone through all of our daily analyst reports and compiled lists by sector and grouping for which top stocks from analysts would fall under the so-called Top Picks for 2017. These top technology stocks were seen on well-known lists named the Top Picks, Franchise Picks, US 1 picks, Conviction Buy list and so on. These calls are also the ones issued mostly from major firms like Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Jefferies and others. As a reminder, investors should never just blindly follow analysts. We would not have you thinking we blindly endorse or follow an analyst call just because a call was made. The traditional upside for Dow and S&P 500 stocks is now running about 8% to 15% to each Buy target. So what does it tell you if analysts are calling for 20%, 30% or even 50% in upside ahead? It means there may be more risk. Analysts often get their theses wrong, and sometimes outside forces interrupt or destroy the prospects for upside gains. These are the top technology stock picks for 2017 that have been issued by some of the top analysts and most widely recognized firms on Wall Street. We have provided links to each article, if available, in an effort to keep this a more concise review. Alphabet The search giant formally known as Google was named in the Barron’s Top 10 Picks for 2017 and was among the top 27 picks from Kiplinger for 2017. The publication used its own estimates here to call Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) an impressive growth company with revenues and earnings expected to rise by 17% in 2017. Jefferies still had Alphabet on its key Franchise Picks list after the first week of 2017, and its price target was $1,000. Alphabet recently traded at $825.58, in a 52-week trading range of $672.66 to $839.00, and with a consensus analyst price target of $968.55. Amazon Merrill Lynch made a call on Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) in December, but the firm was looking for close to 50% upside. While this was substantial upside from Merrill Lynch, it was still shy of the street-high price target for Amazon shares of $1,250. Evercore ISI also had Amazon as its top internet pick for 2017. Kiplinger called it one of 27 top stock picks for 2017, citing that Value Line sees revenues rising 19.5% annually over the next five years. Shares of Amazon were last seen at $794.73, with a 52-week range of $474.00 to $847.21 and a consensus price target of $928.53. Apple Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the top pick from Morgan Stanley for 2017, based on an iPhone super cycle later this year, and winning from being the top brand values in the world. Barron’s had Apple in its Top 10 Picks for 2017 as well. What matters here from a 2017 Bull/Bear outlook is that Apple analysts were far too optimistic in 2016 and that they are far less enthusiastic in 2017, but Apple has to perform if tech stocks want to experience valuation upside via “multiple growth” ahead. Apple was trading at $118.97, in a 52-week range of $89.47 to $119.43. The consensus price target is $132.25. NVIDIA It may have been among the top large cap performers of 2016, but NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) has had a slow start to 2017 after Citron Research gave a short seller report. Still, we have seen price targets raised. On December 20, Goldman Sachs added NVIDIA to its Conviction Buy list with a $129 target, based on its unique growth story from gaming, virtual reality, automotive and data center efforts. After the start of 2017, Jefferies raised its price target to $125 from $110 as part of its Franchise List Portfolio. Shares of NVIDIA were trading at $106.21. The 52-week range is $24.75 to $119.93 and the consensus price target is $96.39. Alibaba Deutsche Bank named Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA) as its top China internet pick for 2017, calling for 21% in gross merchandise value growth this year. Alibaba is even making moves to fight counterfeiters. Jack Ma was just in New York City to visit Donald Trump before his inauguration, and the two men talked up a positive 2017. Alibaba was last seen at $97.21 a share, in a 52-week range of $59.25 to $109.87. The consensus analyst target is $121.24. Box When Oppenheimer reaffirmed its Outperform rating for Box Inc. (NYSE: BOX) at the start of January, it also was given an $18 price target. The firm listed it in the Top Picks series as well, because it is positive on Box’s transformation to a broad enterprise content platform that can win from its IBM partnership. At $15.40 per share, Box has a 52-week trading range of $8.82 to $16.59 and a consensus target price of $18.20. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Jon C.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple iPhone 8 to sport iPhone 4-like stainless steel frame Apple iPhone 8 to sport iPhone 4-like stainless steel frame By Bindu Nair - Jan 11, 2017 Apple may be looking to the iPhone 4 for design inspiration when it comes to the look of its next iPhone 8. A new report alleges that the company is abandoning its current aluminum back cover in favor of two panes of glass that will be held together by a stainless steel frame. Upstream supply chain sources told DigiTimes that the iPhone 8 will adopt a stainless steel forging process rather than the traditional CNC machining it usually uses. Orders for this new component are reportedly being shared between Foxconn and US-based Jabil. The choice of suppliers could be relevant since both Foxconn and Jabil also manufactured the iPhone 4’s stainless steel frame. The new material is apparently being produced through a new forging process meant to enhance its sturdiness. The technique further serves to reduce manufacturing time and 30% to 50% of costs. Also Read: Apple’s pre-iOS click wheel iPhone surfaces in video However, this stainless steel bezel will apparently have to be further refined by CNC machining. Apple has supposedly added Wistron as a new assembler of the iPhone 8, an honor it shares with Foxconn and Pegatron. Wistron was in the news recently since it could be tapped to put together iPhones in India if negotiations between Apple and the Indian government are successful. The manufacturer has already applied for an extension of its current Bengaluru plant, presumably to accommodate iPhone production. Rumors about the Apple’s next-generation iPhone have pretty consistently claimed that it’ll be sold in 3 variants namely an iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and premium iPhone 8. It’s possible the first two will be saddled with the same design that’s been around since the iPhone 6 and only the last will be getting the full revamp treatment.

In addition, growth could be hindered in initial years by customer fear of fully autonomous vehicles, existing laws for autonomous car use and accident liability issues. "Apple's entry into the automotive industry will help it complete its ecosystem, comprising devices software, cloud storage, and home kit thereby, offering seamless access to personal data both at home and on the move," noted Natteri. "Its acquisition of companies in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning indicates interest in creating a service solution for the automotive industry that could revolve around the iPhone."

It is believed Apple has joined forces with German lens specialist Carl Zeiss to create augmented reality smart glasses that will arrive on the market sometime this year. AP:Associated Press 3 Will Apple suffer the same fate as Google for it’s Glass disaster? This is according to tech evangelist Robert Scoble, who claimed a Zeiss employee confirmed the partnership at this year’s CES, News.com reported. “A Zeiss employee confirmed the rumours that Apple and Carl Zeiss AG are working on a light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year,” he wrote on his Facebook page. “That explains why there was no augmented reality in Zeiss’s booth even though it was right in the middle of the AR area.” 3 The iPhone celebrated its tenth anniversary on Monday 3 Microsoft’s augmented reality headset is called the Hololens Augmented reality differs from virtual reality as it superimposes a computer-generated image on a user’s view of the real world, instead of creating a fully immersive new world. The most popular example of the technology has been seen with Pokemon Go, which saw computer generated Pokemon appearing in the real world. This isn’t the first time the company has been rumoured to be entering into the world of AR, with Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook being vocal about his interest. “[AR] gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present, talking to each other, but also have other things — visually — for both of us to see,” he told ABC News last September. “There’s a lot of really cool things there.” Cook went onto say the “present” nature of AR made it more commercially viable than VR.

"Less people will be interested in that." Additionally, Apple has filed a number of AR patents with the US Patent and Trademark Office, including a "transparent electronic device".

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple, Consumer Reports find smoking gun that caused variable life in initial review Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Wednesday, January 11th, 2017, 05:41 Category: battery, Developer, Hardware, MacBook Pro, News Apple and Consumer Reports may have figured out what caused the poor battery test results that Consumer Reports highlighted during its review. On Tuesday, both companies released reports stating that a developer setting had been activated that typical users don’t use during testing, and also that the same setting has a bug that affects performance. In its review of the MacBook Pro, Consumer Reports said its battery life test results varied wildly, from 4 hours to 19 hours. Consumer Reports explained on its website that its notebook battery tests do not necessarily reflect real-world usage; instead, tests are designed to be consistent across different notebook for comparison’s sake. In the case of the MacBook Pro, Consumer Reports’ battery tests uses Safari in Developer mode, which is not the default setting. To enable Developer mode in Safari, go to Safari’s preferences and then click on the Advanced tab. Check the box at the bottom on the window that says, “Show Develop menu in menu bar.” Consumer Reports’ battery test involves downloading “a series of 10 webpages repeatedly,” but the publication turns off Safari’s caching ability in order to load fresh webpages. Caching is on by default, and the only way to turn it off is by using Safari in Developer mode. “This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage,” Apple said in a statement. Apple offered the following comment: “[Consumer Reports’] use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab. After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life.” The Developer mode in Safari proves interesting in that it can disable the web browser’s cache, causing it to ping a web server every time and reload all the content of a page, even if an element has already been downloaded. Consumer Reports disables the cache “to collect consistent results across the testing of many laptops, and it also puts batteries through a tougher workout.” Following a series of retests Consumer Reports stated that the MacBook Pro produced “consistently high battery life results.” Consumer Reports said it is retesting the MacBook Pro and will update its review. As for the bug, Apple has created a fix and it’s currently being tested as part of the Beta Software Program. Once the beta run is complete, the fix will be issued publically through Software Update. The Consumer Reports review marked the first time that a new Apple notebook had not been recommended by the publication. The retest and updated review could provide a chance for Apple to continue this streak and regain any consumer confidence that had been lost since the initial publication of the review.

Image: GagliardiImages/Shutterstock Apple has released a patch to fix problems with the lifetime of certain MacBook Pro batteries, first discovered in late 2016. Just before Christmas, technology site Consumer Reports investigated Apple’s new MacBook Pros, establishing some pretty strange findings. Testing three different devices, battery lives ranged from 3.75 hours up to 19.5 hours, something that consumers, and Apple, were clearly frustrated by. Since then, behind the scenes, Apple and Consumer Reports have been working together on a fix, which has now been released on the former’s website. During their investigations, Apple discovered that Consumer Reports’ tests utilised a relatively hidden feature on Safari that turns off the browser cache. The idea behind this setting, according to Consumer Reports, is to load every web page as if it were new content from the web, essentially loading everything afresh. “Their use of this developer setting […] triggered an obscure and intermittent bug, reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab,” said Apple in a statement. Apple claims this is not a setting used by customers and “does not reflect real-world usage”, but regardless, a software update has been developed. “After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life. We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test.” In the past six months, you could be forgiven for thinking Samsung was the dominant company in terms of battery issues, but Apple has hardly been squeaky clean in this regard. In November, the company issued guidelines for replacement batteries after a fault found in certain iPhones caused devices to shut down out of the blue. The company said it only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015. MacBook.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Business Image Source: Jeff Chiu/AP/REX/Shutterstock Tesla steals top Apple coder for its Autopilot team Chris Smith @chris_writes January 11th, 2017 at 6:50 AM Share Tweet Chris Lattner isn’t a familiar name to most people who follow Apple news, but he’s definitely an Apple star — or he was an Apple star, as he announced on Tuesday that he’s leaving the company to pursue a different opportunity. Tesla was then quick the confirm that it hired Lattner, giving him a major role in the development of Autopilot. Don't Miss: Company that made exploding Galaxy Note 7 batteries announces breakthrough for electric cars Lattner will be Tesla’s new vice president of Autopilot software, and he will lead the company’s Autopilot engineering team. This is a massive steal for Tesla and a very exciting one for fans of autonomous cars. Lattner, although not as popular with fans as other Apple employees, is the director of Apple’s Developer Tools. He was responsible at Apple for Xcode and then Swift. These are powerful tools that let developers code apps for Apple products, with Swift becoming quite popular since its original introduction at WWDC 2014. “I’m happy to announce that Ted Kremenek will be taking over for me as “Project Lead” for the Swift project, managing the administrative and leadership responsibility for Swift.org,” Lattner said on Tuesday in a message posted on the Swift Evolution mailing list (via John Gruber). “This recognizes the incredible effort he has already been putting into the project and reflects a decision I’ve made to leave Apple later this month to pursue an opportunity in another space. This decision wasn’t made lightly, and I want you all to know that I’m still completely committed to Swift. I plan to remain an active member of the Swift Core Team, as well as a contributor to the swift-evolution mailing list.” Soon after that, Tesla posted a welcome message on its blog for Lattner. “We would like to welcome Chris Lattner, who will join Tesla as our Vice President of Autopilot Software. Chris’s reputation for engineering excellence is well known,” Tesla said. “He comes to Tesla after 11 years at Apple where he was primarily responsible for creating Swift, the programming language for building apps on Apple platforms and one of the fastest growing languages for doing so on Linux.” Here is Lattner demoing Swift at WWDC 2014: Tags: Apple, Autopilot, Chris Lattner, Tesla View Comments Trending 1 Accessories This portable Wi-Fi router is smaller (and smarter?) than your smartphone 2 Mobile Watch this disgruntled customer drive her SUV through a T-Mobile store 3 Entertainment 9 new movie trailers you need to watch from this past week 4 Entertainment DirecTV Now is seriously broken 5 Retail The NES Classic Edition was in stock at Best Buy for just 20 minutes Picked For You Former Android chief Andy Rubin to release a high-end iPhone competitor this year By Yoni Heisler January 14th at 3:19 PM $40 device doubles the storage of your 32GB iPhone 7 or 7 Plus By Maren Estrada January 14th at 10:30 AM Whatsapp bug allows viewing of encrypted messages By Chris Mills January 13th at 11:01 PM Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use ad

Picture: REUTERS Mark Hibben is an independent analyst. BUSINESS DAY TV: The iPhone is a decade old this week and its inception revolutionised the smartphone industry — but that was 10 years ago and the competition has stiffened. So, is Apple still an attractive investment destination, and will CEO Tim Cook deliver on his promise of more technological breakthroughs? We’re joined on the line by independent analyst, Mark Hibben to discuss that. Mark … so where does your rating sit when it comes to the iPhone and its success as a consumer product? Are we looking at the most successful consumer product of all time, as some would put it? MARK HIBBEN: There’s been an ongoing … concern about whether iPhone has peaked out [in terms of] sales. I don’t think it has. In fact Apple’s Macintosh hasn’t really peaked out in any discernible way in terms of sales. So I still believe there’s a lot of room for growth in Apple. It may not be apparent this year but in the long run there’s still plenty of growth ahead. BDTV: Since the phone’s birth the market cap of Apple, according to Google Finance, has gone up 870%. That’s nearly a ten-bagger in 10 years — which, as most investors know, is an exceptional feat. Valuations now … where does that sit in your books? MH: Actually in terms of price-earnings ratio Apple is not valued exceptionally high, whether you look at a trail of 12 months multiple or a forward P-E, so I believe because of the low valuation investors can probably still look forward to growth. I don’t see anything that intrinsically limits Apple’s growth, and there are potential new products on the horizon that could add revenue to what Apple already has. BDTV: You talk about adding to growth, new technologies. It certainly has a supportive balance sheet — a $240bn-odd cash pile that it’s sitting with — and if you factor that into the equation, some are calling it pretty exciting metrics. MH: Actually the overseas cash looks like it is serving to accumulate the stock price in the near-term, that’s probably primarily the Trump effect. Now that Donald Trump has been elected he is promising to lower the corporate tax rate in the US substantially, to 15%, as well as institute a one-time-only repatriation rate of 10%, and that would be very attractive for Apple and Apple’s investors. I worked it out, it looks like if Apple repatriated roughly half of its overseas cash it could amount to a dividend for investors of roughly $18 a share. Now it’s not clear that they’ll pay that all out at once, but it’s still a pretty attractive dividend rate. BDTV: All of that being said, some have put it out there that there isn’t a single instance where Apple’s management has demonstrated the level of clarity [Steve] Jobs displayed when he was at the helm, and I picked this up from a document on Seeking Alpha earlier today. What do you make of that kind of commentary, and are you convinced by management that it is actually leading the future here? MH: Yes, as a matter of fact I wrote much to that effect in some of my recent articles. What I’ve talked about is a need for a product architect. When Jobs was in charge he was the product architect for Apple. He directed the R&D efforts to develop new products, he identified the key markets and he kind of put his imprimatur of his taste and sensibilities on Apple’s product line. You just don’t have that kind of a personality in charge of Apple now. Tim Cook is a very capable manager but I still believe that Apple does need a unifying vision with respect to its products that it’s not getting that from Tim. And I do believe there is a need to make some changes in Apple’s management in order to unlock the growth potential of Apple. BDTV: If you take into consideration the competitive landscape right now — as mentioned earlier, very different to what it was 10 years ago … that competitive muscle [needs] to be worked on even more. MH: There certainly is a lot of competition in the smartphone space and in computers but it is worth noting that all of Apple’s competitors have basically been chasing Apple and to the extent that they’ve caught up, they have become stronger competitors as a result. Apple just needs to push the boundaries forward and I would agree that we’re not seeing Apple do that right now. In fact what we’re getting from Apple is a stream of very evolutionary products that don’t really break new ground, and that is the problem that Apple has right now.

By Oliver Cragg January 11, 2017 12:19 GMT An image of Apple's New York flagship store with a green-tinted logo to celebrate 'Earth Day'.Reuters Greenpeace has released its annual report comparing the clean energy policies and commitment to renewable energy from major internet companies from around the world. Two-time chart-topper Apple once again led the pack with an 83% clean energy index. Google and Facebook also enjoyed an overall "A" ranking alongside the iPhone-maker. The report card looked less favourably on other notable tech giants, however. Samsung and Twitter were heavily criticised, while Amazon Web Services – a global cloud-computing subsidiary of Amazon.com – was reprimanded over the transparency of its policies. "Apple has remained among the most aggressive in the sector in its efforts to power its online platform with renewable energy," read the report. "Apple continues to play an important role in opening access to renewable energy new markets where it has located its data centres, such as the company's most recent data centre in Arizona." The Cupertino company was also praised for the clarity of its clean energy reporting, as well as its siting policies, with the report stating: "Since adopting its 100% renewable commitment in 2012, Apple has maintained a strong siting policy, requiring any new data centre location to have the ability to secure 100% renewable energy." Apple's Redmond rival Microsoft received a "B" grade and a 32% index score. Greenpeace note that after being "a solid C student at best" for the last two years, "new policy and commitments recently announced by Microsoft President Brad Smith have apparently marked an important shift in strategy, pointing Microsoft away from its claim that its data centres are already 100% renewable." While Facebook and Google also received pats on the back (67% and 56% index scores, respectively), questions were raised over the accessibility and clarity of reports originating from Samsung SDS - a IT-service affiliate of Samsung - and Amazon Web Services. The former received an overall "D" grade with Greenpeace highlighting a data centre in Sangam with "on-site renewables equivalent to 6% of its total electricity demand". Despite Amazon's advocacy of pro-clean energy laws, the report's lead author Gary Cook took umbrage with how it relayed details of its energy footprint: "Amazon continues to talk a good game on renewables but is keeping its customers in the dark on its energy decisions. This is concerning, particularly as Amazon expands into markets served by dirty energy," wrote Cook. Greenpeace The full breakdown (which can be downloaded here) also casts an eye over video and music streaming services, blogs and social media companies, with Netflix receiving an overall "D" and Twitter and Reddit each slapped with "F" for not providing Greenpeace or the public with any information. Cook also used the report to stress the need for all of the technology leaders listed to strengthen their stance on renewable energy in light of President-elect Donald Trump's imminent inauguration on 20 January. "In [technology markets], a much greater focus on advocacy is needed to overcome the entrenched political power of the utilities and create a pathway for the rapid adoption of renewables. This is particularly true in the United States following the election of Donald Trump, who has promised to roll back climate policies and revive the use of coal. Sustained and vocal advocacy by corporations, who recognise the ecological and economic imperative for an aggressive transition to renewable sources of electricity, has never been more important in the United States."

CareKit allows patients to choose to share health data from an app on their iPhone with the physicians treating them. While CareKit data is already encrypted by default, it doesn’t use full end-to-end encryption, meaning that any data stored on cloud services would be open to decryption by the owners of that service. Buzzfeed reports that Apple is partnering with security firm Tresorit to offer better encryption options to developers – but this won’t necessarily mean that all CareKit programs adopt it … Tresorit’s security technology, called ZeroKit, will offer user authentication for patients and healthcare workers, end-to-end encryption of health data, and “zero knowledge” sharing of health data, in which data isn’t shared with any service as it transfers. Apple says that ZeroKit offers three benefits over standard encryption. First, ZeroKit takes care of user registration and authentication, so that developers never have access to passwords – and therefore have no concerns about being hacked. Second, a server breach would never provide access to decrypted data. Third, a ‘zero knowledge’ approach means that nobody between patient and doctor ever has access to either patient data or access keys, providing hospitals with the assurance that they are fully compliant with regulatory requirements. The improved security means that hospitals are able to use CareKit without fear of breaching the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Tresorit says that nobody has yet won a $50k bounty for cracking the encryption, despite more than a year’s worth of attempts. More than 1,000 hackers, including MIT, Stanford and Harvard have failed to break in. The SDK is available for iOS (Swift), Android (Java) and web browsers (JavaScript) and can be used by developers without any previous experience of secure apps. A sample app with ZeroKit-integrated CareKit can be downloaded from Tresorit. Note that there is no requirement for CareKit developers to use ZeroKit, and patients enrolled in CareKit programs won’t be able to choose. It will be down to individual developers to decide whether or not to adopt ZeroKit.

Mandatory Credit: Dan Powers/The Post-Crescent via USA TODAY Sports Crosby vs. Ovechkin: 5 times their rivalry was everything to hockey fans by Dave Stevenson Teams can’t even handle the threat of John Wall’s pick-and-rolls by Scott Rafferty NFL Aaron Rodgers gives Packers edge over Cowboys by Matt Verderame4 days agoFollow @MattVerderame Tweet Share x GPlus Pin Comment The Green Bay Packers may be underdogs in Vegas, but with Aaron Rodgers leading the offense, they are favorites over the Dallas Cowboys. On Sunday afternoon, the New York Giants had the look of a team ready to pull an upset. The Packers were scuffling and despite plentiful time in the pocket, Aaron Rodgers couldn’t find an open receiver. By the end of the game, Green Bay won 38-13, and Rodgers had thrown for 362 yards and four touchdowns. Now, the Packers will take on the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC Divisional round. If Dallas hopes to throttle Green Bay, it needs to limit Rodgers. Here are two examples of Rodgers’ brilliance against New York, showcasing why he’s the most talented player in the league. Play #1 The Packers are trailing 6-0 midway through the second quarter at the Giants’ 38-yard line. On this play, Green Bay comes out in “11” personnel with Davante Adams wide right, going against rookie corner Eli Apple. New York is in its nickel package with a Cover 1 look. Rodgers knows he had Adams running a fly pattern without immediate safety help, giving him the green light with a good release. Less than a second after the snap, Rodgers is locked on to Adams. Apple is doing a nice job using the boundary, but a jam never comes. The result is a quick receiver getting a free run. As important is the actions of free safety, Leon Hall. On the snap, he begins running toward the middle of the field, partially because of the balanced formation. Once Hall turns his hips, he’s a non-factor. This screenshot is a split-second after Rodgers releases his throw. Adams has a step on Apple, and Hall is still 20 yards from the sideline. The throw is perfectly placed toward the boundary, falling to Adams’ left shoulder. The result is 1st and Goal for the Packers, and an eventual touchdown. Play #2 This was ultimately the game-winning play, and the one where New York was put into submission. Leading 14-13, Green Bay has a 1st and 10 at the Giants 30-yard line with 3:26 remaining in the third quarter. Once more, the Packers are in 11 personnel while New York counters with its nickel package. While the Giants try to disguise their coverage as Cover 2, it’s Cover 1 all the way with Landon Collins playing deep. Green Bay is running verticals across the board, with tight end Jared Cook running a deep cross. The idea is to stretch the defense in both directions, giving Rodgers a pair of man-to-man matchups. It works beautifully. Rodgers has a bevy of solid choices. Adams has a half-step on the left boundary against Janoris Jenkins, while Cook is winning his deep cross route. However, Rodgers sees the right decision immediately with Randall Cobb, who is breaking into the clear. Cobb has torched veteran corner Trevin Wade, and with Collins on the far hashmark, it’s an easy completion. Once Cobb makes the catch at the 15-yard line, it’s over. Collins, for all of his brilliance on the evening, misjudges the angle and over-pursues. From here, it’s a walk-in touchdown and a 21-13 lead. Going into Sunday’s game against Dallas, Rodgers is playing at his peak. Over the last seven regular-season games and last weekend’s playoff win, the former NFL MVP has thrown 22 touchdowns without an interception. The Cowboys have plenty going for them, but a strong secondary isn’t one of their strong suits. Next: NFL Power Rankings: 30 Best QB of All-Time If Dallas wants to reach the NFC Championship Game for the first time since 1995, it needs to generate pressure on Rodgers without blitzing. If it can’t, look for the Packers to throw at will, with or without Jordy Nelson in the lineup.

Most common of the complaints is the battery life of the laptop that seems to perform below advertised numbers. A lot of day one buyers of the MacBook Pro 2016 have noticed that their laptops tend to last only six hours on average. This is way below the advertised 10 hours of continuous use according to Apple. Because of this, the laptop became the first ever MacBook Pro to not receive a recommendation from the Consumer Reports. During its own battery test for the MacBook Pro 2016, the results gathered were a bit confusing and varied greatly in range. One test resulted in a 16-hour usage time while another one a mere three and a half hours. These results led the Consumer Reports to give the MacBook Pro 2016 a “not-recommended” stamp last year. Immediately after releasing its test results, Apple worked closely with the Consumer Reports to see where the tests went wrong. It would seem that Apple is serious on proving that the MacBook Pro 2016 does deliver on its advertised performance. MacBook Pro 2016 (via apple.com) During the initial investigations, Apple discovered that the Consumer Reports test procedures triggered a bug in the Safari browser. This bug resulted from deactivating the caching feature of the web browser. Furthermore, Apple added that the Consumer Reports’ test procedure does not best represent how a user will use the laptop. In response to this statement, the Consumer Reports redid the tests on the same MacBook Pro units it tested earlier. It performed the same tests, only this time, Safari’s caching feature was turned on. According to the Consumer Reports, the three MacBook Pro’s that it originally tested gave consistently high battery life after turning the caching feature on. Furthermore, Apple also released a statement that it is currently working on a fix for the bug and that it will be released soon. In fact, the fix will be included in the macOS Sierra 10.12.3 developers beta release. Once Apple deems the fix stable and consistent, it will then make it available for public use. For the time being, participants of Apple’s beta testing program will be able to update their systems through the App Store. Meanwhile, public users can expect the release of the official update within a few weeks. For more updates on the MacBook Pro 2016, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

The best laptop is the Dell XPS 13, but there are many other top laptops in our guide to the best laptops of 2017, including best Windows laptops and best MacBook reviews. What's the best laptop? Well, it's one that can do everything - but there isn't just one, here are 18 best laptops By Marie Brewis | 04 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments What's the best laptop? Best laptop Price Key specifications Dell XPS 13 9360 £999 Windows 10, Intel Core i5-7200U, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 13.3in 1920x1080 display, 60Wh battery Lenovo Yoga 710 11in £549 Windows 10, Intel Core M3-6Y30, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 11.6in 1920x1080 display, 40Wh battery Asus ZenBook UX310UA £699 Windows 10, Intel Core i5-6200U, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 500GB hard drive, 13.3in 3200x1800 display, 48Wh battery Jump straight to our full best laptops chart What's the best laptop? We round up the best laptops you can buy in the UK in 2017, including best Windows laptops and best MacBooks. The best laptop is the Dell XPS 13, followed by the Lenovo Yoga 710 and the Asus ZenBook UX310, but there are plenty of other options in our list below. Also see: Best Laptop Deals Despite the rise of tablets, there are still plenty of reasons to choose a laptop. Sometimes you just can't beat a bigger screen, a keyboard and Windows for getting stuff done. But, if you want a laptop that's also a tablet, there are plenty of convertible or 'hybrid' laptops which have a touchscreen which folds right back behind the keyboard and can be used as a tablet. The Yoga 710 is one of the best we've seen in this respect, although if its 11in screen is too small, Lenovo does offer larger versions. Before you buy any of the MacBooks in this chart, note that Apple unveiled a new MacBook Pro on 27 October. We will add the new MacBook Pro to our chart once we have completed our testing. Best laptops 2017: Buying guide As with any product we review, the best laptops are rated on various factors - performance, build quality, features and value for money – along with an overall score, potentially with an award, too. Note that star ratings don't always dictate where a product ranks in the list below, as the score applies to the date it was reviewed. If you're looking for a laptop that can handle the latest games, see our up-to-date list of the best gaming laptops. As much as we can, we make sure all the laptops in the chart are available to but in the UK. However, it's not something we can check every day so there's a chance you might not find the model listed. There are also often many different SKUs (versions/models) of a laptop so the specs might vary to those on the model we've reviewed (we can't always choose the exact model to review). Most laptops will come pre-installed with Windows 10 now. Of course, our best laptops group test also includes the best MacBooks, which run OS X (now macOS) out of the box. Macs are often more expensive than Windows laptops, but Apple's laptops are better value than ever before. You might feel that the premium build quality and features warrant spending extra, although many Windows laptop manufacturers have stepped up their game recently. Best laptops 2017: How much should I spend on a laptop?  In this chart, there's no cap on how much the device can cost – sometimes the best does come at a steep price. Equally you can get a lot of laptop for under £300 – provided you only need to do basic tasks like browse the web, email and create the odd document. If so see the best budget laptops. Spending a bit more, around £500 and above, will potentially get you a nice laptop but it's likely to have an entry-level set of specs. We're talking a relatively basic processor, minimal SSD storage and a low resolution screen. It might also be a bit heavy and bulky. Content continues below Ramp up the amount you're happy to splash out - £800 and up - and you'll be looking at the best of the best with a blazing fast processor, plenty of RAM, hordes of storage and a gorgeous display. You should also expect excellent build quality and premium materials. That's why it's crucial to read laptop reviews before you buy.  Best laptops 2017: What screen size laptop do I need?  The size of your screen is an important decision when buying a laptop. After all they typically range from 11- all the way up to 17in. A smaller screen might be harder to work on but it means that the laptop will be far more portable, handy if you need to take it around with you wherever you go. Bear in mind that a smaller device means less space for features like ports. At 17in, you're buying a desktop replacement laptop which isn't deigned to be moved around often. You'll likely get a full-size keyboard, lots of connectivity and possibly even an optical drive, too. Generally, unless you're looking at either end of the spectrum, a 13in laptop is the sweet spot for us combining portability with usability. While many laptops have a resolution of 1366x768, you should look for something more if you want the best. Full HD (1920x1080) and higher should be a tick box and you can even get 4K laptops now, although arguably it's not necessary. If you want a touchscreen, this normally adds to the cost. Most laptops come with a glossy screen but most people prefer a less reflective matt finish so that's something to look out for, too. Best laptops 2017: How much laptop storage do I need?  As usual, storage depends on what you want to use a laptop for. As a general rule of thumb get as much as possible without wasting money on the upgrade (manufactures can charge a premium on this area). An SSD will mean your laptop runs faster but doesn't provide as much space as a traditional hard drive. Remember that there are also plenty of cloud storage options but this isn't so helpful when you don't have an internet connection. If you're going to need to storing a large amount of data (perhaps you make home videos or you simply want all your TV box sets ready to go) then look for 1- or 2TB of space. Don't forget you can buy a portable USB drive to supplement a laptop which has only a small-capacity SSD.  Memory (RAM) is where programs and files are stored only while you're using them, and more is always better. Consider 4GB an absolute minimum, unless it's a Chromebook, with 8- to 16GB the ideal figure if you can afford the upgrade. You can't have too much. Best laptops 2017: Which laptop processor is best?  Unless you're going to run complex and demanding software or gaming, you don't need the latest top-spec processor. It doesn't hurt, of course, but it's best to find a nice balance as there's nothing worse than waiting for a app to load etc. If you're happy to splash out then you're probably looking at the latest generation (6th) Intel Core i7 chip. Entry-level spec models are likely to offer a Core i3 or even a Core M processor instead. A Core i5 sits nicely in-between so check how much extra it is to upgrade before making a final decision. If you're not sure which generation the Intel processor is, look at the model number as the first digit represents this. For example, a Core i5-6500 is a sixth-generation CPU. While most come with Intel processors, you can still find AMD powered devices around. See AMD vs Intel for more information. Best laptops 2017: Ultrabooks and ultraportable laptops Buying an ultraportable laptop is really no different than any laptop, except that your priorities are likely to be different. You might want an ultraportable laptop that's light and will last a long time away from the mains.  However, other people want an ultrabook that's powerful and can handle demanding applications without breaking your back when you carry it around. Both types are available. Some compromises are inevitable if you want a thin and light laptop, though. There's less space for a battery, so it's typical to find shorter runtimes. But some companies have overcome this with clever packaging, such as the MacBook Air.  Another factor is efficient hardware, so a newer processor is likely to sip rather than guzzle power. The same goes for other components. But you should always read our reviews to find out how long a particular laptop lasted in our tests as you can't rely on specifications and it's unwise to go only by manufacturers' claims.  Thin laptops tend to have shallow key travel, so if you need a laptop to do a lot of typing then, again, read our reviews as they're the only way (short of hunting down the machine in a shop) to find out whether a keyboard is a joy or a pain to use.  Many ultrabooks use low-power processors which are better for battery life, but may not have much power for running Windows apps. Our benchmarks sort the speed demons from the sluggards. Best laptops 2017: Warranty and other considerations  We recommend all the laptops here: there isn't a duff one among them. However, we urge you again to read through the full review before spending your hard-earned cash. None of them are perfect and what will suit your needs might not simply be the device ranked at number one. Battery life and warranty are two things which vary between laptops. The latter may well differ depending on where you buy the laptop from, too. John Lewis, for example, tends to offer longer warranty than rivals. After-sales service is something you should consider, not only laptops but pretty much everything you buy. Check whether the company has a UK-based support line, and forums (including our own) are an ideal place to get an idea of whether a manufacturer is generally good or bad at carrying out work under warranty. You might not even have to deal with the manufacturer directly if you have a fault in the first six months as it's the retailer's responsibility to deal with issues. This is when it pays to have purchased from Amazon, John Lewis and others which will often replace or refund without quibble. After al that, it's also worth considering whether a laptop is what you really want. You can get some great bargains on desktop PCs these days, and if you don't want a large tower system taking up space there are plenty of all-in-one PCs to choose between. These integrate the computer behind the monitor, so they're much neater. Also, some tablets offer similar functionality to basic laptops. See our piece about choosing between laptop vs iPad, for instance.  Read on for our pick of the UK's best laptops and links to our best laptop reviews.

Dell XPS 13 9360 Rating: Reviewed on: 30 December 16 RRP: From £999 inc VAT (model reviewed £1499 inc VAT) The Dell XPS 13 is an excellent ultraportable laptop, the best 13-inch Windows model going for many. Dell hasn’t aimed for a single superlative feature, a potential gimmick. Its footprint is smaller than the competition, but it’s thicker. Its screen resolution is excellent, but display colour is normal rather than super-saturated. There’s also a mix of old and new connections, and a combo of a large battery and smart power management means the Dell XPS 13 lasts significantly longer than most a lot of the time. The balance is just right - we'd spend our own money on it. Read our Dell XPS 13 9360 review. 2. Lenovo Yoga 710 11" Rating: Reviewed on: 9 August 16 RRP: £549 inc VAT The Lenovo Yoga 710 wants to offer the best, most convenient ultraportable laptop experience you can get without spending a scary amount of money. It has a 360-degree hinge and a touchscreen, which makes is a fun machine for use while travelling around. You wouldn’t want to go any smaller for all-day work tasks, but there is also a larger 14in version of this laptop if you think the 11.6in Yoga 710 will prove too small. For what it’s worth, Lenovo has nailed the display, glossy, sharp, bright enough for outdoor use, covered in toughened glass and jet black when switched off. Core hardware includes an Intel Core M3-6Y30 processor, 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a 128GB SSD. You get a single USB 3.0 port, plus micro HDMI, but no microSD slot for storage expansion. There are stereo speakers, a nice tiled keyboard with two-button trackpad that is mostly comfortable to type on, and this 1.06kg laptop runs on a 40Wh battery. It’s not the fastest Windows laptop, but sufficient for everyday tasks that don’t include gaming. It’s silent in use, with respectable audio and long battery life - 9 hours 45 minutes in our tests. Lenovo’s Yoga 710 is one of the best Windows alternatives to the 12in MacBook. Read our Lenovo Yoga 710 11" review. 3. Asus ZenBook UX310UA Rating: Reviewed on: 6 October 16 RRP: £699 inc VAT The Asus ZenBook UX310A is an ideal mid-range ultraportable laptop. It is what happens when a practical everyday laptop and an expensive all-aluminium Ultrabook fall in love, bringing you the pricey look and feel of a portable, stylish machine with the features of a workhorse and a price way below that of a rival MacBook. Core hardware includes a Core i5-6200U CPU, 8GB of DDR4 RAM and both a 128GB SSD and a 500GB HDD. There’s a single USB 3.0 port and two USB 2.0, plus USB-C, HDMI and SDXC. The Asus sports (albeit so-so) Harman Kardon stereo speakers, and with its 48Wh battery weighs in at 1.45kg. A cheaper version has the Core i3, 4GB of RAM and a lower-res display. The 13.3in screen is a highlight, with unbelievable sharpness (276ppi) and colour saturation at this price, and this matt screen excels in outdoor use. It’s paired with a scissor-mechanism keyboard with backlight and a large, comfortable trackpad. The ZenBook is not perfect - we’d like the display to tilt back further, the shell displays some flexing, and it’s a tad chunky thanks to the HDD inside - but it scored well on performance, provided you avoid intensive gaming. Battery life is solid, at 8 hours 10 minutes. You can’t have it all at this price, but the ZenBook gets close. Read our Asus ZenBook UX310UA review. 4. Dell Latitude 13 7370 Rating: Reviewed on: 22 July 16 RRP: From £1,079 Okay so it’s a business laptop, but check out that 13in edge-to-edge display. You wouldn’t be ashamed to show off the Dell Latitude 13 inside- or outside the office, with design hints taken from the awesome Dell XPS 13 listed higher up this chart. It’s customisable to suit your needs, but the model we reviewed came with an Intel Core m5-6Y57 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. There’s a USB 3.0 port, two USB-C, Micro-HDMI, a microSD card slot and two optional Micro-SIM slots. This 13.3in-screen laptop also sports a 34Wh battery and a fingerprint scanner, and weighs in at 1.12kg. The Latitude 13 has a pleasant matt finish to its base half, but the outer side of the lid is a cool (in every sense) aluminium that is surprisingly sturdy. Or you can add a carbon-fibre lid for an extra tenner. The keyboard is distinctly business-fare, somewhat cramped and with concave, clicky keys, but it’s workable. The trackpad is good, but small. And the screen offers great colours and viewing angles, even outdoors, but it lacks brightness. What really impresses is the Professional version of Windows it ships with, the silent running of the still-powerful processor, and its outstanding battery life of 8 hours 23 minutes in our tests. Read our Dell Latitude 13 7370 review. 5. HP Envy 13 Rating: Reviewed on: 25 February 16 RRP: From £649 inc VAT (model reviewed £799) You won’t find a laptop with a decent-sized screen more portable than this HP Envy 13. It’s incredibly slim and light, powerful, and it doesn’t cost the earth. Magic. Key specs for our review sample include the Intel Core i7-6500U processor with 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a 256GB SSD. There’s a 13.3in full-HD screen, three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI 1.4, a fingerprint scanner, SDXC slot, Bang & Olufson stereo speakers and a tiled keyboard complete with numberpad. With a 45Wh battery the Envy 13 weighs just 1.3kg. Cheaper Core-i5 and more expensive higher-resolution-screen options are also available. Sensationally petite, the Envy 13 has plenty of its own visual personality. This ultra-light system offers a mix of officiousness and cuteness: an unusal combo. There’s a pleasant matt screen, a shallow but crisp keyboard, and HP’s trademark ultra-big, ultra-rounded touchpad - one of the best you’ll find on a 13in Windows laptop. Day-to-day performance is excellent, and more demanding tasks such as photo- and video-editing are well within the HP’s remit. With integrated graphics, though, you’ll want to keep games at low settings. In our tests battery life ran to 8 hours 5 minutes. Read our HP Envy 13 review. 6. Acer S 13 S5-371 Rating: Reviewed on: 13 October 16 RRP: £549.99 Introducing the Windows ultrabook for normal people (the ones whose jaws drop when they see the price of a new MacBook Air), the Acer S 13 is an affordable and recommended alternative to such wallet-busters. There’s a quirky trackpad and some parts of the build are cheap, but this is a very decent Windows laptop. The S 13 has an embossed ‘ridged’ plastic lid, offset by a silvery hinge that gives it a recognisable two-tone style. Its underside is plastic too, and the use of this material is one way Acer has managed to keep down the price. Elsewhere the build is more premium, for example the aluminium keyboard surround. On the whole, though, the spec is good. You get an Intel Core i3-610U processor (a Core i5 option is available) paired with 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a 128GB SSD. There are two USB 3.0 ports, one USB-C, HDMI, SDXC and stereo speakers. The 13.3in Acer has a 4,030mAh battery and weighs 1.3kg. Day-to-day performance is good and battery life is very good, but the Acer is not a great gaming machine. It’s mostly quiet, with the fans kicking in only when necessary, yet the stereo speakers are loud. Watch it, though, as they’ll distort at maximum volume. Read our Acer S 13 S5-371 review. 7. Microsoft Surface Book Rating: Reviewed on: 30 June 16 RRP: From £1,299 inc VAT Microsoft thinks it has made the ultimate laptop, which is also a tablet. It's difficult to argue. There are five models, with the top offering the new £2,649 Surface Book i7. We reviewed the original Intel Core i7 Skylake model with 16GB of RAM and Nvidia GPU, and found excellent performance but have to point out the Core i5 model offers better value. The Surface Book is very angular, a slightly unusual shape for a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio, though we got used to it quickly. The 13.5in PixelSense display is stunning, with a crisp 267ppi density. Colour reproduction, brightness and viewing angles all excel. The Book itself is made from magnesium alloy, lighter and more durable than aluminium. The Book splits apart into the 724g screen with a 18Wh battery and the 860g keyboard with a 51Wh battery (battery life is fantastic at 16 hours, 25 minutes). The most striking part of its design its the ‘Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge’, which looks cool and improves balance. Meanwhile, an equally cool ‘Muscle Wire Lock’ uses an electrically charged nickel titanium alloy to hold it all together. The Surface Pen attaches magnetically to the side. You’ll find ports for USB 3.0 (x2), Mini-DisplayPort and an SD Card reader. USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 are missing, but this is still an amazing example of Windows laptop tech. Read our Microsoft Surface Book review. 8. MacBook Pro 2016 Rating: Reviewed on: 11 January 17 RRP: Base prices £1,449 (13-inch without Touch Bar), £1,749 (256GB 13-inch model with Touch Bar), £1,949 (512GB 13-inch model with Touch Bar), £2,349 (2.6GHz, 256GB 15-inch with Touch Bar), £2,699 (2.7GHz, 12GB 15-inch with Touch Bar) We're rather in love with the new MacBook Pro, but as with many love affairs there are irritations. The trackpad is huge and wonderful to use; but it's so big that the keyboard has been pushed up to make room, as well as flattened down to make the laptop slimmer. These factors together mean typing on the new Pro is a little harder - especially for touch typists, who will struggle to locate keys at first - than on on previous models. And those arrow keys are a nightmare. The Touch Bar is lovely to look at and fun to use. It's early days, both for us - we're only beginning to grasp its capabilities - and for app developers, who will surely come up with reams of clever Touch Bar features. Right now it's fun, but we're reasonably confident that it will become essential; the key will be getting lots of users on machines with Touch Bars. The tech is in this respect a little further back along the track that 3D Touch is following. This is a fast machine, of course, but maybe not quite fast enough for some tastes; it's worth reflecting on that maximum spec of 16GB of RAM, which may hold this machine back from a role in genuine pro settings. We're somewhat hopeful for a March update to add the option of more RAM and Kaby Lake processors. All in all, this is a fast and beautiful laptop but one with some flaws to consider. And ouch, that price tag is steep. Read our MacBook Pro 2016 review. 9. HP Spectre 13 Rating: Reviewed on: 5 August 16 RRP: £1299 inc VAT The HP Spectre 13 is desperate to appear a laptop of the future, and that comes with substantial pros and cons. Its supreme portability is quite wonderful, and while its design may polarise, it certainly is fancy. There's substance too, with a surprisingly powerful CPU for a laptop this thin and solid build in the keyboard and trackpad. Its message is a little confused, though. The processor courts enthusiasts, but that's exactly who's likely to be most annoyed by the lack of memory card slot and a traditional USB port. There's an audience for the Spectre 13, but if you've not signed-up to a wireless way of working yet you may want to think twice. Read our HP Spectre 13 review. 10. Lenovo Yoga 900 Rating: Reviewed on: 26 February 16 RRP: From £1199 inc VAT (model reviewed £1499) The Lenovo Yoga 900 is a laptop that really asks you to believe in its design style. After all, it doesn’t come cheap and for the price you can get a laptop with much more power if you’re not out for something immensely portable. That’s where this laptop excels: portability. As well as being slim, light and all-round lovely, the smart hinge lets it sit where most other laptops just can’t. The battery should last through a full day’s work as well. The trackpad can feel fiddly and the display isn’t perfect, but if you’re feeling flush this is one of the top ultraportables around. Read our Lenovo Yoga 900 review. 11. 13-inch MacBook Air (early 2015) Rating: Reviewed on: 6 September 16 RRP: £849 (with 128GB storage), £999 (with 256GB) Buy from Apple After some extensive testing, we found the MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015) to be little different overall to the 2014 model. The Thunderbolt 2 update will prove useful for connecting to high-resolution UHD displays, and a few percent of added processor power is never unwelcome. But hoped-for improvements in graphics performance and battery longevity did not arise in our testing, in spite of a new Intel processor which was expected to shepherd benefits in both areas. Launched at the same price as last year’s model it still deserves attention as one of the finest ultraportable laptops available - doubly so now that its flash-drive speed has shot up another 100 percent - and it will remain the more affordable option in lightweight notebooks when the new MacBook launches this month. Read our 13-inch MacBook Air (early 2015) review. 12. Apple MacBook (early 2016) Rating: Reviewed on: 6 September 16 RRP: £1,049 There's no escaping the fact that this is a very similar laptop to its 2015 predecessor, which so divided the tech community. But we think the problems have been overblown. The engineering on show is superb, and the performance is completely acceptable for a modern-day computer of this size. The arguments that there should be more ports on the MacBook only exist because people want one, and are frustrated that their current set-up needs will not allow for it. Apple has undoubtedly improved the MacBook for 2016. It is a truly outstanding laptop that will be wrongly categorised as a luxury technological item. There's a difference between something costing a little too much and it being luxurious - just like the MacBook Air, this laptop deserves to fall in price and rise in specs to continue to be what we consider an excellent flagship computer. The world and its ports just need to catch up. Read our Apple MacBook (early 2016) review. 13. Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA Rating: Reviewed on: 5 January 17 RRP: From £1099 inc VAT (model tested £1499 inc VAT) The Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA is an extremely light laptop and one that doesn’t compromise performance or kill battery life as a result. It’s also more affordable than some of the alternatives, particularly in its entry-level spec. However, we’re not convinced about all the choices Asus has made. A single USB-C port won’t cut it for a lot of buyers, the ultra-slim keyboard isn’t great for long-form typing and the trackpad’s clicker mechanism has some real issues. The trackpad also seems a bit pointless when it’s reliability is mediocre, even if it’s down to Microsoft’s software. Its portability is just about unbeatable, but some of you may prefer the more accommodating style of the Dell XPS 13 or one of Asus’s cheaper ZenBook models Read our Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA review. 14. Dell Chromebook 11 (3120) Rating: Reviewed on: 9 March 16 RRP: £202 inc VAT Buy from Dell Dell knows what it’s doing when it comes to Chromebooks. This new, rugged model has plenty to offer in terms of speed and durability, but you don’t feel like you’re sacrificing much in return. With the long battery life and unique waterproofing feature it does seem like a device that’s built to last, which is good as you’ll want to keep using it for a long time to come. Read our Dell Chromebook 11 (3120) review. 15. Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Rating: Reviewed on: 14 September 16 RRP: £799 inc. VAT The Dell Inspiron 13 5000 tells you larger convertible laptops have truly entered the mainstream. It’s reasonably affordable, still looks good and has the roughly the same power as some laptops costing way over £1000. Down sides include that the screen isn’t as colourful as the best and that the casing is made of plastic rather than something fancy like aluminium or a magnesium alloy. Oddly enough, though, it actually fits in well among its more stylish peers. Read our Dell Inspiron 13 5000 review. 16. HP Envy 15-as001na Rating: Reviewed on: 13 September 16 RRP: £799 inc. VAT The HP Envy 15 doesn't seem like a desperately interesting laptop at first glance. It's too big to be cool, not quite cheap enough to be a stone-cold bargain. However, the longer you use it, the more you realise quite what a sound fit it is for people who want a larger laptop, but one not ugly, chunky or liable to last 90 minutes between charges. Sound performance, a smart trackpad, a respectable display and sensible price make the HP Envy 15 one of the best laptops for those who don't really need a super-performance PC but still want the desktop-replacer feel you get with a 15.6-inch laptop. Read our HP Envy 15-as001na review. 17. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Rating: Reviewed on: 30 June 16 RRP: From £749 inc VAT (model tested £1079) There is a great deal to like and rave about the Surface Pro 4. The design is thinner and lighter for starters. The screen is awesome, there's plenty of power available, the new Surface Pen is better and the Type Cover is a vast improvement on the last one. However, the design is inherently awkward at times, it's more expensive that a lot of laptops and the Type Cover, which you'll pretty much need, isn't included lowering the value. Read our Microsoft Surface Pro 4 review. 18. Microsoft Surface Pro 3 Rating: Reviewed on: 22 January 16 RRP: From £639 inc VAT A very decent laptop replacement, and an okay tablet, the Surface Pro 3 is undeniably impressive. If you need a single device to do everything we can't think of any better device. And when you consider the cost of buying a discrete laptop, tablet and desktop PC the Surface Pro 3 is priced to shift. The question remains as to whether people want a single device rather than multiple gadgets that are better at their individual tasks. Microsoft's latest results suggest that Surface Pro 3 is winning hearts and minds. Has it won yours? Read our Microsoft Surface Pro 3 review.

As a recent full-time switcher to Android, keeping track of conversations on my Macbook is one of the main things I’ve missed, and I’ve learned to keep my phone within arm’s reach whenever I’m at my desk. Android SMS for iChat offers something of a solution. While it’s not quite as polished as Apple’s native syncing with the macOS app (which is actually called Messages rather than iChat now), the service actually does manage to spoof Apple’s system into syncing the messages received on your Android phone. And while there are some bugs and wrinkles that keep it from being a true replica of the iCloud-iPhone experience, it should provide enough home cooking to keep switchers happy. Cross-platform chats The setup is a little more complicated than Apple’s method, but the app’s tutorial does a good job walking you through it. First you need to download the Android version from Google Play, since that’s where most of the heavy lifting takes place. From there you’ll create an account, and head back to the Messages app on your Mac. Click Add Account, then Other, and add a Jabber account with your newly created username and password. After a few more clicks the two apps will be linked. Greenbot The setup process for SMS for iChat is a little confuding, but the tutorial will walk you through it. While you might need to refer to the SMS for iChat app to tweak the occasional setting, you’ll actually still be using the main messaging apps on your phone and Mac as usual. Once it finishes setting up, it should bring over any threads you’ve saved, though several of the conversations in Messenger on my Pixel were left behind. Otherwise it mostly behaves like the normal Messages app does, but there a few inconsistencies. For one, anything originating from your Android phone won’t be separated into gray and green bubbles. Rather, both sides of the conversation will all be stacked on top of each other with sent messages marked with a “- (Sent by you via Android)” signature. It’s not too hard to decipher the flow of the conversation, but if you’re looking to keep a pristine log of your conversations on your Mac, SMS for iChat might not suit your needs. Familiar faces SMS for iChat did a nice job with keeping up with new messages coming in, and I haven’t missed a single one since I started using it (despite some back-and-forths being inexplicably split into new conversation threads). Notifications work nicely too, though an odd quirk displays banners for both incoming and outgoing messages. Greenbot It’s not perfect, but you’ll be able to pick up your Android conversations on your Mac. But despite those hiccups, SMS for iChat dutifully synced anything sent to my Android phone, and I was able to respond to incoming messages on my Mac like I did before. Well, almost like before—the service doesn’t support delivery of MMS messages just yet, though the company says it is working on a version that will add the functionality. However, incoming pics can be viewed via a link to a secure site. Speaking of, if you’re concerned about the privacy of such an unofficial solution, developer MDRS assures users that it uses secure connections and 128-bit encryption when transferring messages. Texts are delivered via Google’s Cloud Messaging service and purged after three days. Greenbot You’ll need to pony up some cash if you want to send more than five messages a day. Should you download it? The service is free to download and use, but if you want to manage more than five messages per day you’ll need to pony up some dough. There are three options for subscribers, each of which offer unlimited messages. You can opt to pay $10 a month, $60 a year, or $130 for a lifetime subscription. That might be too rich for some people, especially for an app that might not ever work perfectly due to Apple’s efforts to stymie outsiders, but even with the inconsistencies I thoroughly enjoyed using my Mac again to send text messages. While it won’t replace the smooth, consistent manner in which iCloud shares messages between the iPhone and the Mac, it does bring back much of the functionality you gave up when you switched. And when you’re navigating a strange new land, a little familiarity goes a long way.  To comment on this article and other Greenbot content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

ADVERTISEMENT The campaign group was especially critical of Amazon Web Services, which it said continued to show a "lack of transparency" about its use of renewable energy sources to power its vast hosting business. Greenpeace also criticised Amazon for continuing to grow its business in US states that rely heavily on coal-fired power plants, such as Virginia. The report, Clicking Clean (PDF), looked at the energy footprints of large data centre operators and popular websites and applications. Highest praise was reserved for Apple, Google, Facebook and data centre firm Switch, which were taking the "greatest strides" towards 100 per cent renewable energy. Read more The elusive ruby seadragon has been caught on camera for the first time The elusive ruby seadragon has been caught on camera for the first time By Matt Burgess Subscribe to WIRED Netflix's approach to renewable energy was also a cause for concern, Greenpeace said. The streaming service accounts for one=third of internet traffic in North America, but rather than directly investing in and using renewable energy sources it is likely turning to carbon offsetting or unbundled renewable energy credits. Greenpeace's report said such an approach would "do little to increase renewable energy investment". The approach earned Netflix an overall score of 17 per cent and a "D" grade. Google-owned YouTube, by comparison, scored 56 per cent and received an "A". ADVERTISEMENT Apple scored highest on Greenpeace's green energy scale, with its operations using clean energy 83 per cent of the time. Facebook and Google received marks of 67 and 56 per cent respectively, while data centre firm Switch scored 100 per cent. Across the industry, Greenpeace found that nearly 20 per cent of internet firms had committed to 100 per cent renewable energy, but also expressed concern about the influence of Chinese technology companies who continue to lag behind those in the West. The likes of Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent and Naver, all of whom are expanding globally, fell well behind their US rivals in renewable commitments mainly due to the lack of clean energy options from monopoly utilities in China.

Picture: AFP/David Mcnew Matthew Dunnnews.com.au@mattydunn11 APPLE could be set to make its biggest new product announcement since the iPhone, with the tech giant set to be entering into the world of augmented reality. It is believed Apple has joined forces with German lens specialist Carl Zeiss to create AR/mixed reality smart glasses that will arrive on the market sometime this year. This is according to tech evangelist Robert Scoble, who claimed a Zeiss employee confirmed the partnership at this year’s CES. “A Zeiss employee confirmed the rumours that Apple and Carl Zeiss AG are working on a light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year.,” he wrote on his Facebook page. “That explains why there was no augmented reality in Zeiss’s booth even though it was right in the middle of the AR area.” Augmented reality differs from virtual reality as it superimposes a computer-generated image on a user’s view of the real world, instead of creating a fully immersive new world. The highly-popular game Pokemon Go is the best example of AR. Picture: AP Photo/Thomas CytrynowiczSource:AP The most popular example of the technology has been seen with Pokemon Go, which saw computer generated Pokemon appearing in the real world. This isn’t the first time the company has been rumoured to be entering into the world of AR, with Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook being vocal about his interest. “[AR] gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present, talking to each other, but also have other things — visually — for both of us to see,” he told ABC News last September. “There’s a lot of really cool things there.” Cook went onto say the “present” nature of AR made it more commercially viable than VR. “Virtual reality sort of encloses and immerses the person into an experience that can be really cool, but probably has a lower commercial interest over time,” he said. “Less people will be interested in that.” Additionally, Apple has filed a number of AR patents with the US Patent and Trademark Office, including a “transparent electronic device”.

First, similar to what Prussian general Carl von Clausewitz said about war being “politics by other means”, states are increasingly using cyber capabilities as a way to extend their policies by other means. The most prominent recent example of this is allegedly Russia, a nation accused by the United States of interfering with the US presidential elections. The United States Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security charged that the Russians hacked into the computers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and then leaked the emails to WikiLeaks to discredit the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, whom they thought would be less favourable to Russian interests than now President-elect Donald Trump. International cooperation needed to ensure cybersecurity This episode provides an interesting twist to what is considered to be the critical information infrastructure (CII) in any given state. Typically, states see CII to be more technical in nature in fields such as transportation, communications and finance, but now they also need to view the media, electoral and political systems in the same way. These systems also need to be protected against interference from other states who want to influence opinion and decision-making. Second, states around the world are increasingly looking to implement strong surveillance laws with regard to cyberspace. China approved its new Cybersecurity Bill in November, including more stringent rules that require companies to provide data to the Chinese government upon suspicion of wrongdoing. The bill also requires businesses’ domestic data to be stored on Chinese servers, and this data cannot be transferred overseas without state permission. Last year Britain passed the Investigatory Powers Act, giving the state broad-ranging powers that allow surveillance on a large scale. It is only a matter of time before more states adopt such sweeping legislation on surveillance in cyberspace. Corporations may have to concede on some dearly held principles to do business in a foreign state, or forgo business opportunities in nations that are too restrictive. Third, states increasingly want back doors to be built into the security of commercially available software, or for access to private data that has been secured by businesses. Last year, the FBI brought Apple to court to compel it to help unlock the encryption of a dead terrorist’s phone. Apple refused to do so, arguing that this would create a back door and would make all iPhones vulnerable to malicious hackers, and in the end was not forced to do so. China denies US claims military uses two Beijing hotels as bases for cyber attacks Given the failure of the US to force Apple’s cooperation, it may be difficult for smaller nations to compel large corporations like Apple to tweak encryption technology to help with their law enforcement efforts. In the wake of terrorist attacks this year, France and Germany are also pushing the European Union to adopt a law that would require software companies to make encrypted messages available to law enforcement. The right to privacy has thus come under much pressure in the past year even in Western democracies that were previously known for their liberal views. Fourth, some states appear to be offering cybersecurity protection to private enterprises. In September, Ciaran Martin, the head of the cyber department at Britain’s surveillance agency Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), proposed erecting a government-maintained firewall against malicious hackers. The primary goal of the move is to secure government websites and critical infrastructure against hackers, but in his comments, Martin said it could be expanded to include private companies as well. China, Hong Kong firms face highest level of cybersecurity risk, says PwC While this move naturally raises privacy concerns about governments holding and securing the data, the overall security gain for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) who are concerned about the cost of implementing an effective cybersecurity programme may tempt some companies to trust their data to a government-maintained firewall. However, states should be aware of the additional risk in assuming responsibility for cybersecurity of SMEs. While this move may bring SMEs up to a minimum standard, a government cloud, with multiple SME eggs in one basket, would be a prime target for cyberattacks, and any breach or breakdown would result not only in financial losses, but also in reputational and political damage. State intervention in cyberspace is not a new thing, but the tightening embrace of cyber issues by the state can be quite disconcerting and worrying to individuals and business. This is especially true for those who fiercely guard their privacy or fear giving states too much power over its citizens. This may well lead to a restriction of fundamental liberties. States need to realise that the increasingly Orwellian nature of state behaviour in cyberspace reduces the confidence of all users of cyberspace. China pushes through cybersecurity law despite foreign business fears Given the increasing stewardship role of states in cyberspace, there should be appropriate discussions about who will serve in the role of ombudsman to the state, and if there is a danger of overreach into personal lives. There is also a need to define how information is secured while protecting both personal and enterprise privacy. If this trend continues, the state will be responsible for a massive amount of data about its citizens, and any misuse of this data could erode trust in the agencies using the data. There are consequences for expanding the role of the state in cyberspace, and these consequences may not be conducive for the growth of both society and the economy.

Fairy Tail 517: Irene’s Defeat May Be A Clue To Acnologia’s Weakness Technology  By Denise on January 11 2017 09:41 PM Tim Cook Net Worth: How Much The Apple CEO Made Thanks To Mostly Millennials Denise Share Tweet Pin Best Mobile Apps To Help You Organize Your Life Photo from Tim Cook’s Facebook Page Photo from Tim Cook’s Facebook Page Since the passing of Steve Jobs, many people gave mixed feedback at Tim Cook as a good replacement for the former Apple CEO. Apple sales continued to soar even if its products received flak from longtime iOS users. It was recently revealed, however, that Tim Cook net worth says otherwise. With Cook being part of other major companies as well, this only added to his tremendous wealth. Tim Cook net worth: How much the Apple CEO received in 2016 A Game Spot report revealed how much the 56-year-old made last year. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Apple announced how much money some of its top officers, including Cook, were paid in 2016. In the document, it was stated that Cook received $8.75 million, which was less than 2015’s $10.28 million. Reportedly, Cook’s base salary was $3 million where he received a $5.37 million owing to “incentive pay.” These figures are relatively lower than the previous fiscal year’s where he also received added bonuses tagged as “other compensation.” Tim Cook just made an intriguing promise about the iPhone https://t.co/Gi78jpbokh — The Independent (@Independent) January 9, 2017 Tim Cook net worth despite declining sales in 2015 Ars Technica published some of Apple’s officers’ earnings on their website. Reportedly, the company raked in a whopping $215.6 billion in sales in 2016. Interestingly, the numbers prove to be big despite the company sales declining from $233.7 billion in the last fiscal year. Both the company’s sales and its operating income also fell from $71.2 billion in 2015 to $60 billion in 2016. These two metrics, however, were enough to cut Cook and other top Apple executives’ incentive-based pay. Overall, Apple’s revenue fell this year mostly because iPhone sales declined. The same publication notes that the iPhone 6S was “unable to repeat the iPhone 6’s success.” In fact, sales in China dwindled after reaching an all-time high in 2015. Also, with the iPhone SE hitting the market, the gadget’s average selling price drastically lowered the iPhone’s price in general. Next year, as per reports, the company will tailor top executives’ pay depending on their performance. Specifically, “up to 50 percent of long-term equity incentives (like stock)” On Jan. 31 this year, reports about the company’s earning for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 will be revealed. So far, projected revenue is allegedly not more than $78 billion, which is an increase from its earnings during the first quarter of 2016 which was $75.9 billion.

Just 5% of Apple Pay eligible consumers use the service. Why mobile payments has been slow going. By Emily Bary Jan. 9, 2017 1:21 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large More than two years after launching Apple Pay, the payments industry still hasn’t rallied around the platform. Illustration: Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Mobile payments have a PR problem. The technology that enables people to pay by phone exists in a variety of locations, and people actually get more security when they pay with a smartphone versus with a card. But no one seems to know, or care. There are plenty of players to blame: merchants, for often failing to accept smartphone payments, and banks, which may have been initially wary of promoting mobile pay for fear that it would displace their role in the electronic payment chain. A popular target these days seems to be Apple. “Arguably, the lack of broader consumer adoption of digital payments can be blamed on Apple for not being more proactive in educating consumers/merchants to drive behavioral shifts in purchase patterns,” wrote Monness, Crespi, Hardt, & Co’s James Cakmak in a research note earlier this month. (Throw Samsung in there, too.) Spurring greater adoption of “digital money” emerged as a key theme at this year’s CES tech event in Las Vegas. For smartphone companies, “some of it is a little out of their control,” CreditCards.com expert Matt Schulz told Barron’s Next at the conference. Mobile payments “just need to be usable in more places, but also the companies need to figure out some way to make people understand that the technology really does make things safer.” (By creating one-time tokens, smartphones transmit harmless data to merchants -- info that can’t be reused when hacked.) While younger folks tend to have confidence in companies like Apple and Samsung, they distrust banks.The reverse tends to be true for their elders, Schulz says, so getting mobile payments to go mainstream will happen slowly. He argued that we’re still waiting for one company to lead the way, bringing every party together on digital payments. Once upon a time, that was Apple’s role -- one they performed successfully with mobile phones and digital content. Square has managed to bring small merchants aboard, but the company’s broader reach remains limited. “Apple probably has the best chance to do it, just from what we’ve seen with iTunes,” Schulz says. In the early days of online music, Apple made pioneering agreements with music labels to offer songs for 99 cents. So far, the leadership skills haven’t quite translated to payments, though. Only 5% of people with Apple Pay actually used the service regularly as of mid-2016, according to a study from industry site pymnts.com. When it comes to people’s wallets, even Apple struggles to change habits. Big Picture: Two years after the launch of Apple Pay, it’s still only used by 5% of eligible users.

And while the amount of iPhone 8 rumours has become overwhelming to the point it's difficult to know just what to expect from Apple this year, a newly-granted patent further supports speculation of a bezel-less display. Originally spotted by AppleInsider, the patent details a display technology that uses pixels capable of self-lighting (ie OLEDs) arranged on a flexible surface with gaps in between. Related: iPhone 8 The gaps would allow Apple to mount sensors and other equipment, such as a camera or speaker behind the openings, effectively integrating them below the display itself. What's more, the spaces between pixels could even allow for a 'window' that would allow users to see through the display itself. This could enable an augmented reality function, whereby the phone overlaid information or graphics onto the real-world using the 'window', which would be made up of a glass panel on the rear and the main transparent OLED display. It's an exciting development, which would allow Apple to finally do away with bezels by mounting front-facing cameras below the display itself. This is something that has long-been discussed, with previous patents hinting at Apple's plans to move elements such as the fingerprint scanner and home button below the home screen. Other elements such as microphones, speakers, mouthpieces etc, that usually require bezels could also be integrated into the display in this way. Of course, a patent is no guarantee that a particular technology will make it to market, but with all the other patents we've seen hinting at a full-face display, we wouldn't be surprised to see something like this in a future iPhone. We're not sure whether that will be the iPhone 8 at this point, but it's conceivable, especially given all the the talk of Apple making the switch to OLED for its next iPhone instalment.

Chris Lattner, who served at Apple for more than a decade, said in a online message to Apple developers on Tuesday morning that he would "leave Apple later this month to pursue an opportunity in another space" without saying which company he planned to join. Later in the day, Tesla posted a message on the company's website saying that Lattner had been hired as vice president of Autopilot software but did not say when he would start work there. Tesla declined to comment beyond the announcement. Apple confirmed the departure but would not comment beyond Lattner's posted message. The move is a significant win for Tesla, bringing a high-profile figure in the world of software development for a position that previously did not have a full-time leader. Tesla's Autopilot was overseen on an interim basis by the software chief Jinnah Hosein of SpaceX, which is also headed by Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk. Autopilot is the hardware and software system on Tesla vehicles that allows self-driving in some situations but still requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. Federal safety regulators in the United States are examining whether Autopilot played a role in a fatal crash in Florida last year. Lattner most recently served as a senior director in the developer tools department at Apple and was best known for introducing Swift, a programming language that made it easier for software developers to write apps for iOS, the operating system that powers iPhones and iPads. In addition to developing Swift at Apple, Lattner also led a successful push to make the programming language "open source," meaning that developers could incorporate it into their applications without having to pay fees to Apple. The move was a first for Apple, which until then had typically tightly controlled the technology it created. Microsoft Corp and Google parent Alphabet Inc have also either published or contributed to open-source programming languages.

Company executives will be meeting with Ministry officials to sort out these demands on 25 January. The Indian Express reports that the list includes a demand for a 15-year customs duty holiday on the import of iPhone used and new iPhone kits, equipment, raw materials, consumables and more. What’s more, it’s clear from the report that Apple has no intention of sourcing locally. The mention of iPhone kits means that Apple will simply import components and assemble them in India. Every other company that’s had to set up a local manufacturing unit has had to adhere to the local sourcing norms as laid down by the government. Whether Apple can convince officials that it deserves such concessions is still up for debate, especially when such concessions will embolden other manufacturers to demand concessions of their own. Apple also seeks to deal in refurbished products, a practice frowned upon by our government. The company is also seeking to import used equipment, which it tries to justify by claiming that multinationals do this all the time in a bid to “capitalise on efficiencies”. The list includes a number of other related demands, such as less intrusive customs inspections, claims for refunds, tax concessions and much more.

We round up all the rumours about the next-generation Apple TV 5G, widely expected to launch in early 2017 as the Apple TV turns 10 by Karen Haslam | 11 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents When will Apple release the 5th-gen Apple TV? Interface changes Apple TV streaming service Complete guide to 4th-gen Apple TV (2015) When will Apple release the next Apple TV - the 5th-generation Apple TV, or Apple TV 5 - in the UK? And what new features, tech specs, UK price and design changes should we expect from the new 5G Apple TV for 2017? The fourth-gen Apple TV - the first Apple TV device to allow users to install apps - was unveiled by Apple at the iPhone 6s launch event on 9 September 2015, and went on sale weeks later. More than 16 months later, we're eagerly looking ahead to the launch of the next, fifth-gen (5G) Apple TV. Indeed, there are already rumours that a next-generation Apple TV might arrive in 2017: perhaps even a special model to celebrate the Apple TV's 10th birthday. In this article we gather all the evidence related to the fifth-gen Apple TV's release date, as well as reporting on all the rumours and clues about the 2017 Apple TV's new features, tech specs, UK price and design changes. However, if you're still interested in the Apple TV that's available right now, we've got plenty of information about the 2015 Apple TV, including pricing and the best places to buy. And don't forget our Apple TV buying guide 2017. Read next: How to set up the new Apple TV | New Apple TV vs old Apple TV | Apple TV tips UK Updated, 11 January 2017, to discuss the chances of an anniversary update as the Apple TV turns 10; and previously to include the news that the third-gen Apple TV has been discontinued, and what this might mean for the release of the fifth-gen Apple TV. New Apple TV 2017 release date rumours UK: When will Apple release the 5th-gen Apple TV? We expect Apple to release the next-gen Apple TV in 2017 to tie in with the product's 10th anniversary, but there has. Here's when the four generations of Apple TV launched: 1st-gen Apple TV: January 2007 2nd-gen Apple TV: September 2010 3rd-gen Apple TV: March 2012 4th-gen Apple TV: September 2015 Evidently, Apple updates its Apple TV less often than its iPhones, iPads and Macs: there was a three-and-a-half-year wait between the first and second models, and between the third and fourth. Based on that, it would be reasonable to expect the 5th-gen Apple TV to appear in 2018 or even 2019, and we certainly don't have firm evidence to dispute that. But our instincts tell us that the Apple TV's position and status in the company's portfolio of products has changed. It used to be a sideline and a hobby, but with the growing importance of streaming media and smart-home applications, and with the arrival on the platform of games and its own App Store, Apple TV is moving to centre stage. And we're not the only ones to think Apple is likely to start updating the TV more frequently from now on. A report (link for subscribers only) in DigiTimes last year predicted that the fifth-generation Apple TV would go into trial production as early as December 2015, with volume production starting in the first quarter of 2016. Changes were said to include a dramatically improved hardware performance and new functions "to help it no longer serve only as a set-top box". Read next: 14 best Apple TV alternatives | Best Apple TV buying guide 2017 Apple discontinues third-gen Apple TV Apple has officially discontinued the third-generation Apple TV after being on sale since 2012. The move from Apple forces users to invest in the upgraded fourth-gen Apple TV, which starts at £139 compared to the £59 price-tag of the third-gen device. The third-gen Apple TV didn't feature tvOS or the App Store, but was used as a budget option for users that only wanted to stream content to their TVs.   The choice to remove the third-gen Apple TV from the Apple TV lineup suggests, to us at least, that the wheels are in motion and that the fifth-gen Apple TV will be making an appearance sooner, rather than later. Q3 2016 earnings call comments: 'Something bigger' on the way Tim Cook made non-specific but intriguing comments about the future of the Apple TV at Apple's Q3 2016 earnings conference call. He made it very clear that Apple has big plans for its TV division, and plans to build "something bigger" with the product and surrounding ecosystem. Near the end of the hour-long call, a question was posed by Kulbinder Garcha, the managing director of Credit Suisse: "I think about some of the comments you've made about the TV market and how it's been stuck in the sixties and seventies, and the experience hasn't changed," Garcha said. "I understand that you've got the Apple TV box out, but in terms of driving actual video-on-demand services, is that something Apple wants to do themselves, do you want to partner, could you even build content? How do you think about that as an actual business opportunity, as opposed to, here's an Apple box and we sell some units but it's not that meaningful to the overall company in terms of size?" Tim Cook's reply was enigmatic. "The introduction of Apple TV and tvOS in last October and the subsequent OS releases and what's coming out this fall… think of that as building the foundation for what we believe can be a broader business over time," he said. "I don't want to be more precise than that but you shouldn't look at what's there today and think we've done what we want to do. We've built a foundation that we can do something bigger off of." New Apple TV 2017 release date: WWDC 2016 and tvOS 10 Back in spring 2016 we argued that the 5G Apple TV was unlikely to be launched at WWDC 2016, since the event came round less than a year after Apple rolled out the fourth-gen model and none of the previous Apple TVs had launched in summer. Indeed, Apple launched no new hardware at the event whatsoever. But the new version of the Apple TV's operating system, tvOS 10, got considerable stage time. As we often observe when discussing new iPhones and iPads, many of the most significant updates come not from new hardware but from free software updates. Siri gets some big improvements in tvOS's new update: it can now search the Apple TV's movie and TV database with more complex queries. It can search YouTube, too, and any live streaming channels can be launched by saying "watch" and then the name of the channel. There's a new dark mode for Apple TV, which makes the background black instead of the bright white we're used to. And the Apple TV Remote app has been redesigned; it now offers all the Siri remote features and can be used for Siri queries using the built-in mic. One last thing Apple didn't mention, but has since come to light in Apple support documents, is that the requirement for Siri Remote compatibility for Apple TV games has been relaxed. That means they can focus on MFi game controllers, which are much more game-friendly than the Siri remote. See: Best Apple TV game controllers. Read our Complete guide to tvOS's new features for more information on the software update. New Apple TV 2017 release date: 10th-anniversary Apple TV Looking again at those launch dates above, we feel like the tenth anniversary of the Apple TV, which we passed on 9 January 2017, might be a tempting occasion for a big update. Apple tends to dislike historical wallowing - famously refusing to build a museum in its new headquarters because "we're focused on the future, not the past" - but there is a precedent for an anniversary product in the form of the Twentieth Anniversary Mac (number 4 in our article The 5 weirdest Macs of all time). Read next: Best Apple TV game controllers | Best Apple TV games | Best Apple TV apps New Apple TV 2017 release date rumours: Apple's 27 October event While many assumed that we would see the introduction of the fifth-generation Apple TV at Apple's October 2016 event, the event focused mainly on the new MacBook Pro. The New MacBook Pro features a Touch Bar, offering contextual controls depending on the app you're using. You can find out more about the 2016 MacBook Pro here: New MacBook Pro 2016 review. The Apple TV wasn't completely out of the spotlight, though, as Apple introduced the TV app for the Apple TV and iOS devices. The app looks to integrate streaming content from a number of providers, but is US-only at first. Those in the US can expect the app to appear as part of a software update in December, while those in the UK have no solid release date just yet.  New Apple TV 2017 rumours UK: Interface changes An Apple TV owner's user experience is largely dictated by the software side of things. How will Apple change the Apple TV interface? New cross-provider programming guide interface Apple's next big plan for its Apple TV isn't new hardware: it's a software-based programme guide. That sounds boring, but it's potentially a powerful way of improving user-friendliness for those who are signed up to multiple content providers. The first foundation of this strategy was laid with the announcements of tvOS 10 at WWDC in June. tvOS 10 includes a new feature known as 'single sign in', whereby a user can sign in once, with a single login and password, and tvOS will then automatically sign into a whole raft of services for them: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and so on. Nice and convenient. But for many of us who do use multiple TV and movie services, a bigger issue than multiple sign-ins is simply keeping track of everything that's available to watch. Each service will have its own ways of highlighting new, popular or user-tailored recommendations, but having to open up two, three or even more apps to check out what's on offer when planning an evening's viewing is a slight pain. This is where Apple comes in. The company is really good at stuff like this: forging relationships with content providers and creating a simple and trusted umbrella interface enabling users to browse and access everything they want. That was what iTunes was so good at, and the iOS App Store is successful in that regard too. We just hope the new Apple TV programming guide has strong search. The App Store still has disappointing search, with worthless spammy apps that are good at SEO ranking above legitimate apps on relevant search terms. The two scenarios aren't quite the same - there isn't really such a thing as spam TV - but Apple still needs to find a way to foreground higher-quality content so it isn't drowned out by the volume. For more information about upcoming changes to the Apple TV's interface, take a look at our complete guide to tvOS 10. New Apple TV 2017 release date rumours UK: Apple TV streaming service Rumours that Apple will launch a TV streaming service have been around for a while. If you'd like more of an in-depth discussion of this topic, take a look at our separate article about Apple's streaming service plans. Unfortunately for anyone who was looking forward to the launch of the service, it sounds like it will be further delayed as Apple continues to negotiate with the TV networks in the US. The December 2015 report from Bloomberg claims that Apple is putting its plans for the streaming service on hold because the cable companies and networks are proving resistant to the idea. In fact, Apple may ditch the idea altogether, focusing instead on offering the tvOS platform for media companies to sell their content directly to consumers via the App Store, according to the Bloomberg report. Bloomberg reckons the reason for the resistance is Apple's demand for content at a price the networks aren't happy with. CBS CEO Les Moonves, who has often commented on the rumoured service, has also claimed that Apple has put the streaming service plans "on hold", according to Bloomberg. Previously Moonves had hinted that the rumoured Apple TV steaming service would arrive in 2015. The revelation came during an earlier interview with Bloomberg TV in which he suggested his company would soon come to an arrangement with Apple. Moonves said: "Apple is having conversations with everyone about doing their own streaming services. We have had those conversations, as have the other networks. Do I think something will happen? Probably, but I don't know when." This isn't the first time Moonves has made comments about the rumoured service. Earlier this year he made a similar revelation in an interview at a Re/code conference, giving the impression that he was in ongoing conversations with Apple.

Rebounding after the disastrous Galaxy Note 7 launch last year, Samsung is expected to release a new phone in the Galaxy S series this year instead. But what do we know so far about Samsung’s latest handset? In this article, we’ll take a look the various Galaxy S8 rumors circulating, including specs, price, and when to expect the new handset. When will the Samsung Galaxy S8 be released? Each previous generation of the Samsung Galaxy S has been announced at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona in late February. With that in mind, you’d expect it to be an almost certainty that Samsung will unveil the Galaxy S8 at the event this year. However, according to SamMobile, delays in testing could force Samsung to push the reveal of the Galaxy S8 back and ultimately miss the aforementioned Mobile World Congress trade show. Samsung is apparently keen to prevent a repeat of last year’s Note 7 release, where a battery fault led to devices exploding in users’ hands and causing a PR nightmare for the company. With that in mind, the Galaxy S8 is expected to instead be unveiled at a separate event in New York, ahead of its release in mid-April. Upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8 image leaks online, could be unveiled soonhttps://t.co/Yy1hq1FRrZ pic.twitter.com/uAdi3Bhk6C — Phone Radar (@phoneradarblog) January 5, 2017 How much will the Samsung Galaxy S8 cost? It’s expected that Samsung will once again split the Galaxy S8 into two variations, the standard Galaxy S8, and the Galaxy S8 Edge. With that in mind, two different pricing levels are also to be expected. However, according to NDTV, Samsung is expected to increase the cost of their flagships by 15 to 20 percent in order to better compete with Apple’s high-end flagships. Whether Samsung will risk alienating their current users with that price increase remains to be seen. That being said, Samsung is also hoping to ship more Galaxy S8 units than ever before. According to the Express, Samsung has set an internal target to ship 60 million units of the new device, meaning that the company might ultimately decide against a price increase in order to hit their ambitious targets.

Forget The iPhone 7, Leaked Images Reveal Apple’s Click Wheel iPhone Prototype What new features will the Samsung Galaxy S8 have? As aforementioned, much like its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to launch in two variations, one with a 5.1-inch display, the other with a 5.5-inch variant. On both models, Samsung is expected to drop the capacitive buttons typically found on the bottom of their devices, replacing them with on-screen navigation buttons. This would allow Samsung to drastically decrease the size of the bezels of their devices, something that Apple is also expected to do with the release of the iPhone 8 later this year. Samsung is also expected to borrow another big feature from Apple’s devices. 3D Touch, allowing for pressure-sensitive interaction with the device is expected to be present with the Samsung Galaxy S8 in some form of another. However, it’s safe to assume that Samsung will brand the feature differently on their handset.

Whether Samsung will replace it with a USB-C connection or just continue with their standard charging port remains to be seen. All will be revealed when Samsung officially unveils the Galaxy S8 in the coming months.

Go iPhone reaches a milestone Details Category: Local News Published: Wednesday, 11 January 2017 04:00 Written by Cody Glydon Ten years ago this week the smartphone business landscape changed drastically. Canadian company Blackberry was the dominant force in smartphone technology manufacturing, but that all changed in 2007 when Apple announced they would release their first generation iPhone. "Blackberry, HTC and Nokia had some smartphones too, but when Apple released the iPhone that was really a game changer, I think," said John Shoff, owner of Reality Bytes in Drumheller. The phone revolutionized the way people interacted with one another and what a user could now do in the palm of one's hand. "It's your note taker, it's your navigator when your driving, your calendar system, your personal assistant, so many things that these smartphones do that really aren't anything to do with being a phone. They're more of a universal tool than an actual phone," added Shoff. The years have not been kind to Blackberry and Nokia as the companies began to struggle competing with Apple and Samsung, which became heavyweights in the smartphone business. In fact, Blackberry, the creator of the smartphone, announced they were getting out of the business in 2016 and focusing more on security and software development. Looking ahead, Shoff believes some devices will be expanding in screen size while shrinking in other devices. "The other interesting technology I'm keeping a close eye on is the flexible screen technology, so that's something LG has been at the forefront of and to see, eventually, a smartphone device that (has) a flexible screen that you can just slide into your pocket almost like a piece of paper. That's going to be really cool," smiled Shoff. Apple just released their iPhone 7 and rumors are beginning to swirl about an iPhone 8 already. An announcement from Samsung about the Galaxy 8 and Galaxy 8 Plus is expected early this year and Nokia also plans on mounting a comeback in the phone business in 2017.        Prev Next More Local News New Munson Hall gets top marks It's been three and a half months since the new Munson Community Hall opened its doors; so how are things going?

THEO PANAYIDES meets her   It’s New Year’s Eve and I find Eve Makis in the Sun Hall Hotel in Larnaca, tapping at her laptop. I’m a few minutes late, admittedly, but I’m still a bit surprised to find her hard at work, on New Year’s Eve no less. Still, there she is, not exactly writing – her new book (her fifth) is almost done, due to be dispatched to her agent at the end of this month – but editing, polishing, taking advantage of every spare moment. “Yeah,” she confirms, “I can write anywhere. Because I’ve got two children, so I’ve had to get used to writing with noise around me, and to sort of grab any moments I can”. Eve lives in England – in a suburb of Nottingham, where she was born – but her profile in Cyprus has seldom been higher. Her fourth novel, The Spice Box Letters, has just come out in a Greek translation, while a feature film called Boy on the Bridge (adapted from her third novel, Land of the Golden Apple) is set to premiere later this year. Spice Box Letters tells a tale of the Armenian community in Cyprus, Land of the Golden Apple was inspired by the childhood experiences of her husband Tasos in the village of Trikomo. “The underpinning of every book has been Cypriot history,” she explains – but her biggest hit was perhaps her debut, Eat, Drink and Be Married, with a teenage heroine whose life revolved around a Nottingham chip shop run by her Cypriot parents, much like Eve herself. We’ll get to that in a moment; but first, let’s take some photos. This turns out to be complicated. We venture outside but the light’s too bright, it hurts her eyes (she lived in Cyprus for about four years “in my 20s” – she’s now “in my 40s” – but nowadays only visits a couple of times a year). I snap away in the lobby, but the results leave something to be desired. Let’s take another one, she pleads, studying her image unhappily. Maybe if she smiled a bit more, I suggest – and she tries but it doesn’t come naturally, at least in a photo. She’s uneasy, whether with the set-up or publicity in general; I suspect she’s a natural introvert. Later on, she admits that she never does promotional tours for her books, though she knows she should; she’ll do a few signings in Nottingham, but “it’s not the bit [of the job] that I enjoy”. Nor is she actively a part of the UK Cypriot community (“I’m probably the worst Cypriot around”), nor indeed of any community. “I don’t do the group thing, I’m an outsider. I’m an outsider wherever I am – and I think that’s the best place to be for a writer. I’m outside looking in, and that’s where I want to be”. As a writer, i.e. a writer of novels – not a journalist, which she did for seven years but never felt was “a natural fit with me” – she’s led something of a charmed life. Eat, Drink and Be Married was published by the very first publisher she approached, and Eve was taken on as a client by the very first agent who read the manuscript; that never happens, especially in today’s cutthroat book market. “I was very, very lucky,” she concedes; she talks easily, candidly (she’s not spiky, despite that early uneasiness), her sole verbal tic being the occasional ‘sort of’. The timing was right: Eat, Drink came out soon after My Big Fat Greek Wedding (though she’d signed her book deal before that film) and was also, at the time, the first representation “from the inside” of the Greek Cypriot community in England. “But the book took four years to write,” she points out. “So you can see it as being luck, or you can see it as your life sort of leading up to that. And a lot of hard work, and a lot of years when I wasn’t earning anything”. Her whole life had indeed been leading up to that book – especially her childhood and teenage years in a very particular sub-culture: Eve was the only Greek Cypriot girl of her generation in Nottingham to leave home and go to university, and “my parents ideally would not have wanted me to get an education, but to get married”. Eat, Drink “began as a very, sort of, angry representation of the life that I had lived – which was a repressive life”. She started writing it when her daughter was born (the daughter is now 18, a gifted singer studying Commercial Music), motherhood having perhaps spurred her on to make sense of her own upbringing – but something strange happened in the writing process. The book began angry, “but when it was angry, it didn’t work”; only when she distanced herself did it start to work, when she added perspective and turned it into a kind of rueful satire. “Because actually, the repression wasn’t terrible. I wasn’t beaten, I had a happy childhood – it’s just that I couldn’t have a boyfriend, I couldn’t go to parties. Y’know, I couldn’t wear Doc Martens…” It’s an interesting point, that ‘angry’ didn’t really agree with her. She must’ve been angry at some point in her life, or at least sufficiently strong-willed to insist on an education (she did a Combined Arts degree with an emphasis on Psychology), and she talks of Eat, Drink and Be Married as having “exorcised [the] demon” of her adolescence – yet a rave review in the Daily Express, quoted on her website (eve-makis.com), calls the book “an easy-to-digest and highly enjoyable read”, which doesn’t really sound like an exorcism. I suspect it takes a certain kind of person to write an angry book – a bitter, blustery, self-centred person – and she’s not that kind of person. She comes across as earnest, empathetic, maybe rather anxious. Asked to describe herself, she goes for “liberal” and “easy-going”. Does she still get angry nowadays? “I channel my anger into my work.” Does she have a cool head? Is she good in a crisis? She hesitates: “It depends on the crisis”. Something small. Like for instance, if she saw a cockroach? “Oh no, I’m not good,” she replies with a shudder. “Not good at all, no. I would sort of panic. Yeah, majorly panic. I’d majorly panic about a cockroach.” Another good word to describe her might be ‘grounded’ – which perhaps is another way of saying that you can take the girl out of the Nottingham Cypriot household but not vice versa. Needless to say, Eve has raised her own kids (she also has a nine-year-old son) very differently than her parents raised her: “They don’t know what suppression is,” she chuckles. On the other hand, her devotion to those kids – writing is all very well, but “my kids come first, and time with my kids comes first” – is pretty old-school, and of course the man she married must’ve met with her parents’ approval, being “Cypriot Cypriot,” i.e. not UK-born, “fully Cypriot”. She pauses: “Very Cypriot! In some senses. In terms of his temperament, not in terms of his values”. Her husband works in football (he’s a former player and scout) and it’s fair to say they don’t often talk about books, even her own books – which is perfectly fine. “I don’t think I’d like my husband to be involved in my work. It’s my thing, you know. I just want to get on with it.” There it is in a nutshell: the grounded-ness, the total lack of preciousness, Eve’s view of writing as a job one simply ‘gets on with’. That’s why she writes whenever she can, even in spare moments between ferrying kids and doing housework (she doesn’t have a maid, or other domestic help: “I’m a writer, I don’t earn that sort of money!”), without claiming to be special or pretending that the rules don’t apply to her. The word she uses is “professionalism”, meaning you buckle down and do what needs to be done. “I think, if you take the professional approach to writing, you have to be habitual in your writing process… You know, like someone gets up and goes to work, you get up and go to your desk,” she instructs firmly (it’s no surprise that, as well as writing her own books, she also teaches a writing course at Nottingham University). “I mean, I think a lot of people aspire to write books, and a lot of people are capable of writing books – but if they don’t put the time in, and they don’t establish the writing habit, it never happens. And they wonder why it never happens: it never happens because they’re waiting for inspiration to strike, and that’s not how writing takes place!”. Professionalism means having the work in mind all the time: “You get up, you’re brushing your teeth, you’re thinking ‘What am I going to do when I sit down [to work]?’. You walk the dog, you’re thinking ‘Where am I taking this, where is it going?’.” Professionalism means rising above your own ego and desire for validation, especially when it comes to working relationships: “For example, I would never hassle my agent, I would never keep sending her stuff to read. I know that’s not done”. The new book goes out this month, and Eve is worried that her agent might not like it – all she’s seen so far is a synopsis and an opening chapter – but if she comes back asking for changes, then Eve will do her best to accommodate those changes. “A book is a product,” she explains flatly, “and it has to appeal to a market”. It’s no good being precious about these things. Professionalism means looking at the work realistically. Boy on the Bridge, the upcoming movie, is nothing like her book – but that’s okay, because she and the rest of the team (Eve co-wrote the script) made a decision to go in another direction. The book is about a boy being preyed-on by a paedophile; in the film, that plot has disappeared completely, doubtless to make it more commercial. “You can sit there and think ‘Oh, this is my creation and I’m not changing it’, and that’s fine,” she notes as a general principle. “But then you have to be prepared not to sell.” That doesn’t mean being sloppy, of course. I suspect she’s a bit of a perfectionist (judging by how long it took us to get a photo) and the books don’t come easily, taking between two and four years to write. “There’s times when you don’t want to do it, there’s times when you fall asleep at your desk, there’s times when it doesn’t flow,” she laments – but Eve Makis also comes across as a down-to-earth woman who’s devoted her life to this mad vocation, using it not just to channel her feelings and exorcise demons but also as a kind of patriotic gesture, introducing Cypriot history to a UK audience. (“Eve, I didn’t know any of this,” marvelled her editor after reading her first book. “I didn’t know the island was divided”.) You go into a chip shop in England, she notes, “and there’s Cypriots behind the counter, and you have no idea what they’ve gone through… All you see is a person with a little moustache frying your fish”. Part of her mission is to restore the dignity of these unknown fish-fryers, including her now-retired dad – though these days it’s just as likely to be Syrians in a kebab shop, often reviled in the post-Brexit England she finds so alarming. The work is everything, or almost everything. “I’m a robot,” chuckles Eve Makis. “I am. I’ve become that way.” Does she have any hobbies? Not really: “I swim, three times a week. I have no other hobbies, because I don’t have time. I read and I swim, and I write. And I look after my kids”. She reads a lot – though not in the past three months, she’s been too caught up in her own writing – mostly literary novels; her favourite book may be Jeffrey Eugenides’ Middlesex. She knows her own work isn’t quite in that league, at least not yet. “I think my books are essentially small books with a big heart,” she admits with disarming honesty. “I see the flaws in every book I’ve written. I don’t display them on my bookshelf, I don’t, sort of, bandy them about. There’s flaws in every book I’ve written”. Professionalism means seeing the flaws in your work, and trying to get better. What if she hadn’t been ‘lucky’? What if she hadn’t been picked up by the very first people who read her manuscript? What if she’d tried and tried to get published – as most writers do, unless they self-publish – and still not succeeded? Would she have kept writing anyway, in the shadows and crevices of daily life? I recall what she said about being “an outsider” (a common problem for second-generation immigrants) and realise that writing is a kind of home for her, a place to belong. “I think I need to write,” she confirms. “Writing isn’t a thing I do because I have to. I need to write. It keeps me sane”. My mind flashes idly to a kind of sitcom family house in suburban Nottingham, husband watching football on the telly – and Eve serenely tapping at her laptop, as dogs bark and kids bicker around her.

Newsweek Anthony Cuthbertson 4 days ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL How to prepare for 2017 Social Security changes 21 expensive products that cost way more than they should © REUTERS/Luke MacGregor A woman speaks on an Apple phone as she passes an advert for the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, London, September 2, 2016. Samsung may have accidentally revealed the identity of its answer to Apple’s Siri: a virtual assistant called ‘Bixby.’ The South Korean electronics manufacturer has been largely left behind in the battle of the bots, with Microsoft’s Cortana, Amazon’s Alexa and the Google Assistant all offering rivals to Siri. With the much-anticipated arrival of the Galaxy S8 smartphone, Samsung is expected to launch its own virtual assistant. In a recent beta version of the Samsung Pay app, three options were offered in the menu bar: Shopping, Mini and Bixby. The options, first spotted by unofficial Samsung blog SamMobile, have since been removed, but suggest the company is planning to integrate the digital assistant into its mobile payments platform. Samsung does not comment on rumors or speculation, but the news comes just three months after the firm announced the acquisition of artificial intelligence platform Viv. In a statement at the time, Samsung said: “The deal showcases Samsung’s commitment to virtual personal assistants and is part of the company’s broader vision to deliver an AI-based open ecosystem across all of its devices and services.” Samsung added that the virtual assistant would help simplify user interfaces on its devices and understand context in order to offer appropriate suggestions and recommendations. After the Galaxy S8, the “conversational interface” could be integrated into Samsung’s smart home appliances and wearables. The company has previously filed for a trademark in South Korea for the word “Bixby,” which is distinct enough from other words to be used as a voice-activated technology. The patent covers “computer software for personal information management,” and describes “computer software for enabling hands-free use of a mobile phone through voice recognition.” Former phone giant Nokia may also be jumping aboard the AI assistant bandwagon, having applied for a trademark on the word “Viki.”  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

As part of that, we’ve already seen some of the original prototypes and software projects that were being considered by Apple for the iPhone’s development. Now, the earliest precursor of what became iOS has shown up on video. Last week we saw images and video courtesy of Sonny Dickson, of one of the software operating systems that Apple was toying with before launching the iPhone. Dubbed AcornOS internally, the system was developed by Tony Fadell and his team and was heavily based on the iPod’s interface. However, this design known as P1 was clunky, slow, and simply unpleasant to use. At the same time, Apple’s Scott Forstall was developing P2, a different system that relied entirely on on-screen buttons which could be touched directly by the user. This is the project that eventually turned into iOS as we know it today. Of course, as you can see in the video, the version demoed here is very rudimentary, seeming to be more of an interface proof of concept than anything else. The blocky, strident buttons are very limited and the navigation between menus and settings is still somewhat muddled. Obviously, this was just a test phase and never meant to see the light of day outside of Apple’s walls, but it does give us a fascinating glimpse into the history of the phone that changed the world.

Early Competing iPhone Prototypes Shown in Video GO The prototypes ran the same OS but had different UI concepts Jan 11, 2017 09:41 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  On Monday, Apple marked 10 years since the launch of the first iPhone, on January 9, 2007. The smartphone was introduced by the late Steve Jobs and the event marked the start of Apple’s dominance and innovation in the smartphone market. Sonny Dickson shared a video on YouTube showing the two early iPhone prototypes, Tony Fadell’s P1 and Scott Forstall’s P2 projects. The two phones were the prototypes considered for the first iPhone and they both run Apple’s Acorn OS, but different competing software versions. The video shows both smartphones booting up, but saying that their feature set is limited is an understatement. The software versions incorporate diagnostics tools and some basic system information. It appears that Apple had put together two teams to work on the software that would later be implemented in the original iPhone. Tony Fadell’s P1 device ran a software version that was similar to the one found on iPods at the time. The Acorn version had a digital representation of a scroll wheel that would be used for accessing system menus on the phone. The Forstall 2 version had an interface that combined a more direct touch approach, similar to the SwitchBoard operating system that Apple currently uses on test iPhone prototypes. Hundreds of prototypes were considered for the original iPhone Ultimately, Apple went with Forstall’s P2 version of the iPhone Acorn OS, which used individual icons to interact with the phone, compared to a scroll wheel. Essentially, P1’s scroll wheel was a good idea considering that Apple held the majority of the market with its iPod at the time, but that didn’t mean that such an interface could be successfully ported on a phone. It appears that the P2 interface was a success, seeing how even though much has changed, the basic concept remained the same. Needless to say, the prototypes featured in the video are just two of the many iterations considered for the original Apple. Indeed, Apple worked on many versions for the first iPhone, with differences in both hardware and software specifications. Considering that the early iPhone was announced a decade ago, we’re quite curious if Apple will bring significant changes to the iPhone 8 in order to mark this milestone.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | January 10, 2017 -- 18:43 GMT (10:43 PST) | Topic: Hardware Apple has issued a fix to a Safari bug that it blames for problems with the new MacBook Pro's battery life. Consumer Reports has refused to recommend the laptop to consumers after its tests showed the battery life on the machines would last anywhere from 19.5 hours to 3.75 hours. Apple said the findings did not match the results of its own tests. Working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data. https://t.co/IWtfsmBwpO -- Philip Schiller (@pschiller) December 24, 2016 Now, after reviewing Consumer Reports' diagnostic data, the Cupertino company says the problem can be attributed to a Safari bug that was triggered by the settings Consumer Reports used. "We appreciate the opportunity to work with Consumer Reports over the holidays to understand their battery test results," said Apple in a statement to Consumer Reports. "We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache... We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test." The fix for the Safari bug is currently only available to those who sign up for the Apple Beta Software program, but it will be a part of a broader software update available in a few weeks. Luckily for Apple, Consumer Reports says it's re-running its battery tests after downloading the software fix and will give the MacBook Pros a recommended rating if the problem is resolved. These models were the first MacBooks to not receive recommended ratings from Consumer Reports -- and they were the only laptops out of 140 tested that demonstrated such inconsistent battery life.

 Apple may be working on its own version of Google Glass with German lens manufacturer Carl Zeiss Sam Shead Jan. 10, 2017, 4:06 AM 2,888 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook at an Apple media event in San Francisco on September 7.REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach Apple has partnered with the German lens and optics manufacturer Carl Zeiss AG on a new pair of augmented reality smartglasses, according to technology blogger Robert Scoble. Scoble said on his Facebook page that an employee from Carl Zeiss AG confirmed rumours that Apple and Carl Zeiss AG were working on "a light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses." The conversation occurred during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, Scoble said. It specifically took place at the Zeiss stand in the AR section of CES, according to Scoble. The Carl Zeiss stand at CES reportedly had no AR technology despite being in the AR section.Facebook/Robert Scoble "Carl Zeiss is in the AR part of CES," Scoble wrote on Facebook. "But it is NOT showing off its mixed reality optics. Why not? I said 'Tim Cook didn't let you' and the employees around me smiled nervously." Scoble has a mixed track record when it comes to Apple's future products. He claimed, for example, that the iPhone 8 would be "a clear piece of glass." That's almost certainly not going to happen. But we do know that Apple is very interested in augmented reality. CEO Tim Cook said in September that he was excited by the possibilities of augmented reality. "There's virtual reality and there's augmented reality — both of these are incredibly interesting," Cook said. "But my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far." Confirmed: Apple and @CarlZeissLenses are working together on augmented reality optics. Details: https://t.co/11bsLQn8GP — Robert Scoble: VR/AR (@Scobleizer) January 9, 2017 The glasses could be announced by Apple as early as this year, Scoble said, writing that he previously expected Apple to announce them in 2018. Unlike Google and Snapchat, Apple is yet to release any form of computerised glasses. If Scoble is right and Apple is planning to release a pair of glasses, it's unclear how they would be positioned versus competitor products or where they would be priced. Google's failed Glass product cost over £1,000, while Snapchat is selling its Spectacles in the US for $130 (£100).

Tesla has hired an Apple software engineer to help develop its self-driving Autopilot system. — Reuters picSAN FRANCISCO, Jan 11 — Electric carmaker Tesla Motors Inc has hired a key Apple Inc software engineer to oversee its Autopilot self-driving software efforts, Tesla said in a blog post yesterday. Chris Lattner, who served at Apple for more than a decade, said in an online message to Apple developers yesterday morning that he would “leave Apple later this month to pursue an opportunity in another space” without saying which company he planned to join. Later in the day, Tesla posted a message on the company’s website saying that Lattner had been hired as vice president of Autopilot software but did not say when he would start work there. Tesla declined to comment beyond the announcement. Apple confirmed the departure but would not comment beyond Lattner’s posted message. The move is a significant win for Tesla, bringing a high-profile figure in the world of software development for a position that previously did not have a full-time leader. Tesla’s Autopilot was overseen on an interim basis by the software chief Jinnah Hosein of SpaceX, which is also headed by Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk. Autopilot is the hardware and software system on Tesla vehicles that allows self-driving in some situations but still requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. Federal safety regulators in the United States are examining whether Autopilot played a role in a fatal crash in Florida last year. Lattner most recently served as a senior director in the developer tools department at Apple and was best known for introducing Swift, a programming language that made it easier for software developers to write apps for iOS, the operating system that powers iPhones and iPads. In addition to developing Swift at Apple, Lattner also led a successful push to make the programming language “open source,” meaning that developers could incorporate it into their applications without having to pay fees to Apple. The move was a first for Apple, which until then had typically tightly controlled the technology it created. Microsoft Corp and Google parent Alphabet Inc have also either published or contributed to open-source programming languages. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Drive Channel Most Viewed Now Week In New York, ride-hailing drivers are slaves to the surge Daimler’s Zetsche shows off the new Mercedes E-Class (VIDEO) Perodua unveils new Perodua Axia with VVT-i engine In cars, do Americans care about looks?

By David Glance. Added by David Glance on 11 January 2017. Saved under In-depth, Top Tags: Apple, Google, Steve Jobs Tweet The original iPhone It is 10 years this week since Steve Jobs walked onto a stage and said, “Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything.” He was referring to the iPhone, launched on 9 January 2007. Like many products, it could be argued that it wasn’t until version 3 in 2009 and the iPhone 3GS when everyone else started to really share Jobs’s vision. The App Store had been available for a year by then and the notion of the smartphone as a truly portable general purpose computing device was born. Since 2007, Apple has sold more than a billion iPhones, generating about US$650bn in revenue for the firm. In addition, the App Store generated $28bn of revenue last year alone. Of course, Apple’s sales in smartphones are now only 13% of smartphone sales globally, but Apple takes nearly all the profit. Apple didn’t invent the smartphone and must share honours with Google’s Android in driving the development of smartphone technologies and in particular the development of the mobile app environment. Certainly, there would be nowhere near the adoption worldwide if Android had not enabled the development of inexpensive handsets. Smartphone adoption now stands at 43% of adults globally but goes up to as much as 77% in Australia and 72% in the US. This is now greater than the number of adults who own computers. There is not a facet of life that hasn’t been changed by the advent of the smartphone, with most of these changes occurring within the last five years. What they have given us is freedom and control in our lives. In health, education, politics and social discourse, smartphones have provided the universal accessibility for an almost fully democratic participation. On a more practical level, we have the freedom to buy products from anywhere at any time and not be constrained by what is on offer in our physical location. We can consult with health providers anywhere or even check on their advice. We have the freedom to share our opinions and thoughts with anyone at any time. The mobile phone played a significant role in the last US election and is now the primary means by which the incoming US president, Donald Trump, will communicate with the country and the rest of the world. We have the wisdom of the world at our fingertips and even the ability to converse with our devices to allow them to guide and advise us. Most importantly, we can communicate and relate with our family, friends and colleagues at all times from anywhere in the world. We can use the phone to document our lives and share whatever portion of it with whichever audience we choose. None of this was really viable or possible before the advent of the smartphone, and certainly not before Apple and Google created the platforms to enable this to happen. Of course, the world had to change to adapt to the possibilities created by the smartphone. Businesses like Uber would not have been possible but they had to put the technology together with the idea and drivers to enact them. Technologies like Bluetooth have been developed alongside the smartphone to enable the connection of devices to the phone that have made possible wearables, headphones and other devices. The smartphone itself would have been worth nothing if the Internet had not existed and the World Wide Web and browsers hadn’t created the means to communicate and interact on a global scale. So many different technologies have been brought together in the past 10 years that it is wrong to think that it was simply Apple or Google that brought the world we live in to bear. What Apple did, however, was to create the vessel in which these other technologies were able to work together to achieve what they have done. They would not have worked in a world of desktop or even laptop computers, or other devices. Although we don’t know the exact details of what the smartphone will look like in 10 years’ time, we know it will still be here and the main device we interact with. As the TV has not gone away but simply got smarter, the same is likely to be the case with the smartphone. The artificial intelligence capabilities of the phones will be far greater and the technologies that interact with the phone will catch up to match its capabilities. Apple may not have invented the smartphone but it certainly made them the life transforming devices that we have now.

Image: gui jun peng/Shutterstock Greenpeace has released its latest report into what companies are doing the most to clean up their act, and based on its findings, there is one clear front runner. The Greenpeace report entitled Clicking Clean: Who is Winning the Race to Build a Green Internet? highlights the ever-increasing demand the internet has on energy across the globe, citing evidence that 7pc of global electricity is currently needed to run it. Given that global internet traffic is expected to triple in just three years’ time, the environmental organisation wondered if the world’s largest tech companies will be ready to power the vast majority of it using renewable energy. Switch leads the way Based on Greenpeace’s findings, some of the familiar leaders in the tech world include Apple, with a clean energy index of 83pc based on available data, followed by Facebook at 67pc and Google at 56pc. Apple’s high ranking has been attributed to its decision to open one of its largest renewable energy data centres in Athenry, Galway later this year. One of the surprise entries on the list was the data centre provider Switch, which despite being a smaller operation than Apple, achieved a 100pc clean energy index, meaning it is entirely powered by clean energy. With an overall grade of ‘C’ and an energy transparency grade of ‘F’, Amazon was only able to achieve a clean energy index of 17pc. Greenpeace said the company is able to “talk a good game on renewables, but is keeping its customers in the dark on its energy decisions”. Image: Greenpeace Also notable in this year’s report is the first inclusion of Asian companies, including tech giants Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba, and Naver, revealing a region severely lacking in renewable energy use, with many receiving an overall ‘F’ grading. Netflix under scrutiny Netflix has also come under scrutiny, with one of the largest data footprints on Earth, accounting for one-third of internet traffic in North America and contributing significantly to the worldwide data demand from video streaming. With an overall ranking of ‘D’, Netflix was given a clean energy index of 17pc, with the majority of its energy consumption being generated equally by natural gas, coal and nuclear energy. “Like Apple, Facebook and Google, Netflix is one of the biggest drivers of the online world and has a critical say in how it is powered,” said Greenpeace USA senior IT analyst Gary Cook. “Netflix must embrace the responsibility to make sure its growth is powered by renewables, not fossil fuels, and it must show its leadership here.” Also facing criticism are the social media giants of Reddit and Twitter, which both received an ‘F’ grading, with a clean energy index of 17pc and 10pc, respectively.

Picture: REUTERS Las Vegas — The smartphone continues to change the world a decade after the debut of the iPhone, even as Apple is under pressure to come up with a new wonder. The iPhone — introduced by late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs on January 9 2007 — set the stage for mobile computing and an entire industry revolving around it. The handsets built on iPod digital music players and featured touchscreens at a time when the smartphone market was ruled by BlackBerry devices with keypads. Jobs billed his smartphone approach as blending liberal arts, design and technology. What was not obvious at the time was how iPhone’s focus on apps would send people rocketing along a path to tweeting, Snapping, Pokemon Go, live streaming video, and more. "Apple gets credit for the apps that brought the mobile computing platform to your pocket," Gartner analyst Brian Blau told AFP at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) that ended on Sunday in Las Vegas. "Today, it is hard to make a consumer electronics product without [internet] connectivity." Smartphones are even playing a role in virtual reality trends, with people using handsets as screens inserted into headsets for exploring fantasy realms. Apple does not attend CES. But its trend-setting power is felt here from cars boasting "infotainment" systems that synch with iPhones, to smart-home networks controlled by mobile apps and rival smartphones mirroring iPhone features. "The iPhone changed the world because mobile computing is now part of everyone’s daily life," Blau said. The iPhone, in a way, was a seed around which the consumer electronics industry has crystalised, said Maxwell Ramsey of mobile phone news website phoneArena.com. "It’s pretty remarkable what it did," he said of the iPhone. "We are still riding that wave from 2007." Putting the internet in people’s pockets, and on tablet computers, has profoundly changed the way people watch films, get news, socialise and work. Insiders at the show cited the iPhone as the main impetus for the revolutionary shift to mobile computing lifestyles. "It turned the industry on its head," Maxwell said. "It figuratively destroyed a lot of firms, and changed the landscape." But iPhone sales began to decline in 2016 in the increasingly saturated and competitive smartphone market. Apple CE Tim Cook and top executives saw their compensation for 2016 cut because internal income targets were missed, according to a filing on Friday with US regulators.

The maker of Apple iPhones has posted its first revenue decline in 26 years. Pichi Chuang / Reuters Apple iPhone maker’s first sales decline since 1991 in worst year on record January 11, 2017 Updated: January 11, 2017 12:38 PM Related Sharp’s new owner Foxconn to shut overseas units of Japanese firm and cut jobs Chinese smartphone makers to set up factories in India Apple supplier Foxconn freezes hiring at largest plant in China Video: Foxconn plant reopens after riot Related Sharp’s new owner Foxconn to shut overseas units of Japanese firm and cut jobs Chinese smartphone makers to set up factories in India Apple supplier Foxconn freezes hiring at largest plant in China Video: Foxconn plant reopens after riot Topics: Apple Smartphones Hon Hai Precision Industry, known as Foxconn and the main assembler of Apple’s iPhones, has posted its first annual revenue decline after the global smartphone market went through its worst year on record. Foxconn saw sales fall 2.8 per cent in 2016 sales to NT$4.36 trillion (Dh501.33bn), it said in a filing to Taiwan’s stock exchange, mostly in line with analysts’ estimates. It was Foxconn’s first decline in annual revenue since listing in 1991, and comes as Terry Gou’s Foxconn Technology Group prepares to invest billions of dollars in display-making capacity after taking control of Japan’s Sharp. The world’s biggest contract manufacturer of electronics has been grappling with the smartphone slowdown, the result of maturing markets and a decelerating Chinese economy. It has deployed robots and boosted production efficiency to drive down costs but its fate is intertwined with Apple’s, which is trying to regain investors’ confidence after less-than-stellar quarterly earnings. Pegatron, which also makes Apple products, posted a 27 per cent slide in December sales to NT$84bn. Shares of Foxconn’s smaller rival dropped as much as 7 per cent on Wednesday to their lowest since November. Foxconn mostly unchanged. Apple accounts for about half of its sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In October, Apple reported its first annual revenue decline since 2001 and forecast sales of $76bn to $78bn for the holiday quarter. That is barely higher than expectations despite arch-rival Samsung Electronics’ issues with the now-defunct fire-prone Note 7. Chinese rivals such as Oppo and Huawei Technologies have also steadily grown global market share at the expense of Apple and Samsung. Those brands rely on in-house manufacturing, bypassing Foxconn and Pegatron because of the perception that they pander to Apple, according to Roger Sheng, a Gartner analyst based in Shanghai. "South Koreans are making devices on their own, and the Chinese brands think Hon Hai is too expensive and doesn’t devote the most attention to their orders," Mr Sheng said. * Bloomberg business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Technology Nintendo Switch: New games console to go on sale March 3 Robot co-pilot leads Nissan’s Infiniti down a different path Amazon’s Alexa to help spur 100,000 new jobs at tech juggernaut Peter Nowak: The iPhone’s decade changed the world – and Apple MOST VIEWED Business | All Emirates passengers given option to pay for access to premium lounges Are tourists or visitors allowed to drive Dubai-registered cars?

Apple scores top marks in green internet report Apple has received the highest score in Greenpeace's green energy and practices report on internet companies (TechCrunch). This is the third consecutive year that Apple has topped the charity's index, with an A grade, matched by Google and Facebook. Apple scored particularly well in the clean energy category, with 83 per cent of the electricity working its data centres coming from renewable sources. Facebook managed 67 per cent renewable energy and Google 56 per cent, with a strong performance in other categories. China's Baidu and Tencent, however, got an F grade, as did a number of South Korean firms including LG's technology services division.

Windows 10 is getting new privacy controls Microsoft has announced that Windows 10 users will be getting a new web-based privacy dashboard and updated local settings to help them control what information is shared with Microsoft (Ars Technica). Windows 10's somewhat opaque approach to user data and telemetry has been a key complaint among users since the operating system launched. However, while Microsoft is making the settings to control what data it sends home easier to find and is making them opt-in, rather than opt-out, it still won't be possible to entirely prevent Windows 10 from phoning home or to see exactly what data it's sending back. 3. Tesla swipes new Autopilot VP from Apple Tesla has revealed that its new vice president of Autopilot software will be former Apple staffer Chris Lattner (TechCrunch). Lattner was at Apple for 11 years, where he notably designed the approachable Swift programming language. Lattner's wide-ranging expertise in software development puts him in a good position to help the company complete its autonomous driving software now that all the requisite hardware is in place in its cars. Tesla said that "we are very excited that Chris is joining Tesla to lead our Autopilot engineering team and accelerate the future of autonomous driving." 4. Online messaging services face new restrictions on tracking The European Commission has proposed new legislation to ensure the stronger privacy of individuals when it comes to using online messaging services including WhatsApp, iMessage and Gmail (WIRED). Věra Jourová, Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality said the new strategy will “facilitate international data exchanges in the global digital economy and promote high data protection standards worldwide.” Under the proposal, tech companies including Google and Facebook will have to guarantee the confidentiality of their customers’ conversations and make sure to get their consent before tracking them online, something that is used to serve customers with personalised ads.

Apple's latest patent suggests an all-screen iPhone Apple has been granted a patent for "electronic devices having displays with openings" - in other words, a phone with hardware mounting points built into the display itself (Apple Insider). The design notes and diagrams suggest that the display panel would occupy the phone's entire face, incorporating speakers and other components. While there's no guarantee that any given patent will make it to a real device, it confirms previous leaks suggesting that the 2017 iPhone will be " a clear piece of glass". 6. Biologist Twitter has put together a Who's Who of the flatulent animal kingdom Having already identified the animal kingdom's best beards, the biologists of Twitter have turned their expertise to answering one of nature enthusiasts' most important questions: does it fart? (Popular Science) The conversation originated when conservation researcher Dani Rabaiotti asked biologist David Steen whether snakes fart. This rapidly spawned a surprisingly comprehensive Google Sheet dedicated to the topic, packed with intriguing - if largely uncited - tidbits such as the observation that sea anemones don't fart but suffer "awful burps" and that orangutans "do it often and have no shame". And yes, for the record, snakes do indeed fart. 7. LinkedIn and Ebay founders donate $20 million to ethical AI fund LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and Ebay founder Pierre Omidyar’s nonprofit group have each contributed $10 million to a new fund intended to prevent the development of artificial intelligence applications that could harm society (Recode). The fund, which has a total value of $27 million, is being administered by MIT’s Media Lab and Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, and will sponsor research into how socially responsible artificial intelligence can be designed to ensure fairness when they are used in fields ranging from education to criminal justice. MIT Media Lab director Joi Ito said that "one of the most critical challenges is how do we make sure that the machines we ‘train’ don’t perpetuate and amplify the same human biases that plague society."

Video: Elon Musk wants better storytelling from video games In newly released outtake footage from a an interview with Y Combinator's Sam Altman, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk sings the praises of Blizzard's Overwatch and laments the lack of quality storytelling in modern games (TechCrunch) Comparing Deus Ex: Mankind Divided with the seminal design of Warren Spector's original games in the series and contemporary titles, Musk observers that in earlier games "the graphics and sound were terrible, so they had to rely on storytelling". Musk also plays Hearthstone, having been turned onto it by his kids. 10.

An AppleInsider report said that according to a patent filed by the company for ‘electronic devices having displays with openings’, Apple is working on processes to mount components behind small holes in a smartphone screen. Interestingly, the holes will be so tiny that a normal human eye cannot see it. What this technology will do is that it will allow manufacturers to build a device with a true edge-to-edge display on the front. Components will be mounted, aligned to the openings in the display and they can be connected in more ways than one. There might a seperate place designated to connect with the device. Notably, the main electronic components which can be attached are anything which uses light, like a camera or a sensor or an indicator or maybe a secondary display which has display pixels. The opening will allow a passage to the signals, including acoustic and electromagnetic, related to the components. Also, according to DigiTimes, Sources from Apple’s supply line in Taiwan, have said that the company has decided to bypass its main manufacturer Foxconn in order to get forged stainless steel iPhone frames from another supplier Jabil. It will also be between the front and back end glass panels. Earlier, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Apple was speculated to be changing the design and the specifications of the iPhone 8 drastically. While rumours such as these have been in the air for a while now, it was reported a few weeks ago that Apple might just ditch the LCD panel for an OLED display. Watch This: The Wall Street Journal had pointed out that the Cupertino tech giant has asked its suppliers to speed up the production of OLED and provide better OLED screens than that of Samsung. The report states that since the OLED displays are a lot more expensive, the already high priced iPhones might also carry a much higher price tag. There were further suggestions that the latest iPhone 8 could feature the introduction of wireless charging. Ming-Chi Kuo of the KGI Securities had speculated that the iPhone 8 users would be able to charge their device in a manner similar to that of Apple watches, which would also provide faster-charging speeds. Kuo also says that the iPhone 8 would come in bezel-less OLED version and there could be a 5.8 version as the new flagship device. Apple is also reported to create the OIS feature standard in both the wide-angle lens and telephoto lens for the new iPhone 8. Please Wait while comments are loading...

But that wasn't always the plan — internally, Apple had different teams competing on different projects to find the best operating system for its new device. We got our first look at one of these systems last week, a click wheel prototype designed by Tony Fadell and his team, and known as P1. Now we've seen another: a very early version of the touchscreen operating system, codenamed P2, that would become iOS. The video above, recorded by Sonny Dickson, show P1 and P2 running next to each other. P1 — running what Dickson calls "AcornOS" — boots up faster than P2, but it's the second device that runs a more familiar operating system to modern iPhone users, albeit a very basic version. Giant blue icons appear on a white background, offering touchscreen options for calls, SMS, and "Other" — a menu that leads to Music, Network, and Preferences, among other choices. Other images shared by Dickson show further options, including a toggle for Airplane mode and a phone dial screen. The video shows a true touchscreen interface Where P1 was the work of "the father of the iPod," Tony Fadell, and his team, P2 was developed by a group led by Scott Forstall — the then-leader of Mac development within the company. As history has shown, Forstall's prototype won the competition between the teams inside Apple, leading to the creation of the first consumer version of iOS. As Dickson notes, these prototype devices were never meant to be seen outside of Apple's walls. But these early prototypes are also key elements of Apple's history, marking a fork in the road that helped make the iPhone Apple's most important product, and change the way we use smartphones.

Topping this criticism was a damning report from Consumer Reports, which cited inconsistent battery life as the reason for not giving the new MacBook Pro its ‘recommended’ tag. In the course of its testing, Consumer Reports (CR) noted that the MacBook Pro’s battery life varied between under 5 hours to over 19 hours. This inconsistency failed to impress CR. Apple, understandably puzzled by the widely varying results, approached CR to understand the test process and hunt out the cause for the variation in battery life. Apple’s investigations unearthed a bug in Safari’s (the default browser on macOS) developer mode which affected the test results. The mode specifically disables the browser cache and is enabled by CR as part of its test process. Apple says that this mode is not used by the average consumer and hence, will not affect the average user. Describing its test process, CR explains that it disables features like browser cache, automatic screen dimming, etc. to establish a reliable base line for battery performance. Following Apple’s findings, CR ran the tests again with caching off and found that battery life was now consistent. Apple has since published a patch to fix the issue, but it’s currently only available to subscribers to Apple’s Beta program. The fix will be released to the general public sometime later as part of a larger software update for macOS, says Apple. In a statement, Apple said, “This is the best pro notebook we’ve ever made, we respect Consumer Reports and we’re glad they decided to revisit their findings on the MacBook Pro.” CR has promised to report its findings once it finishes retesting the MacBook Pro.

ISSN 2330-717X Home News Opinion Analysis Business Social Religion Entertainment Environment Technology Health India’s Manufacturing Powerhouse: Threat To China? – OpEd Make in India logo. By S. Majumder* January 11, 2017 In a surprise revelation, a Chinese daily rang alarm for China’s manufacturing powerhouse to rally behind India. It warned of China  losing its competitive edge in manufacturing and and which could dent job opportunities in China. Foreign investors were already on the spree to dislocate their manufacturing activities to low cost countries. The target countries are India and Vietnam. In addition, US President-elect Donald Trump’s pledge to bring back jobs in USA will be double whammy for Chinese manufacturing activities, the Chinese daily warned. The recent decision of Apple for considering to set up manufacturing facilities in India after failing to retail due to tough domestic procurement rules and the exodus of Apple production chain, Foxconn, perked up concerns for loss of ten of thousand jobs in China. Foxconn is the contract manufacturer for Apple and is the world’s largest contract manufacturing company in electronic industry. Foxcon has decided to invest US $ 5 billion in India. If Apple expands in India, it may lure other tech giants in India and China is likely to face more transfer of supply chains in India, the Chinese daily apprehended. At a time when China’s manufacturing sectors are battling for overcapacity, concerns are rising for further loss of job, with the Chinese outbound investment on the rise. The recent decision of Chinese largest telecom company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to set up smart phone manufacturing plant in India perturbed the Chinese daily. It beaconed China’s loss of competitive edge and forecast India to be on the way to become the world’s new hub for manufacturing. Besides Huawei, a number of Chinese vendors are in the rally to set up their smart phones manufacturing plants in India. Vivo China has already set up a smart phone manufacturing unit in Greater Noida. Xiaomi , ZTE, One Plus, Gionee are in the queue to open their manufacturing shops in India. Chinese renewable energy firm Chint Group, chemical firm Sopo Group , Shanghai Electric Company and Ding Sen are among the firms looking for substantial investment in India. Chinese biggest industrial park developer CFLD looks to set up 10 industrial parks in India. Even the Indian electronic manufacturers and assemblers, who were solely dependent on import from China, are shifting their strategies of procurement due to high costs. Instead of importing from China , Indian firms forayed in establishing their own manufacturing operations in India. Havells , Godrej, Micromax (a handset manufacture), Bosch ( auto part maker ) have all started exploring manufacturing operations in India. The competition between India and China is centered on low labor cost and labour skill. India’s labour cost is one-third of China after the yuan appreciation. According to Boston survey, in 2014 average manufacturing labour cost in India was US $0.92 per hour, compared to US $ 3.5 per hour in China. China has an edge in skill over India. Even then, yawning difference in wage has a significant role in luring foreign investment, when the world is bogged down by frequent currency fluctuations. The global slump in export led China shifting the growth model from export to domestic demand base. This wobbled manufacturing activities in China. Growth of manufacturing production plunged to 6.8 percent in August 2016 from 11.3 percent in October 2013, according to Chinese National Bureau of Statistics. Number of private enterprises were reduced to 214 thousand in 2014 from 274 thousand in 2010. These sent China into the red zone for job opportunities. China is going to lay off 5-6 million workers in the next two to three years in the wake of overcapacity in the country. According to Chinese Minister for human resources and social security, China would lay off 1.8 million workers in coal and steel sectors. Further, unlike China, India’s high economic growth is sustainable because of its strong domestic demand. Nearly 65 percent of the GDP is engineered by domestic demand. The downturn in Chinese manufacturing provides opportunities to India. It revved up India’s manufacturing strength. Even though share of manufacture in India’s GDP is low – 15 percent against 30 percent in China, it has become the engine for the surge in GDP growth. India sustained the world highest GDP growth of 7 percent during the past two years. In 2015-16, manufacturing witnessed the highest growth of 9.3 percent in GDP , making a big leap from 5.5 percent in 2014-15. Even though misgivings shrouded over the statistical fudging, when it is compared with index of industrial production, which crawled to 2.4 percent growth, the Chinese and foreign investors brushed aside the fuss The undeterred foreign investors continued to flow their investment in India. Foreign investment spurred by 67 percent over the two years period of Modi government. Of these, investment in manufacturing was highest with 65 percent share. Chinese nervousness of losing its manufacturing edge was unveiled when China introduced Made in China campaign , immediately after Made in India. “Make in India” and “Made in China” evoked similar sound. But, conceptually they are different. While “Make in India” was a call to establish world’s biggest manufacturing hub and increase share of manufacturing in GDP from 15 percent to 25 percent, “Made in China” was to re- built China’s manufacturing sector into a qualitative workshop with production of more Hi-tech products. So far China’s manufacturing sector served as turf for volume production. Make in India steered a fierce competition between India and China. Growth of mobile telephone industry is a case in point. India’s mobile telephone industry made a landmark shift from import to domestic base production industry. Until two years ago, a few were manufacturing mobile phones in India, after Nokia closed down its factory in Sriperumbudur in Tamilnadu. Today, there is a spurt in domestic production. It meets 45 percent of the mobile demand in the country. India produced 100 million mobile phones in 2015, against 64 million mobile phones in 2014- triggering a growth by eighty percent within a year. Import from China plunged by over 25 percent during the past two years. *S. Majumder, Adviser, Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), New Delhi. Views are personal.

Kuo has predicted that the 12.9-inch iPad Pro will be the second generation to the current iPad Pro, with the 10-inch model featuring a narrow bezel design, while both will feature Apple’s A10X chip. The cheaper 9-inch iPad will purportedly feature the A9 chip and will be a lower-cost option.
