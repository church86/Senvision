 It's going to be an uphill slog for Apple Wolf Richter, Wolf Street Oct. 13, 2016, 6:42 PM 3,827 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Images/Chip Somodevilla Worldwide PC shipments fell 3.9% in the third quarter from a year ago, according to IDC, thus continuing the long methodical decline of the entire ecosystem. But beneath the surface: shipments of the boring uncool brands rose worldwide and soared in the US, as shipments of cool Macs plunged. Grave injustice? Or just sign or our commoditized times and channel stuffing? Despite predictions of the sector’s death, these machines – desktops, workstations, and notebooks of all kinds, but not servers and tablets – are still the workhorses in the office environment, and their death is going to arrive only slowly and in fits and starts. Lenovo, which in 2004 bought IBM’s PC division, is still the market leader, with a 21.3% share. But its global shipments fell 3.2%; it has growth trouble in China, its home market, where it does much of its business. For Lenovo, Q3 was the sixth quarter in a row of year-over-year declines. But second and third in line, HP and Dell, increased their market share, as their global shipments rose 3.3% and 6.2% respectively. For the fifth in line, Taiwanese-based Asus, shipments jumped 6.9%. The real losers: Apple Mac shipments plunged 13% and “others” plunged 13.2% year-over-year. Excluding Apple and “Others” (marked in red in the table), shipments by the remaining top four vendors rose 2% to 44.3 million units. The top three now command 58% of the global market: WolfStreet And this is what happened in the US. Apple Mac shipments plunged 13%, and shipments of “Others” plunged 19.8%, while shipments of the top three brands soared a combined 9.5%, with Dell and Lenovo picking up double-digit gains. These top three vendors now command 71% of the US market. Total US shipments rose 1.7% to 17.6 million units: WolfStreet But even for the winners, it’s not exactly a rosy scenario. The shipment gains are based on building up inventories, as hopes are now circulating for a huge holiday season particularly in the US. And a buildup of inventories is deemed essential to satisfy this sudden surge in expected demand. This is a change, after a long struggle to reduce bloated inventories, which caused the steeper shipment declines over the past year or so. But if the holiday season is not huge, and if the hopes that are circulating turn out to be false hopes once again, the period of trying to bring down bloated inventories will recommence, along with even sharper shipment declines. The report: [W]e believe the strong market performance has less to do with strengthening demand and more to do with increased appetite from the channel for inventory. We will need a strong holiday season to ensure that we don’t enter 2017 in a poor inventory situation. So classic channel stuffing in the hope that demand will somehow materialize and mop up that ballooning inventory. The fourth quarter will be key. And IDC maintains its “cautious outlook.” By Region: Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) PC shipments were stronger than forecast thanks to healthy notebook sales, while desktop sales were very much in line with the forecast. The buildup of expectations towards the year-end business (e.g. mobility adoption) and holiday season promotions like Black Friday, combined with the anticipation of price increases related to some components, pushed the volumes up in the region for notebook. The Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan) PC market came in slightly above expectations, although it remained constrained with shipments declining year on year. Efforts to reduce channel inventory continued, allowing for stronger than expected sell-in in China, while the upcoming festive season led to a sequentially higher consumer quarter in India. Several corporate projects that were rolled out across the region, coupled with stronger demand from business users in China, helped alleviate the decline in otherwise soft commercial markets. The Japan PC market returned to positive growth in the third quarter, stabilizing after a substantial drop in 2015. Demand for Windows 7 systems remained a key driver as companies still using the OS purchased systems ahead of price increases. This leaves Apple Macs as the biggest loser, worldwide and in the US. Apple is going to come out with some updated and even cooler PCs. Everyone is hoping that they will be a big hit. But the PC market has been commoditized years ago, and cool doesn’t really matter anymore. What matters is price and functionality. And it’s going to be an uphill slog for Macs. Thank God for the iPhone and for the fiasco that has befallen Samsung with its exploding Note 7 smartphones, which its owners are now told to turn off. Mac sales accounted for only 12% of Apple’s total sales of $42.4 billion in the last quarter, and that share will likely fall further, as Apple continues with its transition to a company dominated by just one product. Blame the Millennials? They certainly get blamed for everything else. Read the original article on Wolf Street. Copyright 2016. Follow Wolf Street on Twitter.

Bay Area firm Bohlin Cywinski Jackson established the company’s signature design style in the early ‘00s, but the responsibility for maintaining and updating Apple’s look has in recent years fallen to London-based Pritzker Prize-winning architect Norman Foster’s studio, Foster + Partners (the firm is hard at work designing a UFO-like new headquarters for Apple in Cupertino, California, which looks pretty cool in this drone video). Apple’s store in central London, which sits behind an impressive, Grade II-listed Neoclassical facade, (the company’s first to open in the English capital when it arrived in 2004) just got a facelift as part of that baton passing, with Foster + Partners creating a more open, airy space by excising a mezzanine level that once snaked along the outer edge of the store. Now, the store has a tripartite arrangement, with three spaces for disparate functions including seating (called “the Avenue” and meant to mimic a public throughway); “the Forum,” an area for events; and “the Boardroom,” a space for Apple retail employees to provide trainings and other services.

Cook tells the outlet that his team is “high on AR in the long run” and he believes the technology can be “huge.” His latest comments echo those from previous interviews, including one from August with The Washington Post. He said at that time that Apple is very bullish on AR and is doing a lot of things with the tech behind the curtain. From today’s BuzzFeed interview: “There’s no substitute for human contact,” Cook told BuzzFeed News. “And so you want the technology to encourage that.” It’s not the first time Cook has indicated that Apple might favor AR. “We are high on AR for the long run,” Cook said during an earnings call this past summer. “I think AR can be huge.” Huge, indeed — one could look to the sudden and explosive success of Pokemon Go to see an immediate real-world example. […] “VR, I think, has some interesting applications, but I don’t think it’s a broad-based technology like AR,” Cook explained. “Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it’s profound. We might … have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here, right? And so I think that things like these are better when they’re incorporated without becoming a barrier to our talking. … You want the technology to amplify it, not to be a barrier.” There’s a stack of evidence to back up Cook’s claims that Apple is betting big on AR, including high profile hirings, acquisitions and patent applications. And given how hot VR is right now, it’ll be interesting to see how this unfolds.

Electrocardiograph methods have been in (basic) use for over a century, but even today, they're not really practical for use outside of a medical practice. Hooking electrodes up to the skin is somewhat impractical for day-to-day use, to put it mildly. That means that fitness trackers promising heartrate monitoring have to make compromises. While some offer support for chest straps to measure the heartbeat directly, most of them plump for optical heart rate sensors. These work by illuminating the capillaries in the wrist with an LED light, while an adjacent sensor measures the frequency at which blood flows underneath the skin, giving you an estimated rate at which the heart is pumping blood. That's the intent anyway – a compromise solution based on the practicalities of fashion and technology – but how accurate are they? The Cleveland Clinic has just published a study of four fitness trackers which provides some interesting reading for fitness fans. The researchers took four fitness trackers (the Apple Watch, Fitbit Charge HR, Mio Fuse and the Basis Peak) and measured their results against a chest strap and an EKG on 50 healthy adults at rest, walking and running on a treadmill. In all, they recorded 1,773 heart rate readings across all the devices, with readings ranging from between 49 and 200bpm. Overall, the chest strap was almost as good as the EKG, measuring 99% accuracy, which isn't too surprising as both technologies work the same way, capturing electrical activity directly from the heart. Things dropped off for the commercial fitness bands, but it was the Apple Watch that maintained the most accuracy, managing around 91%, beating the Mio Fuse by a nose. The Fitbit Charge HR and Basis Peak had around 84% and 83% accuracy, respectively.   The reduced accuracy of wrist based tracking isn't surprising to study co-author Dr Gordon Blackburn, director of cardiac rehabilitation at the Cleveland Clinic. “You need to have good contact between the photosensing cells; as a person is exercising more vigorously, there's more bounce, so you may lose some of that contact,” he explained. However that's not to say that wearables shouldn't be consulted anymore, but perhaps take it with a pinch of salt – especially at higher activity levels. “What we really noticed was all of the devices did not a bad job at rest for being accurate for their heart rate, but as the activity intensity went up, we saw more and more variability,” said Blackburn. “At the higher levels of activity, some of the wrist technology was not accurate at all.” The moral of the story is that if you're serious about measuring your heart rate, it might be time to consider a chest strap.

"It taste like apple juice," said Mason Hagen, 4, of Davison, after biting into a Jonathan apple Thursday, Oct. 13, for the Michigan Apple Crunch Day. Applewood Estate invited the public to participate in the fourth annual Michigan Apple Crunch Day while educating the community about the orchard and Michigan produce. The event offered different stations for groups to taste different types of apples and learn about them while exploring the grounds. Michigan is the third largest producer of apples in the country. Apple Crunch Day began as a way to help share Michigan's agriculture heritage with the local community.  "It is so important for kids and anyone to know where food comes from...and helping people know what grows locally," said Renee Saba, education and events coordinator at Applewood Estate.  Most Read Find Local Homes for Sale Apartments Car Dealers Used Cars Jobs Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries Active Discussions Get the latest updates Subscribe to our newsletters Like MLive on Facebook Follow MLive on Twitter About Us MLive Media Group Our Team Advertise Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Jobs at MLive Subscriptions Newspaper | Digital Editions | eNewsletters The Ann Arbor News The Bay City Times The Flint Journal The Grand Rapids Press Jackson Citizen Patriot Kalamazoo Gazette Muskegon Chronicle The Saginaw News MLive Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Apartment Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Business Resource Center Your Regional News Pages Ann Arbor Bay City Detroit Flint Grand Rapids Jackson Kalamazoo Lansing Muskegon Saginaw Mobile Mobile apps | Tablet apps More on MLive Photos Video Weather Post a job Post a free classified ad Sell your car Sell/Rent your home Apartments and Rentals Site Map Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | YouTube Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 MLive Media Group.

October 13 AAPL: 116.98 -0.36 Apple begins selling unlocked, SIM-free iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus in the U.S. Chance Miller - 1 month ago @ChanceHMiller Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 went on sale nearly a month ago from carriers and on installment plans, but customers interested in purchasing a SIM-free model were forced to wait. That wait is now over, though, as Apple has started selling the SIM-free iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus on its online store. Now, when you go to the iPhone purchase page, you’ll see a new option in addition to the existing Sprint, T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon, and iPhone Upgrade Program. Customers can now choose to purchase an iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus without a SIM card at full retail price. As Apple notes on its webpage, purchasing a SIM-free iPhone means that there’s no contract commitment or carrier financing. Instead, customers can go to the carrier of their choice and pick up a nano-SIM card, assuming that the iPhone supports the wireless bands of the carrier. Apple notes of the following network compatibility on its website: AT&T and T-Mobile The iPhone for AT&T and T-Mobile does not support CDMA and will not work on Sprint or Verizon Wireless. It will use 3G cellular technology for voice services and either 3G or 4G LTE cellular technology for data services. However, the iPhone for AT&T and T-Mobile can roam internationally on many GSM carriers around the world. Sprint, Verizon Wireless, and SIM-free If Sprint or Verizon Wireless is your wireless carrier, your iPhone will work on AT&T and T-Mobile once activated. The SIM-free iPhone will work with any carrier. An iPhone activated on Sprint or Verizon Wireless, and the SIM-free iPhone, also have the ability to roam internationally on GSM networks. International Roaming All iPhone models are world phones, so you can use them almost anywhere. Which means you can roam internationally on GSM networks in over 200 countries around the world, whether you are a GSM or CDMA network customer. Availability of LTE data varies in some countries and depends on carrier support for certain LTE radio frequencies.  For details on LTE network support, please see www.apple.com/iphone/LTE. As far as availability goes, the iPhone 7 has faster shipping times than the Plus model does, though the Jet Black variant is still hard to come by in either size. Pricing for the variants is below: iPhone 7 32GB – $649 128GB – $749 256GB – $849 iPhone 7 Plus 32GB – $769 128GB – $869 256GB – $969 Head over to Apple’s online store to order an unlocked and SIM-free iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

For most Fili­pino families, the most-anticipated Christmas tradition is the Noche Buena meal. It’s when we gather as families, give thanks for the year’s blessings, and share both food and fond memories. The Manila Times joined San Miguel Pure Foods Culinary Center on October 6 as they hosted “Nostalgia: Holiday Cooking with Celebrity Moms,” a cooking demo and dinner event featuring moms Angeline Dantes—mother of leading actor Dindong Dantes, Maria Victoria “Chupsie” Medina—mother of Ping, Alex, Carl, and Victor Medina, and Rina Casiño—mother of young heartthrob Albie Casiño. Together, they reminisced on family Christmases and shared treasured recipes their children—today among the country’s top actors—grew up with. Freshly baked artisan rolls paired with Rina’s cheese pimiento spread and butter compound welcomed guests. The main feast started with Chupsie’s chicken molo soup and Angeline’s Russian potato salad. The main course included Angeline’s meatloaf complemented by the Culinary Center chefs’ Coq au Vin (chicken in wine), oven-baked fish, tender roast beef, and creamy eggplant moussaka. The meal ended on a sweet note with Rina’s signature apple cinnamon crumble loaf topped with ice cream classic vanilla flavor. The moms also shared their cherished traditions during Christmas holidays. Angeline Dantes, like all mothers, is the light of her family. A mom to three girls and two boys, she was exposed to cooking at an early age, when she would go to the wet market with her mother then watch her cook. But it wasn’t until she became a mother herself that she really took cooking to heart. To celebrate Christmas, she gathers everyone—her kids, their spouses, their spouses’ families—at their home to make sure everyone is present and no one is in a hurry to leave. Meat loaf by Angeline Dantes “Since I want all my children together and three of them are married, I invite all the in-laws so they don’t have to divide their time because way back, when they were small, I used to divide my time. I stayed at until quarter to 12 in my family and then I rush to my in-laws so I said I don’t want to experience that anymore. So I prepare a lot and I invite all of the in-laws of my kids so we can spend Christmas Eve together,” Dantes told the press. Medina meanwhile learned to cook from her mother, whom she watched in the kitchen during weekends. As soon as she was able to handle cutleries and the stovetop, she immediately tried her hand at cooking, even going to the market to buy fresh ingredients. Today, she has a wide range of recipes under her belt and has even self-studied baking. She also attends classes to be up-to-date with the latest ingredients and techniques. “Basically my mom usually brought us to the market. She said that every girl should learn how to cook and then she’d give me tips on what meat to buy; how to look at fish to know if it’s fresh, chicken, pork, different cuts. She tell me what the cuts should be for, so basically my culinary [skill]is influenced by my mom but eventually, when I got married, I read a lot of books and magazines too,” Medina shared. Their annual holiday spread varies from year to year, depending on the family’s mood or the current food trends. This year, Chupsie is toying with the idea of preparing salted egg prawns, following this year’s trend on salted egg dishes. Their menu constantly evolves, but classics such as chicken molo soup, ham, and queso de bola always make an appearance on the table. On the other hand, Casiño started out as a working mom, but when Albie’s career took off, she decided that her main focus would be on being a mother. As her sons grew older and became more independent, she also found more time to try her hand at cooking new dishes. “I am just in my first year into baking. I started with my cheese pimiento and then I made it into a business. My grandmother is my biggest influence in my baking journey. My mom doesn’t bake. The only thing she does is the Russian potato salad and that’s only twice a year,” Casiño said. “I’m the one who really cooks at home. Even if we have helpers, my children really want my cooking. And then when I started baking, my husband took over the kitchen,” she added. During the holidays, she said that she and her husband take the lead in the kitchen. Every year, her husband makes his well-loved red pasta while she would bake sweet desserts like apple cinnamon crumble loaf. Share.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Now you can stream Facebook video to your TV Chris Davies - Oct 13, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Facebook has been doubling-down on streaming lately, pushing election debates and more to its addicted audience, and now the social network is adding casting support to your TV. The update allows Facebook to hook up wirelessly to one of a number of set-top boxes or dongles – including Apple TV and Chromecast – and it works both from the mobile app and the browser. The goal, Facebook says, is to broaden the number of ways you can watch video content shared by your friends on the service. Of course, given the increasing controversy over the US election process, plenty of those videos might be to do with Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. Still, there should be a fair number of cat clips too, or the short cookery tutorials that appear to have taken Facebook by storm in recent months. Whatever the video, the process to cast them will be the same. You’ll need either an Apple TV or a Google Chromecast initially, and for the moment either Facebook in the browser on your PC or Mac, or on an iOS device. Soon, Facebook says, it’ll support casting from Android devices to Chromecast as well. When you’re watching a video you want to stream to your TV, there’ll be a TV symbol in the top right corner. Tapping that will bring up a list of devices that support casting; picking one will automatically connect with it, and the selected video should resume on your TV. It supports both prerecorded clips and Facebook Live videos. While casting is taking place, meanwhile, the same device that’s hosting the stream can be used to browse through the Facebook news feed. It also works as a way to control what clip is played next. Comments and reactions to Facebook Live videos are shown on-screen, and casting viewers will be able to react themselves from their device. Obviously wireless video casting isn’t new – Apple has been doing it for some time with AirPlay, and Google with its Cast technology. Now, though, it’s another sign of Facebook’s intention to break out of the browser or app, and expand to another in-demand display in the home. While average TV watching time may have been eaten into by smartphone and tablet use, it’s still a significant part of daily life for many. NOW READ: How Facebook plans to supercharge the Internet Of course, at the same time it also gives Facebook another opportunity to boost its video audience metrics. Those took a hit in September, when the social network admitted that it had inflated them to advertisers. Zuckerberg’s company confessed it had been working out its average viewing time numbers based on videos that had been watched for more than three seconds. Footage seen for less than that time was ignored, artificially pushing the average up. Facebook said that it had corrected the error in calculation, and that no advertisers had been overcharged.

October 13 AAPL: 116.98 -0.36 Tim Cook again praises augmented reality, says there’s ‘no substitute for human contact’ Chance Miller - 1 month ago @ChanceHMiller Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit In a new interview with BuzzFeed News, Apple CEO Tim Cook has delved deeper into his thoughts concerning virtual reality and augmented reality. Cook has touched on these areas before and in today’s interview, Cook again seems to favor the latter of the two technologies… In the interview, Cook explains that there’s “no substitute for human contact,” again hinting that the Apple CEO favors augmented reality over virtual reality. These comments aren’t all that surprising considering Apple’s history of acquisitions in the field, as well as comments Cook has made before. “There’s no substitute for human contact,” Cook told BuzzFeed News. “And so you want the technology to encourage that.” Additionally, Cook explains that while he thinks virtual reality has some interesting applications, he doesn’t believe that it will be a “broad-based technology.” On the other hand, Cook believes that augmented is something that is “profound,” though it may take some time to get right. The ultimate benefit in Cook’s mind is that AR would amplify human contact, not be a barrier like VR would. “VR, I think, has some interesting applications, but I don’t think it’s a broad-based technology like AR,” Cook explained. “Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it’s profound. We might … have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here, right? And so I think that things like these are better when they’re incorporated without becoming a barrier to our talking. … You want the technology to amplify it, not to be a barrier.” BuzzFeed News also claims that Apple has recently been holding meetings with immersive content companies such as Jaunt, a cinematic virtual reality company. Cook has long expressed his favorability towards AR, noting during an Apple earnings call that he sees Apple as being in the AR race for the “long run.” Cook also recently touched on the area during a question and answer event at the Utah Tech Tour. While Apple hasn’t been very public about what exactly it’s planning with augmented reality, it’s clear that the company has a vested interest in the technology. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

A bike valet has also been arranged to be at the main entrance. Cox Orange Pippin, one of the apples for tasting at the UBC Apple Festival this weekend. NICK PROCAYLO / PROVINCE The success of the festival has undoubtedly something to do with the enduring image of the apple as a symbol of all that is good and wholesome and virtuous. We don’t need to be Cezanne to see that an apple in a bowl is an object of undeniable beauty; the shape and colour and size all combined in exquisite design to present a classic form of Plato-envisioned perfection. We all know very well the proverbial truth of the apple’s power to keep the doctor away. And we also recognize the apple as forbidden fruit, a delicacy too sweet for Adam to resist, and we have heard stories of quests for golden apples in fairy tales and heroic myths. Hey, even the Beatles picked the beauty of an apple as the image for their record company. Love, love, love the apple. Malus domestica is easily the world’s most popular fruit. Today, there are more than 7,500 cultivars in existence, with more than 60 million tonnes being grown commercially worldwide each year, mostly by China, followed by the U.S., Turkey, Russia, Italy and India. WHAT, WHERE, WHEN What: 25th annual Apple Festival Where: University of B.C. Botanical Garden, 6804 Southwest Marine Drive, Vancouver. When: Oct. 15 and 16 from 11 am to 4 pm Admission: $5 for adults, free for children under 12.  More information: Go to botanicalgarden.ubc.ca or call 604.822.452 swhysall@postmedia.com twitter.com/stevewhysall   Meditative flute coming to Vancouver (video) 'Waste of farmland' sign rises on Tsawwassen band land Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

October 13 AAPL: 116.98 -0.36 2017 BMW 5 Series Sedan to be first car with wireless CarPlay built-in, coming in February Chance Miller - 1 month ago @ChanceHMiller CarPlay View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit BMW today announced in a press release that the 2017 BMW 5 Series Sedan will be the first car to hit market and support wireless CarPlay. The 5 Series Sedan will begin hitting the road around the world in February 2017. According to the press release put out today, iPhone users will be able to wireless connect to the BMW iDrive system and access the CarPlay interface with that wireless connection. “BMW is the first carmaker to integrate Apple CarPlay without any cables at all,” it touts. And smartphone integration has been further improved – from Apple CarPlay (which, in a first for a carmaker, has been incorporated fully wirelessly), to inductive phone charging and the WiFi hotspot for up to ten devices. BMW is the first carmaker to integrate Apple CarPlay without any cables at all. Wireless CarPlay first appeared with iOS 9, but no car has been able to take advantage of the feature until now. It was reported earlier this year that Volkswagen had planned to demo its wireless CarPlay integration at CES, but Apple stopped it at the last minute. Seeing that BMW is now planning to release the first car with wireless CarPlay, it’d be interesting to know what happened to VW’s plans. Wireless CarPlay will allow for a much more seamless experience for iPhone users. No longer will they be required to connect their phones via a Lightning cable in order to access CarPlay. In turn, this would presumably increase the number of CarPlay users as a good portion of drivers simply use Bluetooth in their vehicle and don’t bother with cables. The BMW 5 Series Sedan will begin hitting the streets in February of 2017. It’s unclear at this point if wireless CarPlay is included at the base tier or if it will be an update, but we wouldn’t be surprised if there’s an extra charge associated with it. In the meantime, if you’re looking to add CarPlay support to your existing vehicle, a variety of third-party head units exist at a wide array of price points.   Guides CarPlay View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Skip to main content Apple Valley Review Main menu Home Arrest Logs Classifieds Community Events Contact Us Opinion Roy's 100th You are here Home Learning town history at tour, 'shindig' October 13, 2016 Apple Valley Legacy Museum hosting Shindig at the Museum after inn tour By L.J. Gambone For the Apple Valley Review Although the Town of Apple Valley was officially incorporated in 1988, it’s rich history dates back centuries. The area was first inhabited by Native American tribes, such as the Shoshone and Paiute. In the late 1770s, California’s Spanish Mission founder Father Francisco Garces spent time in the area. And in the 1800s, Apple Valley was explored by Spanish gold seekers. During the early part of the 20th century, apple orchard owner Max Ihmsen brought further recognition to the town after winning numerous agricultural awards. From the 1940s through ‘60s, the Historic Apple Valley Inn on Highway 18 became a popular place for celebrities such as Bob Hope, Marilyn Monroe and John Wayne to hang out. While the apple orchards and Indian tribes have disappeared, the Apple Valley Inn still stands as a historical treasure. Most recently, the Apple Valley Legacy Museum began offering tours of the property in order to give locals and out-of-town visitors a chance to experience all it has to offer. The next tour will begin at 3:30 p.m. on Thursday. According to Marcella Taylor, founder of the Apple Valley Legacy Museum, the tour will include all of the inn's interior rooms, outside grounds and vintage barber shop. The cost is $10. “We will only be able to accommodate about 60 people, so tickets must be purchased prior to the event,” said Taylor. “This is an incredible opportunity to see the whole place and learn about its magnificent history. “The owners of the inn, Leor and Sarah Lakritz, are doing a wonderful thing by opening up the property for this kind of unique experience.” According to Taylor, the tour will be followed by another event at the old Bob Hope Cottage #153 called Shindig at the Museum at 5 p.m. Admission to Shindig at the Museum is free and does not require a ticket for the tour. Food will be provided by Old Town Dogs and served by Roy Rogers’ nephew David O’Dell for $5 or $10 a plate. There will also be line dancing and live music from High Desert Jammers. The nonprofit Legacy Museum is a sister project to the Legacy Trail effort, according to Taylor. Museum admission is free and made possible by the support of the High Desert Community Foundation. Visitors will find vintage postcards, news articles, photos, books and other historical items that have been donated by local residents and/or organizations.

More than 75% of New Zealand’s EFTPOS machines are on the Paymark network and as long as the machine has contactless capability, Paymark retailers can now accept payment via Apple Pay. Apple has introduced Apple Pay to the New Zealand market in conjunction with ANZ so customers of New Zealand’s largest bank can now use Apple’s secure payments environment to host their card details and make payments without needing to carry their card. For Paymark’s CEO Mark Rushworth this is a step forward on the journey to a post-plastic world. "Customers tell us they want to ditch their wallets in favour of using their phones. Apple Pay is the leading provider of such capability in the US market, where three out of every four contactless transactions are delivered via Apple Pay and we’re delighted to play a part in bringing this ability to New Zealand." More than 20% of the Paymark fleet of EFTPOS machines can already accept contactless card payments giving Apple Pay users the ability to pay via their iPhone or Apple Watch around the country. "Retailers who already have a contactless machine don’t have to do anything in order to receive payment via Apple Pay - it’s already part of the Paymark EFTPOS standard." Contactless transactions now account for more than 12% of all transactions on the Paymark network and that figure is growing quickly as more New Zealanders move to contactless.

The restaurant is located at 101st Street and Sheridan Road. ROSSY GILLE for GTR Newspapers Chicken fried steak! Burgers by the score! Open-faced roast beef sandwiches! Breakfast served all day. Apple pie ala mode! Berry tarts! The new Apple Barrel restaurant that fills the old Arvest Bank at 101st Street and Sheridan Avenue would do Route 66 dining mainstays proud. It is all-American cooking at its best. But no lamb, which may seem strange because where its owner grew up, lamb was a common in the diet. “I imagine it’s beef now,” says Owner Simon Khatib, “but when I was growing up in Damascus, lamb was the favorite.” How did a Syrian steeped in the cuisine of the Middle East wind up selling bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches in Tulsa? “I wasn’t forced to leave Syria. The Syria I grew up in wasn’t a battleground but a beautiful country where Muslims and Christians co-existed peacefully. It was certainly an open society compared to, say, Saudi Arabia.” But Simon’s older brother had gone to America to get an education, moved into the food business, and wound up owning restaurants in a place that, for a Syrian, must have had an exotic and foreign sound: Oklahoma. “I came to Tulsa 27 years ago to help my brother,” says Khatib. “He taught me everything I know about the restaurant business. After a few years with him, I felt I could strike out on my own.” The restaurant business wasn’t the only adventure he undertook. In his trips back to Syria to visit his family, he met Rida. They corresponded, more trips followed, and ultimately they married. She has since been at his side throughout his restaurant ventures. “I opened my first restaurant on Peoria Avenue in 1996. It was a sort of a fast-food outlet that specialized in fresh foods. It was successful, but I opened it with a partner and I never really felt I had full control over what went on so ultimately I sold it and went looking for my own place.” Khatib’s journey into the gastronomic wilderness ended in a small restaurant near East 151st Street and Memorial Avenue in Bixby. He gave it a good American name, the Apple Barrel, and frankly admits that he started off with pretty much the menu of the previous restaurant. “As we progressed, I began to experiment and add my own touches to the food. Now, what we serve is entirely to my standards.” Those standards, he says, emphasize freshness. “A lot of restaurants buy food that has been pre-breaded; they plop it into a fryer and it comes out tasting like everyone else’s meat. Our food is breaded with our own special recipe, and it gives us our unique flavor.” The Bixby restaurant, Khatib says, was a success from the get-go. It was so successful that he was encouraged to try a second location in Broken Arrow. “That one is at 3806 S. Elm in a shopping center sat well off the street. We were worried that we might be too far off the street, but our customers seem to have found us.” With Apple Barrel restaurants succeeding in Bixby and Broken Arrow, Khatib turned to Jenks as a likely target for a third restaurant. “I couldn’t find a spot in Jenks, but this empty old bank in south Tulsa is close enough to the general location that I wanted, so I took it. You really know within six months if a location will work, but so far our reception has been excellent.” What is the hardest part of opening a new restaurant? “Staffing,” Khatib responds. “Some of the people in the Bixby restaurant have been with me from the beginning. A few from the other restaurants are here in this new location but it takes time to get a smoothly-working, harmonious team. I’m pleased with what we have now, but I’m always looking for more.” The restaurant business is a time-consuming one; the Khatibs work seven days a week. Restaurant hours are 7 a.m.-9 p.m. every day except on Sunday, when they close at 3 p.m. Even when they’re off on a rare vacation, they’re working. “When I go to a restaurant and I order chicken, I’m thinking what spices or herbs would make it even better and if it would be a good addition to our restaurant.” Khatib, who with his wife has long been a naturalized American citizen, doesn’t think his story is unusual. A citizen from across the ocean makes a trip to these shores, starts a business, marries, has two sons and thrives. That’s a tale as American as apple pie.

Fall is in the air, and Northern Michigan orchards are busy harvesting bushels of fresh, ripe apples in preparation for the 38th Annual Apple Festival, taking place in downtown Charlevoix this weekend. More than 30 types of apples will be available, as well as other fall harvest items. The apple festival includes fun for the entire family, including the apple fest arts and craft show, kid's activities, a family fun run, fall color cruises and guided mushroom home tours. The Hotel Frankfort will be hosting a murder mystery dinner on October 28 and 29, titled "A Knight of Murder." Guests are invited to celebrate the marriage of Baron Bartholomew and Lady Diana, but will find themselves at the scene of the crime, and work to find the culprit and clear your own name. Tickets for the evening are just $35 each and include dinner. Register early to get your choice of character for the evening! On Friday, October 28, Petoskey will promote its ghostly history with a progressive dinner throughout local haunted establishments. Learn about the crying toddler, the employee who fell in love with a ghostly visitor, the mysterious fan, the woman in the wall, and much more, as you treat yourself to good eats in Petoskey's very haunted downtown. Appetizers will be at Stafford's Perry Hotel, entree at City Park Grill and dessert at Jesperson's. The dinner will last approximately three hours.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Control Your Smarthome Devices with Siri on the Apple TV Who needs Alexa when you have Siri? tvOS 10 allows you to control your various smarthome devices from the Apple TV using just your voice. Here’s how to take advantage of such a feature and control your home without even busting out your smartphone. RELATED ARTICLES 17 Things You Can Do with Siri on the New Apple TV What Is Apple HomeKit? Before you can use Siri on the Apple TV to control your smarthome devices, you first need to make sure that these devices are compatible with Apple’s HomeKit platform and that HomeKit is officially set up on said devices. Most smarthome devices will include HomeKit in the initial setup process when you go to install them for the first time, but if not, there’s usually a place in the settings where you can set up HomeKit after the installation. This process involves scanning a code on the back of the device using your iPhone. Once your smarthome devices are set up and HomeKit is ready to go on these devices, you can begin controlling them using Siri on the Apple TV (or any other Apple device for that matter). To do this, simply start by pressing and holding down the Siri button on your Apple TV remote. While holding the Siri button down, say something like “Set the thermostat to 73” if you want to change the temperature on your HomeKit-enabled smart thermostat. Or if you have Philips Hue lights, you can say “Turn on Living Room lights”. Granted, in order to get specific and say which room to turn the lights on from, you’ll need to customize HomeKit and set up different rooms. You can usually do this within the smarthome product’s app itself or within the new Home app on iOS 10 devices. In any case, after you say a command, Siri will tell you that it completed the task and confirm the action on the screen. There’s nothing specific that you need to set up separately on your Apple TV in order to get Siri smarthome control to work, so once you have your smarthome devices set up with HomeKit, you can immediately begin controlling them using Siri on the Apple TV.

Apple: No Evidence Apple Store Workers Stole Photos From Customers’ iPhones Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple: No Evidence Apple Store Workers Stole Photos From Customers’ iPhones Image courtesy of Adam Fagen October 13, 2016 3:42 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler Sticky Virtual Fingers stealing photos no evidence phones customers' phones apple apple store Even though Apple fired several Apple Store employees accused of stealing photos from female customers’ iPhones, the company says that there is no evidence that any such theft occurred. The investigation was initiated after the Courier Mail reported earlier this week that employees of an Apple Store in Queensland, Australia had been fired upon the discovery that they were sharing photos of female customers and employees, according to CNET. The retailer says that it was looking into reports of violations of its business conduct policy at the store “where several employees have already been terminated as a result of our findings.” Still, the company says it found “no evidence that customer data or photos were inappropriately transferred or that anyone was photographed by these former employees.” According to the Courier Mail, staff at the store reportedly took photos of female customers and employees, and allegedly stole photos from customer phones left at the location for repairs. The issue was apparently first reported by another employee who discovered one of the alleged perpetrators scrolling through a customer’s phone. The Courier Mail alleged that the photo pilfering was part of a sharing ring, with the subject of each shared photo being rated on appearance on a 1 to 10 scale. If the employees did indeed take photos from the customers’ phones it would just be the latest in a long line of tech companies doing so. Back in 2007, Consumerist’s three-month sting operation caught a Geek Squad technician — on video — stealing porn from our hard drive. That investigation was initiated after complaints by current and former Geek Squad techies, as compiled in the 10-page Geek Squad confession, “Stealing Customers’ Nudie Pics Was An Easter Egg Hunt.” More recently, a Radio Shack employee was charged with allegedly stealing racy personal photos off a customer’s cellphone.

Thursday, October 13, 2016 [Tweets] [Favorites] Why Does Siri Seem So Dumb? Walt Mossberg (MacRumors): Google Now, on the same Apple devices, using the same voice input, answered every one of these questions clearly and correctly. And that isn’t even Google’s latest digital helper, the new Google Assistant. If you try most of these broken examples right now, they’ll work properly, because Apple fixed them after I tweeted screenshots of most of them in exasperation, and asked the company about them. […] For instance, when I asked Siri on my Mac how long it would take me to get to work, it said it didn’t have my work address — even though the “me” contact card contains a work address and the same synced contact card on my iPhone allowed Siri to give me an answer. Similarly, on my iPad, when I asked what my next appointment was, it said “Sorry, Walt, something’s wrong” — repeatedly, with slightly different wording, in multiple places on multiple days. But, using the same Apple calendar and data, Siri answered correctly on the iPhone. Ruffin Bailey: Spend ten million (he said figuratively) and get the best QA staff in the business, and make sure there's no silo making QAing app interactions an issue. If Maps borks like this, the QA team “for Maps” has to be able to hold Siri and Contacts (or whatever else) accountable. No software ships until this blocking bug is fixed. John Gruber: Indeed, Siri now knows the date and time of the next U.S. presidential debate, but where Siri fundamentally falls apart is its inability to maintain context and chain together multiple commands. […] These sort of glaring inconsistencies are almost as bad as universal failures. The big problem Apple faces with Siri is that when people encounter these problems, they stop trying. It feels like you’re wasting your time, and makes you feel silly or even foolish for having tried. I worry that even if Apple improves Siri significantly, people will never know it because they won’t bother trying because they were burned so many times before. In addition to the engineering hurdles to actually make Siri much better, Apple also has to overcome a “boy who cried wolf” credibility problem. Nick Heer: I think the inconsistencies are worse than outright failure. The inability to answer a query implies a limitation which, while not ideal, is understandable. Inconsistency, on the other hand, makes Siri feel untrustworthy. If I can’t reliably expect the same result with basic queries that are almost identical, I’m much less likely to find it dependable. Kirk McElhearn: I pointed out similar problems in a Macworld article in August. For me, Siri is a waste of time. The only thing Siri consistently does correctly for me is set timers. I keep trying to use it to add reminders and am usually frustrated. Either the phone can’t connect to Siri, or it mis-parses what I said. It’s easier to use my finger to create a new action in OmniFocus and then to use the dictation button on the keyboard. iOS is pretty good at transcribing what I say. The problem is that interpreting it is unreliable. And that’s why I rarely even try to ask it more complicated questions. See also: Daniel Jalkut on Siri logging, David Spark’s Dragon Professional review. Update (2016-10-14): Stephen Hackett: Siri should feel like a living, growing platform and it just doesn’t. Even SiriKit, which allows developers to build plugins for the service, doesn’t get Apple far enough down the road. This is a platform vendor problem, and not one a handful of apps can solve. Update (2016-10-17): David Sparks: Why does it take an article by a popular journalist to get these things fixed? I feel as if Siri needs more attention. I don’t think the underlying technology is as bad as most people think but it is these little failures that causes everyone to lose faith. Update (2016-10-20): Nick Heer: I think it’s important to keep bringing it up because I think Siri is currently fundamentally flawed in its design. […] More worrying for me is that the user interface component of Siri — a field where Apple typically excels — simply isn’t good enough. Dictation Google Now iOS iOS 10 Mac macOS 10.12 Sierra Reminders Siri 5 Comments 5 Comments Peter N Lewis October 13, 2016 9:26 PM Unfortunately even setting the alarms in Siri does not do correctly. Try this: Create an alarm for 9:43, repeating every Tuesday, and turn it off. Now: "Siri, set an alarm for 9:43" - it simply turns on the 9:43 alarm which wont go off until Tuesday, not today or tomorrow as expected. Chucky October 14, 2016 2:43 AM Peter, if I'm parsing your results correctly, were I a human assistant, I'd act exactly as Siri is doing in this particular case... charles October 14, 2016 3:07 AM Chucky: I agree with Peter. If I say "an alarm", the indefinite article implies a different alarm, not the pre-existing one, so Siri should create a new one. If I say "Switch on the 9:43 alarm", and assuming I only have one set up, then yes, I should not expect it to go off until Tuesday. Chucky October 14, 2016 5:12 AM "Chucky: I agree with Peter." Yeah. I understand now. I misunderstood his comment. BCG November 1, 2016 1:31 PM I'm tired of the Siri bug that has persisted since iOS 8 (it was fine in iOS 7, IIRC) where if she misunderstands your command to create a reminder, and then you either manually correct it (or now with iOS 10) select one of her alternate suggestions, it STILL creates TWO reminders... the misinterpretation, and the correction. I have filed this bug on Bug Reporter, reported it via Apple's Feedback page, and even emailed Craig Federighi and Alex Acero about it (they both responded). Yet, here we are at iOS 10.1 and it still exists. It makes me wonder if Apple even cares anymore if they are letting simple bugs like this make it through the development process of THREE different versions of iOS and multiple bug reports and emails to SVPs... and still not fixing it. Like why would you provided a mechanism to correct Siri's input, but then not actually honor it when the user chooses the corrected version?

The full ad functions as a basic overview of the service, letting potential users know what they can expect from it. The ad is built around the five tabs on the bottom of the app. It starts out showing off that users can build a library of their own music, segueing into Apple Music's "For You" section. The ad showcases how the service will recommend music users currently love while also introducing them to music they will love. From there, the ad quickly shows users that they can share playlists and easily add music to their libraries before mentioning that Apple Music receives the newest music from major artists. Finally, the ad moves toward the radio component of Apple Music, letting users know that they can listen to live or on-demand radio shows. It also shows highlights from some of the Beats 1 programming available on Apple Music, including content from Zane Lowe, other DJs and artists. The new ad is a part of Apple's campaign to push iOS 10's redesigned Apple Music. Last month, the company debuted an ad starring "Late Late Show" host and "Carpool Karaoke" producer James Corden pitching commercial ideas for the service.Tags: Ads, Apple Music Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: CNET - Affiliate - 3 weeks ago< > Embed Apple's New MacBook Pro and Macs: The Final Rumors 02:48 It's every MacBook Pro, MacBook, iMac, Mac Pro and Mac Mini rumor we've heard before Apple's official announcement.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple hires COO and engineers from iPhone graphics provider Imagination Technologies By Christian Zibreg, Oct 13, 2016 Tweet 1 Comment Combing through multiple LinkedIn profiles, MacRumors has discovered that Imagination Technologies COO John Metcalfe left the company in June along with a bunch of engineers and is now listed as a Senior Director at Apple, where he started in July. Imagination GPUs are found in Apple’s in-house designed mobile chips for iOS devices. Imagination is a fabless UK-based R&D company focused on semiconductor and related intellectual property licensing. Its high-performance GPU designs are licensed by companies like Apple for integration into their own semiconductor products. Joe Rossignol, writing for MacRumors: Imagination Technologies engineers Dave Roberts, Jonathan Redshaw, and Benjamin Bowman are also now employed by Apple. Likewise, a fourth engineer Simon Nield joined Apple as a Design Manager just this month. A search of former Imagination Technologies employees now working at Apple yields 25 results. Many of Imagination’s employees continue to be based in London, but some have apparently relocated to Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California. Fuzilla alleged in 2015 that Apple embarked on building its own mobile GPU in order to cut the cord from Imagination. Sources in the graphics industry told Fuzilla that Apple’s been secretly developing a custom GPU in-house for a few years now. Apple was rumored to be in “advanced talks” to acquire Imagination following news that the company shed jobs. A representative for Apple confirmed that the company “did hold some talks”, but declined making a formal offer to acquire Imagination. Imagination’s attempt to diversify into areas like MIPS processors, chips for servers and ray tracing GPUs were mostly unsuccessful, prompting longtime CEO Hossein Lassie to step down amid declining average royalty rates. In 2014, Apple extended its licensing agreement with Imagination, securing multi-year access to all future PowerVR-branded video and GPU designs. The sheer number of Imagination engineers that now work in Cupertino could certainly hint that Apple might be assembling an in-house team to design iOS device GPUs itself. The Cupertino company currently designs its own CPUs, but not GPUs. For example, the A-series chips utilize custom CPU cores that are compatible with the ARMv7 instruction set and developed 100 percent in-house. But before the iPhone 5s’s A7 chip, the A-series processors used off-the-shelf CPU designs from ARM Holdings, another fabless UK chip maker that designs rather than builds semiconductors. The GPU in the iPhone 7’s A10 Fusion chip boasts 50 percent greater graphics performance while consuming 66 percent of the power versus its predecessor, the A9. Apple’s been known to use mobile GPUs that aren’t on Imagination’s official roadmap so we won’t know for sure if the A10 Fusion uses Imagination’s PowerVR GPU series until a thorough teardown analysis is performed by chip wizards at Chipworks. We only know currently that A10 Fusion’s GPU has six cores. Earlier this year, Chinese-state owned company Tsinghua Unigroup International purchased a three percent stake in Imagination. Apple already owns an 8.5 percent stake in Imagination, more than twice that of Tsinghua’s shares. Intel owns a five percent stake in the British company. Imagination had five primary investors as of December 2015: Baillie Gifford & Co., M&G Investment Management Ltd., Apple Inc., Newton Investment Management Ltd. and Majedie Asset Management Ltd.

Sign up now close ​Business shut over fake Microsoft and Apple malware pop-up ads Liam Tung (CSO Online) on 14 October, 2016 06:38 0 - - - - print email A firm with operations in India and the US has been charged for using pop-up ads to scare consumers into calling tech support to pay for services they don’t need. No one likes cold-calls from pushy tech support scammers pretending to be Microsoft, but scammers have recently reversed the routine by using pop-up ads to trick consumers into initiating the call themselves. US regulator the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) hit six firms working out of the US and Canada in July, freezing their assets for using pop-up ads that posed as security warnings from Microsoft or Apple. On Thursday, the FTC announced charges against another network of firms, once again, for using pop-up ads designed to appear as security warnings from Microsoft or Apple. A federal court in Missouri has temporarily frozen assets of several individuals and firms behind a company that operated under the name Global Access Technical Support. The ads prevented consumers from closing or bypassing them and prompted consumers to contact a toll-free number, according to the FTC. After calling the number, consumers would be connected to call center in India where operators claimed to work for a recognizable tech firm and falsely claimed they were certified to work with Apple or Microsoft products. From there, the scam operated like any other bogus tech support service, by directing users to grant full access to the computer, which allowed the telemarketer to offer false translations of system messages. “The telemarketers typically direct consumers to go to a website, enter a code, and follow the prompts to begin the remote access session. Once Defendants gain remote access, they are able to control the consumers’ computers,” the complaint reads. Read more Got an iOS 10 exploit? This company will pay you $1.5m for it “Among other things, Defendants can view the computer screen, move the mouse or cursor, enter commands, run applications, and access stored information. At the same time, consumers can see what Defendants are seeing and doing on their computers.” After gaining control of the user’s PC, the scammers then run diagnostic tests and present error or warning messages to convince consumers they’ve been hacked and need help. In June, an undercover FTC employee was shown such a warning after contacting the support center. “While displaying this screen, the telemarketer drew FTC staffs attention to a number of errors and warnings in the computer and claimed that these are evidence of computer problems. In fact, the FTC computer used during this undercover transaction was free ofviruses, spyware, malware, or other security issues at the time ofthe undercover transaction.” Read more FBI could have unlock iPhone 5c without Apple’s help in under two days Charges have been filed against Missouri-registered firms Global Access Technical Support, Global sMind, Source Pundit, Helios Digital Media, and an Indian company, Global Ites Private Limited.

The negotiations have been confirmed by sources within Sonder, though a final deal has yet to be announced. The Sonder Keyboard features an e-ink display beneath transparent plastic keys, allowing users to customize the keyboard to their liking. While the keyboard is not out just yet, it is currently available for pre-order, though an acquisition by Apple might interfere with its plans to release the keyboard as a stand-alone product. The keyboard would make an interesting addition to the Apple lineup, particularly considering the recent rumors that a customizable OLED touch strip is planned for the upcoming MacBooks. According to 9to5 Mac, the Sonder Keyboard could be slated for inclusion in a MacBook at some point in the future, as Apple continues to explore dynamic input devices, but it is unlikely we would see it soon. Related: Apple planning a second research and development center in China Sonder currently produces a laptop module for their e-ink keyboard and the company claims three laptop manufacturers are in talks to license the technology. So the laptop compatible e-ink keyboard is clearly more than a concept at this point. Still, Apple is expected to unveil a new slate of MacBooks later this month and even if the Sonder acquisition closes by then, we likely will not see the technology integrated into Apple products for at least one or two more MacBook generations. According to sources close to the negotiations, the technology Apple is interested in differs from the upcoming consumer version of the keyboard significantly. The current Sonder Keyboard uses a non-backlit e-ink display beneath the alphanumeric keys, while the version Apple is reportedly being shown features a set of fully dynamic and backlit keys. The talks with Sonder were reportedly carried out by Apple’s procurement board with assistance from Foxconn International Holdings, Sonder’s parent company, and E-Ink Holdings.

A new report claims Apple wants Sonder’s E Ink-based keyboard system for future MacBook Pro models, and may be negotiating to buy Sonder the company. The Sonder E Ink keyboard may be coming to the MacBook Pro Sonder is an Australian company with desktop and laptop computer keyboard designs that use E Ink technology to dynamically change what’s displayed on individual keys. Sonder’s technology makes it easy to change languages on the fly, or show app-specific function keys. News of the keyboard technology first appeared on Reddit where user Foxconninsider said, I work on Tsinghua university campus, it is like the Chinese MIT. It hosted a Foxconn event where I saw the new Macbook keyboard module design and Apple’s 2018 E Ink Magic Keyboard that’s a DFT model. (DFT is design for testing). Reddit moderators claim they verified Foxconninsider’s identity. TrustedReviews contacted a Sonder spokesperson who said the company was at the Foxconn’s Innoconn demo day at the school, and that three laptop makers are in talks to use its keyboard technology. “Sonder has been in discussions with Apple’s procurement board regarding Sonder’s laptop module,” the spokesperson added. “Foxconn International Holdings and E Ink Holdings—both strategic partners of Sonder Design Pty. Ltd. are assisting with the above discussions.” The Reddit source claimed a Foxconn executive said Apple was “was closing an [Sonder] acquisition,” too. Apple and Sonder aren’t offering up any information to back up that claim. Apple could use Sonder’s E Ink keyboard technology to make a universal language version of the MacBook Pro where the laptop’s keyboard changes when users set their preferred language. Currently, users choose which primary language they want when purchasing and the laptop comes with the appropriate keys. There isn’t much evidence yet to back up Apple buying Sonder. Still, dynamically changing keyboards sound like a pretty useful feature for future MacBook Pro models. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: E Ink, keyboard, MacBook Pro, Sonder 3 Comments Add a comment Rick Allen October 13, 2016 A very interesting idea, yet the demo above with the keycap image well below the surface is a bit strange to me. I am used to the image right at the top of the key. I suppose it would be a matter of getting used to it. October 13, 2016 at 11:40 EST AM ppartekim October 13, 2016 An E Ink keyboard combined with a Haptic engine would remove the need for physical keyboards altogether yet still look and feel like a normal keyboard. October 13, 2016 at 1:51 EST PM JBSlough October 14, 2016 Was thinking the same thing. A keyboard that is basically a bunch of glass keys that don’t really move but through force touch and haptic feedback give the illusion of movement. They could probably seal the entire laptop and prevent water damages. October 14, 2016 at 11:48 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple is reportedly in discussions to acquire Sonder, a company that developed a unique morphing E Ink keyboard under Foxconn’s incubator program. Apple buys other companies all of the time, but this one is particularly compelling. Rumors have suggested that Apple wants to add an OLED screen to its MacBook Pros to add more room for shortcuts, media controls and more. With an E Ink keyboard, the physical keys on the keyboard could change, too, as you can see in the images above. Why this matters: Apple, not unlike every other computer manufacturer out there, is clearly looking for new ways to help its products stand out from the competition. This could add a new function we haven’t seen much of before. Lenovo, however, has something similar. Lenovo’s Yoga Book doesn’t use E Ink, but it does have a keyboard that appears and vanishes unlike anything else we’ve seen before. Sonder’s tech is very different, but still definitely allows the keyboard to serve as a space that can be used for more than just typing.

Has Scooped Up Some Major Chip Talent The iPhone maker is bolstering its in-house graphics chip team. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 13, 2016 at 2:50PM A10 Fusion chip. Image source: Apple. This should come as no surprise considering Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has become a world-class semiconductor designer over the past five to six years. The iPhone maker poached John Metcalfe from Imagination Technologies earlier this year, as noted by MacRumors, citing the executive's public LinkedIn profile. Metcalfe served as Imagination's COO but now works as a senior director at Apple. Digging deeper, MacRumors also notes that there are also over two dozen engineers that Apple has poached from the British graphics chip specialist. Apple has long licensed Imagination's PowerVR GPU technology for use in its A series of processors, which was paired with CPU architectures licensed from fellow British chip designer ARM Holdings (since acquired by Softbank). Imagination has been on the ropes lately, announcing a corporate restructuring and layoffs earlier this year. There were even reports that Apple was considering a full-blown acquisition. Apple confirmed that there were some negotiations, but no offer materialized. Taking the "acqui" out of "acqui-hire" Why buy the whole company (Apple was already a stakeholder in Imagination) when you can surgically poach what you need? As Apple continues to expand its chip strategy into a diverse range of semiconductors, it's arguably surprising that Apple has only recently begun bringing graphics expertise in-house. The company now designs the system-in-package that powers Apple Watches and wireless audio chips in the new AirPods, among others. Strong graphics performance is integral to Apple's A series of chips, particularly as gaming has become the largest and most popular category of apps on the App Store. Combined with the never-ending string of evidence that Apple is still working on an ARM-based Mac that will potentially run on an A chip, the company's chip aspirations are only getting grander. Apple prefers using integrated graphics in many of its Macs these days, particularly entry-level machines, so it will need to significantly improve A series graphics performance since Macs have greater graphics needs (larger displays, more graphics-intensive applications, etc.). Expanding across the pond Many of these poached engineers are still based in London, and it just so happens that Apple is planning on expanding its U.K. headquarters in London. The Mac maker has decided to consolidate offices and move into the Battersea power station, an iconic decommissioned coal plant, utilizing 500,000 square feet. The company is hoping to open the location in 2021 and expects to relocate 1,400 employees that work in the area. The Battersea power station is about an hour away from Imagination's headquarters. Apple's presence in London is only getting bigger. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple and LinkedIn. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

To begin with, the device includes a built-in GPS, which was lacking in the original Apple Watch. Runners, which are a key market segment in fitness-oriented wearable devices, will clearly appreciate such improvement. If you want to track your distance and speed via GPS with a first-generation Apple Watch, then you need to go running or walking with your smartphone, which is far from ideal. The original Apple Watch, as well as many devices from Fitbit and other manufacturers, can track distance by approximation without a GPS. These devices basically estimate speed and distance based on a pre-specified stride length, which is obviously not as precise or accurate as using a GPS, but can be reasonable enough to many users.  Apple Watch Series 2 is also water-resistant up to 50 meters, and it even rejects the water from the speaker after being used under water. The new activity app allows swimmers to record workouts in both open water and a pool, and it includes sensors that count laps, average lap pace, and estimated calorie burn while swimming. Apple and Nike (NYSE:NKE) have been working together for a long time in fitness-related products, and the Apple Watch Series 2 is taking that relationship to a new level. Apple has partnered with Nike to develop Apple Watch Nike+ edition, which comes with unique specially designed sports brands, exclusive Nike watch faces, and the Nike+ Run Club app, which provides run reminders, challenges from friends, and weather-related alerts, among other fitness-oriented features. Apple and Nike are two of the most powerful brands in the consumer sector, so the fact that they are joining forces in wearables is a red flag for competitors in the industry. The most recent smartwatch from Apple also has huge improvements when it comes to the display, the device offers 1,000 nits of brightness, more than double the 450 nits of the first Apple Watch. According to Apple, this makes it much easier to see the screen outside on a sunny day. Should investors in Fitbit be worried? According to data from IDC, the top five vendors in the wearable devices industry shipped 22.5 million devices in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 26% versus 17.8 million units in the same quarter last year. Fitbit is the clear leader in the industry, the company has a market share of 25.4%, and it shipped 5.7 million units during the second quarter, an annual increase of 29%. As for Apple, the company comes in a third position behind Xiaomi, as it reportedly shipped 1.6 million devices in the second quarter, a big decline versus 3.6 million in the second quarter last year. On the other hand, the new Apple Watch was launched in September, so many consumers who want to buy an Apple Watch probably postponed their decision during the second quarter, and things could change substantially over the coming months.  Importantly, consumer demand seems to be evolving lately. According to Jitesh Ubrani, senior research analyst for IDC Mobile Device Trackers: "Fitness is the low-hanging fruit for wearables. However, the market is evolving and we're starting to see consumers adopt new functionality, such as communication and mobile payments, while enterprises warm to wearables' productivity potential." Fitbit has some important advantages when it comes to competing against Apple Watch. Fitbit devices have a battery life in the range of five to ten days, while the Apple Watch typically needs to be recharged every night. Fitbit also offers more convenient prices, with products ranging from $60 to $250. By comparison, the Apple Watch Series 1 starts at $269, and the Series 2 has a starting price of $369. Fitbit devices also work with all kinds of smartphones, but you need to pair the Apple Watch with an iPhone. This means that Fitbit will probably remain the best choice for consumers who are looking for basic fitness-tracking wristbands at affordable prices. However, Apple is much stronger than Fitbit when it comes to areas such as design, brand power, and building a full ecosystem of services and applications around a smartwatch. If industry demand is transitioning, and consumers are demanding increasingly more functionalities from smartwatches, then Fitbit will be fighting an uphill battle against Apple.

In our previous installment about cloud services, A Side-by-Side Comparison of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure, we did an overview of what is it that you can do in the cloud, covering topics such as computing, analytics and networking. In this article, we’ll dig deeper into cloud storage, starting from small and very practical requirements for domestic users (desktop services), and scaling up to the needs of businesses, using the same technologies. What Is “the Cloud”? The “old” way More from this author Data Serialization Comparison: JSON, YAML, BSON, MessagePack DevOps by Example: Tools, Pros and Cons of a DevOps Culture Not more than just a decade ago, when you needed to upload something to the internet, you would hire a hosting company to rent a certain amount of online space. If you were fancy, you would make an additional backup of files, just in case something happened to that server. And of course, things did happen to servers: hardware failures (it even seemed that hard disk drives (HDD) were just meant to break), crackers (if you ever had an account on a shared hosting, you just knew that every couple of months some foreign flag would appear on your site), and the always unintentional but clumsy overwriting or deletion of files (come on, we all did it). Now, if you were really fancy, you would deploy your files to different locations at once to ensure redundancy and availability, and to minimize the latency worldwide (that is, the amount of time between you request a file, and when you finally access it). However, doing things the right way was not only costly and time consuming, but it required a fair amount of technical savvy (and we didn’t even get to discuss doing load balancing so that your files would still be available during high traffic situations). The new way Today, when you upload a file to a service such as Google Drive, iCloud, Amazon S3 or a hosting grid, this file is automatically replicated in multiple servers and, very often, to multiple locations — so that when you try to access your documents while in Japan or the East Coast of the United States, your request is automatically routed to the closest pool of data that’s available. That is the cloud. Under this new architecture, if a server or a data center gets disrupted, chances are you won’t ever find out, because the traffic is going to be transparently redirected to the next available pool of data. And even if a server gets cracked, the attackers are not going to come across regular files as in a traditional hosting service, because in many cases the data is obscured in some way and even encrypted, and it’s your request that actually builds the file. Mind you, this technology — which is pretty much ubiquitous today — made its breakthrough just a decade ago: Amazon S3, launched in 2006 Dropbox, founded in 2007 iCloud, launched in 2011 Google Drive, launched in 2012 … et cetera. You are already using it Some people (OK, my ex-girlfriend) are hesitant about using the cloud. “The cloud?” they say. “No thanks!” They don’t like this idea of having their files “everywhere”, and it does sound awkward when you put it that way. But as we mentioned, it’s not quite “your files” that are everywhere, but rather the bits of data that can build your files upon your requests. And if you use services such as Gmail or Yahoo Mail (which is another way of saying “if you’re using the internet”), you are already using the cloud, and you realize how convenient that is. To explain further: some of you won’t even remember the days when email was downloaded with a client program to a single machine and everything was lost if something happened to that computer, should there be no backup of those files somewhere else. Gmail or Yahoo Mail are just the cloud version of email — a ubiquitous, secure and reliable service that’s replicated around the world for instant access … Yes, the cloud! Desktop Services There are tons of services, but for this survey, we’ll be listing some that have been running for a couple of years and that offer full-featured free plans, not just limited trial periods. Some of these services have specific tools, or come integrated with services for certain kinds of storage, such as music files, pictures and documents, which we will cover in detail later in the article. (The w is a link the Wikipedia entry.) service docs pics music free plans Amazon Drive w no yes yes 5GB unlimited/$59.99/yr Apple iCloud w no yes yes 5GB 50GB/$0.99/mo; 1TB/$9.99/mo; and more iDrive w no limited no 5GB 1TB/$52.12/yr Google Drive w yes yes yes 15GB 100GB/$1.99/mo; 1TB/$9.99/mo; and more Dropbox w yes limited no 2GB 1TB/$9.99/mo OneDrive w yes limited yes 5GB 50GB/$1.99/mo; 1TB/$6.99/mo Pay attention to how you count space! All of the space you’re using on the same provider will count as a single resource. For example, if you’re using 5GB on Gmail and 2GB on files stored on Google Drive, that means you’re using a total of 7GB, so your available space in case you’re using the free tier would be: 15GB (total space) 
    - 5GB (from Gmail) 
    - 2GB (from Google Drive) 
        = 8GB available
 iCloud is more of a backup service for the iPhone and the Mac rather than a full-featured cloud service, and as such is not available for non-Apple products. In fact, Apple has earned a poor reputation when in comes to interoperability and, while it’s convenient in Apple environments, you’ll come across a number of problems if you ever need to change to Android or temporarily switch to a PC. On the other hand OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) is not exclusively a Windows tool, even though it’s developed by Microsoft. You can freely use it on a Mac, your iPhone, and on Linux environments such as Android phones. Documents The field for productivity is certainly that of office documents. You can store these files in any storage service. After all, they’re just files. However, we’re listing here services that, besides storage, also give you the possibility to manage documents right there, allowing users to create, edit, and share documents. Google Drive is the home for Google Docs, Sheets, Slides and Forms. All of them are mature tools that you can use without limitations and for free through your browser. And Google has really managed to make collaborative editing in real-time a true highlight of its office suite. Late but determined, Microsoft joined the online club of productivity tools. You can store your Office documents in OneDrive and have a limited editing and free visualization via Office Online, the free version of Office 365. The licensing scheme for the full-featured products is way to complex to reproduce here, but have a look at it if what you need is full support for Microsoft Office products. Paper is the all-in-one work solution by Dropbox. It’s a fairly limited tool, specially when compared against Google’s tools or the full-fledged Office 365. But its simplicity might also be its main advantage, given that it’s a very straightforward tool to use that requires little training. And it does support collaboration, rich formatting and, of course, Dropbox attachments. There are some workarounds and plans to integrate iCloud with iWork, Apple’s office suite, which would bring document editing capabilities to the iCloud service. For now, though, we count it as a missing feature. Pictures If there is a backup service you should start using now, this is it. It’s sad to know that still today many families keep their treasured memories on a desktop or laptop computer hard drive. If I wasn’t clear before, I’ll try to make it clear now: the hard drive of a computer (especially the traditional HDD) is a bomb about to explode. And even if you have a more reliable solid-state drive (SSD), still, your laptop could get stolen, get a virus, or disappear into the blue (why not?). When it comes to storing and sharing pictures, for some of you Facebook may do just fine, but it does fall short on features: you can’t order prints, you can’t search by date, or edit. And what if you decided one day to get rid of Facebook altogether? As a solution, all of the services we’ll cover here will automatically upload for you every new pic or video that you take on your phone or that you sync from your camera to your computer, thus enabling you to clean up space very quickly and allowing you to select later what you keep or not. service free space plans Amazon Prime Photos w 5GB unlimited/$59.99/yr Flickr w 1TB 2TB/$5.99/mo Google Photos w unlimited 100GB/$1.99/mo; 1TB/$9.99/mo; and more iCloud Photo Library w 5GB 50GB/$0.99/mo; 1TB/$9.99/mo; and more Dropbox used to bundle a decent photo service called Carousel that they unfortunately decided to shut down in early 2016. They still have support for automatically uploading of photos from your phone and visualizing them with an app or the browser, but features come nowhere close to those of these other services. Microsoft also hasn’t integrated OneDrive with a dedicated photo service so far. Flickr is arguably the place for sharing photos, with the biggest community of pros and amateur photo enthusiasts, a website that’s been running and adding features since 2004, and great organization tools and privacy settings. iCloud comes with a tool called iCloud Photo Library, and Google Drive comes integrated with Google Photos (formerly Picasa Web Albums). Both are full-featured photo services for tagging people, sharing and creating albums, and even editing pictures, along with many more features. A huge plus is that Google Photos gives you unlimited storage for pictures for free (that is, without subtracting space from your Google Drive account) as long as you don’t need to store the originals for pictures in resolutions higher than 16 megapixels. Should you choose this option, it will shrink your hi-res pics to 2048×2048 (in other words, OK for most domestic uses). A fairly limited product with few organizational tools and no search, Amazon Prime Photos (paid) is the most generous when it comes to storage — unlimited for all images, including hi-res. Music You can also use the cloud for storing your ripped CDs and MP3 files. You’ll have the benefit of being able to stream your music from everywhere for free with your phone or computer, and forget altogether about the idea of bringing your files on USB drives and other media whenever you want to take your music somewhere else. Aside from streaming, all of these services allow you with certain limitations to upload your own music collection: service free upload w/subscription plans Amazon Music w 250 250,000 $25/yr (storing only) Groove Music w up to 5 GB unlimited $7/mo (streaming and storing) Google Play Music w 50,000 50,000 $9.99/mo (streaming and storing) iTunes Match w no 100,000 $25/yr (storing only) Some of these services also include family packages so that different users can simultaneously access the service for a reduced fee. This is the case with the Google Play Music family plan, allowing unlimited access up to six family members for $14.99/mo. Notice that, when you pay a streaming subscription, you also have access to millions of songs in high definition audio. But as we covered here, this is not a requirement for uploading your own music files to the cloud. And talking about music subscription services, we won’t discuss services such as Apple Music , Spotify, Deezer or Tidal, as these are intended strictly for streaming (that is, you pay a fee to stream music on demand) with no option for uploading and storing your own music library. Google allows for uploading local music to the cloud with the Music Manager tool. The subscription to Google Play Music also includes YouTube Red, which is the ad-free version of YouTube, along with access to YouTube Red Original series and films. Amazon Music also allows uploading music, but through an app. Although Amazon shut down its Music Importer tool, they didn’t entirely get rid of the option to upload music, which can be done now with the Amazon Music app. iTunes Match will automatically try to match your local collection to what’s available on iTunes, and it will automatically add to your online library whatever matches without you needing to upload any actual files. However, you need to pay a subscription to be able to use this feature. Uploading files to Groove Music is a bit more of a hassle, and you need to keep space in mind. First, there’s no way to match your collection as with iTunes, so you’ll need to upload files individually or sync your Music folder to OneDrive. Second, and unlike the previously mentioned services, here you’ll be using up space from your cloud storage account, in this case OneDrive. However, if you’re already paying for a OneDrive subscription, this may be OK with you; same if you’re paying the $7/mo subscription for Groove Music. Storage for Business There are very interesting options for those who like the simplicity and practicality of the desktop services we described, and would like to take just that to the working environment. These services may be very attractive for companies, because some of the functionalities we already described plus some of these extras: easy online collaboration (which is a huge plus for the enterprise) no APIs to integrate; in general, no additional training for users (for example, if you already use Google Docs, you’re good to go) control panels for administrators (to manage users’ access, space quotas, and other features). service space plans, per user Box 100GB (starter); unlimited (business) €4/mo (starter); €12/mo (business) iDrive Business 250GB (A); 1.25TB (C) $74.62/yr (A); $374.62/yr (C) [unlimited users] Dropbox Business unlimited $15/mo Google Drive for Work 1TB (for less than 5 users) $10/mo OneDrive for Business 1TB (plan 1); 5TB (plan 2) $5/mo (plan 1); $10/mo (plan 2) Be careful when evaluating the total cost of these services, as you’ll need to take into account both your storage requirements and the amount of employees. Cloud Storage for Websites, Apps and Archiving There are, of course, services oriented towards storing objects for websites and applications, as well as online archiving, and even building a content delivery network (CDN). For details about these services, you should see the “Storage” section of “A Side-by-Side Comparison of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure“. Conclusions We’ve seen plenty of options for using the cloud to store your digital assets, including free and very rich-featured ones. If you’re a domestic user who wants to keep it simple, you might be better off choosing a desktop service and sticking to it for all of your needs. In addition, or as an alternative, you might pick a specific service for a specific type of storage (say, Flickr for pictures). And in some cases, you’ll be able to smoothly transfer these practices and tools to your company. In any case, don’t risk losing files and information you value, and keep your music, pictures and documents in a safe, accessible place. The cloud is your friend.

It’s the usual suspects. Samsung has appealed a lower court’s ruling that several models of its smartphones violated an Apple design patent. While the outcome of the Court’s decision may very well affect interface design at large, longtime issues with the patent system remain unchallenged. Patent law hasn’t gone before the Court since the Patent Act of 1887 was pushed through to protect two companies whose carpet designs were being filched and sold by a small rival. Ruling that an object’s appeal is inextricable from its design, lawmakers concluded that copycats should fork over all profits from their forgeries to the patent holder. In Samsung’s case, those profits exceed $500 million for what frighteningly amounts to little more than infringement on look and feel: rounded corners and a display of gridded icons, two protected features included in the patents filed for the original iPhone. Central to the ruling is whether those formal parts, not its functional ones, can stand for a more complicated whole, and thus the entire profit on that phone. Though the dollar figure is extraordinary, it’s not any less absurd than what’s been wrought on the web by patent holders already. In a 2006 opinion, Justice Kennedy wrote, “An industry has developed in which firms use patents not as a basis for producing and selling goods, but, instead, primarily for obtaining licensing fees.” He was referring to MercExchange’s $30 million win in its infringement case against eBay for unauthorized usage of the “Buy It Now” button, part of a burgeoning litigious tech culture which has availed itself of a patent office unprepared. Many web designers had their first run-in with patent law earlier this year when a brief wave of panic (and smug elation) swept over Twitter as news broke of a lawsuit alleging the Apple website infringed on a 2014 patent awarded for the web carousel. A former software engineer named Samuel Lit filed the patent in 2007, several years after the carousel had come into common use, and similar to MercExchange’s case against eBay Lit had been active but unsuccessful in licensing his invention. But however unlikely, a gavel in Lit’s favor could change the complexion of the web overnight, as organizations wrestle with what other section of the homepage to fight over. (I kid. Sorta.) Excessive penalties may deter organized design pirates from filching your interface whole cloth, but it extends a bridge to a new breed of patent trolls who can make a cottage industry of registering every permutation of CSS under the sun. It’s exactly the little things which hang in the balance. In support of the original total-profit penalty leveraged against Samsung, a joint statement from Tiffany and Adidas says, “Although the copied design constitutes only a portion of the complete design, it is often the case that the copied portion of the design (i.e., the hardware on the handbag or the sole of the shoe) resonates with consumers and drives demand for the overall article of manufacture.” If the Court rules particular parts can act as a sort of metonymic short-hand for the full appearance and profit of an item or service, if a clasp can represent a whole handbag, then it’s worth considering what component parts of a website or product make it distinct from another. It’s plausible, certainly for the fashion industry, that what tickles somebody’s money bone is a minor detail that accounts for only a fraction of the total design but is otherwise brand significant. What’s fundamentally being argued for here is identity protection. The brand is the interface, the interface the brand. “Only a McDonald’s cheeseburger looks like a McDonald’s cheeseburger,” wrote Oliver Reichenstein in the excellent “The Interface of a Cheeseburger,” “I unwrap it and look at the bread and the meat and the ketchup mustard color pattern: McDonald’s cheeseburger it is.” Reichenstein’s point has as much to do with brand standards as working within a typology: every order of design, even the cheeseburger, has a narrow acceptable range of deviation from the norm, and designers have to meet the public somewhere along that continuum. That incrementalism doesn’t preclude innovation, though how influence and inspiration can be interpreted by a court is worrying. Just how different is different enough? Famed designer Raymond Loewy called this the MAYA principle — Most Advanced Yet Acceptable. The rule was at work in the failure of Apple’s own Newton, a category-coining gambit whose ambitions outpaced technological reality. Palm cashed in Apple’s chips four years later. Thing is, everybody wants to be Apple. Doubling down on this lawsuit reveals an Apple that assumes it will always be ahead of the curve, always the benefactor. In some ways it’s a bold internal directive to keep things that way. If it has a tincture of hubris, the Tiffany and Adidas brief makes the point: “designers invest enormous amounts of capital, time, and sweat equity in creating innovative designs that capture consumers’ attention and drive consumption.” They go on to say, “Design pirates capitalize on the huge investments made by fashion designers by copying only popular and successful designs.” It’s a fair point, and as a designer one I’m sensitive to; anyone who’s been the victim of a blatant copycat knows how little legal recourse there is to set things straight. But that, as SCOTUS has already noted, is an issue for Congress to take up. We won’t know the lasting effects of the Supreme Court ruling for years, and regardless of which way the wind blows it won’t address the core problem: a broken patent system that gives protections to concepts too broad and too obvious to merit single ownership. Though overhauling the patent system has been bruited about on the web since Amazon began defending, lucratively, its 1-click order patent, patent law is unlikely to get the serious attention it deserves by a Congress that has demonstrated, time and again, a sharply offensive ignorance — if not outright hostility — toward design and technology.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is news of new smartwatch patent. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Wednesday. Apple Watch Patent: A new patent connected to the Apple Watch could change how owners use the device, reports AppleInisder. The patent it titled “Wristband device input using wrist movement.” It details a system that would allow users to control their smartwatch with different wrist movements. This would be possible with different sensors that could be used to determine how a person’s wrist is flexing and stretching. This means that users could do things like making a phone gesture with their hand to answer calls. Sonder Acqusition: Apple is reportedly in talks to acquire startup Sonder, The Guardian notes. According to the publication, an unnamed representative for the startup confirmed that it is in talks to be acquired by AAPL. This includes CEO Francisco Serra-Martins meeting up with AAPL CEO Tim Cook. Sonder is the startup behind a keyboard that can change based on what programs are being used. Recent rumors claim that the tech company is interested in using this technology for its Magic Keyboard 2, which may come out in 2018. iPhone 7 Sales: Analysts are expecting iPhone 7 sales to pick up, reports Reuters. Sales of the iPhone 7 are expected to increase now that Samsung Electronic KRW5000 (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) has permanently pulled the Galaxy Note 7 from stores. This means that there’s no major rival to go against the iPhone 7 and this gives AAPL an advantage. Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:TSM) is also increasing its revenue outlook for 2016. It supplies the A10 chips for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search How Apple’s next MacBook Pro could be the most flexible laptop ever Chris Burns - Oct 13, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Apple has been tipped to be speaking with Foxconn startup Sonder, a company which creates some of the strangest keyboards in the world. The keyboards Sonder makes don’t look significantly different from Apple’s current MacBook Pro and iMac offerings – just so long as their keys keep their standard characters. Sonder’s big differentiator in keyboards is their ability to switch keys at a moment’s notice using E-Ink technology. Back in 2008 a keyboard was introduced to the world as Optimus Maximus (as seen below), the first of its kind. This keyboard was designed by Art.Lebedev and featured keys with their own tiny displays and individually programmed actions. Industrial designer Timur Burbaev and engineers Maksim Pavlukhin and Grigory Annenkov made a keyboard that may have been 8 years before its time – or at least before its preparedness for mass adoption. Sonder makes a couple of products right now, one of which is a standalone keyboard. This Sonder keyboard costs $199 and uses E Ink to alter the visual content behind each of most of its keys. There’s also a notebook implementation of this technology from Sonder being prepared for release right now. “We meticulously designed and engineered the Sonder keyboard, from the inside out,” said Sonder. “The final product is an advanced, elegant keyboard with transparent keys and a bespoke display that’s as much a work of art as it is state of the art.” Sonder has also suggested that theirs is the world’s first E Ink keyboard. Sonder’s laptop webpage says it’ll be delivering the “future at your fingertips.” Clearly they mean they’re the future of keyboards – but also your touch interaction. They also suggest that, “Partnering with experienced manufacturers, Sonder will redefine laptop keyboard design and user experience.” UPDATE: As of 12-noon Central Time (possibly before), Sonder’s website has gone down. It is possible that this down time is happening due to increased traffic. On the other hand, it could also be because Apple asked Sonder to take down their webpage temporarily – we do not have confirmation either way, yet. Above and below are videos posted by Sonder to their YouTube channel. The video above was posted a year ago, while the video below was posted yesterday. These were posted to the official Sonder YouTube channel, linked via their official website. If Apple is indeed creating a MacBook or MacBook Pro with a keyboard like Sonder has mocked up for the public to see (at least until this afternoon), we can see why. Above and below are a number of images rendered by Sonder of an unnamed notebook with Sonder’s keyboard but without a brand. We can safely assume these were meant to resemble a MacBook Pro. Apple could at last be aiming some of its notebook resources at versatile gaming applications. While it’s been fairly standard practice for some years now that more casual games are developed for both Windows devices and Apple’s desktops, Apple could be expanding. Gaming is the industry in which PC sales are growing quickest – Apple may want a piece of that pie. Keyboards made by Razer have backlighting that’s able to change color based on various stimuli. SteelSeries keyboards have reprogrammable keys and have their own rainbow color backlighting. More keyboards have odd keys, lights, and added functionality than ever before. If Apple does implement Sonder technology into their MacBook of the future, users will have some adjusting to do. First, it’s possible that Apple will allow a seasoned MacBook user to work with this new MacBook without needing to learn how to utilize the new keyboard display technology. E Ink allows this without needing the keys to be lit up with any significant battery drain as a result. If Apple does use E Ink, as Sonder does, users won’t actually need to physically SEE the keyboard to use it. They wouldn’t need to see this hypothetical MacBook’s keyboard to use its basic functionality, that is to say. There’ll still be hardware indicators of where the keys are – F and J, we “see” you. It’s also possible that Apple will want users to make full use of this technology when the new MacBook arrives. They might push the technology the same way they’ve worked with app developers to utilize 3D Touch on the iPhone. Developers could be taking advantage of this new bit of hardware for a wide variety of apps – music to games to programming. If Apple does use Sonder technology to enhance their MacBook experience, it may end up being the second in a two-step modification to their MacBook line. The first has been tipped to be an LED touchscreen at the top of the keyboard – which, at first, would remain relatively standard. This touchscreen would be able to change depending on the application it loads, controlling functionality of the notebook therein. If Apple implements either a touchscreen above the keyboard or a whole new keyboard with hyper-interactive keys and functionality, we’re in for a change. A change of epic proportions, along the lines of the change Steve Jobs addressed in the video above as he explained the company’s first touchscreen interface. We’re in for a change not just for the MacBook, but of our expectations of what a keyboard on a notebook computer can do. Rumors suggest that October 27th could be the date of the Apple event where a new MacBook Pro (or just MacBook) is set to be revealed. As 9to5Mac suggests, that’s just two days after what very well may be a slightly “disappointing” iPhone sales quarterly earnings call.

Follow TechnoBuffalo We’re closing in on the end of the year at a pretty rapid pace. Before we know it we’ll be knee-deep in holiday shopping season. While we’ve seen plenty of exciting gadgets launch this year, a few more are coming. Here are a several we’re most excited about. 1. New MacBook Pro laptops We still think Apple will launch new a MacBook Pro by the end of the year. Thanks to reporting from 9to5Mac, we’re expecting new processors (finally), a special OLED bar above the keyboard and a new design. Earlier rumors suggested it might arrive as soon as October, but Apple hasn’t sent out invites for any sort of event. The computers may launch in tandem with a new MacBook Air, a computer that’s also expected to get a refresh. This is particularly important given Apple hasn’t refreshed the MacBook Pro in ages. The computers still run on older Intel processors and are generally getting long in the tooth. It’s important for Apple to get these computers out, given that its competitors are already using new Kaby lake chips. 2. Microsoft Surface all-in-one computer Microsoft is hosting an event on October 26. All signs point to the company’s first Surface-branded all-in-one computer. According to ZDNets Mary Jo Foley, it’s code named “Cardinal” inside Microsoft. We expect the Surface all-in-one to ship in several sizes with touchscreen displays. Our bet is it will run Windows 10 Anniversary and offer Surface Pen support, too. This will be the first Microsoft Surface all-in-one. Until now, the Surface branding has only appeared on the company’s Surface Pro tablets and Surface Book laptop computers. One question we have: is there that much demand for this sort of product? 3. Oculus Touch The Xbox One controller, while wonderful, doesn’t meet the demands of virtual reality entirely. The medium needs motion control. This December, Oculus will have motion control for sale when Oculus Touch launches. The input pair will sell for $199 starting on December 6. We’ve used them at conventions and events before, and the $199 price tag is worth it. The Oculus Touch is a fine piece of hardware. 4. Surface Pro, Surface Book refreshes The Surface Pro and Surface Book are ready for new hardware. Word on the street is Microsoft isn’t going to offer full-on refreshes. Expect a smaller update. We’re betting on new processors in both computers but not complete design swaps. Most reports have suggested Microsoft isn’t going to make a big deal out of these computers, which means we might not hear them discussed much (if at all) during Microsoft’s event. We’re huge fans of these computers, though, so even a marginal update is exciting. 5. Huawei Mate 9 Huawei has an event on November 3 where we expect the Chinese smartphone maker to unveil the new Mate 9 flagship. Pictures leaked earlier this week point to two models, including one that looks eerily similar to the recalled Galaxy Note 7. Look for a curved Quad HD display, gobs of RAM, plenty of storage, a Kirin 960 processor and Android 7.0 Nougat. The Huawei Mate 9 is unlikely to launch immediately on U.S. carriers. Instead, we expect it to make its debut in Asia and Europe. If we’re lucky, we’ll get an unlocked model here, too. 6. HTC Bolt This one might not launch before the end of the year. The HTC Bolt has been circling around the rumor mill recently. It’s expected to make its debut on Sprint, at least according to a leaked press image. Other features should include Android 7.0 Nougat and HTC Sense 8.0 software. Given that HTC introduced the HTC 10 this spring, it’s possible the HTC Bolt won’t launch until 2017. Given the increase in leaks, however, anything seems possible. 7. PlayStation VR Call us for cheating if you want. PlayStation VR is officially out today. Fine. You win. Sony’s virtual reality headset marks the third major effort for the medium this year. It presents the lowest cost option, not counting mobile variants like Gear VR, and it earned attention from gamers everywhere. We’re excited for another source of VR gaming. Oculus and Vive are great inputs, but we’re hoping Sony’s clout as a game maker and publisher pushes PSVR to new heights. 8. Made by Google Gadgets We’ll bundle these all together. We’re excited for all of the new “Made by Google” products that are launching soon. That includes the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL on October 20, followed by the Chromecast Ultra, Google Wifi, Google Home and Google Daydream View VR. Each of these is exciting in its own right, but we’re most excited about the phones. They’ll introduce Google Assistant in Android 7.1 Nougat, Google’s smartest-ever voice-controller artificial intelligence. Assistant will also be accessible through Google Home, the company’s take on the Amazon Echo. And, even more exciting, the smartphones will power Google Daydream View VR, a new headset that’ll compete with Samsung’s Gear VR. All of these products are slated to launch by the end of this year. 9. LG V20 Last but not least, the LG V20 will launch by the end of this month. It’s the very first Android Nougat phone (at least it was the first announced with Nougat) and features LG’s unique secondary display. It’s one of the few flagships with a removable battery and expandable storage, plus it offers top-notch audio and visual features including a powerful DAC and a Quad HD screen. With the Galaxy Note 7 out of commission, this is LG’s time to shine.

They don’t have to stay forgotten. Apple and Google are both applying a form of artificial intelligence called “machine learning” to organize your pictures and video – and along the way, help you rediscover last year’s vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. Google and Apple are using “machine learning” to help you organize your photos and video easier. Google Apple’s tools are part of last month’s iOS 10 system update for iPhones and iPads. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organize these memories – and Google signaled last week that it will only get smarter. And on Wednesday, Google introduced additional features for rediscovery. Here’s a look at how they take you down memory lane: Apple’s memories Apple’s new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party. Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. This isn’t just a slideshow. There’s slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. When you’re ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file – so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. For me, Apple’s app created a “Florida to Illinois” package for a three-week trip in January and one for a day trip to Philadelphia last November. But Apple goes beyond date and location. Apple created a “Together” package for shots with family over the past two years. It also created an “At The Beach” package with beach photos since 2013. Other scenic themes could include mountains, lakes and sunsets. Apple offers up to three new Memories a day. You can create more based on photos you add to an album and generate new automated ones by scrolling down to “Related.” You can also add or delete images within Memories – in my experience, a few included mundane screenshots I had to get rid of. Nothing will ever replace the human touch. But let’s face it, even though I keep meaning to organize my photos, I never find the time. The machine-generated selections aren’t necessarily ones I’d choose myself, but with a small amount of tweaking, they’re presentable and will tide me over until I get around to catching up manually ... someday. Google’s Assistant Google Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout . Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so that they resemble as a moving image . Unlike typical “GIF” animation files, Google applies its magic to align successive shots, so buildings and bridges look steady – without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. Google’s Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation – although you can create your own from scratch. (That does defeat the purpose of letting the robots do the work, though.) Sharing is easy and doesn’t require recipients to have Google Photos. The results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots. The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes, such as following a kid growing up. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google’s choices aren’t necessarily ones I’d make, if only I had the time. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones to check out. I also enjoyed a feature called “Rediscover this day.” Google will automatically create collages from shots taken on a day, say, two years ago. On Wednesday, Google said it will apply that to people, too, so you’ll get collages of you with a specific friend or family member. Searching Apple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple’s version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. Google is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognize the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities (you can merge them, and things will be fine after that). Google has an edge over Apple in part because it taps its powerful servers to process photos. Apple leaves all the machine thinking to your device as a privacy measure. But Apple says it also favors being right more than complete to reduce the work people need to do to fix things. Being wrong can also have consequences: Google had to apologize last year after its software got too aggressive and mistakenly labeled two black people as gorillas. Storage To free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you’re online. Google Photos offers unlimited online storage of photos at up to 16 megapixels and videos at 1080p high definition – good enough for most people. It will compress larger photos, or you can store the original and have it count toward your Google Drive limit, which starts at 15 gigabytes for free. Apple’s iCloud Photo Library requires paying once you exceed 5 gigabytes, which is enough for a few thousand photos. © 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

To be sure, Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.'s (OTCMKTS: SSNLF) headaches of the past six weeks have given Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock a boost. To catch you up: Samsung was forced to suspend sales of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 on Aug. 31, less than two weeks after the smartphone went on sale, following reports of exploding devices. Attempts to fix the problem failed, forcing Samsung to pull the Galaxy Note 7 entirely on Oct. 11. The entire saga was seen as a positive for Apple stock, which began selling its own new flagship, the iPhone 7, on Sept. 16. CFRA analyst Angelo Zino said he expects the Samsung disaster to boost iPhone sales by more than 14 million units in the September quarter. And the AAPL stock price most definitely has jumped up as the Samsung saga has played out. Apple stock is up nearly 11% since Aug. 31 and is trading at a 10-month high. Related: Apple Stock Could Get a Lift from Buying One of These Companies But the Samsung news wasn't happening in a vacuum. Several U.S. carriers reported very strong pre-sales in the days after the iPhone 7's Sept. 8 unveiling, with T-Mobile US Inc. (Nasdaq: TMUS) and Sprint Corp. (NYSE: S) reporting year-over-year increases of about 400%. That also helped propel the Apple stock price last month. But many seem to have forgotten that the Apple stock price already had strong upward momentum going back to the end of June. Since June 27, AAPL stock is up 22.7%.

Email Print Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Tweet Home â Business Consumer Reports: A guide to mobile money Posted: 10/13/16, 10:11 AM EDT | Updated: on 10/13/2016 # Comments New technologies are making the convenience of living cash-free a reality. But consumers need to understand the trade-offs of abandoning paper money entirely. Consumer Reports offers this overview. -- Mobile Wallets What do they do? Let you pay for purchases at physical retail stores and online. Noteworthy brands. Android Pay, Apple Pay, PayPal, Samsung Pay. Advertisement Cost. No direct fees. What Consumer Reports likes. Apple Pay is now accepted at 3 million stores in the United States because retailers are equipped with new EMV chip card readers that also have near-field communication (NFC) technology. Android Pay and Apple Pay need NFC to transact with cash registers. Samsung Pay can be used at more than 10 million U.S. merchants, because it employs NFC plus a second technology that lets it communicate via magnetic strip with readers that don’t have functioning NFC. Caveats. PayPal is mostly for online shopping and has very limited acceptance at retail stores. Apple Pay works only on certain, more recent iPhones; Samsung Pay works only on certain Samsung devices. -- Electronic Toll Tags What do they do? Let you pay for highway, express lane, bridge and tunnel tolls, as well as parking at some airports. Noteworthy brands. EXpressToll, E-ZPass, FasTrak, Good To Go!, MnPASS, SunPass, TxTag. Cost. No fees beyond the toll itself. What Consumer Reports likes. Commuters can knock 20 minutes to an hour off their daily drive, says J.J. Eden, president of the Alliance for Toll Interoperability. No stopping. No need to scramble for cash or change. Caveats. High traffic volume can clog up even the toll tag lanes. And now the discounts, used to lure new customers, are starting to go away. -- Person-to-Person (P2P) Payments What do they do? Let you send money to another person via the app, email or text. Noteworthy brands. BBVA/Dwolla, Chase QuickPay, clearXchange, Facebook Payments in Messenger, Popmoney, Snapcash, Square Cash and Venmo. Cost. Usually recipients never pay, and fees for sending vary from free to up to 3 percent or more if paid for with a credit card or some debit cards. What Consumer Reports likes. It’s super easy. Can transfer money fast (but see caveats). All the services take steps to ensure security. Caveats. How quickly recipients get their money varies, depending on the service. For example, money moves instantly via Facebook Payments in Messenger and by clearXchange, but your bank may take up to five business days to make the funds available to you. -- Branded Payment Apps What do they do? Let you pay for purchases only at the merchant brand’s physical stores and service providers, and their online counterparts. Noteworthy brands. Dunkin’ Donuts, Lyft, PayByPhone, Starbucks, Uber, Wal-Mart Pay. Cost. Generally no direct fees. What Consumer Reports likes. These apps combine payment, loyalty programs and ordering capabilities. Uber automatically charges you for your ride. PayByPhone lets you extend parking meter minutes from wherever you are. Caveats. Can be used for only one merchant brand. You can’t pay if your phone runs out of power. Subscribe to Home Delivery for only $2.50 per week!

While the Pixel and Pixel XL have most of the same specs, Apple pulled out a few more stops in its 7 Plus flagship. Size The Pixel isn't so XL next to the iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone is a few millimeters taller and wider than its Google-made counterpart. Weight The iPhone is not just bigger, it's also more dense, weighing in at 11-percent more than the Pixel. That's not enough to break your back, but it is quite a bit of difference as far as two similarly sized smartphones go. Build These phones don't push any boundaries when it comes to construction. While we're not exactly excited about seeing another take on a streamlined aluminum unibody, we're not complaining about it, either. Colors The iPhone has more color variants than Google's flagships, though the Pixel's blue version stands out from the neutral-and-metallic crowd. Water resistance You don't have to kiss your iPhone goodbye if it accidentally goes for a swim. The IP67 rating means it can withstand immersion in up to one meter of water for as long as 30 minutes. On the other hand, Google is a little behind the curve when it comes to water resistance. Display size The Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus both have 5.5-inch phablet-sized displays. Display resolution Yes, the Pixel XL display has more pixels. Its pixel density is 28-percent greater than the iPhone 7 Plus display, which will come in handy for powering a virtual reality headset (read on). Still, there are other qualities – white balance, contrast, color saturation – that make the iPhone's display quite lovely. Display type Apple is one of the few smartphone manufacturers clinging to IPS technology. Google follows the herd and opts for AMOLED, with its truer blacks and saturated colors. Pressure-sensitive display All current iPhones (with the exception of the SE, which is a bit of a throwback) have pressure-sensitive displays, which gives you more ways to interact with the touchscreen beyond simple tapping. Apple dubs this technology "3D Touch". Camera megapixels The two phones have equal resolution in the rear-facing cameras, but the Pixel packs a bigger punch in the front camera. Read: sharper selfies. Dual lens camera The iPhone 7 Plus has a killer camera feature that the Pixel XL does not: a dual-lens rear camera that enables 2x optical zoom and increased digital zoom. Check out our iPhone 7 Plus review for some photo examples. Camera aperture (rear) This year, we saw several smartphone manufacturers grow increasingly competitive in the race for larger camera apertures. Among other things, larger apertures let in more light, helping you get better captures when environmental light is low. The lower the f-stop, the bigger the aperture, so the iPhone 7 Plus has an advantage here. Optical image stabilization Optical image stabilization, or OIS, is a kind of camera engineering that counteracts the shakiness of your hands while you're taking pictures. It's absent from the Pixel, but it's a nice addition to the iPhone's low-light shooting arsenal. Battery The Pixel XL's jumbo battery trounces the iPhone's in size. There are many other factors in determining battery life, but the Pixel XL does seem to have more staying power overall. According to Google, the Pixel XL offers up to 32 hours of talk time or 14 hours of internet use/video playback. By Apple's count, the 7 Plus can dole out up to 21 hours of talk time, 13 hours of internet use, or 14 hours of video playback. Fast charging The Pixel can get up to 7 hours of use from a 15-minute charge. iPhone charging is not so expedient. Wireless charging Neither flagship can be charged without a cable: USB-C for the Pixel and a Lightning cord for the iPhone. Processor Both phones have ample processing power, but the iPhone 7 Plus clocks in faster. RAM Apple finally upped the RAM in its fleet of flagships, but the iPhone 7 Plus still has less memory than the Pixel XL. Storage Both phones are available with 32 or 128 gigabytes of storage, which should be ample for most users. Apple also offers a capacious 256-gigabyte option for power users. microSD If you were crossing your fingers for an iPhone alternative with external storage, you'll need to look elsewhere. The iPhone 7 Plus is not expandable, which is no surprise, but many had different hopes for Google's first phablet. VR-ready If you want to join the masses already using mobile virtuality reality (VR) headsets, steer clear of the iPhone. The Pixel XL, on the other hand, is compatible with Google's recently launched and fairly affordable Daydream View. Headphone jack Even though Apple has been liberal with the axe, headphone jacks have not gone the way of the dinosaur just yet. Pixel XL has a dedicated jack for your ear candy. Fingerprint sensor The fingerprint sensor is becoming ubiquitous: We can't think of one mid-range or high-end phone released this year that doesn't have a fingerprint sensor. The Pixel's sensor is on the back, and the iPhone's sensor is built into the home button on the front. Home button Like most Android phones, Pixel XL has an onscreen home button with a back button on the left and a recent apps button on the right. The iPhone 7 Plus has a uniquely Apple solid-state home button with haptic feedback for your pressing pleasure. It's positioned below the display, so it doesn't take up any onscreen real estate. Mobile payments No surprises here – Pixel XL's equipped with Android Pay, and the iPhone 7 Plus has Apple Pay. Merchants that are mobile payment-ready can often accept either, since they have similar requirements. Virtual assistant The Pixel and Pixel XL are the first phones with Google Assistant built in. Google Assistant is being billed as a more intelligent and powerful alternative to Siri, so we will be sure to test its full capabilities in our upcoming Pixel review. Operating system The iPhone 7 Plus launched with iOS 10, but since Apple pushes software updates onto all iPhones, you can count on that operating system being continuously updated until the phone goes kaput. Not all Android phones get the latest and greatest software updates, but the Pixel will be at the front of the line. As a Google-branded phone, it launches with the brand new Android 7.1 Nougat and will receive all updates for at least two years and security updates for at least three years. Release Apple released the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus just weeks before Google launched the Pixel and Pixel XL. Starting price (full retail) Like their little brothers the Pixel and iPhone 7, Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus have the same price points, which suggests that Google intends these phones to be direct competitors. The 32 GB models are $769 and the 128 GB models are $869, while the 256 GB iPhone is $969. While the base-level flagships seem neck-and-neck, the differences between these phablets are little more distinct. iPhone 7 Plus has an advantage in terms of camera capability and water resistance, but the Pixel XL is outfitted for perks like VR, proper headphones and fast charging.

It’s a design flaw in Apple’s handling of text messages, its favoring of iMessage over SMS. If you turn data roaming off on your phone when travelling, you may not be able to get text messages reliably. If you have an iPhone suitably logged in to Apple’s cloud services, other iPhones (and Apple stuff in general) will prefer to deliver text messages via iMessage instead of SMS. You see this in the phone UI: the messages are blue, not green. In general iMessage is a good thing. It’s cheaper and has more features. The problem is Apple’s iMessage delivery requires the receiving phone have an Internet connection via WiFi or cellular data. If you have no WiFi at the moment and have data roaming turned off, your phone is offline. And so Apple can’t deliver to you via iMessage. They seem to buffer sent messages for when you come back online. Which is too bad, because your phone could still receive the message via SMS. Unfortunately iMessage doesn’t have an SMS delivery fallback. In practice this design flaw meant I had to leave data roaming turned on all the time because I needed to reliably get messages from another iPhone user. Which then cost me about $30 in uncontrollable data fees from “System Services”. Some $15 was spent by Google Photos spamming location lookups (a bug?), another $15 receiving some photo iMessages from a well-meaning friend. Admittedly the SMS fallback I’d prefer would also cost some money, but I think significantly less in my case. There’s a broader problem with iMessage which is that once a phone number is registered with it, iPhones forever more will not send SMS to that number. Apple got sued over this, so now they have a way to deregister your number. tech • bad   2016-10-13 14:29 Z Nelson's Weblog • tech • bad

Still more are worried about losing the expensive wireless headphones that Apple recommends as an accessory. But M3D , a company that makes 3D printers, might just have the answer. The company has knocked out a pair of earrings with a tiny basket attached to them. The idea being that when you're done listening to your headphones, you can just drop them into the baskets and carry them with you.

Apple has been keen to stress that the pricey AirPods have been designed to sit comfortably in your ears. Speaking with ABC News' Robin Roberts about the concerns consumers might have, the company's big cheese Tim Cook said he "never personally had one fall out since using them" and has used them on treadmills.

"There's a little case that you put the AirPods in and magnetically they're sort of sucked down into the case," Cook told Roberts.

According to a report from 9to5Mac, discussions took place through Foxconn’s International Holding’s (FIH) Incubator program, and E Ink Holdings was also in the discussions. A concept would be similar to the rumor of Apple’s OLED touch bar in the upcoming MacBook Pro refresh, but with all the keys, and all being individual keys as opposed to touch keys. Such a concept would be similar to the touchscreen on the iPhone back in 2007, replacing permanent, written keys with dynamic keys. Tags: Keyboard, Magic Keyboard About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology. He conceits himself by religiously rocking the Apple brand. You can find him on Twitter @iPeterCao.

Samsung Pay uses other security measures, including fingerprint authentication to provide secure payments. With Samsung Pay technology embedded, the device is constantly monitored for signs of malicious attacks or vulnerabilities. Even if your device is ever compromised, your card information is still safely encrypted within a separate and secure data vault. In participating stores, Apple Pay® will work with iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch, upon availability. Within apps, Apple Pay® is compatible with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3.

The refreshed laptops will reportedly feature an OLED touch display above the keyboard that changes depending on which application the user has open. Now, it’s been revealed that a similar system could be implemented into an entire Apple keyboard. Reddit user Foxconninsider, who works at Tsinghua University (“like the Chinese MIT”), said such a keyboard was on show at a recent closed-doors event on campus, hosted by Apple supplier Foxconn. Australian startup Sonder was present at the event, showing off a prototype next generation Apple Magic Keyboard that features an E-Ink display on every key. These can change depending on a user’s needs, bringing up different languages, images, and shortcuts. The device could also have many applications when if comes to gaming, especially with titles that use a lot of keys, such as Elite: Dangerous. Sonder revealed its backlit, e-display keyboard last year. The company confirmed to Trusted Reviews that it is closing procurement contracts with three third-party laptop companies “to integrate our technology into their products.” The Redditor claims a Foxconn executive said Apple’s Procurement Board “was closing an acquisition” for Sonder. Foxconninsider said he also saw the MacBook Pro’s OLED panel at the show, described as the “new Macbook keyboard module.” Reddit mods have verified Foxconninsider’s identity, but the keyboard is an early prototype designed for testing, so it’s not guaranteed to appear in any future Apple laptops or as a standalone product. An Apple spokesperson said: “Sonder has been in discussions with Apple’s procurement board regarding Sonder’s laptop module. Foxconn International Holdings and E Ink Holdings – both strategic partners of Sonder Design Pty. Ltd. are assisting with the above discussions."

It's also claimed the employees were stealing images from iPhones that were being repaired. The original report in Brisbane’s Courier-Mail claimed the staff secretly took photos of female co-workers and shoppers without their knowledge. These were added to a sharing ring, which reportedly contained over 100 intimate images, including close-ups of women’s chests and behinds. The pictures were then rated out of 10 by the four employees involved. The publication also states that female iPhone owners who brought their devices in for repair had photos copied from the handsets. It was only when a staff member noticed a store technician looking through a customer’s phone in the repair room that things came to light. The Carindale store brought in an HR executive from overseas to look into the matter. Apple said that based on its investigation thus far, it has found no evidence that customer data or photos were inappropriately transferred or anyone had been photographed without consent. However, the company did say that several employees have been terminated as a result of its findings – so it must have discovered some wrongdoings. “Apple believes in treating everyone equally and with respect, and we do not tolerate behavior that goes against our values," the company said in a statement. The chance that a firm could steal or accidentally erase photos from a phone is a concern for many people. Not everyone knows to make backups of their images before sending a handset in for repair. Just last year, Apple had to pay a UK man $1810 in compensation and $1166 in court costs after one of its stores wiped photos of his honeymoon and 15 years worth of contacts when his iPhone was sent in for repair. This is the second time an Australian Apple store has created unwelcome headlines for the company. In November 2015, several black teenage students were told to leave an Apple store in Melbourne because staff thought they “might steal something.” Related Reads Black students kicked out of Australian Apple store because "they might steal something" Australian court rejects Apple's appeal for 'App Store' trademark Australian consumer group issues court order forcing Apple to offer 24-month product warranties 16 comments 105 interactions Now Read This… Apple quickly removes crime alert app Vigilante from its store due to content concerns Smartwatch shipments were down 51.6% last quarter Popular 193 comments How Much RAM Should You Get? 4GB vs. 8GB vs. 16GB Tested The Best Smartphones: Google nails it 11 comments Hands-On with Google Daydream and Daydream View 54 comments Woman facing jail for selling ceviche through Facebook group is overreacting, says prosecutor Load Comments 16 ...

October 13 AAPL: 116.98 -0.36 Comment: Beats 1 station deserves an Apple Music-like revamp in year 2 Chance Miller - 1 month ago @ChanceHMiller Apple Music Beats 1 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit When Apple first revealed Apple Music, one of the aspects I was most excited about was the always-on Beats 1 streaming station. I wrote in detail how it was the feature that could help Apple Music stand out from the competition. Throughout the past year and a half, however, it feels as if Apple has seriously neglected Beats 1, seemingly giving it no attention since the initial unveil. With Apple not releasing direct listenership data for Beats 1, you have to wonder what is being said about the initiative behind the closed doors of Apple… Apple Music was one of the central points of iOS 10 and the changes that came with it. The app got a major design overhaul, boasting improved discovery and playlist features, but demoting original Apple Music features like Connect and even Beats 1. The iOS 10 Music app makes Beats 1 harder to access and doesn’t actively promote it. Despite this, the actual content of Beats 1 is still alive and kicking, and there’s still an insane amount of musical talent and knowledge behind the service. Zane Lowe is still heading up the initiative, while celebrities like Elton John, Pharrell, and Drake are all trying their respective hand at hosting shows. Additionally, you still have Ebro Darden hosting out of New York and Julie Adenuga hosting out of London. This makes me wonder, is Apple planning something big for Beats 1 in the future? How could it possibly justify the money it’s pouring into Beats 1 without promoting it at every possible opportunity? Personally, I have found myself listening to Beats 1 less and less as time has progressed since its initial launch. I remember the day it first went live, Zane Lowe’s hot mic and all, and everyone on Twitter being tuned into the debut. Since then, I’ve seen fewer and fewer people talk of Beats 1, both on social networks like Twitter and especially in real life. The reason for the lack of interest from non-tech savvy people has to be primarily due to the fact that Apple has never really marketed Beats 1 to the public. Despite having A-list interviews with artists like Drake, Ed Sheeran, Eminem, and others, Apple has largely focused its Apple Music marketing on things like offline listening, the three-month free trial, and other discoverability features offered. While there was that massive Times Square ad prior to Beats 1’s launch, it’s been quiet since then. One of my biggest reasons for not listening to Beats 1 is that I simply either forget that it’s there or I’m unaware of what’s going to be on that day. There’s one big solution to this: push notifications. This is something that I and many others have been requesting since the launch of Beats 1. To me, it seems absurd that there’s no way to be notified when artist you like is either playing on Beats 1 or will be interviewed. For instance, if Coldplay is going to appear on Beats 1, I should be able to receive a push notification informing me of the appearance, as well as allowing me to quickly jump to the Beats 1 area of the Music app. Imagine the growth Beats 1’s listenership would see if a notification was sent out that said, “Interview with Drake about to begin, tune into Beats 1 now.” It’s something that I can’t for life of me believe that Apple hasn’t added in any of the updates to Apple Music since it’s original launch. With listenership likely slowing, you also have to wonder what the future holds for Beats 1. While it has been largely quiet the Beats 1 front in terms of rumors, there have been a few whispers as to potential new features coming to the service. Last year, it was reported that Apple had received trademarks for additional Beats channels (i.e. Beats 2, Beats, 3, Beats 4, etc). The initial though with this was that Apple would use the additional channels to either be genre-specific or include content like news and sports. As of now, nearly a year later, nothing has come of those rumors. I’d go as far as to say Apple’s lack of attention towards Beats 1 is hurting its chances at continuing to secure big-name interviews and song premiers. Artists always want to go where the most listeners are, and while Beats 1 is in the pocket of every iPhone user, Apple doesn’t do enough to promote it to take advantage of its reach. Thus, artists are likely to premier songs on other platforms. What can Apple do to push Beats 1 to the next level? Essentially, the service needs an Apple Music-like overhaul. The talent certainly there with Zane Lowe, but more needs to be done to take advantage of that asset. The service needs to be marketed much better, for one. This includes better placement in the Music app, as well as more prominent TV and print advertising. The aforementioned push notifications would also greatly help Apple take advantage of its reach for Beats 1, as well, although the notifications would likely need to be opt-in. One thing that is especially weird to me is how this year’s Apple Music festival was not plastered all over Beats 1. That would have been a great way for Apple to incentivize for people to listen to the service, but instead, the festival was streamed separately. Additionally, Eddy Cue himself interviewed Bruce Springsteen recently, but instead of streaming on Beats 1, the interview was streamed on Facebook. The morale of the story here is that Apple clearly doesn’t have all its eggs in one basket. There’s a clear fragmentation in how Apple is directing its attention. So much so that Apple Music feels incredibly neglected just a year and a few months after it original launch. How often to you stream Beats 1?

Best Buy Selling iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus At $50 To $100 Markup Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Best Buy Selling iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus At $50 To $100 Markup Image courtesy of YouTube October 13, 2016 1:22 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler Checking the price best buy iphone iPhone 7 device Paying More retail full price msrp In general, retailers sell new Apple products at the sticker price set by the tech giant, but if you want to buy a new iPhone through the Best Buy website you might end up paying up to $100 more than what you’d pay elsewhere. 9 To 5 Mac reported Thursday morning that Best Buy is charging $50 to $100 more for the new iPhone 7 devices. A look at Best Buy’s website shows some confusing pricing for the starter 32GB iPhone 7: While the installment pricing offer of $27.04/month for 24 months comes out to the actual $649 price of the phone, for some reason Best Buy is charging $699 if you want to buy the device outright. Similarly, Best Buy’s installment price for the iPhone 7 Plus is the same as Apple’s $769 sticker price, but the buy now full price is $869 — $100 more than what you should be paying: Apple’s website confirms that the company has not changed the retail prices on either of these devices: 9 to 5 Mac notes that the markup price at Best Buy isn’t entirely unusual, as the company has done the same with previous version of the iPhone. While the markup could have been the result of a supply and demand issue — some iPhones were difficult to find when first released — the devices are now more readily available at Apple stores and online. As 9 to 5 points out, the discrepancy between the installment price and Best Buy’s price is likely due to the fact that the wireless providers determine the installment rates. So if you’re going to purchase a phone through Best Buy, that installment plan seems to be the only way to get the better price. Consumerist has reached out to Best Buy for comment on the pricing differences. We’ll update this post when we hear back.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Download: tvOS 10.0.1 Beta 3 Now Available By Uzair Ghani Posted 1 month ago 10Shares Share Tweet Submit The third developer beta of tvOS 10.0.1 for Apple TV 4 is now available to download alongside iOS 10.1 Developer Beta 3. tvOS 10.0.1 Beta 3 for Apple TV 4 Released Alongside iOS 10.1 Developer Beta 3, Apple has seeded the third beta of tvOS 10.0.1 to developers as well. The download is available over the air and directly from the Apple Developer Program website, both. If you have the beta installed already then you should take the OTA route to keep yourself up to date. In order to update right away, first of all turn on your Apple TV 4 unit. Once it is done booting up, open the Settings app. Scroll all the way down to System and then select Software Updates. Download and install all the available software updates for your Apple TV unit. And since the Apple TV 4 packs some powerful hardware therefore you can expect the installation to go through at a good pace. But remember not to tinker around or play with your Apple TV unit during the download and installation process. It’s important that everything flows extremely smooth. If you’re a developer (or not) and want to give tvOS 10.0.1 a try on your Apple TV 4, then you can download the pre-release bits from the Apple Developer Program website. Furthermore, since you’ll be restoring the software using iTunes, therefore you need to source yourself a USB Type-A to Type-C cable in order to connect your Apple TV 4 with your computer. You can easily find one of these on Amazon or even at your local retailer, if you’re lucky enough. Advertisement Wrap Up Whether you’re a developer or not, you should keep your Apple TV 4 updated at all times. This ensures you get the maximum performance benefit out of the latest software release. And if you want to take things up a notch, then you can take the more difficult route of installing tvOS software every single time using iTunes. We will not recommend this route though, but in return you’ll get a piece of software that functions like a boss! Download tvOS 10.0.1 Final for Apple TV 4 - Direct Link Who doesn’t want that, right?

You can pry my gun emoji from my cold, dead hands Daniel P. Finney , dafinney@dmreg.com 12:04 p.m. CDT October 13, 2016 The gun emoji has been replaced with a squirt gun. (Photo: File photo) The terrible day that stalwart defender of the Second Amendment, the National Rifle Association, has predicted for decades arrived last month: They came for our guns. Well, it was just one gun, and a cartoon one at that, but no quarter must be given in any effort to remove our guns, which, as an NRA president has famously said, must be pried from our "cold, dead hands." The latest version of mobile software for Apple iPhones, released last month, removed the pistol emoji and replaced it with a squirt gun. Before the update, Americans enjoyed the freedom to send a cartoon drawing of a gray and black revolver, similar to a .38-caliber Colt Detective Special, to whomever they wanted via text or the web. This cartoon symbol of strength and defense served notice to all that we were prepared to stand our ground. Note the hypocrisy of Apple, which shuns its gun emoji, yet keeps emojis for a bow and arrow, a knife and a bomb. What's more, Apple kept an emoji for a deadly carbohydrate-laden plate of spaghetti — without even knowing if the pasta is gluten-free! Apple's move reportedly stems from news stories about schoolchildren threatening classmates and police with digital messages containing gun emojis. Authorities charged a 12-year-old girl in Fairfax, Virginia, with threatening her school in an Instagram post featuring gun, knife and bomb emojis. Police also arrested a Texas teenager for posting a police officer emoji with pistol emojis pointing at his head. Prosecutors eventually dropped the charges. For the record, neither Des Moines Police Chief Dana Wingert nor Amanda Lewis, spokeswoman for Des Moines schools, say they are aware of any threats made with gun emojis. "It's an interesting thought," Wingert said. Gun emojis.  (Photo: File photo.) Fortunately, capitalist and patriot Michael Spano, an app developer from Florida, has come to the rescue of the disarmed emoji community. He’s written an app called Gun Emojis that returns cartoon firearms to texts and social media posts. His 99-cent app fully stocks your iPhone with an emoji arsenal, complete with semi-automatic handguns, rifles, shotguns and even grenades. So I urge you, my fellow Americans, to download this app. Because as we all know that when you take gun emojis away from law-abiding Americans, only the bad guys will have gun emojis. Daniel P.

Apple subsequently confirmed the talks, but said it did not plan to make an offer to purchase the company at the time. Nevertheless, over the past year, Apple has been recruiting talent away from the company, according to multiple LinkedIn profiles. Imagination Technologies COO John Metcalfe, for example, left the company in June and is now listed as a Senior Director at Apple, where he started in July. Imagination Technologies engineers Dave Roberts, Jonathan Redshaw, and Benjamin Bowman are also now employed by Apple. Likewise, a fourth engineer Simon Nield joined Apple as a Design Manager just this month. A search of former Imagination Technologies employees now working at Apple yields 25 results. Apple poaching employees from Imagination Technologies could be part of its efforts to build out an in-house graphics team. Many of the employees continue to be based in the London, England area, although some have relocated to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California. An anonymous tipster informed us that Apple has established a new team in London to work on GPUs in house, but the information remains unconfirmed. Imagination Technologies traditionally supplies the PowerVR graphics architecture found in Apple's range of iPhones and iPads. Apple has been a licensee and stakeholder in the company since at least 2008, and it became a key investor in mid-2009 when it raised its stake in the firm to 10 percent. In 2014, Imagination Technologies announced an extended licensing agreement with Apple, providing the iPhone maker with access to current and future PowerVR graphics and video IP cores as part of a multi-year deal. These technologies are incorporated into Apple's own A-series chips like the A10 Fusion in iPhone 7. Tag: Imagination Technologies [ 70 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) Kaibelf 5 weeks ago It's not "poaching" if Imagination was cutting jobs and people chose to leave. If a company I work for seems unstable, I'd look elsewhere too. Being blindsided by a layoff isn't in my game plan.

Unquestionably these employees moved because they got a better offer from Apple. As an employee myself, nothing was better for my salary, benefits, and career than having companies compete for me. Being recruited is a good thing. In fact, when Google and Apple secretly agreed not to recruit each other's employees, that was illegal under California law since it suppresses job opportunities and salaries.

Sure takes me back to the IBM / Motorola G-series days and the whole reason Apple went Intel. Now Apple is being hosed by chip makers again. It is no wonder they are exploring the idea of making their own chips. there's not a lot true in this. First and foremost: Apple computers is where it is today because of Apple's halo products, first the iPod and then the iPhone. Prior to the iPhone in particular, Apple computers were extremely niche and small. The brand recognition of Apple has brought a lot of attention to their computer business. If those computers suddenly were spun off to a new company, the liklihood of continued sales as they are today is far far less. Nevermind the fact that Apple computers currently are declining in sales as is, not growing. second: Apple cannot blame intel for being 3+ years behind in their updates. intel has released broadwell and Skylake chips that could be suitable for almost all of their hardware, but have chosen not to take them. Apple will use the excuse "none of them met our requirements" as some ploy to blame Intel, but here's a hint, if not a single manufacturer meets your requirements, but seems to hit 95% of the rest of the PC industries requirements, maybe it's Apple setting unreasonable expectations and its Apple who needs to re-evaluate what they're doing. Most of their current hardware is still on Haswell. There has absolutely been both Broadwell and Skylake chips that could have been used. Apple just decided not to. Apple also has no capability of "making their own chips". What they have is an inhouse design team that has license for ARM instruction set for their designs. All designs are then shipped to a 3rd party FAB to produce. And neither broadwell or Skylake were "A mess". Rating: 6 Votes MacLawyer 5 weeks ago Doesn't seem cricket.

The US corporation can expect to hear from Australian Privacy Commissioner Timothy Pilgrim, who has indicated he wants to know more about the incident. Apple on Thursday said employees at their Carindale store were terminated because of their behaviour but did not specify how many staff were sacked, although media reports suggested four men have lost their jobs. "Based on our investigation thus far, we have seen no evidence that customer data or photos were inappropriately transferred or that anyone was photographed by these former employees," Apple said. "We are investigating a violation of Apple's business conduct policy at our store in Carindale, where several employees have already been terminated as a result of our findings." News Corp has reported they lifted private images off phones, and took explicit and inappropriate photos of female staff and customers, and then rated the women. The sacked employees are also accused of sharing the photos and ranking them out of 10 based on their looks. The breach of protocol was apparently picked up by a staff member who noticed a technician fossicking through a customer's phone while it was being repaired. © AAP 2016 queensland Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

The Diamondbacks’ girls team had a dominant afternoon with McKenzie Cornell leading the way. Serrano scored 19 points to top second-place Apple Valley by 39 points. Cornell took first place with a time of 19 minutes, 42 second. Apple Valley’s Lindsay Calderon came in second at 19:45. Serrano runners took the next five spots — Elizabeth Martin (19:51); Maribel Aguilar (19:53), Julia Brenner (20:04), Madison Elliott (20:35) and Kendra Swatzell (20:39) — in close succession to seal the victory. In the boys race, Jhavahn Holston ran a fast 15:47 time to top Sultana’s Manny Ramirez by 10 seconds. Holston’s time was 15 seconds off the record at Serrano’s home course. Apple Valley’s Daniel Rosales ran 15:32 in 2009. But Sultana took places second, third, fifth and six top Serrano 24-52. Sultana’s Uriel Mercado followed Ramirez at 16:17 and teammates Zach Williams (16:46) and Uziel Mercado (16:47) finished a second apart. MRL Finals will be held Nov. 2 at Victor Valley College.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Confirmed: Apple held talks with Sonder on using e-ink for a dynamic Magic Keyboard By Christian Zibreg, Oct 13, 2016 Tweet 7 Comments An exciting story yesterday, based on a sketchy Reddit report, alleged Apple could use dynamic keyboard technology from Australian startup Sonder, part of Foxconn’s International Holding’s Incubator program. It would presumably permit the Cupertino company to engineer a keyboard with a tiny e-ink display on each key so that the layout could change depending on the app being used. British newspaper The Guardian confirmed that discussions between members of Apple’s boss Tim Cook and representatives from Sonder Keyboard indeed took place. “Apple is reportedly closing in on a Australian startup that has pioneered dynamic, customisable Magic keyboards,” reads the report. Apple’s boss Tim Cook reportedly met with Sonder CEO Francisco Serra-Martins. The paper wrote: The Guardian can confirm the Apple CEO, Tim Cook, met with Serra-Martins in China on Wednesday. Foxconn and E Ink Holdings, both strategic partners of Sonder, were assisting in the discussions with Apple. The company is partly owned by third-party companies and is in the middle of raising an investment round. Apple is also rumored to be working on a next-generation MacBook Pro with an OLED strip replacing the row of function keys that would change dynamically depending on the app being used. A full-on keyboard based on keys that with an e-ink display would be awesome, in my personal opinion. Theoretically speaking, switching apps would dynamically change the layout so you would have, for instance, one set of shortcuts for Twitter, another set of keys in a photo editing application and so forth. Simply changing your regional settings would instantly adapt the keyboard layout to different languages, including—why not?—emoji input. Here’s a video showing Sonder’s current e-ink keyboard in action. That $199 keyboard is currently available for preorder on the Sonder website. It uses the same e-ink display technology as Amazon’s Kindle e-reader and can be customized to accommodate any language, shortcut or custom icon. E-ink technology is very power-efficient and allows for unmatched readability. Redditor “Foxconninsider” yesterday said that a keyboard prototype utilizing Sonder technology was shown off at the Incubator Innoconn event at Tsinghua University in Beijing, where she worked. She allegedly spent some hands-on time with the prototype Magic keyboard that she claimed used an adaptive interface developed by Sonder. She said the main differences between Apple’s prototype and the Sonder keyboard shown in the above video was all the keys had a screen and lighting panel, and the display updated instantly with no slow transition from black to white. Here’s an excerpt form her post on Reddit: I work on Tsinghua university campus, it is like the Chinese MIT. It hosted a Foxconn event where I saw the new Macbook keyboard module design and Apple’s 2018 E Ink Magic Keyboard that’s a DFT model. (DFT is design for testing). The startup Sonder makes a smart keyboard module, it has a new magnetic mechanical mechanism and a lit E Ink display which allows for swapping shortcuts and languages etc. I saw it swap between a few programs and languages (English, Japanese, Taiwanese layouts etc). The Foxconn Innoconn Executive said Apple’s PBO (Procurement board office) was closing an acquisition for the startup company that is now registered in Hong Kong for a big return of investment for Foxconn International Holdings and E Ink Holdings. The event was organized by Apple’s favorite manufacturer Foxconn International Holdings. Reddit moderators were able to confirm the report and vouch for the woman’s identity. According to her, Apple will release the keyboard sometime in 2018. Image top of post: Sonder’s $199 Bluetooth e-ink keyboard, due later this year.

Apple: 'No evidence' of photo theft from phones left with store CNET 13/10/2016 Daniel Van Boom © Provided by CNET Apple Store staff found raiding photos from phones of female customers  Apple has investigated the alleged theft of photos from female customers' phones at an Australian Apple Store and stated it found no evidence data was transferred inappropriately. The Australia-based Courier Mail reported this week that employees at an Apple Store in Queensland, Australia, had been fired after they were discovered sharing photos of female customers and employees. Staff at the store, located in Brisbane's Carindale Westfield shopping centre, were reportedly taking photos of female customers and employees, as well as raiding them from phones customers left there for repairs. A worker at the store flagged the issue after discovering one of the alleged perpetrators scrolling through a customer's phone, according to the publication. The original report suggested photos were allegedly part of a sharing ring, with the subject of each shared photo being rated on appearance on a 1 to 10 scale. "We are investigating a violation of Apple's business conduct policy at our store in Carindale, where several employees have already been terminated as a result of our findings," Apple said in a statement. The company added that based on its investigation, "we have seen no evidence that customer data or photos were inappropriately transferred or that anyone was photographed by these former employees."

The US corporation can expect to hear from Australian Privacy Commissioner Timothy Pilgrim, who has indicated he wants to know more about the incident. Apple on Thursday said employees at their Carindale store were terminated because of their behaviour but did not specify how many staff were sacked, although media reports suggested four men have lost their jobs. "Based on our investigation thus far, we have seen no evidence that customer data or photos were inappropriately transferred or that anyone was photographed by these former employees," Apple said. "We are investigating a violation of Apple's business conduct policy at our store in Carindale, where several employees have already been terminated as a result of our findings." News Corp has reported they lifted private images off phones, and took explicit and inappropriate photos of female staff and customers, and then rated the women. The sacked employees are also accused of sharing the photos and ranking them out of 10 based on their looks. The breach of protocol was apparently picked up by a staff member who noticed a technician fossicking through a customer's phone while it was being repaired.

Learn tricks for making the most of the macOS Sierra integration. By Erik Eckel | October 13, 2016, 8:14 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Brandon Vigliarolo/TechRepublic When I first heard Apple was bringing Siri to the Mac, I didn't believe the enhancement would prove that useful. But, properly wielded, Siri proves to be a surprisingly helpful feature. The trick is to know Siri's desktop and laptop capabilities, as well as the feature's limitations. Understand Siri's constraints Don't ask Siri to close an application. She can't—she's not allowed. She'll offer a quick apology, and that's all you get. And, it makes sense—I'm confident Apple precluded the ability for fear of losing unsaved data or accidentally closing an application in the middle of a critical process. You also shouldn't try using Siri in noisy environments because, odds are, she's not going to be able to understand your commands—and, you'll look a little strange talking in public to your computer. But when you're in the privacy of your office or another quiet location where the audio won't prove disruptive to others, Siri will pause background programming long enough to provide a fair shot at speaking commands. I don't recommend leveraging Siri to perform complex tasks, such as editing photos, editing spreadsheets or documents, or composing presentations. It's all about possessing accurate expectations. SEE: Screenshots: A complete roundup of new macOS Sierra features Follow these tips and tricks for using Siri Several options exist for summoning Siri. By default, you can press and hold the Command and Space keys. Or, you can click the Siri icon macOS Sierra Places, by default, within the Dock. Or, you can click the Siri icon from the Mac's menu bar. You can also access Siri from the Applications folder or Launchpad. Open System Preferences and select Siri to customize the keyboard shortcut that summons the feature (Figure A). For example, you can change the Keyboard Shortcut to use the Option and Space keys. You can also adjust the microphone input, specify whether the Siri icon should appear in the menu bar, and enable or disable Siri's voice feedback. Other customization options include changing the voice and language. Figure A Image: Erik Eckel/TechRepublic With Siri configured and activated according to your preferences, you're ready to put her to work. Ask her to open directories. She'll oblige, including for files stored locally on the Mac or in iCloud. If you wish to view files within iCloud, say "Siri, open the iCloud directory." She will open a Finder window displaying the iCloud Drive. Ask her to conduct searches. For example, if you need to know which flights service Toledo, say "Siri, search Safari for flights to Toledo." You can compose and send simple email messages using Siri. Ask her to compose an email message, and she'll begin by asking to whom the message should be sent. After you provide the recipient, Siri requests the subject text, then the body, after which she asks you to confirm you wish to send the message. For quick and easy messages, the feature is surprisingly adept. Or, if you need to confirm the volatility for GE stock, say "Siri, what's the beta for GE stock?" She'll tell you she can't get "beta," but she will display the stock ticker for GE, which you can then click to obtain the beta (i.e., the measure of an investment's volatility). It's still way quicker than moving the mouse to select and open Safari, moving your hands to the keyboard, typing the keystrokes to spell GE stock beta, pressing the Enter key, returning to the mouse, and clicking the GE stock search result. You can use additional shortcuts by leveraging Siri to search for documents, open applications, adjust the volume, immediately access System Preferences, and similar common tasks. Siri can also set appointments, create reminders, draft a Note, and create lists. You can save time using Siri to look up word definitions and synonyms. Just say "Siri, do you know of another word for..." and state the word for which you're seeking a synonym. Or, say "Siri, please show me the definition for..." and speak the name of the word Siri should look up. Siri will promptly open a window presenting the information you seek. Try Siri in macOS Sierra The next time you find yourself in a quiet location where you can speak without interrupting others, give Siri a try. I suspect you'll be surprised by how powerful the initially seemingly innocuous assistance proves, even if you must occasionally make adjustments for some expected limitations.

UK Bans Apple Watch from Cabinet Meetings Amid Fears of Cyber-Espionage GO UK officials take "Better safe than sorry!" approach Oct 13, 2016 16:25 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  The UK government has banned ministers from wearing Apple Watches at cabinet meetings, amid fear that the devices might be compromised by foreign intelligence agents. According to an inside source cited by British newspaper The Telegraph, UK officials are afraid that hackers might use the devices to spy on secret cabinet meetings, in order to gather intelligence on Britain's upcoming political moves. The UK government had previously barred ministers from coming to cabinet meetings with mobile phones a few years back, under the same fears. Michael Gove, former Secretary of State for Education and later Secretary of State for Justice, was a famous Apple Watch wearer under former Prime Minister David Cameron. While The Telegraph mentioned only Apple Watch, it is likely that other types of smartwatches might be forbidden as well. Despite sales declining for the first time this summer, smartwatches remain a must-have accessory in many social circles. "The Russians are trying to hack everything," the source said, revealing the UK government's fear of Russian-backed hackers, who have been lately faulted for numerous hacks, including the US Democratic Party, US voter registration databases, the World Anti-Doping Agency, and more. Of course, the UK also fears other countries as well, such as North Korea, China, and Iran, who are also often cited as the source of various cyber-espionage campaigns. #Apple Watch#iWatch#Apple#cyber-espionage#UK subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news 2015 TV5Monde Hack Almost Destroyed TV Station's Infrastructure US Government Blames Russia for Recent Hacks, Fails to Provide Any Evidence US Government Arrests NSA Contractor Accused of Stealing Classified Data Russia Offers to Stop WADA Hackers, but for a Price Five Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked Microsoft Releases Interactive Mail Notifications for All Windows 10 Users KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive Vendetta Online 1.8.396 MMORPG Released for Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android    Apple Watch banned from UK cabinet meetings Related Apps TrustPort Tools: Encrypt sensitive data, clean temporary files, permanently delete activity traces, and create secure archives of your documents with this software suite Free Firewall: Protects your computer against all kinds of threats, preventing suspicious applications from accessing the Internet and sending data back home KCleaner: Find and remove unused files to free up space such as web browser cache or Windows installer files, optionally shred data, schedule automatic tasks, and set the PC to shut down afterward Cryptomator: Keep your cloud-stored files as safe as possible with the help of this platform-independent and user-friendly encryption application VPN Gate Client Plug-in: A plugin for SoftEther VPN whose main purpose is to easily hide your online identity via a network of relay proxy servers that conceal your IP address Prevent Restore: Take privacy protecting to the extreme by making deleted files unrecoverable with the help of this streamlined and easy to use tool Tom's FileZilla Password Recovery: A password recovery tool for the Filezilla FTP client that aims to come to the rescue in case you forgot or lost your login information Reader comments Load old comments   Criminal Scum Offering Website Builder for Online Scammers more on: tech support scam i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Books Why Fractured author Catherine McKenzie wrote an entire book within a book by Isabella Biedenharn • @isabella324 Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Jason Trott) Posted October 13 2016 — 11:37 AM EDT See also Catherine McKenzie talks new novel 'Arranged' Read an excerpt from Catherine McKenzie's 'Smoke' -- exclusive Catherine McKenzie’s latest novel, Fractured, follows a novelist named Julie Apple, whose best-selling first book, The Murder Game, was loosely based on her own experience in law school. But when she finds out a stalker is obsessed with her — and with proving that The Murder Game was more fact than fiction — Julie moves from Tacoma, Washington to Cincinnati, Ohio and becomes fast friends with her new neighbor. Just when she thinks things may finally be settling down, a series of misunderstandings occurs, and Julie and her family seem to find themselves in more danger than ever. What makes Fractured especially fascinating is that McKenzie didn’t just write that novel (out now from Lake Union) — but she also wrote Julie Apple’s entire contentious debut, and self-published it for curious readers who want to go deeper. Below, McKenzie tells EW what made her want to embark on such an endeavor. ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Plenty of novels mention a book within the book — but few people actually write that interior book, like you’ve done with Fractured and The Murder Game. What made you want to write the The Murder Game? CATHERINE MCKENZIE: I actually wrote The Murder Game before I wrote Fractured. I wrote it ten years ago and someone I should not have listened to told me that no one would buy a book with an unreliable narrator! So I put the book in a drawer. When I was writing Fractured, I knew that Julie’s (the main character’s) book would be a character in the book and I was having trouble anchoring that in something that didn’t exist. So I decided to base it on The Murder Game. Once Fractured was complete, I decided it would be fun to put The Murder Game out as Julie Apple. But after I wrote Fractured, I needed to edit the book. There were some pacing problems with it and I needed to cut about 12,000 words. Which is much easier 10 years after you’ve written a book than when you are still close to it! Why did you want to self-publish it? I think one of the great things about being a writer now is that you can do both at once. Self-publishing The Murder Game gave me the flexibility to put it out when I wanted and how I wanted, but I am still working closely with my publisher, Lake Union, on it. How long did it take to write? I wrote the first draft very quickly in about six months. And then have tinkered with the book off and on for almost 10 years! What was difficult about it? Was anything unexpectedly easy? It takes place over two timelines with the same character, 12 years apart. The challenge of this book was finding a way to have a different voice for Meredith—the innocent she was in law school versus the hard-nosed person she’s become 12 years later. What did writing The Murder Game help you uncover or teach you about Julie’s character? I think there is something perverse about treating murder like a game. So that definitely says something about Julie’s character, that she would do that in law school…then again, I wrote The Murder Game, so what does that say about me? Do you think you’d ever do something like this again? Not sure! Even though the book was “written” it was a lot of work to get two books ready for publication at the same time. That being said, I have had an idea for another “Julie Apple” book, so maybe I’ll put out another book as her sometime in the future!  Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories 'Westworld': Jeffrey Wright on that episode 7 shock 'Westworld' producers on that huge revelation and brutal scene John Oliver on Trump's election win: 'What the f--- do we do now?'

It has been alleged that the members of staff in an Apple store in Australia secretly took the pictures and passed them round, rating the women out of 10. According to Brisbane's Courier-Mail , which first reported the story, the staff also stole pictures directly from customer's phones. Apple has confirmed that several employees were fired but that it had nothing to do with preying on customers.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple Pay arrives in New Zealand, faces uphill battle as large banks continue to attempt lock out By Steffen Reich, Oct 13, 2016 Tweet 2 Comments New Zealand has just joined the ranks of Apple Pay enabled countries on Wednesday, following suit after neighbouring Australia finally introduced the service in May through ANZ Banking Group. The foray was met with great customer praise in May, when ANZ became the first major bank in the region that decided to buck the trend of openly colluding with rival banks in an effort to prevent Apple Pay from hitting the shores. While Kiwis will undoubtedly be eager to embrace the technology, implementation is not likely to gather significant momentum until the same large players barring Apple Pay from the Australian market (most notably Commonwealth Bank, National Australian Bank, Westpac) come to an agreement over the cut Apple makes with every micro transaction and join ANZ in rolling out the service in both countries. The service is reportedly suffering slow consumer uptake in Australia mostly due to the bank stranglehold, meaning far less populous New Zealand joining the service under equally constricted circumstances will – for now – not measurably impact Apple’s bottom line. Somewhat conflicting the word on the streets, here is what Vice President of Apple Pay Jennifer Bailey had to say about the service landing in NZ this month:  “We’ve seen how popular Apple Pay has been in Australia and we’re excited to offer our ANZ New Zealand customers the same great experience.” Regardless of its actual uptake, it is a nice to have for local Apple devotees who also happen to be with ANZ. Amongst others, Apple Pay is going to be accepted at BP, Corporate Cars, Farmers, McDonalds, Domino’s, K-Mart, Hallenstein Brothers, Stevens and Storm.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software iOS 10 Adoption Jumps To More Than 66 Percent, Faster Than Previous Updates By Ali Salman Posted 1 month ago 20Shares Share Tweet Submit It’s been less than a month since Apple released its iOS 10 firmware to the public. At this time, iOS 10 is running on more than 66 percent of the devices according to Fiksu. Moreover, the iOS 10 adoption rate is faster than the previous iOS releases. Let’s see some more details on the subject. iOS 10 Adoption Is The Fastest Compared To Previous Updates iOS 10 is a major upgrade considering the amount of features and the design changes introduced. Apart from some of the major visual changes, iOS 10 brings a revamped Messages app along with a redesigned Apple Music platform that appears to be more bold than before. Of course, there are under the hood improvements along with a handful of minor tweaks in the Notification Center. The Lock screen also has also been a subject to design variations with a dedicated widget screen on the left. Mixpanel is recording the iOS 10 adoption rates, which is now topping 66 percent since Sunday. As shown in the graph the iOS 10 adoption rate is topping 66 percent, more than any other past iOS release. Even though, the release of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus contribute to the two third of users adopting iOS 10, it definitely isn’t the only factor. iOS 10 on it own was a major upgrade and most users were looking forward to it. Since Apple does not push users into installing iOS 10, the choice rests on users’ behalf. Advertisement Before the release of iOS 10, iOS 9 rested on 88 percent of active device base. A month later, iOS 10 is close to that number. It can simply be summed up that there are now more devices running iOS 10 than iOS 9. There are also users who restrain themselves from upgrading to the latest firmware. Most of them are users that deem to keep the jailbroken status. Updating to the latest version would kill the jailbreak and then there will be no turning back. It’s one of the possibilities that kept iOS 10 from scoring an even higher adoption rate. iOS 10 Beta Vs iOS 9 - Visual Comparison (Screenshots) The trend in adopting iOS 10 escalated rapidly by the end of September and there are no possible explanations as to what could have caused this. Initially, when iOS 10 was released, it seemed that the new upgraded firmware would fall behind the rate at which iOS 9 was adopted. However, that did not turn out to be true as there are more than 66 percent of devices running iOS 10. This is it for now, folks. What do you think about the fast pace of iOS 10 adoption rate?

Andrew Hoyle/CNET Apple's redesigned London store is kitted out with untethered iPhones 0 Share: Tech Culture by Katie Collins October 13, 2016 7:55 AM PDT @katiecollins Up Next What a Trump presidency means for tech Inside Apple's slick new London Regent Street store Apple has given its London Regent Street store a huge makeover. We took our cameras inside for a tour before it opened to the public. by Jonathan Garnham 1:07 Close Drag Apple is set to reopen its flagship London Regent Street store to the public on Saturday with a fresh design after more than a year of refurbishment. This was the first Apple Store in Europe when it opened in 2004, but these days it's one of a hundred or so across the continent. The former mosaic and glassmaking workshop is positioned in the heart of London on a grand, sweeping crescent famous for playing host to luxury shops. Apple is known for taking the design of its products seriously, but it puts just as much effort into ensuring its retail environments are aesthetically pleasing. They tend to be gleamingly bright spaces and Apple pays great attention to detail to even the most seemingly insignificant of features. Heading up the makeover of Regent Street is Apple's design chief Jony Ive, who worked with renowned London architects Foster and Partners to ensure the redesign was in keeping with the building's historic character and its Grade II-listed facade. The new look follows the redesign of Apple's San Francisco store, which was completed back in May. Pollution stains, be gone! The Grade II-listed facade of the Apple Store has been given a good scrub. Photo by Andrew Hoyle/CNET The exterior of the store has been given a good clean, showing off the marble columns and mosaics put in place by the original occupants. "We wanted to pay homage to the street and its heritage," said Wendy Beckman, Apple's head of retail for Europe. Inside though, the store is classic Apple. It carries the stone details through from outside, but keep them simple, minimalist and modern. Ive's team and the Foster and Partners architects are also working together on Apple Campus 2, the company's new spaceship-shaped Cupertino headquarters. Some of the features from the London store such as the silky stone handrails handcrafted in Bologna, Italy, will be carried over into Campus 2, which is slated to be completed later this year. CNET took an early look around the store on Wednesday, ahead of its official opening. The mezzanine level that previously cut the grand atrium with its seven meter-high arched windows in half has gone. Now the space has been opened so that the ceilings are effectively double their previous height and the benches are divided by lines of ficuses. 15 Inside Apple's revamped London Regent Street store The oak, bronze and stone palette has also been broken up by living walls, planted with real greenery to lure in weary shoppers. "We want it to feel a little bit like a town square, a little pocket park," said Rafe Bertram, partner at Foster and Partners. The focal point is a stool-strewn area called "the forum," that sits between the two staircases leading to the mezzanine, which is now only at the back of the store. The forum is the hub for Apple's outreach and educational workshop program and will also play host to events including acoustic gigs. Apple's usual colors are broken up by this "living wall" of greenery. Photo by Andrew Hoyle/CNET Perhaps the most interesting feature of the store is that when it opens to the public at the weekend the devices won't be tethered to the tables as they were previously, and are in other stores around the world. Apple says this is to allow people to hold them properly, try cases on them and even see how they feel in your pocket. It's a bold move, especially given the lack of visible security in the building. We couldn't spot a single CCTV camera, although any phone taken out of the store will set off an alarm. If not returned, the phones will also be rendered unusable. Tucked away at the rear of the store is a boardroom for Apple to deliver training and advice to developers and business customers. Decorated with artistic blueprints of the Campus 2 mothership and shelves lined with heavy design bibles, it has the feeling of a fancy home study. Anyone invited in here will be able to help themselves to chocolates from luxury London department store Fortnum and Mason. Campus 2 is set to have an identical room itself, but there's no guarantee that the chocolate will be up to the same standard. The store is set to open this Saturday at 10 a.m. If you can't make it down to see for yourself, be sure to check out our gallery for a close look at all of the key details.

According to Courier-Mail, staff at Apple Store in Carindale Shopping Centre were swapping photos of other female staff and customers and rating them out of 10. The report said that over 100 intimate photos were taken of the staff and customers without their knowledge and photos were also taken from phones that were submitted for repair.

Courier-Mail explained that photos of the victims were circulated in a chat group and the employees would rate females based on their appearance on a scale of 10. Apple has also brought in an overseas HR executive to look into the matter. We are investigating a violation of Apple's business conduct policy at our store in Carindale, where several employees have already been terminated as a result of our findings," Apple said in a statement released on Thursday. "Based on our investigation thus far, we have seen no evidence that customer data or photos were inappropriately transferred or that anyone was photographed by these former employees. We have met with our store team to let them know about the investigation and inform them about the steps Apple is taking to protect their privacy." "Apple believes in treating everyone equally and with respect, and we do not tolerate behaviour that goes against our values," the statement added.

The issue is the long-term symptom of “bendgate,” a design flaw that allows the iPhone 6 Plus (and sometimes the iPhone 6) to flex imperceptibly during normal use. Over time, the chips come loose, causing intermittent touchscreen functionality and eventually causing the touchscreen to fail entirely. Often, but not always, touch-diseased phones will have flickering grey bars across the top of the phone's screen. Because it’s a logic board problem, it can’t be fixed with a screen replacement; the only way to fix it is to resolder new chips onto the logic board. Apple has attempted to sidestep the issue entirely—it has not admitted publicly that there’s a problem, and has been charging customers up to $329 to replace their out-of-warranty touch-diseased phones with a refurbished one (released in September, 2014, most iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices have expired warranties). A note on terminology: Internally, Apple calls these refurbished devices “remanufactured.” Image: Trent Dennison/Rice Is For Dinner The big problem? Many of these refurbished phones are exhibiting symptoms of touch disease soon after they’re sold, and in many cases, Apple Store employees are seeing the problem on “newly remanufactured” phones that are fresh out of the box. “I can't even tell you how many times I have gone to replace a customer’s device, and the 'New' device out of the service replacement box is already having the same flickering/flashing and multitouch issue,” one Genius told me. "I’ve swapped out phones and as soon as we turn on that replacement phone, that same issue is happening on the new phone" Two other current Geniuses and two ex-Geniuses confirmed to me that this is a problem they’ve experienced. Some Geniuses say they see newly refurbished phones with touch disease "all the time," others said it's happened on only a handful of devices. “I’ve swapped out phones and as soon as we turn on that replacement phone, that same issue is happening on the new phone,” another Genius told me. “Everyone at the Genius bar knows it’s an issue, the higher ups know it’s an issue. Something has to be done because it’s really unfair.” There’s no way of knowing if or when a device is going to exhibit touch disease, but dozens of readers have told me that they have gone through up to five different iPhone 6 Pluses, which suggests that simply replacing the phone with a refurbished one doesn’t mean you’re automatically out of the woods. Anecdotally, refurbished phones seem to exhibit problems more quickly than new ones do, which makes sense considering that Geniuses and independent repair professionals who have worked on touch diseased phones believe Apple doesn’t use brand new logic boards on its remanufactured phones. This is a big problem, because refurbished phones come with a much-reduced 90-day warranty, compared with the standard one-year warranty that comes with new devices. "Because this is an intermittent problem, Apple’s testing processes aren’t always picking this up" The Geniuses I’ve spoken to explain that Apple’s silence on the issue isn’t just hurting customers, it’s also making it much more difficult for Geniuses to do their job. If a Genius officially puts a replacement phone sale through on Apple’s internal system before noticing that the replacement phone is also broken, Apple’s system won’t immediately allow Geniuses to swap it with a third, functioning device. “If you put it in the [Mobile Genius point of sale system] and can't give them that shitty 6 Plus that's doing the same thing as their device they came into fix, you personally have to hand them a different one than the paperwork they signed says, and do another swap through Mobile Genius the next day,” a Genius told me. The customer, of course, doesn’t have to pay for a second replacement phone because it’s within the 90-day warranty period, but essentially they’re being given off-the-books replacement devices for at least 24 hours until the system is updated. More pressing, customers aren’t generally happy when they’re asked to spend $329 to replace a phone that they didn’t cause to break. “In order for you to get a promotion or raise as a Genius, they look at customer satisfaction reviews. With this, you know a lot of times it’s not going to be a good encounter. When your yearly review comes up, your manager will say, ‘Well, you had a lot of negative reviews,’” a Genius told me. “And then you say ‘Yeah, they had a phone that they did nothing to and we asked them to pay $329 to replace it.’ It affects your career at Apple.” "Touch disease impacts pretty much every iPhone 6 Plus eventually" Just as Samsung wishes it hadn’t created a phone that is spontaneously exploding, Apple doesn’t seem to want to deal with the headache that touch disease is causing it. The company is facing two class action lawsuits and as more phones fail, its reputation for making quality products with long lifespans will take a hit. So, the existence of touch disease is defensible as a mistake. But there are two things that are indefensible: The company still refuses to acknowledge publicly that this problem exists, and Apple sells the refurbished phones with shorter warranties. “Giving out a remanufactured phone with a 90-day warranty is a challenge—touch disease impacts pretty much every iPhone 6 Plus eventually, and it seems Apple’s refurbishment policy right now is not to replace those chips,” Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, told me. “Because this is an intermittent problem, Apple’s testing processes aren’t always picking this up. They might make the device look good as new, but internally, it’s got hairline cracks that will often cause the problems within a couple months.” Many of the Geniuses told me that Apple’s handling of the issue has changed how they view the company. “Don't get me wrong, I still love the company I work for, and enjoy my job,” one of them told me. “But the way they are handling this issue—or rather not handling this issue and trying to sweep it under the rug—is deplorable.” Apple has ignored six requests for comment from me and has not publicly commented to other journalists who have covered the issue.

Funded by a successful $65,000 Kickstarter campaign, it grabbed a lot of press, including from mainstream news outlets like CNBC. At it’s peak, the Next Keyboard made almost $20,000 in a single day, but like most apps, it rode a steep slope down after the initial spike. Tiny Hearts recently announced that it is discontinuing work on the Next Keyboard and pulling it from the App Store at the end of next week. Robleh Jama, the founder of Tiny Hearts, explores what went wrong: When we built Next Keyboard, we were amongst the first to experiment with Apple’s custom keyboard functionality. Unfortunately all third-party iOS keyboards — including Next Keyboard — were never truly stable because of Apple’s API. There’s a surprisingly poor user experience around using third-party keyboards (such as setting up a new keyboard). Even Google’s Keyboard, Gboard, has issues today, a full two years after third-party keyboards were announced. It’s hard to turn any app into a sustainable business, but the Next Keyboard faced greater challenges than most. Third-party keyboards are hard to build, limitations in the Apple APIs mean they cannot match the system keyboard feature-for-feature, and big companies like Google and Microsoft entered the market shortly after the Next Keyboard was launched. The experience was a costly and disappointing one for Tiny Hearts, but not without value. As Jama explains: Even though it was an expensive lesson, things worked out. There are things we wished would’ve turned out differently. We let our users down, and we don’t feel good about that. But we came out stronger and smarter for it, we’ve learned an unbelievable amount, and we will still bet on iOS, messaging and conversational interfaces. If you don’t play, you’ll never win. It’s been tough for us to swallow, but we paid for one of the most important lessons: making money with an app is risky.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. lost billions in value Tuesday after it was forced to cease production of its flagship phone, an unprecedented blow in the company’s long-running battle with Apple. The Korean electronics giant, which has been thrown into crisis in recent weeks after battery problems in its new Galaxy Note 7 phone caused the device to overheat and explode, finally admitted defeat, announcing it would permanently discontinue the device in the interests of customers’ safety. The company’s shares fell 8 per cent, their biggest decline in eight years, wiping 19 trillion won (US$16.7B) off the company’s value. Apple rose 0.6 per cent to a nine-month high, with analysts forecasting that the iPhone maker was most likely to benefit from the debacle. Imagination Technologies, the British technology company whose graphics chip designs power the iPhone, climbed 6.9 per cent. Related Worst-case scenario for Samsung Galaxy Note 7 may force restatement of results Canadians can now return their Galaxy Note 7 smartphones: Samsung Samsung sends fireproof packaging and gloves for Note 7 returns Samsung is the world’s biggest smartphone manufacturer, accounting for almost one in four sales globally, and the Note 7, first released in August, was meant to be the pinnacle of its engineering prowess. The company was first forced into an embarrassing recall a month ago, which in itself was expected to cost it billions. But after multiple claims that the new and supposedly safe phones Samsung had produced to replace the faulty ones were also exploding, it yesterday bowed to pressure to pull the plug on the handset entirely. Samsung said it was investigating what had caused the explosions. It had originally blamed them on a faulty battery, but the problem persisted after it had switched suppliers for its new replacement devices. Analysts said that unless the company can prove that the issue was limited to the one model, it could tarnish the whole brand and threaten its standing as the world’s biggest smartphone maker. “The biggest challenge for Samsung will be to prevent the consumer and investor fallout from worsening,” said Karissa Chua of Euromonitor. “The fact that its premium Note 7 smartphone is labelled a safety hazard is damaging to [its] reputation. It could also have repercussions on consumers’ overall confidence in Samsung smartphones.” The company had won high praise for the phone, with critics lauding its design and new features, and more than 1 million had been released to customers by the time it first recalled the device. The company did not say how many have now been sold, although around 10,000 of the original and replacement phones are believed to be in consumers’ hands in the U.K. Supply in Britain has been limited by the fact that the Note 7 was not due to be released here until the day of the original recall. We believe the Note 7’s ongoing issues could help market share shifts for Apple Mobile operators urged customers to return the devices, offering to swap them for phones of their choice. The company’s moment of weakness could provide leverage for Elliot Management, the activist investor, which wants Samsung to restructure itself and pay a special dividend of 30 trillion won. Elliot’s intervention last week had sent Samsung shares rising. The setback comes with inauspicious timing for Samsung. Demand for Apple’s latest iPhone is believed to be at a record, and Google has just launched its own Pixel handset, which runs on the same Android software that Samsung’s devices use. “We believe the Note 7’s ongoing issues could help market share shifts for Apple,” Credit Suisse analysts said. “We would further note that this could result in not only short-term unit gains for the iPhone, but could also result in long-term gains as well, as Android users churn over to the sticky [Apple] iOS ecosystem, which boasts a 95 per cent loyalty rate.” Separately, Apple and Samsung headed to the U.S. Supreme Court last night, for a hearing to determine how much Samsung should owe for infringing iPhone-related patents in a case that dates back five years. After Apple accused the Korean company of copying key aspects of the iPhone several years ago, Samsung was ordered to pay US$548 million in damages, but is trying to get that amount reduced in America’s highest court. A decision on the case is not expected to be reached until next summer. Find Financial Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo?

 It looks like Apple hasn't integrated a Cambridge startup's voice recognition tech into Siri, despite acquiring it a year ago Sam Shead Oct. 13, 2016, 11:42 AM 1,237 facebook linkedin twitter email print Reuters/Suzanne Plunkett This time last year, Apple reportedly paid up to $100 million (£82 million) for a Cambridge voice recognition startup called VocalIQ as it looked to make Siri that bit little smarter. But VocalIQ's software — designed to help computers and people speak to each other in a more natural dialogue — hasn't found its way into Siri, according to an artificial intelligence (AI) expert with knowledge of voice recognition platforms. "I think it’s extremely unlikely that [VocalIQ] is in Siri now," the source said. "In fact, I’m pretty sure it isn’t. But obviously Apple have got it for a reason." The source said they could tell that VocalIQ's technology hadn't been integrated into Siri just by talking to the personal assistant. VocalIQ has a "a very particular style of dialogue ... and I haven’t seen that in Siri," they said. VocalIQ's technology was spun out of the University of Cambridge so it's "very technical, mathematical stuff," the source added. "It also takes a long time to get technology from a startup into a production product," they said. But one of VocalIQ's early investors told Business Insider that it was "hard to tell" whether VocalIQ was in Siri or not. Earlier this year Steve Kovach reported: "According to a source familiar with VocalIQ’s product, it’s much more robust and capable than Siri’s biggest competitors like Google Now, Amazon’s Alexa, and Microsoft’s Cortana. In fact, it was so impressive that Apple bought VocalIQ before the company could finish and release its smartphone app. After the acquisition, Apple kept most of the VocalIQ team and let them work out of their Cambridge office and integrate the product into Siri." He went on to write: "It’s still unclear when Apple plans to implement more of VocalIQ’s capabilities into Siri. One source speculated that it may happen slowly over time, so as not to throw off users with a radical change. But it sounds like Apple is arming itself for a significant shift in how Siri works."

Some of the features include The Grove which places local trees into the store. There's new shelving units and new tables and new private rooms like "The Boardroom" where businesses could be trained about iOS and all their hardware. Norman Foster's architecture firm Foster and Partners were tasked with renovating the 11,000 square-foot space. Below are a number of jumbo photos of the store and you can click on any of them to enlarge.   Regent Street was Apple's first ever store in Europe, opening 12 years ago. Since then, Apple has served over 60 million customers on the site, marking it as one of the company's most prized and lucrative retail sites.   Jony Ive spoke with Wallpaper design news last month and stated that "Like many great cities, London's historic architecture has great significance to the community. On Regent Street, we preserved the incredible exterior façade while opening up the interior of the store to enhance the transparency and flood the space with natural light. By choosing materials sympathetic to the historic nature of the building, we're able to modernize the space while remaining authentic to its surrounds."   The actual building features a Grade II Listed exterior façade of portland stone, carrara marble, and hand-cut Venetian Smalti glass tile.   Trusted Review notes in their report that "Regent Street was Apple's first ever store in Europe, opening 12 years ago. Since then, Apple has served over 60 million customers on the site, marking it as one of the company's most prized and lucrative retail sites. That's why it's no surprise that the Regent Street store is the first Apple Store in Europe to roll out the company's new retail design concept, which first debuted in the states earlier this year.   Speaking to press at today's briefing, Ahrendts said: "I know how iconic and important Regent Street is, not just to London and the UK, but on the global stage, it's one of the most important streets in the world."   Other photos could be seen over at Engadget or GQ Magazine UK.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

News & Analysis TSMC Grows Share of Foundry Business Repercussions of Samsung's burning batteries Alan Patterson 10/13/2016 09:38 AM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet TAIPEI — Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) increased its share of the foundry business to 55 percent this year on better than expected demand for smartphones during the third quarter. “In the third quarter, we gained market share across most technology nodes,” according to TSMC Co-CEO Mark Liu, speaking at a Taipei event to announce the company’s quarterly results. TSMC, which counts Apple as its largest buyer, said that sales growth was driven by its mobile customer’s new product launch. TSMC makes the A10 processor for Apple’s latest smartphone, the iPhone 7 Plus, introduced in September. In the third quarter, TSMC’s sales of chips made with its most advanced 16nm/20nm process technology increased to 31 percent of overall revenue from 23 percent during the second quarter. The quarter marks the first time for 16nm/20nm to account for the largest portion of its overall revenue. The company’s previous cash cow, 28nm technology, dropped to 24 percent of its total wafer revenue from 28 percent in the second quarter. TSMC said it expects demand for 28nm to continue to be strong and last for many years as it extends the technology into low-cost and more versions for automotive and other applications. Up to now, few of TSMC’s rivals have made a dent in the company’s market share in 28nm. TSMC said it expects to outperform the overall semiconductor industry this year as the foundry segment continues to lead growth. The company said that in US dollar terms, its sales will grow by about 10 percent in 2016 while the foundry segment increases 9 percent and total industry revenue, excluding memory, gains by 1 percent. TSMC is likely to benefit from stronger than expected demand for the iPhone 7 Plus after Samsung was forced this month to halt production of its high-end Galaxy Note 7 smartphones because of exploding batteries. The Galaxy Note 7, selling for a retail price of about $800, was positioned to compete head to head with the iPhone 7 Plus. TSMC said it expects its silicon content in smartphones for low, mid and high-end customers to increase to an average of $10 per unit next year from slightly more than $9 per phone this year. New technology In the third quarter this year, TSMC transferred 10nm development from R&D to production and has five tape outs lined up for mobile products. The first commercial shipments of 10nm products are scheduled for the first quarter next year. The company predicted that high-end smartphones will move to 10nm from 16nm during 2017. TSMC reiterated that it is on schedule for 7nm with risk production planned for the first quarter of 2017 and 15 customer tape outs lined up for the full year. The company said that customers in high-end mobile and high-performance computing are on board to adopt the new technology. The company said that it has entered the technology development phase for 5nm. TSMC expects mobile products and high-performance computing to drive growth of 7nm and 5nm. The company said 7nm will ramp in 2017, followed by 5nm in 2019 to support smartphones and high-end mobile products with new features including virtual reality and augmented reality. The company expects the high-performance computing market to be worth $15 billion in the next five years as more machines used in healthcare, media, consumer and automotive applications gain the ability to see, hear and predict. TSMC said that it expects high-performance computing to account for the largest portion of its business within the next five years, replacing mobile devices. Capital expenditure TSMC said that it expects its capital expenditure for this year to come in at more than $9.5 billion, the low end of an earlier forecast range of $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion. The company said it is keeping capex low because improved cycle time has helped to boost capital efficiency.  The company is expected to have the second-largest capex in the semiconductor industry this year, following Samsung and slightly more than Intel. —Alan Patterson covers the semiconductor industry for EE Times.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Competitions Desktop PCs Internet Laptops Monitors PC Components Peripherals More Printers Software Trending: iOS 10 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / Laptop News / New Apple MacBook coming October 27? Maybe New Apple MacBook coming October 27? Maybe by Sean Keach 13 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments Evidence that Apple may be planning a MacBook 2016 reboot for late October is mounting – here’s the latest. A Twitter user has reignited rumours of an October 27 Apple MacBook launch event, revealing that he was offered accessories for a new (and unannounced) version of the flagship Apple laptop. Zee M Kane, who posts under the Twitter handle @Zee, is a digital media brand advisor and former CEO of technology site The Next Web. In a tweet sent earlier today, he said: “Just got an email from a company with an offer to pre-order their MacBook sleeves designed for the new MacBooks to be released on the 27th.” Related: iPhone 7 review The MacBook sleeves are produced by a company called Waterfield, and are purportedly made in a small workshop in San Francisco, Apple’s home turf. The new version is called the Maxwell Sleeve, and is available for pre-order ahead of an October 27 release. There are four colour options (green, black, blue, red) and an optional suspension strap – we can hardly contain ourselves. What’s interesting is that Apple has been widely rumoured to be planning a launch event for a new MacBook on October 27. It’s expected that invitations will be sent out within the next week, and that an event will be held out in San Francisco. The new MacBook is expected to debut a major redesign. One of the most prominent rumoured changes affects the keyboard; the top row of function keys will supposedly be replaced with a touch-sensitive OLED strip that will display customisable buttons and notifications. We’re also expected to see USB-C added, just like the 12-inch MacBook, as well as a new AMD Polaris GPU. Unfortunately, Apple hasn’t confirmed any details about a new MacBook, so take this report with due caution. It’s also worth noting that although accessory makers sometimes get access to device information before it becomes public knowledge, there’s no guarantee that Waterfield is privy to any secret MacBook designs.

By Aaron Brown Aaron Brown PUBLISHED: 14:00, Sun, Oct 16, 2016 | UPDATED: 16:39, Sun, Oct 16, 2016 EXPRESS NEWSPAPERSApple wants to make its brick-and-mortar stores a more enjoyable and interactive experience Apple is currently overhauling the retail experience in its flagship stores. As part of its mission to make shopping in its brick-and-mortar stores a more enjoyable and interactive experience, the Cupertino company has revamped its Regent Street store. The central London shop is the second Apple Store to get a stunning new makeover, after Apple debuted its new concept in San Francisco earlier this summer. The iconic Regent Street store has been closed for months while the US company has been busy redecorating – and now it is finally ready to open its enormous glass doors to the British public. The new retail space is finally open, and Express.co.uk Technology Editor David Snelling was given an exclusive tour around the beautiful new shop. Redesigned Apple Store, Regent Street – First Look Thu, October 13, 2016 ENORMOUS video walls, a forest of trees, and free workshops from some of the world’s most talented professionals - welcome to the new Apple Store in London. Play slideshow EXPRESS NEWSPAPERS 1 of 21 The central London store is the first UK Apple Store to get the stunning new makeover Of the flagship new Apple Store, he said – From the moment you walk in from the bustling streets of London, you are instantly met with a sense of calm. The entrance now sports a double-height grand hall, which is over seven metres high with huge windows to flood the store with natural light. These vast ceilings have allowed Apple to place twelve huge Ficus Ali trees in the store, which makes you feel like you're shopping in the great outdoors. The pots they've been planted in also act as extra seating so you can play with your latest gadget in the shade of their leaves. EXPRESS NEWSPAPERSApple's growing line of cases and accessories are housed in an entirely new display Another new addition to the Apple Store is an enormous television, which has an area in front of it for what Apple is calling “The Forum”. This space, which can seat 75 people, will be used for daily free workshops from artists, photographers, musicians, gamers, developers and entrepreneurs. Customers will be able to book join these activities via Apple's website. Of course, one of the main reasons for heading to the Apple Store is to check out their latest tech toys and every gadget from iPhones to MacBooks are available to test and try. And Apple's Genius Bar is still available for anyone struggling to get to grips with their latest gadget. New twin staircases, which feature sandblasted and honed Castagna stone handrails hand carved into the stone walls, take customers to the Genius Bar where help is on hand for anyone struggling to get to grips with their latest gadget. Speaking about the new store Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice-president of retail, said the space had been designed to feel inviting and make potential customers feel comfortable. The Regent Street Apple Store first opened its doors in 2004 and has since served over 60 million customers. And when Apple fans walked into the first ever Apple Store there was no iPhone and the most popular products were the iMac G5 and the iPod photo.

Enjoy the flavors of fall Courtney Slater, Hy-Vee dietitian 10:03 a.m. CDT October 13, 2016 Lactation oatmeal chocolate chip cookies from Des Moines MamaÕs Freshly Baked Goods. (Photo: Special to the Register) Fall brings an abundance of flavorful, seasonal foods that are packed full of nutrition. October is National Pork Month, Apple Month, Cranberry Month — and Oct. 29 is National Oatmeal Day. Now is the time to take advantage of these flavorful fall foods and the nutrition they provide. Oatmeal is the dietitian Pick of the Month for October, and it is a great pairing with these seasonal fall foods. National Pork Month: Pork Month was originally started because October was the time most hogs were brought to market. Now the month has evolved into a way to educate consumers on pork production and the nutritional benefits of eating pork. According to the USDA, pork is the world’s most widely eaten meat, making up 42 percent of meat consumption worldwide. To choose the leanest cuts, look for the words “round” or “loin” in the name. These cuts will contain higher amounts of quality protein and lower amounts of saturated fat. Pork tenderloin contains the same fat content as a skinless chicken breast, and offers a good source of many B vitamins and minerals. The pork tenderloin is not only lean, but it is versatile and flavorful as well. Oatmeal works great as a coating for both tenderloin and pork chops. You can leave the oatmeal whole, or grind it up into a flour for a flavorful twist. National Cranberry Month: October is the peak month for harvesting cranberries. Cranberries are grown on vines in bogs or wet marshy areas. Cranberries are known for their bacteria-blocking compounds that have been linked to the prevention of urinary tract infections. New research is showing these compounds may also be helpful in preventing ulcers and gum disease. Cranberries’ rich antioxidant content may help reduce inflammation and increase heart health. Cranberries come in a variety of forms with varying nutrition content. Fresh, frozen, canned, dried and cranberry juice all contain the bacteria-blocking compounds. If fresh or frozen cranberries are too tart for you, make them into a sauce by boiling them with water or low-sugar orange juice just until they pop. Overcooking the cranberries will increase their bitterness. Fresh cranberry sauce is excellent stirred into oatmeal or plain Greek yogurt.  Better yet, stir all three together for a creamy fall treat. When choosing dried cranberries or juice, look for ones with no or less added sugar. Buy Photo  (Photo: MICHAEL ROLANDS/RECORD-HERALD) National Apple Month: More than 2,500 varieties of apples are grown in the U.S. The saying “An apple a day keeps the doctor away” has scientific merit. One study found eating an apple a day helped reduced LDL (bad) cholesterol.  Regular apple consumption has also been linked to weight loss, improved gut health, cancer prevention and reduced inflammation. There are many ways to add apples to your daily diet. The easiest way is to wash and eat. Or add chopped apples and a dash of cinnamon to oatmeal before cooking it for a flavorful fall treat. Apples and oatmeal make a great fall combo in bars, cookies and breakfast breads as well. Keep in mind, apples ripen six to 10 times faster at room temperature, so if you want your apples to last longer, store them in the refrigerator. Easy Pork Chop Sauté with Cranberries  Easy Pork Chop Saute with Cranberries  (Photo: Special to the Register) Serves 4. All you need: ¼ tsp dried thyme leaves ¼ tsp salt, divided ¼ tsp freshly ground pepper, divided 4 boneless pork loin chops, (1 to 1 1/4 pounds), trimmed of fat ⅔ cup cranberry juice cocktail or orange juice 2 ½ to 3 tbsp clover or other mild honey 2 tsp Hy-Vee canola oil ¼ cup chopped onion 1 cup fresh or thawed frozen cranberries, coarsely chopped (see tip below) All you do: 1. Mix thyme and ⅛ teaspoon each salt and pepper in a small bowl. Sprinkle both sides of pork chops with the thyme mixture. 2. Stir cranberry juice and 2 ½ tablespoons honey in a 1-cup glass measure until well blended. 3. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Add the chops and cook until browned on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side.  4. Push the chops to one side of the pan, add onion to the empty half and cook, stirring, until the onion is soft and beginning to brown, 1 to 2 minutes.  5. Pour half the juice mixture into the pan. Add cranberries. Reduce heat to medium and cook, turning the chops occasionally, until cooked through, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer the chops to a serving plate and tent with foil to keep warm.  6. Add the remaining juice mixture to the pan. Increase heat to high and cook until the mixtures reduces to form a syrupy sauce, about 2 minutes. Season with the remaining ⅛ teaspoon salt and pepper and up to an additional ½ tablespoon honey to taste. Spoon the sauce over the chops. Tip: To make quick work of chopping cranberries, place whole berries in a food processor and pulse a few times until the berries are coarsely chopped.

Andrew Hoyle/CNET Apple's redesigned London store is kitted out with untethered iPhones 0 Share: Tech Culture by Katie Collins October 13, 2016 7:55 AM PDT @katiecollins Up Next What a Trump presidency means for tech Inside Apple's slick new London Regent Street store Apple has given its London Regent Street store a huge makeover. We took our cameras inside for a tour before it opened to the public. by Jonathan Garnham 1:07 Close Drag Apple is set to reopen its flagship London Regent Street store to the public on Saturday with a fresh design after more than a year of refurbishment. This was the first Apple Store in Europe when it opened in 2004, but these days it's one of a hundred or so across the continent. The former mosaic and glassmaking workshop is positioned in the heart of London on a grand, sweeping crescent famous for playing host to luxury shops. Apple is known for taking the design of its products seriously, but it puts just as much effort into ensuring its retail environments are aesthetically pleasing. They tend to be gleamingly bright spaces and Apple pays great attention to detail to even the most seemingly insignificant of features. Heading up the makeover of Regent Street is Apple's design chief Jony Ive, who worked with renowned London architects Foster and Partners to ensure the redesign was in keeping with the building's historic character and its Grade II-listed facade. The new look follows the redesign of Apple's San Francisco store, which was completed back in May. Pollution stains, be gone! The Grade II-listed facade of the Apple Store has been given a good scrub. Photo by Andrew Hoyle/CNET The exterior of the store has been given a good clean, showing off the marble columns and mosaics put in place by the original occupants. "We wanted to pay homage to the street and its heritage," said Wendy Beckman, Apple's head of retail for Europe. Inside though, the store is classic Apple. It carries the stone details through from outside, but keep them simple, minimalist and modern. Ive's team and the Foster and Partners architects are also working together on Apple Campus 2, the company's new spaceship-shaped Cupertino headquarters. Some of the features from the London store such as the silky stone handrails handcrafted in Bologna, Italy, will be carried over into Campus 2, which is slated to be completed later this year. CNET took an early look around the store on Wednesday, ahead of its official opening. The mezzanine level that previously cut the grand atrium with its seven meter-high arched windows in half has gone. Now the space has been opened so that the ceilings are effectively double their previous height and the benches are divided by lines of ficuses. 15 Inside Apple's revamped London Regent Street store The oak, bronze and stone palette has also been broken up by living walls, planted with real greenery to lure in weary shoppers. "We want it to feel a little bit like a town square, a little pocket park," said Rafe Bertram, partner at Foster and Partners. The focal point is a stool-strewn area called "the forum," that sits between the two staircases leading to the mezzanine, which is now only at the back of the store. The forum is the hub for Apple's outreach and educational workshop program and will also play host to events including acoustic gigs. Apple's usual colors are broken up by this "living wall" of greenery. Photo by Andrew Hoyle/CNET Perhaps the most interesting feature of the store is that when it opens to the public at the weekend the devices won't be tethered to the tables as they were previously, and are in other stores around the world. Apple says this is to allow people to hold them properly, try cases on them and even see how they feel in your pocket. It's a bold move, especially given the lack of visible security in the building. We couldn't spot a single CCTV camera, although any phone taken out of the store will set off an alarm. If not returned, the phones will also be rendered unusable. Tucked away at the rear of the store is a boardroom for Apple to deliver training and advice to developers and business customers. Decorated with artistic blueprints of the Campus 2 mothership and shelves lined with heavy design bibles, it has the feeling of a fancy home study. Anyone invited in here will be able to help themselves to chocolates from luxury London department store Fortnum and Mason. Campus 2 is set to have an identical room itself, but there's no guarantee that the chocolate will be up to the same standard. The store is set to open this Saturday at 10 a.m. If you can't make it down to see for yourself, be sure to check out our gallery for a close look at all of the key details.

An Apple store in Brisbane, Australia, is under intense scrutiny today as a number of its staff are accused of stealing photos from their female colleagues’ phones, according to local paper The Courier Mail. The individuals, who were sacked for a “violation of Apple’s business conduct policy,” reportedly shared the photos with other Apple stores in the state. Those involved apparently rated their victims on a scale of one to ten. The perpetrators were also under fire for taking customer photos. The Courier Mail claims a staff member reported that a technician was caught looking through a customer’s phone a number of weeks before the revelation. However, the multinational technology giant firmly denies there is evidence to support the claim that customer’s photos were involved. In a statement issued by Apple, it confirmed that “several employees” had been fired following its investigation. “We have met with our store team to let them know about the investigation and inform them about the steps Apple is taking to protect their privacy,” the company says. "Based on our investigation thus far, we have seen no evidence that customer data or photos were inappropriately transferred or that anyone was photographed by these former employees.” Be the first to comment on this article.

 One of Apple's most important technology partners is suffering a brain drain — to Apple Kif Leswing Oct. 13, 2016, 10:46 AM 8,870 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Images/Justin Sullivan Apple is hiring a lot of talent from British chip designer Imagination Technologies, the company that provides the graphics processor for the iPhone 7. Apple confirmed in March through the London Stock Exchange that it had discussions to buy Imagination Technologies but that it ultimately did not make an offer for the chip company.  But since then, Apple may have gotten what it wanted anyway, hiring several senior employees from Imagination as well as a handful of engineering talent in what was described to Business Insider as a "brain drain." The biggest hire is John Metcalfe, whose LinkedIn profile says he's been working as a senior director at Apple since July. He was Imagination Technology's COO for a decade before that, and was nearly a 20-year veteran of the company. Last October, Apple hired Imagination's VP of Hardware Engineering to be a director based in the United Kingdom. The moves are notable as Apple is reportedly the third-largest shareholder in Imagination Technologies.   Other recent hires from Imagination Technologies now work for Apple in London in positions like GPU Architect, Engineering Manager, FE Hardware Design, and Design Manager. The hires worked on Imagination Technology's PowerVR product, which is what is included in the iPhone.  Six technical employees from Imagination Technologies have joined Apple since September. The hires may be working on GPU technology in Greater London. Apple has long been rumored to be working on its own GPU design but it has never been confirmed. The company has a GPU-focused office in Orlando, Florida as well. One of Apple's core strengths is chip design. Apple designs the system-on-a-chip used in the iPhone, for example. Most other phone makers buy a design from companies like Qualcomm or MediaTek.  GPU technology is becoming increasingly important as a building block for technologies including computer vision, self-driving cars, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Imagination Technologies has had a mixed year, although its stock is up over the past year. It overhauled its business in February as its former CEO Hossein Yassie stepped down. Then, it cut 200 jobs in March. In July, it posted a large £61.5 million loss on revenue of £120 million. "It’s no surprise that our customers, who are exposed to the talent here, sometimes hire that talent, especially from our more customer facing teams. To call it a brain drain is nonsense – Imagination is a 1,400+ person company and we are talking about a handful who have gone to any one customer," an Imagination Technologies spokesperson told Business Insider.  "We have no issues with anyone who has gone from Imagination to work with a customer – we all still work closely together no matter which side of the relationship is paying our wages," the spokesperson continued, saying that "we see Imagination continuing as a strong, independent IP company owned by its shareholders." Apple declined to comment.  Know anything about Apple's GPU plans? We'd like to talk to you.

Follow TechnoBuffalo What if you could flick your wrist to execute certain commands on the Apple Watch? That’s not possible right now, but a recent patent application filed by Apple describes that use case. A flick of a wrist might enable several things. Maybe you want to flip through applications, for example, or dismiss a notification. I also imagine a scenario where a certain gesture could quickly bring up Apple Pay on the Apple Watch. The invention also describes using different gestures for interacting with another device, possibly an iPhone. “Signals from the wristband sensors can be analyzed to identify a specific wrist gesture,” the patent says. “The identified gesture can be interpreted to determine a function to be invoked, for instance by reference to a gesture library that maps specific wrist gestures to functions, or actions, of the wrist-worn device. In some embodiments, the interpretation of a wrist gesture can be context-dependent, e.g., depending on what if any operations are in progress on the wrist-worn device when the gesture is made; thus, the same wrist gesture can initiate different functions in different contexts. In some embodiments, the function or action invoked by a wrist gesture can including sending control signals to another device that is in communication with the wrist-worn device, thereby allowing wrist gestures to be used for remote control.” That last part of that description is particularly interesting, where the patent describes using the watch as a remote control. Imagine playing or pausing music and videos using gestures. One can even imagine a scenario where this would work well with the Apple TV. Why this matters: Apple will need to continue to add features to the Apple Watch in order to help it stand out against other wearables. Gesture controls aren’t necessarily new. In fact, Android Wear already offers gesture support. However, the suggestion that a future Apple Watch may allow us to interact with other devices is compelling, and something we haven’t really seen before.

By Darius Tahir 10/13/16 10:00 AM EDT With help from David Pittman (@David_Pittman) and Arthur Allen (@arthurallen202). UDI TO FLY: Your correspondent’s best guess, as of this moment, is that we’ll see unique device identifier on the preliminary recommendation from the ASC-X12 committee for the claims forms change. Story Continued Below For those who don’t know, UDI could do for medical devices what the barcode did for retail — allow observers to track individual items as they move their way through the system. That could allow for everything from easier recalls (as public health authorities or others could direct communications specifically to affected patients) to comparative effectiveness research. The history of UDI dates back almost a decade, and the campaign to include it on payment claims has steadily converted its opponents: CMS once evinced concerns, but now not so much. The American Hospital Association once wrote letters against UDI inclusion in claims your correspondent was told by the powerful trade group that it’s on board now. All these conversions are attempting to influence an obscure standards committee, the ASC-X12, which dictates what’s on the forms and what’s not. Recently, the device industry went public with its critiques. The American Medical Association remains not-entirely-pleased. But, again, our best guess is they’ll be overcome, based on the committee members we’ve talked to. Pros can read more details about the critiques and chances here. IS … THIS APPLE’S PLAN?: As readers may recall, we published a piece last week examining Apple’s health care plans. We’ve got some additional interesting evidence to share. At the end of September, in a Switzerland-based conference, an IBM salesman presented an update regarding an alliance his company had struck with Apple and insurer JapanPost to roll out a software-hardware-services combination to elderly Japanese needing help. There are apparently some interesting software updates to report. The alliance gives subscribers an Apple Watch and iPad, which is uploaded with custom-built software — with one app for the senior, one for the senior’s family or caregiver, and one for a nurse or other provider. Data syncs between apps, and it helps manage care — for example, when a senior logs in, the app asks (aloud) about how the senior is feeling, whether he or she has taken medications, and so on. The Apple Watch, meanwhile, collects data on movement and heart rate, which caregivers and providers can see. Eventually, the IBM salesman mused, you could imagine the app “making recommendations” to the person, or offering subcontractors’ services (e.g. grocery delivery for the infirm). It’s an interesting real-life example consistent with our reporting of Apple’s strategy: The company is recruiting for a business development executive who would conceive of “solutions” blending Apple devices with partners’ products for health care gain. eHealth tweet of the day: Brendan Saloner @BrendanSaloner We shall not cease from HIPAA trainings & the end of our training will be to arrive where we started & know HIPAA for the 1st time. TS Eliot https://twitter.com/BrendanSaloner/status/786284593049501696 THURSDAY: Your correspondent is feeling in a civic mood, so make sure to register to vote if you haven’t (and your state’s deadline still hasn’t passed) and get your flu shots.

Contact dtahir@politico.com for news tips and chatter socially at @David_Pittman, @arthurallen202, @DariusTahir @ POLITICOPro, @Morning_eHealth. PULSE CHECK WITH HEALTH VC: Bijan Salehizadeh, the managing director of NaviMed Capital, stopped to chat with our Health Care colleague Dan Diamond for the latest edition of “Pulse Check.” As you might imagine from a future-focused individual, a lot of the talk centered on the digital health sector. Salehizadeh is, perhaps, a bit skeptical of massive bucks stampeding in; in fact, he muses that there might be a bit of a bubble inflating. His comments surrounding Theranos probably help explain why. Salehizadeh passed on the company when it couldn’t “answer questions more than one or two levels deep.” Ultimately, he didn’t understand the disjunction between what it was offering (at the time, purely a box) and the scale of its promises. Large-scale promises are a warning sign in general, he said. “Health care tends to be a space of incrementalism,” he said, and the companies and investors entering the space may have missed that fact. A good exit for a health IT company is $300 million or so — which doesn’t lead to the type of returns that general tech investors are accustomed to. So there may be some disappointment coming. Listen to the rest here. THE NIH HAS GOT ITS MIND ON ITS MONEY, MONEY ON ITS PMI: As a part of the president’s “Frontiers” conference taking place today in Pittsburgh, various federal agencies are rolling out new commitments to help science and innovation stretch to the horizon. Astute readers of this newsletter can probably guess what the NIH is doing: giving money related to the BRAIN and Precision Medicine initiatives. The institutes are giving $70 million for BRAIN — which, in part, will build needed data infrastructure — while also disbursing $16 million in Precision Medicine Initiative grants. Those will build the NIH’s study cohort — in particular, reaching underserved communities. — Also: There are some health bits here and there, but your correspondent mostly found this related interview with President Barack Obama and Wired on the subject of artificial intelligence and technology to be highly interesting and worth the time. PDMP update: Some notes from the world of PDMP to share: — Missouri: The long-running fight to establish a state prescription drug monitoring program will run another year. Longtime antagonists state Rep. Holly Rehder and state Sen. Joe Schaaf will introduce dueling bills during the January 2017 session. For context about the conflict, read our story from this summer. — Hawaii: The Honolulu Civil Beat wants state lawmakers to PDMP. In an editorial, the website calls for push notifications of doctor-shopping, requirements to use the database, and mandates forcing dispensers to upload data in more timely fashion (that is, not waiting a week). — South Dakota: State doctors aren’t terribly enthusiastic about their PDMP, a hearing at the legislature established. “Participation in the database during 2015 was 15.9 percent among 3,847 opioid prescribers,” said state officials. The legislature is mulling tougher requirements. — National: An interesting article from Emergency Physicians Monthly has three suggestions to enhance the programs: unsolicited reporting, integration of PDMP data with EHRs, and state interoperability. The article also broaches the possibility that cracking down on opioid prescriptions leads to heroin abuse, a controversial theory. THE PERILS OF PAULSEN: Our Health Care colleague Paul Demko notes that Rep. Erik Paulsen, of Minnesota, may be in trouble if an anti-Trump wave builds into a tsunami. Paulsen is known as a medical device advocate, but he also has telemedicine cred. As a part of the chronic-care reform proposed by the Senate Finance Committee, Paulsen specifically cited geographic restrictions on telemedicine reimbursement as an impediment to good care. He also paid a visit to local telemedicine startup Zipnosis in March. A PERSONNEL NOTE: ONC FACA member Josh Mandel is the “Health IT Transformation Lead” at Verily Life Sciences, he confirmed to us. He was mum as to the exact details of the position. WHAT WE’RE CLICKING ON: A critique of MACRA and MIPS — in particular its measures-reporting provisions — from Brookings scholar Niam Yaraghi. Shouldn’t health IT be an election issue, asks Cerner. NYT has an interesting article on UCSF’s efforts to integrate more digital tech. More bad news for St. Jude — they have to recall heart devices due to battery depletion. « View Archives Authors: Darius Tahir dtahir@politico.com About The Author Darius Tahir is an eHealth reporter for POLITICO Pro.

Hollande hit out after the US Securities and Exchange Commission fined the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank US$9.5 million fine for failings in its equity research department. Hollande told French magazine l'Obs: "That is why I want Europe to have the same powers to punish US companies. When the Commission takes action against Google or other digital giants who do not pay taxes they should pay in Europe, America is offended. That is why I said that the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) cannot be agreed because of the enduring imbalances in relationships and reciprocity." Washington v Brussels Washington hit out after the European Commission ruled that Ireland granted undue tax benefits of up to US$14.5 billion to Apple, which it said was illegal under EU state aid rules. Ahead of the Apple ruling, the US Treasury criticized the European Commission's tax probe into Apple, claiming that it should not be able to collect back-taxes on the companies in Europe. "[The] Commission is seeking to recover amounts related to tax years prior to the announcement of this new approach-in effect seeking retroactive recoveries. Because the Commission's approach departs from prior practice, it should not be applied retroactively," the US Treasury report said. The European Commission has already ruled that Starbucks has benefited from tax arrangements in the Netherlands that constitute state aid, a decision which is being appealed. The same is true of Fiat Finance and Trade in Luxembourg. Although the Commission has not issued a final ruling, its preliminary views is that special tax arrangements in Luxembourg constitute state aid to Amazon. So, arrived in EP Brussels this morning to see anti #TTIP #CETA flash mob in full swing. Brightened up my day! pic.twitter.com/Tr6jH3ZgL0 — Matt Carthy MEP (@mattcarthy) October 13, 2016 ​The spat over fines between Washington and Brussels puts the whole EU-US TTIP deal in doubt as any free-trade agreement must come with common agreement over the fiscal rules. If both the EU and the US are imposing fines on each other's country's companies, there is little hope of free trade. ...

The TTIP agreement will suck EU dry (of what's left after all bailouts). But the major reason to do it is because it's supposed to be secret to those it affects, i.e. the citizens. The politicians truly have lost whatever connection they once had with their electorate. Reply goldcamshaft 18:00 13.10.2016 | 2 | Edit | Delete The usa clamps these huge fines on banks solely that they can negotiate. The negotiation is we will reduce the fines if you give us the names and addresses of all your customers with all personal details in the entire world. In this way, america controls the world. What is better to control a world than if you have the personal information of every citizen in the world, supplied from every bank in the world. This attitude is documented in the TTIP and TIP agreements. Welcome to world slavery! There are lots of words spoken in europe, on the steps of their individual parliaments, but come voting time, the law-makers remain very quiet and allow themselves to be taken by the great exceptional state. Of course, america will want its companies to save on world taxes because the strength of america, economically, is propagated by these multi-national giants, as is documented in the TTIP and TiP seemingly unilateral agreements and the less tax that is paid in europe means more for the usa, and still more viability for their corporations. I do hope that the President of France, Germany, Italy, et al awaken before their countries have lost their sovereignty and dignity.

With iOS 10, Apple has made a number of changes to encrypted or password protected iTunes backups. Early iOS 10 backups included a password hash used to verify whether the user had entered the correct password to decrypt the backup. This had the undesirable side effect of making it easier for hackers to crack the passwords of encrypted backups through brute force attacks, as previously reported. Apple has resolved the security flaw by removing the new password hash from encrypted iOS 10.1 backups. The computer maker has reverted from an unsafe method back to the encryption method to the one used in iOS 9, as explained in a blog post by iOS app developers Reincubate here. ® Tips and corrections 2 Comments More News Bytes 1 Mirai scan tool unleashed Security researchers have released a Mirai IoT botnet scanning tool.

October 13 AAPL: 116.98 -0.36 Evidence emerges refuting Dash developer’s claim fraudulent account was not his Ben Lovejoy - 1 month ago @benlovejoy dash View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit There was considerable speculation about what was going on when Apple pulled the popular developer app Dash from the App Store and terminated the account. The developer, Kapeli, claimed to have no idea what had led to the action, with Apple subsequently explaining that it had detected more than 1,000 fraudulent reviews on a linked account. The accounts appear to be linked by credit card, device and developer ID. Kapeli continued to proclaim its innocence, stating that the account and device were used by an unspecified ‘relative’ and that they had done nothing wrong. A post to the MacRumors forum now casts doubt on this, proving that the linked account contains apps which were originally promoted on Kapeli’s own website and in its own Twitter feed. So 5 or 6 years ago, this guy named Bogdan Popescu starts a company called Kapeli and writes a bunch of Shovelware. Puts out a bunch of PR for crap like MoveAddict. All of this is featured on his website, kapeli.com [archived link]. There in the header…moveAddict, iGuard…and something called ‘Dash’. Even his old Twitter posts confirm this. It was these old apps which Apple says were promoted with fake reviews. moveAddict 2.0 released. — Kapeli (@kapeli) September 15, 2010 Another forum user chipped in with further evidence that the apps were owned by Popescu. You’ll see all the apps ‘being sold’ by Mihaela. Let’s pick one – say ‘File View’ […] Select the next image. We can examine the image and see the file owner is a user called ‘bogdan’. This would indicate that when these screenshots were taken, a user called ‘bogdan’ owned files on that mac and created this file on this date (creation date). Kapeli posted an audio recording of a call in which an Apple representative can be heard repeatedly explaining that the company has evidence that the two accounts were linked, and that if the developer wrote a blog post acknowledging that fact, the account would be reinstated. Kapeli has so far declined to do so. Update: Kapeli has responded with a statement: At this point it’s impossible for me to protect my family and my private life anymore, so I’d like to tell the history of Kapeli and of everything I’ve done so far. In 2010 I made my first app, moveAddict. It was well received and although it’s 6 years ago and it is my first app, I still stand behind it and am proud of it. Back then I was a student at Coventry University and asked my mother to set up a romanian bank account for me to use for my app business. Although I was the only one to use this bank account, it ran under her name. I also made and released other apps, DockView being the most notable and best received of my products. I also launched some less successful apps: Switché, iGuard, iSecure, iClap and Stay Awake. In 2011 the Mac App Store was launched and I enrolled my Apple developer account. I was using the bank account my mother had opened for me. In 2012 I released Dash. It was very well received, but I continued to support and take care of my other apps as well. In 2013, my mother, who is an engineer herself, made an Apple developer account and started making apps on her own, including Ideal Weight and Brain Gym I helped and encouraged her as much as I could, including paying for her first membership year using my credit card. Throughout the years I helped her whenever she asked me to, with coding issues or other things like converting images to icons for her apps. I also gave her Xcode projects I had and used as templates for new apps. In 2014 I realised that there was no possible way for me to support and develop all of my apps anymore and decided to focus on Dash exclusively. I told my family about this and they thought I wasn’t rational, because my old apps were still making some money. My mother proposed I move some of my apps to her account and that she would handle the support and maintenance for those apps. I transferred the following apps: moveAddict, iGuard, iSecure, iClap and Stay Awake. Since then I’ve been focusing on Dash. Some clarifications: In early 2015 I finally got around to open a bank account in my name and have updated my developer account to send payments to it. When Apple said that the 2 developer accounts used the same bank account, what they meant was that the bank accounts used the same owner name until 2015. The 2 developer accounts never sent money to the exact same bank account (different IBAN). I have never received any money resulting from the actions of the other account. I did not want this story to blow over as it did. When Apple closed my account, I just wanted to notify my customers so that they knew how to migrate to the direct version of Dash. Once Apple told me what happened, I collaborated with them and did not talk to the press during that time. I also complied with their request to make a blog post telling the truth, which I sent a draft of (https://kapeli.com/apple_draft), but never received a response. I thought I could leave my family out of this, but following Apple’s statement the Internet kept digging, so I had to come forward and tell the whole story. I was not aware that the other account was involved with App Store review manipulation. I stopped following what she was doing after a while. I did not want to release any information on the developer that was behind the accused activity, in order to protect her identity.   Guides dash View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

October 13 AAPL: 116.98 -0.36 Apple in talks with Foxconn startup Sonder for its dynamic keyboard tech Jordan Kahn - 1 month ago @JordanKahn Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Sonder Keyboard, an Australian startup now part of Foxconn’s International Holding’s (FIH) Incubator program, has been in talks with Apple related to its dynamic keyboard technology, according to sources familiar with the discussions. Sonder later confirmed to 9to5Mac that the discussions took place, adding that Foxconn International Holdings and E Ink Holdings are assisting in the negotiations. The talks were carried out with members of Apple’s procurement board, according to the company. Sonder’s keyboard, which is currently available for preorder on its website for $199, utilizes E Ink technology to offer dynamic, contextual keys that can be customized to a user’s preference. The concept is not entirely unlike the contextual buttons that supply chain sources have indicated Apple will include in an upcoming MacBook Pro refresh expected to include an OLED touch panel in place of the keyboard’s current top row of function keys. While Sonder is currently showing off and accepting orders for a standalone keyboard product, Apple is reportedly interested in using a laptop module Sonder has built for OEMs. The laptop module that Apple is interested in is similar to the company’s keyboard technology that can be seen in the demo video below. Sources note that the laptop module being shown to Apple differs in that every single key is dynamic and backlit. Sonder added that it is “currently closing B2B procurement contracts with three 3rd party laptop companies to integrate our technology into their products.” While Apple is thought to be including a new OLED touch panel for dynamic buttons on upcoming MacBooks that could arrive as early as this month, it’s unclear how the Sonder technology might come into play. In theory, the technology could allow Apple to offer a wireless Magic Keyboard that offers similar functionality to its upcoming contextually sensitive buttons on MacBooks, or perhaps Apple is exploring entirely dynamic keyboards for future laptop models beyond the upcoming MacBook Pro refresh. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

OUR WIRELESS FUTURE: All the tech that’s available today, and what’s coming in the next 10 years Antonio Villas-Boas and Jeff Dunn Oct. 13, 2016, 9:36 AM 95,548 facebook linkedin twitter email print Last month, Apple made a big push towards a wireless future. By removing the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, Apple invigorated the idea of using wireless headphones to more people than ever before. The company's new completely wireless AirPods should help with that, too. Getting people to switch from wired headphones to wireless ones might seem a bit insignificant, but imagine one day you're walking down the street and all the headphone wires disappeared. And then, imagine that there were no wires at all: No telephone wires, no nada. On the surface, everything would look pretty much the same. But for everyone who switched to wireless tech, it means no more snags, tangles, and breakages. Removing wires also creates new possibilities for what technology can achieve. Cords are minor annoyances, but to settle when something better is out there is to idle in the present. If you want any involvement in the future, you're going to have to ditch wires. Beyond headphones, there are plenty of other wireless gadgets out there to help eliminate the endlessly tangled clutter of wires, and plenty more to come. Here's what wireless tech we expect to see in the next 10 years.  View As: One Page Slides First of all, why is "truly wireless" a good thing? Gavin Schaefer/Flickr Simply put, wires are the worst thing about tech. They're messy, they tangle, you can trip on them, they snag, they break, and they limit how far you can use your devices. They are a limiting factor for many technologies. So what wireless devices can you buy now to bring you closer to wireless enlightenment? Here are four main scenarios where wires rear their ugly heads the most. 1. Your computer. Not a single wire.randomfrankp/YouTube Wireless accessories can cut down the number of wires that connect your computer to various external devices, including: – Wireless mice – Wireless keyboards – Wireless printers – Wireless speakers/headphones – Wireless display adapters – Bonus: You can even ditch your hard drive, which uses a cable to transfer your stuff to and from your computer, to store all your stuff in the "cloud," like Apple's iCloud, Google Drive, or Microsoft's OneDrive. 2. Your living room entertainment center. This TV setup is one we can all strive for.MS Tech/YouTube This could be one of the biggest culprits of wire-dom. My TV, for example, is hooked up to an Xbox One, a cable box, and a 5.1 surround sound system. That's four power cables, two HDMI cables, an optical cable to link the TV to the sound system, and five wires for the sound system's satellite speakers. You can (almost) avoid all of that: – Use a smart TV with Bluetooth to connect wireless speakers, like a wireless soundbar. – Ditch cable TV (and your cable box), and stream content from over-the-top services like Netflix, Amazon Video, or Hulu from your smart TV or console that streams content, like an Xbox or PS4. – If you don't have a smart TV or a console, use a small streaming device, like the Chromecast or Roku Stick. They plug right into your TV's HDMI port, eliminating the need for an HDMI cable, and they only need a USB cable for power. You can plug the USB cable into your TV's USB port, if it has one. At least the USB cable is hidden behind your TV rather than a power cable that leads to a power strip or outlet. 3. Your mobile life. r. nial bradshaw/Flickr Mobile devices are free from cables... until you need to charge them or listen to music. The solution? Charge your mobile device wirelessly by using a wireless charging dock or mat. The mat itself still needs a power cable, and you still need to leave your mobile device in one place while it charges — just like you would with a charging cable, because it needs direct contact with the device. Still, a wireless charging dock/mat lets you hide away the cable from sight. The only problem is that not all phones support wireless charging, namely the iPhone. Still, hopefuls out there will be pleased to know that Apple's next iPhone in 2017 is rumored to support wireless charging. Yes, those are just rumors, but it could happen. 4. Your music. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Wireless Bluetooth headphones are pretty great. They can be a pain at times, as you sometimes need to dig through your settings and re-pair your headphones. But Apple set out to fix that problem with its new W1 chip that makes it incredibly easy to connect to your devices. For example, to pair Apple's new AirPods to your iPhone, all you need to do is open their charging case and they'll pair automatically with your iPhone. There's no need to trudge through your Bluetooth settings. The only limitation is that the W1 chip is only compatible with Apple products, like the iPhone and MacBook computers. So, unless another company out there develops a more open standard to solve the convoluted wireless pairing issue, people who don't use Apple products are out of luck. Of course, wireless headphones aren't fully wireless, as you need to charge them with a cable. But these minor annoyances pay off when you have full range of motion while listening to your favorite music, so you don't need to worry about getting tangled in wires or having them catch a random surface. So there are several ways you can ditch a bunch of cables TODAY, but what about the next 10 years? Paramount Pictures/YouTube The next 10 years: Bringing super-fast internet over the air without waiting for the infrastructure to upgrade. An internet speedtest of Google's Fiber internet service. This is what gigabit internet looks like, and you could potentially see these speeds with Starry. Soon. Soon.TheHerkyrat/YouTube One company called Starry has an idea to deliver gigabit internet (1,000 Mbps, or 125 megabytes per second) with minimal upgrades to infrastructure, and it can absolutely happen within the next 10 years — possibly even in the next five. It works by transmitting internet signals via transmitters dotted around a city, much like cell towers. That signal is received by an antenna/modem combo you install outside a window, which is then transmitted (via cable, mind you) to the Starry WiFi router or your own WiFi router of choice.  Starry's service is currently in beta in Boston, and the company claims it'll roll out to more cities by the end of 2016 and into 2017. Even Google Fiber, Google's own gigabit internet service, is looking to ditch physical fiber-optic cables in favor of a wireless solution that could help the service roll out to more cities more quickly (and more cheaply, too, since laying down miles of fiber-optic cables and digging up service lines or upgrading above-ground lines is extremely costly). The next 10 years: LiFi, the evolution of WiFi   The concept of LiFi is simple: LED light bulbs can flood a room with internet. It works by flickering LED light bulbs extremely quickly, which transmits Visible Light Communication signals (VLC) to devices that can receive VLC. "All we need to do is fit a small microchip to every potential illumination device," Harald Haas, the inventor of LiFi and a professor at the University of Edinburgh, said during a TED Talk in 2011. LiFi can achieve speeds of up to 224 gigabits per second in testing. That's 28.6 gigabytes per second. With those speeds, you could potentially download a 90-minute 8K – that's eight-kay – movie in 22 seconds.  While those astronomical speeds might not become a reality in the next 10 years, LiFi technology itself could. A LiFi company called Velmenni claims we could see it "rolled out for consumers within the next three to four years" as of 2015, according to the International Business Times UK.  The next 10 years: Wireless charging everywhere. Wireless charging can become more ubiquitous over the next 10 years when furniture companies start incorporating wireless charging systems into their products, thus eliminating the need for a special charging surface, like a mat or dock. IKEA is currently the leader in this concept, as it offers tables and lamps with stands that have built-in wireless charging pads.  And you'll even find wireless charging spots in public spaces, like some restaurants, airports, and even universities. The next 10 years: Wireless power for bigger devices. PCWorldVideos/YouTube The next step in the wireless charging space is wireless power for larger devices that need more power than smartphones or tablets, like laptops. Companies like Intel and WiTricity are developing power mats that can pump out enough wireless juice for power-hungry laptops.  The next 10 years: Truly wireless power is the elephant in the room. Karl Baron/Flickr Even if you've got all the wireless gadgets you can possibly use to ditch wires, you'll still find cables strewn across your home or office to power anything that uses electricity, even wireless charging docks. We need truly wireless power for truly wireless freedom. That way, we can place tech wherever we want instead of looking for a power outlet, or charge our mobile devices by just being inside a building rather than leaving them in their usual spots to charge. The next 10 years: The true innovation in wireless power doesn't need special power mats, furniture, or any power cables at all. Diliff/Wikipedia Power company WiTricity claims to have developed truly wireless charging and power for any and all electric devices in your home. Unlike wireless charging mats, which require direct contact between the charging surface and the device, WiTricity says its solution is "resonantly enhanced" to work on a much bigger scale and over longer distances. WiTricity claims it can transmit wireless power up to a several meters from the main wireless power source, depending on the distance and power requirements of your devices. That means several wireless power sources discreetly installed throughout your home could power pretty much anything that requires electricity. Imagine your smartphone or laptop charging just by being inside a building. I'm particularly fond of this concept, although it's yet to be seen how effective this technology is at charging multiple devices at once, and how fast it can charge those devices. Back in 2014, WiTricity predicted to CNN "kids that are growing up in a couple of years will never have to plug anything in again to charge it." Those two years have passed, and we're still not seeing this level of wireless electricity being used in the mainstream. Yet, the technology is here and ready to use, so it's entirely possible to become more mainstream in the next 10 years. While this wireless future sounds great, it’s still very much a “future.” There are a few familiar hang-ups keeping these sort of cable-free solutions from prevalence today. Let’s start with the obvious one: Wired tech still just works. Google In order for wireless tech to become the norm, it has to add demonstrable value to the wired things it’s trying to supersede. In many cases today, that’s simply not the case. Wireless headphones introduce a host of battery and connection quality issues. Wireless mice add concerns with latency. Wireless charging is slower than using a USB cable. And so on. Simply “being wireless” won’t be enough of an incentive for everyone to make the switch, especially when wireless tech usually comes at a price premium now. It’s a chicken and egg conundrum. The more people that adopt wireless tech, the more incentive companies have to improve it. But for more people to adopt wireless tech, it needs to improve. This is why Apple ditching the headphone jack is such a big deal for wireless audio: It has a ton of customers, and they’re all hungry for a better wireless experience right this instant. This is the natural order of things in consumer tech — and we're already seeing advances — but, as always, it takes time. Outside of the user experience, there are also complications when it comes to advancing wireless standards. Flickr/Nicolas Nova In an ideal world, the wireless things in our life would all work in harmony, and the underlying platforms they use would be the most technically advanced around. You wouldn’t have to worry about if your smart lights can connect to your smart speaker. Everyone — developers and consumers — would all be on the same page. If only. The thing about tech companies is they want to make money. That makes getting them to agree on a broadly compatible set of wireless standards a cumbersome process. Take Bluetooth, for instance. It has a centralized body, the Bluetooth SIG, that counts thousands of Bluetooth-using companies as members, and oversees the development of the tech as a whole. Almost anyone can use it, and almost everyone does. However, the fact Bluetooth accounts for so many companies’ needs makes pushing out new and improved versions of the tech very slow. It has to make sure the tech actually works with all sorts of devices, for one. It also has to deal with internal politicking, since many of its members want to get whatever intellectual property they’ve developed toward the standard to be included in the final spec, and thus ensure they get a cut whenever it’s deployed. That’s just one example. The new 5G network, which will be much more capable than the 4G LTE we use on our mobile devices today, doesn’t even have a base set of standards yet; it looks like it’ll be relatively open, but right now, it’s more of a concept than a concrete piece of tech. While things usually work themselves out, the point is that openness usually comes at a cost, both in terms of time and general quality. The alternative is to let companies create and license their own wireless standards. The Google Chromecast (2015).Getty/Justin Sullivan Think something like Google Cast, or Apple’s AirPlay. Proprietary tech like this is often better than an open alternative, since the company developing the standard isn’t beholden to other needs. (Or at least, not as much.) Still, it’s a trade-off. You’re more likely to run into fragmentation — i.e., some devices inevitably won’t support (or pay for) every private standard — and you run the risk of letting a smaller group of companies hold the keys over everyone else, which distorts the development playing field. This is not a new conflict, and it’s one without a clear solution. Nevertheless, it’s a catch-22 that’ll likely keep any wireless future from arriving as smoothly as it could. The other big, high-level challenge to an all-wireless future, particularly when it comes to 5G, is infrastructure. Starry To put it simply, wireless tech requires wireless spectrum — the invisible frequencies in the air that serve as a sort of “highway” for various wireless technologies. This comes at a premium. In the US, companies have to go through the federal government, and pay for the right to use certain wireless bands in spectrum auctions. The FCC voted to open up more spectrum for 5G earlier this year, but how exactly it’ll be divvied up and auctioned off remains to be seen. What we can say now is that not all spectrum is equal, and some of the spectrum that’s set to make 5G a thing will require serious preparations from both tech companies and policymakers. That’s because a good chunk of the proposed 5G spectrum works on higher-than-usual bands, meaning it allows for faster speeds, but doesn’t travel as far, and has a harder time getting through walls. To combat this, companies will have to make further advances in antenna and reception technologies, then install a whole lot of base stations to keep those short-range wireless signals bouncing from one spot to the next. Companies can’t just plant stuff like that willy-nilly, though. Agreements will have to be made with local governments (and possibly landlords) that allow these things to be installed and maintained. If this sounds like a logistical nightmare, it is! It’s also the kind of thing that could roadblock a startup like Starry, which doesn’t have the deep pockets of a Verizon or a Comcast. Still, this process is easier to take on if you’re building a wireless network (just ask Google), and lots of groundwork has already been laid to make better wireless a reality. It’s probably going to happen — and when it does, it should be great. It’s just not going to be easy.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 13, 2016 at 8:48AM Image source: Apple.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fundamentally redefined the concept of the smartphone with its 2007 introduction of the original iPhone. In the years following, the company has led the way in bringing significant, even game-changing features that have helped transform the smartphone into arguably the most important -- and most used -- computing device category in today's world. The iPhone, unsurprisingly, is far and away Apple's most important product category from a business and financial point of view. Today, I'd like to go over three key facts about Apple's iPhone business that current and potential investors in the company should be keenly aware of. Most of Apple's revenue and profits come from iPhone In the company's last fiscal year, the iPhone brought in approximately $155 billion in revenue out of a total of roughly $234 billion. This means that more than 66% of the company's revenue that year came from sales of iPhones . Moreover, Apple's dependence on the iPhone has actually increased over the last couple of years, jumping from 53.4% of revenue in fiscal year 2013 to a whopping 66.3% of revenue in fiscal year 2015. Additionally, as the iPhone is widely believed to be a higher-margin product than the company's iPad or Mac lineup, it seems likely that the iPhone makes up an even larger portion of Apple's operating profit, and therefore net income. It's this dependence on the iPhone that leads many investors, analysts, and investment commentators to focus so much on the performance of this product category for Apple. If the iPhone is doing well, Apple's financials and share price should do well. If iPhone does badly, then the company's financials and share price should largely follow suit. Apple's iPhone average selling prices eclipse its competitors' One of the reasons that Apple has seen such financial success from the iPhone is that it sells a lot of iPhones at average selling prices (ASPs) that are well above what its competitors are able to command. In fiscal year 2015, for example, Apple brought in around $155 billion in revenue from iPhone on unit shipments of about 231 million, implying an ASP of $665. To put this into perspective, during the second quarter 2016, Apple's chief rival Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) reported overall mobile revenue of approximately $23 billion. Market research firm IDC estimates that Samsung shipped approximately 77 million smartphones in that quarter. Even if we assume that all of this mobile revenue came from smartphones, we're looking at smartphone ASPs of approximately $298 -- less than half of Apple's. Note that this is an upper bound, as Samsung's mobile business includes revenue from tablets and smartwatches in addition to smartphones, including low-end smartphones. In terms of average revenue and gross profit per smartphone, Apple is way out in front relative to its competition. This is viewed as both a strength (Apple currently has pricing power, allowing it to capture much of the profit in the smartphone industry), as well as a potential liability (Apple is at risk of being undercut on pricing, for example). Apple's iPhone business is currently growth-challenged Through fiscal year 2015, Apple's iPhone business always managed to deliver some level of revenue and unit growth. However, Apple is currently expected to report its first-ever annual decline in iPhone unit shipments and revenue in fiscal year 2016, following the first quarterly declines that were recently reported. Clearly, given that Apple's revenue and profit depend so substantially on iPhone sales, this has been a key tenet of the bearish thesis around the company's stock. If the iPhone continues to decline, then Apple's revenue and profits are set to suffer, particularly as it will be very difficult for Apple's other businesses -- large in their own right, but in aggregate still much smaller than iPhone -- to pick up the slack. However, if the iPhone 7 helps return the iPhone category to growth in the coming fiscal year, then the company could be looking at couple of good years of iPhone growth, particularly as Apple is expected to make some dramatic changes with next year's iPhone that could further fuel demand growth.

Dozens of images have been shared on Twitter and other websites, providing us our first glimpse at the revamped location that's been under construction for more than a year. The lower level of the redesigned store (Sebastian Anthony via Twitter) Apple Regent Street now features Apple's next-generation retail design, previously seen at its flagship Union Square location in San Francisco, including wide, open spaces with indoor trees, sequoia wood tables and shelves for displaying products, a large 6K video screen, and light boxes extending the length of the ceiling. Two new side staircases lead to a second level (Ian Betteridge via Twitter) The location now has a Genius Grove, a section at the center of the store designated for customers to receive support side-by-side with Geniuses under the canopy of local trees. This area is able to accommodate more customers than a traditional Genius Bar commonly found at Apple's other retail locations. Apple's new Regent Street storefront (Nick Dines via Twitter) In line with remodeling plans filed last year, the storefront is no longer adorned with four Apple logos in each window, but rather a large, white flag with the Apple logo. The central glass staircase has been removed, replaced with two new side staircases that lead to the second level with more product displays and workshop space. Apple retail chief Angela Ahrendts was on hand to preview the new store, designed by Foster and Partners, the award-winning architecture firm behind Apple's upcoming Campus 2 headquarters and Union Square retail location. Apple Regent Street will open its doors to the public on Saturday at 10:00 a.m. local time.

Stock Back In The Arms Of Wall Street (AAPL) Here's why Apple is a darling once again By Michelle Jones, ValueWalk  |  Oct 13, 2016, 9:30 am EST     Popular Posts: GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Slapped With Multiple Downgrades Recent Posts: GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Slapped With Multiple Downgrades Post Election Actions to Take: Pause, Reflect, and Act Carefully Is Gold a Safe Bet No Matter What the Fed Does? View All Posts It seems the great chill that settled over Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock within the last year may be clearing as Wall Street is happy to welcome the iPhone maker back into its portfolios. No hard feelings, right? After all, the sun is shining on the company again thanks to Samsung’s (SSNLF) massive Galaxy Note 7 recall, and it seems the iPhone 7 cycle isn’t turning out to be as bad as some were worried it would be. Apple Stock’s on a Winning Streak Apple stock continued rising on Wednesday, marking the seventh consecutive trading day of gains. The shares look to be on track for their longest winning streak in nearly two years. They’re also on track to test the 52-week high of $123.82, although they still remain in the $117 range. As of this writing, Apple stock is at $117.34 per share, and it closed at its highest level in ten months on Tuesday. Credit Suisse Group AG (ADR) (CS) analyst Kulbinder Garcha said earlier this week that Samsung’s recall of the Note 7 will not only benefit Apple in the short term but in the long term as well. He noted that the iPhone maker has an exceptionally high retention rate, even as high as 90% or possibly higher. As a result, if consumers switch to an iPhone 7 Plus instead of the Note 7 (or even an iPhone 7 instead of one of other Samsung’s other smartphones), they might never switch back. Samsung, Apple Thanks You So just how much will Apple benefit from Samsung’s major flub? Analysts who follow the iPhone maker have been quick to say that it will be the big winner, but they’re forgetting another entrant: Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL) Google. 10 Stocks That Every Investor Should Own The Pixel and Pixel XL are larger than the iPhone 7 models, and thus, anyone who is an Android loyalist may be more likely to pick up a Pixel instead. The big thing about the Note line (literally) is the large display, and Apple continues to lag behind in this area. Yes, the display on the iPhone 7 Plus is a large 5.5 inches in size, but it’s still a bit smaller than the display on the Galaxy Note 7. Of course the Pixel XL is also 5.5 inches, so again, it would require a very small step down in size. However, at least they can stick with the Android operating system instead of re-purchasing all of their apps on iOS. Also neither phone offers a stylus anything like Samsung’s S-Pen. Overall, analysts don’t believe this is the end for Samsung or for its smartphone line. In fact, Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts believe sales of the Galaxy S7 line have remained unaffected by the Note 7 fiasco. Of course the big question will come early next year, probably in March, when the Galaxy S8 comes out. Sales of that phone should give us a hint on just how serious the damage to Samsung’s brand is. Does Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock Have Any Takeover Options Left? By then we should also have a clue about just how much Apple is benefiting from the explosive Note 7. Certainly the action in Apple stock suggests that investors expect a sizable benefit from Samsung’s misfortune. The post Apple Inc.

PT Written by Dave Mark This video is a walk through the Apple Music interface, highlighting various features. Feels like it belongs on the official Apple Music page. It’s certainly too long for an ad. One thing worth noticing are the not-quite-transparent circles that stand in for a finger tap or drag. Watch the video with that in mind. There are a lot of them. The circles are used both for touches and to highlight sections of the interface. My guess is, these circles are part of some third party screen recording app and were placed there frame-by-frame. I would love it if Apple would expose the technology that made those circles as part of the QuickTime Player’s iPhone screen recording interface. There are ways to capture touches in a video but, in my opinion, none come close to matching these. Caleb Hightower Nice video. Wish I could like Music as much as I like this video. John Whitley I doubt those are a vanilla screen-recorder with tap data. If you look closely, many (all?) of the motion actions represented aren’t drags. The moving circle represents the gesture of a finger swooping above the UI then tapping. Apple’s ad animates the flavor of casual user interaction beyond the confines of pure touch event data. This suggests that the circle animations were hand-edited, possibly with assistance from a screen recorder that also records touches. Either way, it sets a bar for how to do a fluid video illustration of a touch UI. Jeronimo Oh, one of my favorite subjects. 🙂 These circles representing touch activity definitely look like they’ve added afterwards, apps like ScreenFlow have a feature just for that. It’s a real pain to do this manually, but the only way (at least known to me) to record the screen WITH the taps at the same time use to require jailbreaking and an app called “Display Recorder” from Cydia. With that, it was a breeze. Side note: Android has a system setting for that, out of the box. It’s called “Show taps” if I recall correctly. What I would give for Apple to include that in iOS. SchillerJP Yes, the technology is already available, the app is called ‘After Effects’ Ian Davies Yeah, as someone else said, this was done in After Effects. I’ve done enough of these type of things to know the difference between screen capture and motion graphics.

Apple has finally completed the work and the new store will be open to the public on Saturday, October 15. The press got an early look at the new appearance, as shown by these photos via Engadget. The glass staircase and most of the first floor have been removed to create a dramatic double-height “grand hall” replete with green trees bathed in natural light. The redesign brings the Regent Store appearance in line with the ‘next generation’ stores already seen in some US locations, created by Jony Ive and team. Sadly, the iconic glass staircase has had to go — customers can now use one of two stairs made from Italian stone … The redesign in Regent Street is as you would expect, if you have already seen the new look stores elsewhere. There are twelve real planted trees for decoration around the product tables demoing iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and MacBooks. Construction work on the new store took an incredibly long time; it appears this was all in service of bringing more natural light into the building. Apple has removed the outward-facing logos from the side of the store, to let light flood in through the windows. From the pavement, a single central flag bears the Apple logo. The removal of much of the raised first floor also helps make the store feel spacious and inviting — this is actually a significant decision as it means upper floor space has actually been reduced. The store is meant to feel airy and light. It looks great in this press tour but perhaps the effect will be lost when the store is flooded with real customers. Apple Watch bands and other accessories are on display in cabinets that are inset into the walls of the store. There’s even some panels of foliage for additional greenery. There is also a video wall that is flanked by the staircases that lead upstairs. The upstairs section is filled with “Creative Pros” employees that teach customers about how to use their iOS devices and Mac for productivity and creative workflows. Apple told press that some elements of these stores will be mirrored in the company’s new spaceship campus, opening in 2017. If you want to check out the new London store, make your way to Regents Street on Saturday for the store’s “grand reopening” at 10 AM.

The Burlingame Planning Commission unanimously agreed to postpone approving a proposed renovation of the Apple Store and instead directed architects to draw up plans better respecting the aesthetics of the city’s shopping district, according to video of the Tuesday, Oct. 11, meeting. Commissioners appreciated the multinational tech company’s interest in establishing its rebranded look in Burlingame, but showed greater interest in a development reflecting the character of downtown. “The challenge for us is that this building is architecture as product design. It comes across as a product and I understand that is what you are all about. But a building is not a product. We want buildings to do certain things for the community beyond selling things,” said commission Chair Will Loftis. Apple is rolling out a new look for its store and is seeking approval to redesign the company’s Burlingame location to reflect the sleek design featured prominently in its brand of phones, computers, tablets and other devices. The proposed building renovation nearly mirrors the appearance of an Apple laptop computer, with a hard glossy silver shell covering the outer perimeter giving way to a glassy, clear and interactive entrance where customers can be seen shopping from the street. Officials gave glowing reviews to the proposed renovated look of the store front facing Burlingame Avenue, but took issue with the rest of the building which featured little more than the company’s trademark silver paint and logo. Considering the building’s location at the corner of Park Road, serving as a primary access point to the city’s shopping district, officials expressed a desire to see a design showing greater respect to its prominent placement downtown. Jennifer Pfaff, president of the archives for the Burlingame Historical Society, said she would like Apple to consider amending its plans to spruce up the look of the back of the building to be more congruous with the neighboring businesses. “I still don’t feel they get a pass because their architecture is corporate architecture and that is just what they want because that goes with their product,” said Pfaff. Commissioner Nirmala Bandrapalli echoed a similar sentiment, and suggested a mural on the back side of the building might be a fair compromise to improve the design aesthetics. “I don’t like the big blank wall,” she said, referring to the minimal design featured on both the side and back of the building. Apple representatives though showed a reticence to acquiesce, claiming the company has already redesigned components of its proposal based on previous discussions to address the wishes of Burlingame officials. “We are trying to meet the community halfway and meet the desires of the downtown plan and we feel like we have done that,” said Matthew Green, director of design for Apple’s retail locations. Loftis acknowledged he and the other commissioners appreciated the efforts of Apple to hear their concerns, but indicated he felt more should be done before the renovation is approved. “Burlingame is a small town and it’s a prominent building in a prominent location,” he said. “It is sort of a big deal and it is going to stick out like a sore thumb.” Ultimately the commission directed Apple representatives to come back at a yet to be determined date with amended renovation designs addressing the issues they raised. Commissioner Michael Gaul was absent from the meeting and Commissioner Jeff DeMartini abstained from addressing the project. In other news at the meeting, some neighbors of a proposal to redevelop the existing site of a historic home at 1128 Douglas Ave. into a 29-unit apartment building expressed concerns regarding traffic and parking. Former councilman John Root said he feared the proposed five-story apartment project would be too large for its surroundings and could congest neighborhood streets with cars belonging to tenants and guests. “Five stories is just too tall,” he said. “It’s overbearing.” To make way for the project, builders have suggested razing the residence at 1132 Douglas Ave. and picking up the historic house next door at 1128 Douglas Ave. to move it about half a mile away to a location on Oak Grove Avenue, where another existing home would be demolished. The house located at 1128 Douglas Ave. is the former home of James Murphy, who served as an early city stationmaster and later worked as city clerk before his death in 1940. His wife Jessie Murphy served as a park commissioner and helped develop Burlingame’s identity as “the City of Trees,” according to a city report. The home, erected in 1903 and relocated to its current location in 1914, is recognized by the city as a historic resource. The project is in the midst of the environmental review process, and community members are invited to share their perspective until the public comment window closes Thursday, Oct. 20. austin@smdailyjournal.com (650) 344-5200 ext. 105     Tags: building, apple, burlingame, design, proposed, location, Other stories from today: Foster City to explore new rules for pot: Officials consider ban on commercial operations if Proposition 64 passes Two arrested in San Bruno on suspicion of theft, meth San Mateo County police reports     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   What do you think of Donald Trump's election as president of the United States?

Apple Store fires staff for stealing customers' private pics Engadget UK 13/10/2016 Mariella Moon © Provided by Engadget UK Another Apple Store in Australia is embroiled in a scandal, and this time, it involves explicit photos. According to Courier Mail, the Carindale Apple Store in Queensland fired four male employees for not only stealing sensitive images from customers' phones sent in for repair, but also for taking creepshots of their female co-workers. The four reportedly shared their loot with other employees in chat, where they rated women's body parts out of 10. By the time their MO was discovered, they already had quite a collection going: the publication says they were in possession of over 100 creepshots and stolen images, including close-ups of women's chests and derrières. The whole thing was apparently blown wide open when a staff member found one of the employees involved browsing a customer's iPhone in the repair room. Courier Mail says the Carindale store then brought in an HR executive from overseas to investigate the issue. In a statement sent to the various publications, Apple insists that its investigator didn't find evidence that the employees transferred customers' photos and took inappropriate shots of female co-workers without their consent. Nevertheless, Cupertino confirmed that the store already sacked several people as a result of its findings. It's unclear why the company would fire anyone if nothing improper took place, so we reached out for clarification. Here is Apple's full statement: "We are investigating a violation of Apple's business conduct policy at our store in Carindale, where several employees have already been terminated as a result of our findings. Based on our investigation thus far, we have seen no evidence that customer data or photos were inappropriately transferred or that anyone was photographed by these former employees. We have met with our store team to let them know about the investigation and inform them about the steps Apple is taking to protect their privacy. Apple believes in treating everyone equally and with respect, and we do not tolerate behaviour that goes against our values." Last year, an Apple Store in Melbourne landed in hot water after employees kicked out a group of black teenagers. Their reason? They were worried that the kids would "steal something." The store apologized for the incident, and Apple chief Tim Cook sent out a company-wide email calling the incident "unacceptable."

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 13, 2016 at 8:48AM Image source: Apple.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fundamentally redefined the concept of the smartphone with its 2007 introduction of the original iPhone. In the years following, the company has led the way in bringing significant, even game-changing features that have helped transform the smartphone into arguably the most important -- and most used -- computing device category in today's world. The iPhone, unsurprisingly, is far and away Apple's most important product category from a business and financial point of view. Today, I'd like to go over three key facts about Apple's iPhone business that current and potential investors in the company should be keenly aware of. Most of Apple's revenue and profits come from iPhone In the company's last fiscal year, the iPhone brought in approximately $155 billion in revenue out of a total of roughly $234 billion. This means that more than 66% of the company's revenue that year came from sales of iPhones . Moreover, Apple's dependence on the iPhone has actually increased over the last couple of years, jumping from 53.4% of revenue in fiscal year 2013 to a whopping 66.3% of revenue in fiscal year 2015. Additionally, as the iPhone is widely believed to be a higher-margin product than the company's iPad or Mac lineup, it seems likely that the iPhone makes up an even larger portion of Apple's operating profit, and therefore net income. It's this dependence on the iPhone that leads many investors, analysts, and investment commentators to focus so much on the performance of this product category for Apple. If the iPhone is doing well, Apple's financials and share price should do well. If iPhone does badly, then the company's financials and share price should largely follow suit. Apple's iPhone average selling prices eclipse its competitors' One of the reasons that Apple has seen such financial success from the iPhone is that it sells a lot of iPhones at average selling prices (ASPs) that are well above what its competitors are able to command. In fiscal year 2015, for example, Apple brought in around $155 billion in revenue from iPhone on unit shipments of about 231 million, implying an ASP of $665. To put this into perspective, during the second quarter 2016, Apple's chief rival Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) reported overall mobile revenue of approximately $23 billion. Market research firm IDC estimates that Samsung shipped approximately 77 million smartphones in that quarter. Even if we assume that all of this mobile revenue came from smartphones, we're looking at smartphone ASPs of approximately $298 -- less than half of Apple's. Note that this is an upper bound, as Samsung's mobile business includes revenue from tablets and smartwatches in addition to smartphones, including low-end smartphones. In terms of average revenue and gross profit per smartphone, Apple is way out in front relative to its competition. This is viewed as both a strength (Apple currently has pricing power, allowing it to capture much of the profit in the smartphone industry), as well as a potential liability (Apple is at risk of being undercut on pricing, for example). Apple's iPhone business is currently growth-challenged Through fiscal year 2015, Apple's iPhone business always managed to deliver some level of revenue and unit growth. However, Apple is currently expected to report its first-ever annual decline in iPhone unit shipments and revenue in fiscal year 2016, following the first quarterly declines that were recently reported. Clearly, given that Apple's revenue and profit depend so substantially on iPhone sales, this has been a key tenet of the bearish thesis around the company's stock. If the iPhone continues to decline, then Apple's revenue and profits are set to suffer, particularly as it will be very difficult for Apple's other businesses -- large in their own right, but in aggregate still much smaller than iPhone -- to pick up the slack. However, if the iPhone 7 helps return the iPhone category to growth in the coming fiscal year, then the company could be looking at couple of good years of iPhone growth, particularly as Apple is expected to make some dramatic changes with next year's iPhone that could further fuel demand growth.

 Apple is thinking about using Apple Watch-tracked gestures to control your devices Rob Price Oct. 13, 2016, 8:14 AM 673 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Apple Watch.Eric Thayer/Getty Images Apple has an idea for a novel new way to control your devices: Smartwatch-tracked gesture controls. In a patent application published on Thursday, the Californian technology company outlines a way to interact with the Apple Watch and other linked devices using special sensors in the wearable device. These sensors will monitor hand and arm movements, figure out what the user is doing, then translate them into commands. You might rotate your wrist to modify the volume, or raise the angle of your hand to accept a phone call, or lower your hand to scroll through a list of apps. "The device can be attached to, resting on, or touching the user's wrist, ankle or other body part," the filing says. "One or more optical sensors, inertial sensors, mechanical contact sensors, and myoelectric sensors can detect movements of the user's body. Based on the detected movements, a user gesture can be determined. The device can interpret the gesture as an input command, and the device can perform an operation based on the input command." Gesture controls for computers has never really hit the mainstream, and often relies on camera input to track the users' hands. (Gaming is a different story.) Making use of wearables that the user already owns is an interesting alternative approach — and would work even in low-light conditions or situations where the the users' hand(s) are not directly in front of a camera. Examples of gestures from the patent filing.Apple/USPTO It's worth noting that Apple files thousands of patents every year, and many never make it into finished products. They can be wildly experimental, or precautionary, or intended to trip up competitors who might be exploring similar areas. But it does demonstrate that Apple is thinking about the potential of gesture controls as a new input method, and has been for years. The patent application was published on Thursday, but it was first filed back in October 2013, a year before the first Apple Watch was even announced. It's also similar to another patent application published in March 2016, that was reported on at the time by 9to5Mac.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 13 October 2016 | MYT 5:01 PM Amazon joins music wars with new streaming service Big push into music: Amazon's Music Unlimited service can be used with the company's Echo. — Amazon Inc NEW YORK: Online giant Amazon entered the streaming music wars Oct 12, taking on rivals like Spotify and Apple with a subscription service that offers discounts to those using its voice-controlled speakers.  Amazon Music Unlimited will offer “tens of millions of songs” to subscribers, the company said, a step up from the two million available on its existing Amazon Prime streaming service.  The new service costs US$9.99 (RM42) a month for US customers – the same as rivals Spotify Premium, Apple Music and Google Play – but Amazon is offering a discounted rate of US$3.99 (RM17) for subscribers who limit use to its Echo, Dot or Tap speakers.  Current Prime customers can get the new service for US$7.99 (RM34) a month or US$79 (RM333) a year, Amazon said.  The new service is available to US customers, and will launch later this year in Britain, Germany and Austria, the company said in a statement.  ”Amazon Music Unlimited brings real value to the millions of people who are already Prime members,” said Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos.  ”And if you want a sense of the future of voice-controlled music, go ahead and ask Alexa (Amazon’s digital personal assistant) for a free Music Unlimited trial, and play around on your Echo,” Bezos said.  ”If you don’t know the name of a song but know a few lyrics, if you want to hear songs from a specific decade, or even if you’re looking for music to match your mood, just ask.”   Tie-in to Echo  Dan Rayburn, a Frost & Sullivan analyst who follows streaming media, said the new service offers “a nice tie-in to Amazon’s Echo, something that the other services don’t have.”  Rayburn noted that streaming music is “a challenging market, with nobody making money” but that Amazon can afford to offer lower prices with incentives for its hardware and Prime – a service which offers discounted shipping, access to online video and other content.  ”It’s very hard to make money when you’re a standalone service like Spotify,” Rayburn said.  ”Amazon doesn’t need to make money on this because they can push their other devices. They’re using it as a catalyst to sell more stuff.”  Echo is Amazon’s home hub, powered by artificial intelligence to answer questions, control smart appliances, order merchandise from the online giant and play music.  Music streaming has boomed this year, with the number of streams more than doubling in the first six months of the year compared to the same period last year, according to trade specialists BuzzAngle Music.  In the United States, streaming services had 18.3 million subscribers in June, up from 9.1 million at the same time last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America,  Amazon’s new US offering comes a month after Sweden’s Spotify said it had passed 40 million paying subscribers, consolidating its position as world leader in the streaming sector.   Spotify stands well clear of its nearest rival Apple Music, which had some 17 million paying subscribers as of September, but it has yet to post an annual profit, spending most of its revenue on compensating artists and rights-holders.  Streaming music services are also offered by Google, Pandora and a number of other groups.  Pandora this week debuted its latest offering, a US$5 (RM21) per month service which lacks some of the features of Spotify and others but is ad-free and allows users to skip or repeat songs.  Last month Norwegian media said the Tidal streaming service, owned by rap megastar Jay-Z, had posted heavy losses and was having problems making payments on time.  Tidal had a major boost earlier in the year when Beyoncé – who is married to Jay-Z – released her album Lemonade exclusively on the service. — AFP  You May Be Interested UHD TVs tipped for holiday season boost Two major Russian banks say hit by cyberattacks Bangladesh retrieves a fifth of US$81mil stolen in cyber heist Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

Opinions Home Sponsorship Membership Account Insider Login Insider Dashboard Insider Forum' About Tech.pinions Contact Us Become An Insider CarPlay: The Best Incarnation of Apple’s Ecosystem Analysis Featured Tech.pinions The Daily Techpinion Carolina Milanesi / October 12th, 2016 Apple is making a car. The code name is “Project Titan.” Apple brings back Bob Mansfield from retirement to lead the project. Apple lays off dozens of employees who were presumably working on the car project that was never confirmed. Apple might no longer be making a car. There! You are all caught up on the months of speculation around Apple and cars! What I do know for sure is Apple is in my car today. A new car I have had now for about 10 days. A totally unnecessary purchase justified by the fact that my old car – a 2014 Suburban – was not technologically savvy enough. Now, I have the 2016 model and it does all sorts of things for me — warning me about lane departures, making my seat vibrate when a car or pedestrian is approaching me while reversing, and showing me the direction with a big red arrow on my screen. The most interesting part, however, is having CarPlay and Android Auto. As I am currently using an iPhone 7 Plus, I tried out CarPlay and the results are quite interesting. I have been using Google Maps pretty much since I got to the US four years ago. My old car had a navigation system but I hated it so I was using my phone with a Bluetooth connection. I had tried Apple Maps when it first came out but went back to Google and soon got used to certain features, such as the multi-lane turn as well as the exact timing of the command. I got comfortable with it and, aside from trying out HereWeGo and Waze, I have been pretty much happy with Google. Having CarPlay made me rediscover Maps and features like where I parked my car, the suggested travel time to home or school or the office, suggestions based on routine or calendar information — all pleasant surprises that showed me what I had been missing out. It also showed me how, by fully embracing the ecosystem, you receive greater benefits. Having the direction clearly displayed on the large car screen was better and, while there is still a little bit of uneasiness about not using Google Maps, I have now switched over. Maps on Apple Watch just completes the car experience as the device gently taps you as you need to make the turn. It is probably the best example I have seen thus far of devices working together to deliver an enhanced experience vs. one device taking over the other. Music has been in my car thanks to a subscription to Sirius XM but, at home, we also have an Apple Music subscription as well as Amazon Prime Music. With CarPlay, my music starts to play in the car as soon as the phone is connected and, despite my husband’s initial resistance, this past weekend, he was converted. He asked Siri to play Rancid and he was somewhat surprised when one of his favorite songs came on. My daughter is also happily making requests to Siri and everybody catching a ride is quite relieved not to be subjected to Kidz Bop Radio non-stop. The best feature, however, is having Siri read and compose text messages for you. I know I can do that outside my car as well but I rarely do, because, well frankly, I don’t have to: typing serves me just fine. When I interact with Siri, the exchange feels very transactional, i ask a question I get an answer and that is it. The car is the perfect storm when it comes to getting you hooked on voice commands. You are not supposed to be texting and driving, the space is confined, and there is little background noise as the music is turned off when you speak (I have to admit a switch to turn off the kids would be nice too). Siri (she) gets commands and messages right 90% of the time which gets me to use her more. Interestingly, it is also the time where I have a more natural, more conversational, exchange with Siri: Siri: There is a new message from XYZ would you like me to read it to you? Me: Yes, please. Siri: (reads message) Siri: Would you like to respond Me: Yes Siri: Go ahead Me: Yada Yada Yada Siri: You are replying Yada Yada Yada, ready to send? Me: Yes At the end, you have a pretty satisfied feeling of having achieved what you wanted and not once moving your eyes from the road ahead. Our Voice Assistant survey did show a preference for consumers to use their voice assistant in the car. Fifty-one percent of the US consumers we interviewed said they do, so I am clearly not alone. I would argue that interacting through car speakers vs the phone – assuming you are not holding the phone to your mouth which would not be hands-free – gives you higher fidelity and therefore a better, more engaging experience. While we wait for autonomous cars (maybe even one by Apple) to take over and leave us free to either work or play while we go from point A and B, it is understandable that CarPlay stays limited to functions that complement your driving but do not interfere with your concentration. That said, I think there is a lot of room for Apple to deliver a smarter experience in the car if it accesses more information from the car and the user. Suggesting a gas station when the gas indicator goes below a certain point, suggesting a place to park when we get to our destination, or a restaurant if we are driving somewhere where we have not been before and are close to lunch time. The possibilities are many. The problem with CarPlay is it relies on consumers upgrading their cars to one of the over 100 models available or integrating CarPlay kits — which range from just under $200 to over $700 depending on brand and quality. This is a steep price to pay when you are not quite sure what the return on your investment will be. Apple needs to find a way to lower that adoption barrier for CarPlay so as to speed up adoption. The more users experience CarPlay, the easier it will be to get them to take the next step when it comes to cars, whether an Apple-branded car or a fuller Apple experience in the car.

See all articles by Carolina Milanesi @caro_milanesi Unpacked for Friday November 11, 2016 Has Google Set Up Google Home to Disappoint? Touchscreen or No Touchscreen, That is the Question! More from Carolina Milanesi tedcranmore I am loving CarPlay myself. The biggest surprise for me was when it turned down the fan that was running full blast to hear me speak better, and then turned it back full when my speaking was done. It’s an interesting balance of providing service by voice and not showing it on the screen, which I would get to see if I dash mounted my phone. Overall, I’d suggest more tech fans should rationalize a new car purchase just to get CarPlay (despite how ridiculous that sounds)! aardman “Apple needs to find a way to lower that adoption barrier for CarPlay so as to speed up adoption.” I suspect this is a tall order if you want a seamlessly integrated system. And if it was at all possible without comprising on the user experience, Apple would have done it already. carolina milanesi I would think it might require a different business model. If vendors need to lower the hardware prices than something has to give David Gregory First of all Ms Milanesi, your Suburban is a Truck Based SUV- not a car. Just like my Trek Bike is not a motorcycle. CarPlay has some serious issues starting with the lack of third party apps. One of the few Tune-In Radio (+the Pro version) seemingly breaks every time Apple releases an update to iOS. Few iOS app developers have made the jump to CarPlay, the big question being what is holding up progress? I would love to see Apple allow map plugins for CarPlay that would overlay live weather radar data on the Apple Maps display for those who must drive in nasty weather. I have an iOS App that allows subscription based live Radar data that would be a great help if it could get on CarPlay. Apple Maps is still pretty lame on Navigation and on location based recommendations. A new Bridge on a US Highway that I regularly drive and has been open for months is still not on CarPlay’s navigation. The ability of Apple Maps to recommend based upon local recent activity is polluted by it’s aggressive seeking of data in your emails. The routing is not very good compared to Google even after all this time. I can be a mile from a YMCA I go to 5 times a week but if I do a Siri search for YMCA I get seemingly random results from cities far away. Another Siri gripe is that the car’s built in voice recognition is more accurate than Siri even though they both use the same microphones in the same car with the same driver. Apple has some homework to do. The ability to play tunes content has been ruined by Apple’s push of it’s rental music service that I have no interest in. Apple needs to fix iTunes, iOS Music and the way the content is handled on CarPlay. As to price, not all manufacturers charge for CarPlay. Volkswagen gives it away on their standard radio and I am sure they are not alone. I really want CarPlay to work well as both a long time Apple customer and shareholder. CarPlay holds a lot of promise but seems to suffer from the same neglect as the Macintosh. Apple has more than enough money and staff to walk and chew gum at the same time, so the glacial pace of improvement of CarPlay and HomeKit is unacceptable. Bill Tanner My early experience was similar to yours although I have a 3rd party unit so it felt slightly less magical (no automatic quieting of fans for example). The barrier to entry is actually higher than you note for 3rd party solutions as the price of a CarPlay capable head unit is only part of the cost. Mine cost $600 at retail but installation+wiring harnesses+dash kit+sales tax brought the out-the-door cost to about $1100. You could buy it cheaper on Amazon and install it yourself but pulling car dashes apart and mucking around with car electrical systems isn’t something that 99% of car owners are going to do. Another MIA piece is wireless. There was a lot of buzz about it back when CarPlay was announced but it has never showed up. Plugging and unplugging the cable gets old if you make a lot of short trips. A CarPlay capable unit might have Bluetooth but CarPlay doesn’t use it. As mentioned, 3rd party app support is weak. Perhaps because of Apple limits on the kind of apps that can be supported or perhaps because developers don’t see the value. Even some popular podcast apps don’t support it and listening to podcasts in a car is obvious and popular. I love CarPlay but the missing pieces are both frustrating and puzzling. carolina milanesi there is certainly more work to be done but i thought it was interesting as an early view of what an end to end experience could look like Bill Tanner Like HomeKit, CarPlay is interesting and promising. The challenge is that Apple’s pace of improvement is glacial as they seem to to tie improvements in all their software products to the annual OS update cycle with only occasional exceptions. HomeKit is going to take 5 more years at this rate to have the basic functionality that products like Samsung SmartThings have today. Software applications continue to be Apple’s weak point. They treat it like hardware where you launch it but do nothing more with it except critical fixes until the next big launch. It’s absurd that we only see new versions of apps as part of OS updates. PhilipGBaker I have CarPlay on a 2017 Chevy Volt, and it’s best use is to play podcasts and iHeart radio stations. But the car has such an excellent navigation system built in, that using Apple Maps is a disappointment. Much less detail, hard to read and low contrast. And the first time I used it by searching for a known restaurant, it came up with the wrong address. The phone function is adequate, but not as good as the one built in that has a much more informative displayed. Unfortunately, when you enable CarPlay by plugging in the phone, it turns off BT, not letting you use the car’s phone software. carolina milanesi how long ago did you use Maps? I am curious as I made up my mind very early that it was not for me and I was surprised how far Apple has come. Not quite on par with Google but way way better than it used to be. Also surprised you like the on car navigation i hated mine with passion from the voice to the timing of the directions but all of that is very personal of course PhilipGBaker The GM Volt Nav system is so much better than anything else I have tried, including BMW, Lexus, Toyota and Mazda. A real surpise. Very high resolution and contrast. Switching to CarPlay replaced the maps with a less detailed, lower rez and harder to read map. Apple Maps have improved, but I was startled to find the address of a restaurant that’s been in the same location for 15 years to be placed at the same street number, but on a nearby street in a nearby town. I used the built in report tool to send the corrected address to Apple and a few days later it showed the correct street address, but in another nearby town. petieg Wireless CarPlay is coming!!

In September we posted a patent report titled "Grand Apple Patent Covers a Smart Chameleonic Apple Watch Band with 3D Touch, Liquid Cooling & More," that contradicted prior statements and clearly showed that Apple's R&D teams and engineers have been working to design sophisticated cool next-gen Apple Watch bands that integrate all manner of sensors and features. A second patent application in September showed a band that would be able to connect to a future MacBook for charging. A third Apple Watch band patent was revealed last month covering an intelligent band that could be adjusted for a snug fit on a user's wrist by simply tapping on the watch interface. In today's patent revelations we learn that Apple may consider adding new watch sensors that could control certain functionality using specific wrist gestures or movements. Apple's first patent on this concept was covered extensively in our March report titled "New Motion Research for Apple Watch Reveals new Gestures may be supported in the Future."   Apple's patent FIGS. 5B and 6A illustrate techniques for detecting wrist extension (or dorsiflexion) using sensors; FIG. 8 shows a table defining a portion of a wrist-gesture library for Apple Watch.   Apple's patent FIG. 4 is a simplified block diagram of a wrist-gesture processing system that can be included in a wearable; FIGS. 3A-3F illustrate wrist articulations. Extension (or dorsiflexion) is shown in FIG. 3A; flexion (or palmar flexion) is shown in FIG. 3B; abduction (or radial deviation) is shown in FIG. 3C; adduction (or ulnar deviation) is shown in FIG. 3D; pronation (or inward rotation) is shown in FIG. 3E; and supination (or outward rotation) is shown in FIG. 3F.   Apple Watch Camera   Apple's patent FIG. 2 is a simplified block diagram, overview of a wearable device with strap sensors; FIGS. 7A and 7B illustrate a technique for detecting wrist articulations using pressure sensors.   Notable is the fact that Apple's patent FIG .2 noted above shows us that a future Apple Watch will include camera. Apple notes that "Camera #229 can include, e.g., a compact digital camera that includes an image sensor such as a CMOS sensor and optical components (e.g. lenses) arranged to focus an image onto the image sensor, along with control logic operable to use the imaging components to capture and store still and/or video images. Images can be stored, e.g., in storage subsystem #204 and/or transmitted by a wearable device to other devices for storage. Depending on implementation, the optical components can provide fixed focal distance or variable focal distance; in the latter case, autofocus can be provided. In some embodiments, the camera can be disposed along an edge of face member, the top edge, and oriented to allow a user to capture images of nearby objects in the environment such as a bar code or QR code." This is something that Apple see's working on an Apple ring as well. We covered that a second time in a report titled "Could Apple Tap into the Enterprise Wearable Ring Scanner Market?"   Apple further notes in today's revelations that a "camera can be disposed on the front surface of face member to capture images of the user. Zero, one, or more cameras can be provided, depending on implementation." This is supported by another patent filing that we covered back in June in a report titled "Apple Watch Patents Cover the Ultimate Selfie Camera, the Digital Crown & More."   Apple also notes that in some embodiments, the Apple Watch user interface can provide output to and/or receive input from an auxiliary device such as a headset.   Apple filed patent application 20160299570 back in Q2 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Comments Computerworld | Oct 13, 2016 5:02 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Apple iOS Android Mobile & Wireless Apple Samsung iPhone 7 Galaxy Note Comments Apple watchers may remember when the company had to recall a product following incidents in which the battery caught fire. That was the ill-fated PowerBook 5300 series, though, in Apple’s defense, the recall was fast, voluntary and only a few hundred units had been sold. Learning is hard Everyone makes mistakes. Those who claim to know all the answers seldom do. Those who deny their own fallibility can never be trusted, because they don’t display trust in themselves. The main thing is to learn the lessons of the error and strive not to repeat them again. Samsung says innovation is what caused it to take the Note 7 off the market. “In a race to surpass iPhone, Samsung seems to have packed it with so much innovation it became uncontrollable,” Park Chul-wan, former director of the Center for Advanced Batteries at the Korea Electronics Technology Institute told The New York Times. (Via Samsung PR by the sound of it). Innovation isn’t innovation if it doesn’t work well, and right now Samsung can’t even figure out what the problem was. Apple’s “boring” iPhone 7, meanwhile, is selling in huge quantities, despite the negative expectation set by some in the media. Marketing isn’t everything We live in a cynical age. Corporations seem to see the media as an extension of their public relations departments. Crass populists run for high office. The words we use are being twisted to new meanings. War is peace, we’re told. This is the triumph of marketing. Look deeper and you see people’s resistance to such cynicism is growing. There is a powerful force of public distrust in corporations and their big brands. It’s precisely this force Google attempted to exploit when it introduced Android, marketing it as an “open” competitor to the corporate stasis represented by Apple and its iPhone. People bought it. They still do (despite Google’s overt cynicism). Samsung bought into the marketing. It truly thought (many do) that Apple’s success is built on hype and marketing. They ignored that Apple’s true strength is consistency, incremental innovation, and customer, not media, satisfaction. Customers respond to its sincerity. The fatal error This is why Samsung made its fatal error. Ignoring the need to rigorously test everything about a new product it rushed it to market too fast in order to compete with Apple for media attention (not for the first time). “Look at us, look at us,” it said, “We do innovation. We were first.” But first doesn’t matter. Best is what matters. Marketing is meaningless if the people who invest in your product are disappointed. While good doesn’t appear to be triumphing over evil on planet Earth right now, good products still have some chance to shine. These are made through a combination of rigor, attention to detail, and a focus on what works, rather than on what will create the most media attention. Competition is a mirror Arthur C. Clarke once said: “Any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic.” That’s true, but the alchemists who combine the pieces to make the whole aren’t doing so in order to keep up with other alchemists, but out of an almost holy zeal to extend the nature of what they are working with to its best possible limits. (“You can reach a point where you cannot use resources any better,” Ive once said. You can strive to emulate a competitor, but when you do it is they who hold the power, not you. To truly compete you need to set the goal. During the Samsung v. Apple trial I’d have been more inclined to forgive the former’s guilt if it had said it shared Apple’s respect for Dieter Rams rather than spouting PR-friendly nonsense about “rounded corners” and the invention of the wheel. Empty vessels make a noise. Through a glass darkly means you look at a reflection, not of other people, but of yourself. When it comes to product design you might be informed by competing designs, but its good to remain in control of your own direction. You don’t lead by following other people, you lead by focusing on your own path. That’s why designers matter at Apple. They are its creative soul. “Weniger, aber besser” Apple CDO, Jony Ive’s inspiration, Dieter Rams says “less is more”. That’s a point Samsung needs to take on board. You see, rather than pouring its resources into anti-Apple attack ads and striving to develop every single product Apple is rumored to be developing before Apple finishes development and launches something that works, Samsung must step back. If it seeks to maintain its identity as a fast follower, it must accept that more mistakes will happen and that it will become nothing more than a low-budget imitator. To truly share space at the high table, Samsung needs to look deeply inside itself. What does it know? What resources does it have? What can it change? What are its values? What can it deliver to the world that the world truly needs? What can it figure out for itself if it ignores all the journalists (including me)? What and who is Samsung? What are its strengths? Every question needs honest answers, until the point at which every answer burns. That search for the essence of identity could inform and inspire every future Samsung product. Failure to engage in this task will condemn it to more errors in future. The Galaxy Note 7 debacle means Samsung must decide if it is to be part of the problem, or part of the solution.

These 3D-printed earrings are designed to catch your Apple Airpods if they fall out  Apple unveiled the wireless earbuds alongside the iPhone 7 last month Critics said that the untethered Airpods could easily fall out of the ear The bizarre earrings are designed to rescue them if they do  A 3D printing firm has made the design available to download for free  By Libby Plummer For Mailonline Published: 08:05 EST, 13 October 2016 | Updated: 08:54 EST, 13 October 2016 e-mail 772 shares 19 View comments When Apple unveiled its new wireless Airpods earphones alongside the new iPhone 7 last month one of the biggest concerns from Apple fans was that they could fall out and get lost. Now one company thinks it has the answer.  A 3D printing firm has designed a pair of earbud-catching earrings that will catch the tiny white Airpods should they fall out of the listener's ears. Scroll down for video  A design for the 'Twisty Earbud Catchers' can be downloaded for free, enabling those with access to a 3D printer to make their own APPLE'S AIRPODS The Airpods were unveiled last month alongside the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Apple ditched the 3.5mm headphone jack on the new devices meaning that buyers either have to use the supplied adapter to use headphones with a traditional plug or go wireless. The tech firm's Airpods come with a price tag of $159 (£159). Critics argue that the could easily fall out of the listener's ears and as they are untethered, they could be easy to lose.  The earring features an angled dangling basket that is perfectly placed to intercept the untethered earphones should they come loose.  While the 'Twisty Earbud Catchers' aren't available to buy, 3D printing company M3D has made the design available for free download.  This means that anyone with access to a 3D printer can download the design and make the functional jewellery items themselves.  Alternatively, they can enlist a 3D printing company online to make the earrings for them.  The 3D printing design is available on Thingiverse, an online community for sharing 3D-printable designs. So far, only handful of people have 'liked' the design on Thingiverse's page suggested the earrings won't actually be worn be too many Airpod users.   RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next World's most accurate clocks are synchronised to a...

Share this article Share 772 shares Apple introduced the new Airpods in September at the same event where it unveiled its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus handsets. The wireless earbuds were released to complement the new devices, with Apple having taken the controversial decision to ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack.  Apple fans immediately expressed concern that the wireless $159 (£159) earphones could easily fall out of the wearer's ear and get lost. The earring features an angled dangling basket that is perfectly placed to intercept the untethered earphones should they come loose While the Airphones aren't especially expensive compared to similar products, rival wireless earphones tend to be tethered to each other, while Apple's earbuds are entirely independent.  Critics argue that this may make them easier to lose.   However, many users have stated that the Airpods are more secure than they appear.  The wireless Airpods are designed to work with the new iPhone 7, which is not equipped with a traditional 3.5 mm headphone jack  Read more: M3D Twisty Earbud Catcher by Steve-3D - Thingiverse M3D - Micro 3D printer is the Next Generation 3D Printer Share or comment on this article e-mail 772 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Malcolm Turnbull accuses Lisa Wilkinson of 'interrogating' him Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

But on Saturday, October 15, its doors will open once again, revealing a brand new design – and we've already taken a sneak peak at what it looks like. Regent Street was Apple’s first ever store in Europe, opening 12 years ago. Since then, Apple has served over 60 million customers on the site, marking it as one of the company’s most prized and lucrative retail sites. That’s why it’s no surprise that the Regent Street store is the first Apple Store in Europe to roll out the company’s new retail design concept, which first debuted in the states earlier this year. The Regent Street store will re-open on Saturday, October 15, at 10am, boasting entirely new areas that include the tree-lined 'Avenue', a hands-on 'Boardroom', and a ‘Forum’ space that seats 75 people. The Forum is home to a new (and giant) TV screen, which will be used to promote and feature new store programming under the ‘Today at Apple’ brand. If you’re interest, you’ll be able to find events at the store using the Apple website. Watch our Facebook Live tour of the new Apple Regent Street store here The new store was designed in partnership with Foster + Partners, a prestigious London-based architecture and design firm that has offices around the world. Here’s an excerpt from the company’s website: “Over the past four decades, the practice has pioneered a sustainable approach to architecture through a strikingly wide range of work, from urban masterplans, public infrastructure, airports, civic and cultural buildings, offices, and workplaces, to private houses and product design.” Apple design chief Sir Jony Ive, along with Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s VP of Retail and Online Stores, also helped create the redesigned store, which was based on the new retail design concept that debuted in Apple’s San Francisco store in May this year. According to Ive, Apple has tried to give the new Regent Street store its own unique feel. Speaking to Wallpaper* last month, he said: “Like many great cities, London’s historic architecture has great significance to the community. On Regent Street, we preserved the incredible exterior façade while opening up the interior of the store to enhance the transparency and flood the space with natural light. By choosing materials sympathetic to the historic nature of the building, we’re able to modernise the space while remaining authentic to its surrounds." The actual building features a Grade II Listed exterior façade of portland stone, carrara marble, and hand-cut Venetian Smalti glass tile. Speaking to press at today's briefing, Ahrendts said: "I know how iconic and important Regent Street is, not just to London and the UK, but on the global stage, it's one of the most important streets in the world." She added that a new staff position would be opened up at the Apple Store on Regent Street called Creative Pro: "We're also announcing a new position...experts, pros, if you will, on photography, on gaming, on music – that position is called Creative Pro. We also have Geniuses...we now have a Creative Pro to answer any question you might have on our software and services." Angela Ahrendts speaking to press at the Regent Store re-opening Wendy Beckman, Apple's Senior Marketing Director for Europe, was also on-hand to talk about the new changes: "For those of you that can remember, Regent Street looked quite different in 2004 when we opened up our doors. We were really excited to introduce the iMac G5 and iPod Photo." She continued: "Today marks a new day for Apple Regent Street. The avenues when you walk in, they're inspired by our boulevard and windows. You can sit underneath the trees; it's a really calming environment. It really blurs the line between inside and outside." Beckman also confirmed a major change for the Apple store: the products will be untethered for the first time: "You can pick them up, you can discover, put them in your pocket." Apple's Regent Street store had just 100 employees when it first opened, but now employs 510 staff – 26 of whom have been there since the very beginning. The workforce now spans over 20 nationalities, with staffers speaking more than 30 languages collectively.

HMNIW October 13, 2016, 12:49 pm Just as a note, this isn't the first EU store with the new design, nor is it the first U.K. store. Brussels store opened up this time last year as the first EU store with Vintage D, and in the U.K., Brent Cross opened up earlier this year with Vintage D. jimmy October 13, 2016, 3:10 pm you wouldn't expect factually accurate articles here would you?! ha ha LeeTronix October 13, 2016, 3:36 pm The staff all look like Drones that clap on voice command and those tiny school size box chairs what the hell...It just seems so pretentiously fake there is nothing in this store that wants me to visit it especially when it looks like a mental asylum all I need is a white jacket and I would fit right in!!! Seriously T.R why have you written such a pointless article yet again - and you say Apple to do not pay you to promote them...Ahh Ohhhkay sure...riiight...we believe you - NOT (!) Sean Keach October 13, 2016, 3:42 pm Hi Lee, thanks for commenting. They did clap. It was very awkward. I wasn't paid by Apple. I even had to buy my own breakfast granola yoghurt pot. Sean Keach October 13, 2016, 3:43 pm Hi HMNIW, thanks for commenting. I checked up with Apple on this, as we were told that it was the first store in Europe with the redesign. You're right that the Brussels store was redesigned last year with elements of the new design concept, but the Regent Street store is the first in Europe to feature the full new design. Hope that helps! Sean Keach October 13, 2016, 3:44 pm Hi jimmy, thanks for commenting. See my reply above! Sean Keach October 13, 2016, 3:45 pm Hi word-merchant, thanks for commenting. I cannot confirm whether Angela does or does not have feet. We were not made privy to such information, unfortunately. I'll be sure to pass all of your podiatry-related concerns onto my editor, with a view to potentially investigating whether or not any or all Apple executives have feet. I've never been to Biggleswade, but I hear Matalan has some great deals. Will see what I can do. LeeTronix October 13, 2016, 3:46 pm That is terrible I would send Apple an invoice - and did you have to sit on one those children's box thingies when you had your breakfast! :( Sean Keach October 13, 2016, 3:47 pm Hi David, thanks for commenting! Just want to clarify that this is news, not a review. And although I was paid by my editor to write this article, I wasn't paid by Apple. In fact, there weren't even refreshments at the event. Just a load of Apple employees clapping and wooping. As you're probably aware, I can't eat or drink claps and woops. If you want to donate breakfast bars or coffee to TrustedReviews journalists, please get in touch. Sean Keach October 13, 2016, 3:49 pm As an addendum to this, the Brussels store doesn't feature the Boardroom, 'Today at Apple', or the Forum, which are part of the full re-design concept Sean Keach October 13, 2016, 3:51 pm Yes. Fortunately, Apple has designed the boxes with a bum scoop, which made it a little more comfortable. I would recommend boxes with bum scoops in the future. HMNIW October 13, 2016, 4:58 pm Hey Sean. Well, I was working in Field Merchandising during the opening of Brussels, and the stores in UAE, and I'd probably disagree. Vintage D essentially is the Avenues (Accessory bays), the tables, the cieling lights, the stools, the screen, and the Forum area. Everything else, mainly the trees and the 'Boardroom', aren't actually a part of Vintage D, and are additions done on a store by store basis and depending on things like location. They're just like the real nice-to-haves for some of the more exceptional stores (Which most likely won't be mall stores). On the topic of Brussels, it does actually feature the Forum, but on a slightly smaller scale, and whilst I'm unsure what they're currently doing with Today at Apple, they did a number of talks and very interesting workshops with Brussels, including a trial of a photography workshop based on going out into the city with iPhones, and then going back to store after to edit them. Nevertheless, good to see Regent finally get the love it deserved. Borkr October 13, 2016, 8:45 pm Why are all the staff clapping? What's wrong with them? Did they just hear the news they were going to get holiday pay whilst the store was closed for refurbishment during the summer or something? No corporate entity should ever look so smug. It's disgusting. Apple should set an example and ban smiling. Inane grinnery and self indulgent, robotic, clapping should be sackable offenses too. I guess the staff are just glad (and relieved) they don't work on the manufacturing side of things.

(EdBockStock/shutterstock.com) Josh Elliott, CTVNews.ca @joshelliott14 Published Thursday, October 13, 2016 6:31AM EDT Looking to avoid the cost of a traveller's phone plan on your next vacation? Hoping to skip the extra expense of a GPS device with your rental car? CTVNews.ca has collected some of the best Apple and Android travel apps, so you can stay connected on the cheap, no matter where you go. Here are some great applications and cost-friendly alternatives to help you while you're travelling. Video chat For those who prefer face-to-face communication, it's relatively easy to stay in touch when you have access to a WiFi connection, so long as both parties have compatible software on their phones or computers. And, of course, it helps to have a camera available, although audio-only chats are also possible. Apple equipment offers the most readily-available, free video conferencing option, as it's simply a matter of connecting to a WiFi network and hitting the FaceTime button on the contact you wish to conference with. FaceTime software comes pre-installed with Apple's iOS, so there's no need to peruse the App Store to find it. For those who don't own an Apple computer or phone, Skype also offers a great, free way to video chat, provided you and your friend both use the app. Skype is available on iOS, Android, Mac or PC, so it's easily one of the most versatile means possible for you to stay in touch. It's free to set up an account, and free to video conference with others. All you need is a camera on your device for video conferencing, or a microphone for audio-only conversations. Don't overlook other free options such as Facebook Messenger, which added video conferencing earlier this year. The function allows users to have face-to-face conversations with Facebook friends, for free. WhatsApp also offers free video conferencing, texting and voice calling over WiFi to other WhatsApp users on your friends list, regardless of whether you use an Android or Apple device. The app will use cellular data for all calls, unless you’re connected to the internet via WiFi. By phone Need to make a good old-fashioned phone call? There are plenty of WiFi phone apps out there offering a few minutes free for your first call, but those apps tend to go out of business or shut down after a few months. If you're looking for a more reliable phone-over-WiFi option, your best bet is to pump a few dollars into Skype credits so you can call people with ease, anywhere in the world. Skype's rates are quite low, making it worth a $7 credit purchase. The company charges only 2.4 cents per minute to call Canada, and around 10 cents per minute for international calls. That's still dirt-cheap when compared to the cost of buying a travel plan for your phone, or eating the roaming charges of making a call without a plan. The LINE app for Android and iOS is an excellent option if the person you're speaking to is willing to download it as well. The app allows you to make free voice calls and send one-to-one or group text messages over WiFi. It can also be installed on Windows and Mac computers. Similar to LINE or WhatsApp, Viber lets users connect to one another for free through a Windows desktop, or using the app for iOS or Android. The app offers video, audio or text chatting options between Viber users. Many of the apps mentioned in the video section of this article also offer audio-only options for conversation, under the same restrictions. Texting WiFi is once again your lifeline to the rest of the world, if you plan to text without a phone plan. Apple's iMessage allows you to send texts, with images or video, for free to anyone on your contact list, regardless of whether you're hooked up to your wireless provider, so long as you're connected to WiFi. Skype offers in-app chat as an alternative to texting, but you can also pay 12 cents per text to send traditional messages over Skype, if you have the credits. As previously mentioned, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, LINE and Viber are all good for free text chats with others who have the same app. Google Messenger also offers the same functionality, for free. If you're travelling with friends and you want to keep in touch on-the-go, then FireChat offers a clever way of messaging without access to wireless service, data or a WiFi network. The app uses the radio in your cellphone to connect to other FireChat users in the area, up to a distance of 70 metres. Your WiFi and Bluetooth receivers need to be switched on, but they don't need to be connected to the internet for the app to work. FireChat calls itself "the app for large crowds," as coverage improves with more people using the app in one area. The phone signal can leapfrog through other FireChat users to reach your intended recipient, so it can reach across that 70-metre limit if there are other FireChat users in the vicinity. Offline maps Worried about navigating a strange city without a data plan on your smartphone? There are a couple of apps out there that allow you to download full, detailed maps onto your phone's local storage, so you can access them offline at any time. HERE WeGo and Maps.Me are two incredibly useful offline map applications that can track your position in real time, using only the radio signals from your phone. They can store entire country maps on your phone, along with other details you might need on your journey. The apps will also give you routing information without a data plan, so you don't need to spring for that expensive GPS with your rental car. Download HERE WeGo for free on the App Store or Google Play. Maps.Me is also free on the App Store, Google Play, BlackBerry World and the Amazon App store.  Google Maps also offers the option of downloading individual city maps onto your phone. Just make sure you're careful with the storage space on your phone. A few maps can take up a good chunk of space, leaving you with less room for your vacation pictures. Itinerary made easy The free app Tripit is a huge time-saver when you're on vacation. The app automatically scans your email for confirmation numbers from your flight, your hotel, your rental car or whatever tours you've signed up for, and collects them into one easy-to-follow timeline. It's the digital equivalent of a paper itinerary, only it automatically updates when you're connected to WiFi, so you're always on top of your travel plans. It also saves you the hassle of sifting through your inbox to keep all your digital receipts in order. Google accomplishes some of this by adding certain itinerary documents to your personal calendar, but it's not nearly as comprehensive as TripIt. Tripit is available for Android, iOS, Mac and PC users, and is compatible with Gmail, Yahoo and Outlook email systems.

It doubled the minimum amount of built-in storage from 16GB to 32GB. This minimum capacity uplift was implemented in the still-for-sale iPhone 6S range (and all the currently for sale iPad models, without price rises) but the iPhone SE is still sold with a scant 16GB of storage. The new Apple iPhone 7 is available with 32GB, 128GB or 256GB of built-in storage, with each capacity uplift costing the buyer an extra £100. This pricing method applies to both the iPhone 7, starting at £599 and the iPhone 7 Plus, starting at £719. Apple has previously been accused of price gouging for the extra built-in memory. The built-in storage on an iDevice is an important purchasing consideration for those that like to store and capture photo and video content (or music libraries, or many apps/games) on their smartphones, as you can't just pop/swap an SD card. But what if you learnt that the lowest capacity iPhone was also a lot slower to save and load apps and data from storage? According to tests by mobile centric site GSM-Arena, the iPhone 7 models with 32GB of storage are up to 8x slower in disk operations than those with 128GB of storage. The tester used the freely available Basemark OS II benchmark and Pass Mark to assess the storage performance on an Apple iPhone 6s Plus 64GB, an iPhone 7 128GB, and an iPhone 7 Plus 32GB and collected the following data: Storage test Apple iPhone 6s Plus 64GB Apple iPhone 7 128GB Apple iPhone 7 Plus 32GB Basemark OS II Memory 1422 1721 839 PassMark Disk Mark 54557 69616 43668 PassMark Storage Write 200.6Mbyte/s 308Mbyte/s 39.6Mbyte/s PassMark Storage Read 628Mbyte/s 926Mbyte/s 691Mbyte/s 5min 4K video copy 1:00min 0:17min 0:52min   Above you can see the new iPhone 7 Plus 32GB fares worse than a previous gen smartphone (with 64GB of storage). It is also much slower than its 128GB brother in these disk benchmarks. GSM-Arena didn't have access to more than one 32GB iPhone 7/Plus for comparative testing or to assess whether its model had some kind of fault. However, it asked readers to confirm its results in the comments. Looking through them, I found most but not all owners of the 'affected' model claiming similarly dire Basemark and PassMark results. A couple of users of the 256GB version boasted the fastest storage benchmarks of them all. We have seen many a time in computer SSDs that smaller capacity units suffer in performance compared to higher capacity brethren. It's hard to know if it is a similar effect (due to having fewer memory chips operating in parallel) in the Apple iPhone 7 32GB models, or that the storage hardware/interface is otherwise different.

But that's exactly what we've been doing. We sat under a tree on a comfy cushion inside Apple's new flagship store on Regent Street and we have to say we liked it. The store is once again fully open after undergoing a complete refit. The new store, which regains its true flagship status from the Covent Garden branch, is the result of Apple's new vision for the modern day shopping experience. Pocket-lint Visitors to San Francisco's store will notice similarities, the big open spaces, the attempt to bring the outside in, but there are differences. Apple has built something designed specifically for the space. The walls are clad in marble. Above there is one huge light box, which takes the prize for the longest luminous ceiling panel in the world. And there is even a secret boardroom hidden in the back for wooing special customers. Apple iPhone 7 review: Refining the design rather than ripping it up and starting again Apple iPhone 7 Plus review: Big changes from the big iPhone The original exterior of the John Nash-designed building retains its now iconic high windows, but the store inside is completely unrecognisable to what was there before. Gone are the crowded shelves, the glass floating staircase (that's so last decade), and in come wide open spaces, a vaulted seven-metre high "forum" and twelve Ficus Ali trees. Yes, there is lots of trees. Throughout the store, accessories have been pushed to the walls on the side, while Apple's multiple devices take centre stage on traditional-style wooden tables. A giant video wall takes centre stage of the ground floor, with seating for around 75 customers in front. The Regent Street store always had a theatre for demos and lectures, but now it's a lot more central, with the ability to walk in and out of sessions with ease rather than feeling you're in a lecture. Either side of the screen are staircases that feature sandblasted and honed Castagna stone handrails hand carved into the walls. A glass balustrade on the mezzanine level lets visitors overlook the ground level and grand hall. It's impressive. Upstairs is almost entirely dedicated to the Apple Genius bar, with the company able to either fix your devices or offer intimate workshops on how to get more from them. The biggest noticeable difference, apart from the sheer opulence of light everywhere, is that nothing is bolted down. You can freely pick phones up, see how they feel in the hand, even put them in your pocket - just don't walk out the door. The lack of security is as welcoming as it is unnerving. Pocket-lint This isn't a shop as you know it, but a centre for you to learn, enjoy and then buy. That's exactly what Apple hopes you will do. And it makes it much easier an experience than ever before. Angela Ahrendts, senior vice president of retail, explained to Pocket-lint the Regent Street store now has over 500 employees, up from the 100 the store had when it opened in 2004. With that many staff, you are always likely to get served quickly. There are no "pay here" counters for you to queue at. Once again Apple is trying to change the way we shop, removing the boundaries of what to expect while trying to recreate sitting under a tree in Cupertino in the Californian sun. How that will fair with Brits over time is yet to be seen, but one thing is for sure, you won't have been in a shop like this ever before.

What are the key features? Can it really emulate 'pro' cameras like DSLRs? TrustedReviews camera expert Amy Davies puts it to the test. The most interesting thing about the iPhone 7 Plus is the camera. Rather than the single lens found on the standard iPhone 7, it has two lenses with different focal lengths. Here, I'm going to explore exactly what Apple has done, the differences between the two sensors in the 7 Plus, and evaluate the new Portrait mode, which Apple hopes will give you a taste of DSLR-style photography in your pocket. Watch: iPhone 7 Plus vs iPhone 7 iPhone 7 Plus Camera: How are the lenses different? While the iPhone 7 has a 12-megapixel sensor 28mm (equivalent) lens, with an f/1.8 aperture, the iPhone 7 Plus has that along with a second camera, which is also 12-megapixel and features a 56mm (equivalent) lens. Basically, this means that you get a 2x optical zoom, allowing you to get closer to the subject you’re photographing without having to deploy the lower quality digital zoom. Related: iPhone 7 vs Galaxy S7 For this generation of iPhones, Apple has equipped the lens with a wider aperture than on the previous generation. That means we now have an f/1.8 aperture where previously there was an f/2.2 aperture. The upshot of that is approximately 50% more light can be let onto the sensor, which is good news for low light shooting, and in theory at least, for creating a shallow depth of field effect. However, this wider aperture is limited to the first camera. The second telephoto camera has a much narrower aperture of f/2.8, which means it won't be as good in lower light situations. Although not confirmed by Apple itself, there has also been suggestions that the second camera has a smaller sensor than the first one. It's clear, then, that the 'normal' 28mm lens remains the one you'll want to use most of the time. TrustedReviews will explore the details of that difference in the imminent full review of the phone, but as a photographer it's the new Portrait that interests me most, so let's get to that. iPhone 7 Plus Portrait Mode: What it is and how does it work? The new Portrait mode attempts to recreate the look of “professional” cameras such as DSLRs, giving images a shallow depth of field effect – what's commonly referred to 'bokeh'. You can achieve this effect with even the cheapest DSLR or mirror-less camera on the market, but of course, most won't fit in your pocket like the iPhone. Apple talked about this new mode at length during the launch, but it's worth noting it's still in beta. Anyone can download the iOS 10.1 beta and use it, but there's still time for Apple to refine and improve it. Related: iOS 10 review To achieve the look, the iPhone 7 Plus uses the image signal processor (ISP) to create what Apple is calling a "depth map" from both the cameras working at the same time. It scans the scene, determining what is the subject and what is the background in order to create a “beautiful background blur” that is reminiscent of something a DSLR (or CSC for that matter) can produce. If all this sounds familiar, it's because the HTC M8 attempted something very similar, albeit with mixed results, as does the more recent Huawei P9. We'll get to the latter in a moment, but first... How do I use Portrait mode? Once you’ve downloaded iOS 10.1 and enter the native camera app, you’ll see along the bottom of the screen (or to the right if you’ve flipped the phone to landscape orientation) is a new mode called Portrait. Simply swipe to this just as you would any other mode. At this point, the phone will warn you that it’s in beta and that you’ll be trying out something which isn’t quite finished yet. Next, point the phone at whatever you want to photograph. There are some caveats to using the mode, which should become clear as you start playing around with it. For starters, you need to be a certain distance away from the subject – you can’t be too close, but you can’t be too far away either. Don’t worry, you won’t have to get the measuring tape out, because the phone will simply instruct you to move closer (or further away) as necessary. Related: Best iPhone 7 deals and contracts You’ll also notice that if you’re shooting in anything less than bright light, it simply won’t work. The phone will display the message “needs more light” – so there goes your idea of shooting DSLR like images in the pub, then. Assuming you’ve got enough light and the phone is happy that you’re in the right place to take your shot, you’ll see that it displays “Depth Effect” now, and you’ll see that part of your image has that characteristic blur in place. Just because the mode is named “Portrait” doesn’t mean you necessarily have to take a photo of a person – it should also work with just about anything that you want to isolate from the background. iPhone 7 Plus with Portrait mode on iPhone 7 Plus with Portrait mode off When you take your photo and look back at it in playback, you’ll see that it is marked with “depth effect” amongst your other photos. If you transfer the image across to your computer, you’ll see that you have two versions of your image – one which has the effect applied, and one which doesn’t. This extra file could be useful if the mode hasn’t worked all that successfully and you want something else to work with. Haven’t I seen this somewhere before? The Huawei P9 has a similar mode which allows for a shallow depth of field effect to be created, but despite the fact that the camera also has two lenses, the effect is in fact software-created. You can see in our comparison shots how well the Huawei P9’s system works – it doesn’t appear to be quite so impressive, producing mixed results depending on what you’re photographing. By contrast, the iPhone 7 Plus’ results are a lot more consistent. Huawei P9 in lower light iPhone 7 Plus in lower light How well does it work? Let's deal with the big question first – can the iPhone 7 Plus match or near the effect of an DSLR? I don't think so – you will get better results with almost any large sensor camera, even something which will only set you back £200. But that’s sort of missing the point as this is an interesting development for phone technology, and it it's the best example of this approach I've seen. It's already better than the Huawei P9's version, and it's a huge step forward from HTC's attempts with the M8, but there are still caveats. Images taken with the mode enabled look great viewed at normal size on the screen of the iPhone 7 Plus, but if you zoom in you can see problematic areas where it just doesn’t look quite right. The depth effect on Huawei P9 doesn't separate the foreground and background too well, with the subject's arms and shoulders clearing blurring into the background. The depth effect on iPhone 7 Plus isn't quite as aggressive in blurring the background, but the result is more pleasing as the subject and background are well-defined, albeit with small areas of softness the arms and shoulders. This shot, taken on a Panasonic G80, shows the iPhone's Portrait mode is good, but still has some way to go. The subject's shoulders and arms are much sharper, giving a really nice separation between foreground and background. These shots show the Portrait mode works better than previous similar efforts and can create some nice looking shots. But the larger problem is it works on some subjects than others. The effect is quite pleasing on portraits, or anything with a very defined edge, but anything which is a little more complicated, such as intricate flowers, the algorithm seems to get confused about what is the subject and what is background. Moreover, if the light drops, then the result can be a little grainy and smudgy. In fact, in lower light conditions, the Huawei’s version generally performs better, if with more strange artefacts in the shot from time to time. That said, for something which is still in beta, it’s a very promising start, and one which Apple will presumably refine both with this iteration of the phone, and next year with the iPhone 8, depending perhaps on how popular it is. It would be great if the clever engineers came up with a way for it to work properly when the light drops, as not all of us can be blessed with living in bright Californian sunshine. You also run the risk of all your photos looking very similar. Unlike a DSLR where you can move around the frame and place a subject wherever you want, this mode is very prescriptive about where the subject is placed. Again, if Apple could give us a bit more flexibility with that, it would be even better. Watch: iPhone 7 review You can download the public beta of iOS 10.1 now to test out the Portrait mode for yourself if you have an iPhone 7 Plus. Otherwise the finalised version of the software is expected at some point in November. 0 shares Read Comments meir cohen October 13, 2016, 10:38 pm The samsung s7 / s7edge camera is the best on the market by far. You can write 100 articles per day about how amazing the iphone 7 plus camera is but you just laying to yourself. You can't change the facts. The galaxy s7/ 7 edge camera is the best. You can keep saying the same lay again and again but the public not stupid. PGrGr October 14, 2016, 11:54 am Interesting review, but the first example shot, of the fuscia, is not really a good test. Any smartphone camera _can_ produce an out of focus background. Doing so depends on an understanding of optics. I can't be bothered to explain it here. You can search it on the web if you can be bothered. The point is, if the subject is particularly close to the camera lens, and the background is a long way behind that, the background is going to be out of focus with anything but the smallest of apertures. To demonstrate this, here is an example shot of the clutter on my desk, which I took with my (single lensed) Nexus 5x: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/... See how the letter "K" is in perfect focus, but things get blurrier behind that? Obtaining this shot didn't require special software, just an understanding of the way cameras work. Going back to the fuscia, the increased blur is not a bad effort by Apple's software, but it clearly got a bit confused by what's going on at the bottom right of the frame. The first thing I noticed was that there is a perfectly in focus leaf, edge on to the camera, in the unprocessed version, which has completely disappeared in the processed version. Then, the more I examined the photo, the less natural it appeared. I am aware that I am being hypercritical here. The overall impact of what Apple have achieved is great, and I think the technology will really improve the quality of lots of smartphone shots over the coming years. Kupfernigk October 15, 2016, 8:25 am It's quite simple; depth of focus gets smaller as the subject distance decreases, the focal length gets longer and the aperture gets bigger (as it's e.g. f/2 i.e. a reciprocal, f/2 is bigger than f/8) With a DSLR you can vary the aperture and so the depth of focus. You can also use long lenses which give short depth of focus. A typical portrait lens is around 70-80mm focal length for the best balance between DoF, aperture and distortion. For APS-C DSLRs 50-55 mm works almost as well and is small and light. A phone camera is fixed aperture and so although artificial blurring can be added in software, the depth of focus of near objects cannot be improved. As the review notes, pictures look OK on the phone screen - but now look at them on a high res monitor or laptop and the limitations become very obvious. Phone cameras are still the equivalent of the old snapshot cameras for making 3 by 5 inch prints. APS-C DSLRs will deliver good quality at A4, or even bigger under controlled conditions (tripod, lighting).

Piper Jaffray technical analyst Craig Johnson looked at a long-term chart of Apple on Wednesday on CNBC's "Power Lunch." While Apple is currently on its longest winning streak since February 2015, Johnson sees more room to run in the next months. Johnson says that while Apple now sits lower than its May 15 highs, the stock has found "really good support around $90." The stock closed at $117.34 on Wednesday, within $3 of Johnson's previous price target of $120. Here, Johnson believes that Apple may take a short-term dip once the stock hits $120, but he predicts that the stock is actually set to return to the May highs in the next few months. "I'd look for some profit taking to come in at that point in time, look for the drift back a little bit," said Johnson. "But ultimately, looking out six to 12 months, I see a retest of the highs you see in May of 2015, that would take the stock back up to about $130." In other words, Apple could rise another 11 percent in the coming months. Apple is up about 11.5 percent this year, fueled by the release of a new iPhone and other products.

Apple SACKS ‘several’ staff during investigation into ‘explicit photo-sharing ring’ Employees accused of nicking intimate snaps and taking photos of people visiting the shop By JASPER HAMILL 13th October 2016, 11:04 am Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments APPLE has fired a number of employees after denying shop staff snapped creepy shots of customers and nicked naughty photos from people’s phones. The global tech giant has confirmed “several” employees at a store in Carindale, Brisbane, have been sacked but said no “customer data or photos were inappropriately transferred”. Reuters 2 Apple is urgently investigating the accusations It issued the denial after an Australian newspaper published sensational quotes from someone an who claimed to be an Apple insider. “They’ve been taking pictures of them (customers) in store, taking pics off their phones and taking pictures of female staff members,” the source alleged in an interview The Courier-Mail. “One person would take a photo and add it to the chat and others would give the person or their butt or their boobs a rating out of 10 and they would add their own side commentary. “Everyone feels uncomfortable and the female staff don’t know how to feel.” Apple has now sacked “several” members of staff. In a statement, it said: “Apple believes in treating everyone equally and with respect, and we do not tolerate behaviour that goes against our values. “We are investigating a violation of Apple’s business conduct policy at our store in Carindale, where several employees have already been terminated as a result of our findings.

October 13 AAPL: 116.98 -0.36 Patent shows how Apple Watch could use heart-rate sensors to identify owner Ben Lovejoy - 1 month ago @benlovejoy Apple Watch Patent View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Unlikely as it sounds, a future Apple Watch may be able to identify its owner using nothing more than the heart-rate sensors. In principle, this could allow it to eliminate the need for a PIN (or verification via iPhone unlock) when you put it on in the morning. The possibility is described in an Apple patent application published today, in which Apple talks of combining a number of different characteristics. Light emitters and light sensors can be used to perform biometric identification of a user based on identifying characteristics of the user’s vasculature. For example, light information can be obtained at one or more light sensors, and the information can be compared to stored information associated with a user identity. Based on the comparison, the user of the device can be identified as having the user identity. One example given is measuring the O2 content in the blood. Although current Apple Watches don’t currently act as a pulse oximeter, a teardown found that even the first-generation Watch contains the necessary hardware. It’s been speculated that Apple chose not to activate it in order to avoid the need for FDA approval as a medical device. The idea of vascular biometrics – also known as vein matching – dates back to the 1980s, and led to commercially available systems in the 1990s, but were mostly superseded by fingerprint readers. Current systems work either on fingers on on the backs of hands. To identify patterns in hands, near-infrared rays generated from a bank of light emitting diodes (LEDs) penetrate the skin of the back of the hand. Due to the difference in absorbance of blood vessels and other tissues, the reflected near-infrared rays produce an image processing techniques producing an extracted vascular pattern. From the extracted vascular pattern, various feature rich data such as vessel branching points, vessel thickness and branching angles are extracted and stored as a template. Just yesterday, a study claimed that the Apple Watch is the most accurate wrist wearable for fitness tracking.

Now Apple is biting back, sort of. It hasn’t launched a new service or subscription tier. Instead, it launched a new video ad that, while taking you through the new features of both app and service that arrived with iOS 10, also reminds you of the things that you can do on Apple Music that you still can’t on Amazon. Or elsewhere for that matter. The video is technically a quick guide to the new features in Apple Music, but given the timing of its launch, it’s almost hard not to associate it with the arrival of a new challenger. With the music streaming business growing more and more competitive, not to mention saturated, it pays to let prospective subscribers now what they’re getting for $9.99 a month. The Apple Music ad actually goes beyond the basic music streaming features. After all, everyone has those. Instead, it focuses on what you can do with the thousands of tracks available from Apple’s library. That includes keeping track of what you like now and what you might like in the future. And letting everyone know about those two things. Then there are the Apple Music exclusives, like exclusive first dibs on new albums. That one has become particularly controversial and only the business gods know how long that special arrangement will last. But as far as live or on-demand radio shows like Beats 1, Apple Music definitely has them beat. With Amazon’s entry into the ring, we can expect to see more promotions and advertising coming up, both from mainstays as well as up and coming new players. Sadly, despite the overabundance of competitors, the one thing that hasn’t changed at all is the subscription fee, which, when you remove all the special promos, is still $9.99.

 Apple employees have been fired for allegedly stealing photos from customers' phones Rob Price Oct. 13, 2016, 6:43 AM 7,924 facebook linkedin twitter email print An Apple Store.Michael Nagle/Getty Images Apple has found itself at the centre of a photo-stealing scandal in Australia after a bombshell report from The Courier-Mail published Thursday alleged that multiple employees from an Apple Store in Brisbane have been fired for stealing customers' photos from their phones, and secretly taking photos of them, in order to "rank their bodies." The Australian Privacy Commissioner is now looking into the alleged covert photo-sharing ring. Apple denies that any customers' photos were stolen — telling The Guardian that it has seen "no evidence that customer data or photos were inappropriately transferred or that anyone was photographed by these former employees." But it has confirmed that "several employees" have been fired, and that the company is investigating a "violation of Apple’s business conduct policy." Apple did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Here are the key details of The Courier-Mail's initial report: Apple Store employees working at the Carindale store were allegedly stealing photos from customers' phones without their knowledge. They were also allegedly taking photos of female customers and staff. "More than 100 close-up and explicit photos" were apparently taken, the newspaper said. Employees then allegedly traded them among themselves. "One person would take a photo and add it to the chat and others would give the person or their butt or their boobs a rating out of 10 and they would add their own side commentary," an Apple employee said. This behaviour was allegedly discovered after an Apple employee found a technician using a customer's phone in the repair room. Four employees, all male, have been fired. An HR exec has reportedly been parachuted in from overseas to deal with the crisis.Sean Gallup/Getty Images In a statement, Apple told The Courier-Mail: "Apple believe in treating everyone equally and with respect, and we do not ­tolerate behaviour that goes against our values. We are investigating a ­violation of Apple’s business conduct policy at our store in Carindale, where several employees have already been terminated as a result of our findings." Since then, Apple has told The Guardian it has seen no evidence that customers' photos were stolen. "Based on our investigation thus far, we have seen no evidence that customer data or photos were inappropriately transferred or that anyone was photographed by these former employees," it said. "We have met with our store team to let them know about the investigation and inform them about the steps Apple is taking to protect their privacy." Exactly what Apple means by "anyone" is unclear, but it leaves open the possibility that it is referring only to customers — and that other staff members were indeed photographed. If not, it is unclear on what grounds "several employees" were fired. The Australian Privacy Commissioner, Timothy Pilgrim, said (via the BBC): "We are aware of the reports and will be making enquiries with Apple to seek further information ... This is an important reminder that all organisations that collect and manage personal information need to embed a culture of privacy and ensure employees understand their responsibilities."

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « New Ad: Explore the All-New Apple Music | Main | Apple expands their work on Advancing Apple Watch to Include Wrist Gestures and a Camera » October 13, 2016 Apple's Siri to Control Apple TV, Stereo Speakers working with Apple's Streaming Music Service   The US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that reveals a system and method for configuring and adjusting beam patterns output by a speaker system in response to voice commands. This new invention relating to Siri could apply to Macs, iDevices, Apple TV, a gaming console, internet streaming music or movie service. In one embodiment, user profile settings are content based such that each setting in a listener's user profile may have separate values for different content types. For example, a volume setting may have separate preferred values for music, movies, television, etc. These content delineations may be further divided based on genre (e.g., separate volume settings for comedy movies, honor movies, and drama movies).   Patent Background   Loudspeaker arrays may generate beam patterns that focus sound in a specific direction. For example, sets of transducers in a loudspeaker array may be individually and separately driven according to different parameters and settings, including delays and energy levels, to generate one or more beam patterns in a listening area. The beam patterns may focus sound at a particular object or individual in the listening area.   Although beam patterns allow sound to be focused in different directions and/or at specific objects or individuals, configuring beam patterns is often a complex and arduous process. For example, as noted above, configuration of a beam pattern may require individually and separately adjusting delays and energy levels of driving signals for each transducer in a loudspeaker array to achieve a desired result.   Apple Invention: Handsfree Beam Pattern Configuration   Apple's invention covers an audio system that adjusts one or more beam patterns emitted by one or more loudspeaker arrays based on the preferences of users/listeners.   In one embodiment, the audio system includes an audio receiver that is comprised of a listener location estimator, a listener identifier, and a voice command processor. The listener location estimator estimates the location of one or more listeners in a listening area based on sensed voice commands received from one or more microphone arrays.   The listener identifier attempts to associate the one or more listeners with user profiles based on comparisons of the voice commands with stored speech signatures. The user profiles are associated with preferred settings, which have been personalized for each identified listener based on previous use of the audio system. The voice command processor determines settings designated by listeners in each voice command.   Inputs from the listener location estimator, the listener identifier, and the voice command processor are fed into an array processor. The array processor drives the one or more loudspeaker arrays to emit beam patterns into the listening area based on inputs from each of these devices. By examining the location, historical preferred usage settings, and voice commands from listeners, the generated beam patterns are customized to the explicit and implicit preferences of the listeners with minimal direct input.   Apple's patent FIG. 5 noted below shows a method for adjusting sound emitted by the loudspeaker array; FIG. 6A shows an example of a listener speaking separate voice commands.     Apple's patent FIG. 7B shows a beam pattern generated for listeners based on example voice commands.     Apple's patent FIG. 4D shows the estimated location of a listener in the listening area.     Apple's patent FIG. 3 noted below shows us a functional unit block diagram and some constituent hardware components of an audio receiver.     Apple filed this patent application 20160295340 back in Q2 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

Choosing a Michigan apple is a simple choice and a small act that can catalyze great change, said Traverse City-based Cherry Capital Foods Food Safety Team Leader Kelly Lively. Cherry Capital Foods operates as a ‘food hub’ - supporting local farmers and processors to help accomplish this goal. Through food hubs, institutions and other large food purchasers are able to buy Michigan-grown and Michigan-processed foods and keeping our food economy local is a great jobs generator, Lively also said. Additionally, October is National Farm to School Month with the theme “One Small Step” and apples are a popular fruit in cafeterias and lunchrooms. “Too often we see apples grown in other states served by our Michigan institutions. It’s time we decide that we should be supporting our own Michigan apple farmers,” said Lively. Other types of institutions around the state are joining schools in the Michigan Apple Crunch, including hospitals, colleges and universities, retirement homes, early childhood centers - and even the state legislature, Lively added. “We’re also seeing support from businesses large and small, recognizing the value of insisting on supporting Michigan farms and in connecting our communities through local food,” she also said. “The Michigan Apple Crunch is a great first step for many, especially our school kids,” said Lively. Michigan has adopted a Good Food Charter that set a goal for institutions to purchase 20 percent of their food from within Michigan. Attaining that target would translate to tens of millions of dollars staying in local circulation and boosting our agricultural economy, Lively said. For more: www.miapplecrunch.com.

Apple's patent application is titled "User identification system based on plethysmography" and describes how a pulse oximeter is used to determine the biometric signature of a user's cardio rhythms. This data could then be used to identify the wearer and unlock the watch in a manner similar to Touch ID on the iPhone. The system works similarly to existing monitors, by projecting light on the user's skin and measuring how much of it is absorbed and reflected back to the device. The measurement can then be used to determine the amount of blood present in the vasculature. According to the patent, the data gathered by the two photosensors is either stored or compared against previously saved information to positively identify the user. In an associated patent also published today, the invention is extended to take in data from motion sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes to determine user movement. Certain gestures, for example raising the device from waist height to head height, trigger the authentication process. AppleInsider notes that the system could replace Touch ID during Apple Pay payments and further reduce the watch's reliance on iPhone, although it's unclear if heart rate data can be a unique enough identifier to ensure the same level of security.

Your heart rate can change a lot in many normal and abnormal conditions. I call this BS. What this sensor measures is how you blood vessels expand as a pressure pulse is travelling through your veins when the heart contracts. The blood pressure (and thus the size of the blood vessel) follows a periodic fluctuation not unlike a sine curve. The heart rate is given by only looking at the frequency of that periodic fluctuation. Studying the whole shape of the curve gives you much more information than just looking at the frequency.

And fingerprints don't change moment-to-moment depending on your breathing, activity, and environment. Yeah, something not adding up here...! You don't understand micro palpitations do you? The way your heart operates doesn't change moment-to-moment. https://www.wired.com/insights/2014/06/heartbeat-may-soon-password/ " Yury: I didn’t realize that people’s heartbeats are different. Is the heartbeat really a reliable biometric? D’Souza: Yes, it is! Everybody’s got a unique heartbeat. It’s based on the size and shape of your heart and the orientation of your valves, your physiology. It doesn’t change unless you have a major cardiac event like a heart attack. Yury: What about when you’re nervous and your heart rate goes up? Will it still work? D’Souza: Your heart can beat faster but electrically your beats look the same. So, whether it beats faster or slower, it doesn’t really matter. It’s really about the shape of the waves, and what that signal looks like when it comes off your heart. " Rating: 3 Votes keysofanxiety 5 weeks ago That's deliciously clever technology. The Star Trek future gets ever closer. Rating: 3 Votes BMcCoy 5 weeks ago No, my objection is that there is no way this currently works when scaled up to a decent population size, which is of course what would be required for this to be an identification technology. Did you read those papers, or did you just quickly google, then cut n paste? "..the majority of the studies have been conducted on a small population (about a few tens of subjects). Therefore, the applicability of ECG biometric recognition on a large scale (real life authentication scenario) it is not yet proven." "..almost all studies (except for [17 ('https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4535678/#CR17')] and [31 ('https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4535678/#CR31')] ) ignored the variability of the ECG during life span (i.e. variability induced by work, ageing, iterate sport activity etc.); moreover, only few studies [57 ('https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4535678/#CR57'), 83 ('https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4535678/#CR83'), 136 ('https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4535678/#CR136')] considered the applicability of these techniques when subjects suffer from pathological conditions. ECG recognition in pathological subjects is another aspect worth of additional investigations." "it must be emphasised that, while guidelines are available for ECG acquisition in the clinical scenario, there is still a lack of standardisation on ECG acquisition (number of leads and their positioning, sampling frequency, number of bits, filtering, type of electrodes, number of leads etc.) for biometrics applications. However, ECG databases for biometric recognition should ideally include recordings, at a given sampling frequency and conditions, from the same subjects in different circumstances (e.g. relaxed, during and after physical training) and along a period of several years." And still no discussion of sensitivity and specificity. Not even remotely close to being a practical and usable technology. Rating: 3 Votes NT1440 5 weeks ago this is just NOT possible. Your heart rate can change a lot in many normal and abnormal conditions. I call this BS. But your heartbeat signature is unique. This isn't about heart rate, it's about the extremely minute differences in how every persons heart beats, it's as identifying as a fingerprint. Rating: 2 Votes NT1440 5 weeks ago Troll trap!

Apple Workers Accused of Taking and Sharing Close-up Photos of Female Customers GO Employees also believed to have stolen photos from phones Oct 13, 2016 10:01 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Four Apple employees from the company’s store in Carindale, Australia, have been fired after complaints that they were involved in a group of workers taking close-up and explicit photos of female customers and then sharing them in a private chatroom. According to reports, several members of the local Apple store staff took pictures of women without their knowledge and then posted them in a private chatroom to have them rated from 1 to 10 depending on subjects’ bodies. Furthermore, the four employees have also been accused of stealing photos from phones brought in for repairs, local media claims. It appears that photos of female employees have also been shared internally. The privacy violation was reported after one of the store employees spotted a colleague searching an iPhone brought in for servicing for photos that would then end up being shared with others. Apple: No evidence of privacy violation Apple explains that it has already conducted an investigation, but no evidence was found that such activities took place in the store. The company hasn’t mentioned, however, why the four employees were fired. “Apple believe in treating everyone equally and with respect and we do not tolerate behaviour that goes against our values. We are investigating a violation of Apple's business conduct policy at our store in Carindale, where several employees have already been terminated as a result of our findings,” the company said. “No evidence that customer data or photos were inappropriately transferred or that anyone was photographed by these former employees.” Australian privacy watchdogs are now calling for Apple to share more information on its investigation, emphasizing that all companies in the country need to protect privacy of employees and customers in the most effective manner. “This is an important reminder that all organisations that collect and manage personal information need to embed a culture of privacy and ensure employees understand their responsibilities,” Australian privacy commissioner Timothy Pilgrim said. #Apple#Apple Store#iPhone#photo sharing#privacy violation subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Seeds Third Developer Beta of watchOS 3.1 Apple Watch Operating System iOS Far Behind Android Despite Strong iPhone SE Sales “Good Guy” Samsung: iPhone 7 to Sell 8 Million More Units After Note 7 Fiasco iPhone 7 Allegedly Explodes like a Grenade, Causes Injuries to Owner’s Face Five Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked Microsoft Releases Interactive Mail Notifications for All Windows 10 Users KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive Vendetta Online 1.8.396 MMORPG Released for Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android    Apple claims that no evidence of privacy violation was found New Mac Apps WP Express: Simplify the WordPress installation procedure by relying on a local development environment like MAMP and using this utility to automatically download everything it needs CatDV Pro: Streamlined media cataloguer application for Mac OS X that enables you to organize your clips into different groups, and edit their metadata.

Four male staff members have been sacked over the claims, which reportedly involved them taking more than 100 close-up and explicit photos of female customers and staff. Gymnast Louis Smith receives death threats for ‘mocking Muslims’ in video However, an Apple investigation found ‘no evidence that photos were inappropriately transferred’ at a store in Carindale, Queensland, Australia. An anonymous worker at the Apple store told The Courier-Mail: ‘One person would take a photo and add it to the chat and others would give the person or their butt or their boobs a rating out of 10 and they would add their own side commentary. ‘Everyone feels uncomfortable and the female staff don’t know how to feel because the leadership won’t tell staff who is involved.’ Four Geniuses (not pictured) have been sacked (Picture: Rex/Shutterstock) The personal photos were allegedly shared with staff from other Apple stores in Queensland after being stolen or taken without the victim’s knowledge. The men were found out when another staff member walked in on a technician looking through a customer’s phone.

The 11,000 sq ft new look flagship, which was Apple’s first retail outlet in Europe when it first opened in 2004, had been completely shut since June.  The shop has been painted in a palette of neutral white, grey and natural oak colours “to create a calm environment for an enhanced shopping experience”. The redesign by architects Foster & Partners is one of the biggest since Chingford-born Sir Jonathan Ive was appointed the Silicon Valley giant’s chief design officer last year. For the first time, some of the products on display, iPhones and iPads, will be “untethered” - not connected to a security cord - allowing customers to pick them up and walk around with them.

News Corp reported on Thursday that dozens of photos were taken of female staff and customers while others were lifted from some Apple customers' phones. The issue came to light after a staff member at the Carindale store noticed a technician looking through a customer's phone in the repair room. One Apple staff member told News Corp that they were concerned that the "disgusting" practice was occurring at other stores. Photos of both customers and staff were taken without their knowledge and their bodies were ranked from one to 10. In a statement, Apple confirmed the Carindale store was under investigation and that related staff had been fired. "Apple believes in treating everyone equally and with respect, and we do not tolerate behaviour that goes against our values," the statement read. "We are investigating a violation of Apple's business conduct policy at our store in Carindale, where several employees have already been terminated as a result of our findings." Apple said it had not found any evidence of its former employees misappropriating customers' data. "Based on our investigation thus far, we have seen no evidence that customer data or photos were inappropriately transferred or that anyone was photographed by these former employees." A spokeswoman for Queensland Police told News Corp she was aware of media reports surrounding the store but an investigation has not yet been launched.

Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations TechEye Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations Menu Tame Apple Press bullying Samsung Posted on October 13, 2016 by Nick Farrell - Mobiles, News Apple’s minions at its favourite tech magazines are wading into Samsung for being unable to identify the fault which sank the Note 7. For those who came in late, Samsung stopped producing its Note 7 after a recall failed to stop the phones overheating.  Now Apple’s free PR units based at newspapers like the New York Times re wading in claiming that Samsung’s goods are dangerous because it could not identify the fault. The Times coverage was deliberately “inflammatory” making shedloads of references to the phones “exploding” or “blowing up” when in the only cases where the fault appeared the phones melted. But even while the Times was saying that, it had to admit that it was not that Samsung did not know what caused the problem, simply that it was refusing to tell anyone the cause. This is a slightly different issue.  One can imagine a whinging Apple fanboy hack talking to Samsung PR and threatening that if Samsung does not spill the beans he will write a story saying that Samsung does not know the cause of the overheating. The Times went even further and suggested that no one should buy Samsung goods because they all might develop faults. That should teach them for stomping on Apple’s turf. What is more likely is that Samsung does know the cause, and it is somewhat terminal for its design teams. Phone Arena found some specs which were from the Korean safety body which examined the first phones to overheat. They found that the battery was too big and the thin design was pushing all the thin metal frame onto the battery. The second battery was smaller but the design was still pressing against it and so the problem had not gone away. Samsung could not change the design or the battery and therefore had to recall the lot. What is more surprising is that Phone Arena’s story has been ignored by the Tame Apple Press as it falls over itself to promote the iPhone 7 against all rivals.  It is true that Samsung did stuff up, the Note’s problems should have been spotted long before it got into the shops. When the first faults appeared it was logical to think that it was the oversized battery, but they should have checked the design was not a factor. However, it is equally difficult to see how any phone maker could have done much that was different and it is certainly not fair that the Tame Apple Press are behaving like tossers.

Photograph: Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images Elle Hunt @mlle_elle Thursday 13 October 2016 04.58 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 26 October 2016 18.15 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger This article is 1 month old Apple is reportedly closing in on a Australian startup that has pioneered dynamic, customisable “magic keyboards”. The Sydney tech company Sonder has designed a smart keyboard that can be customised to accommodate any language, shortcut or custom icon, using the same E Ink display technology used by Kindle. Apple’s looming acquisition of the company was first reported on Wednesday by a Reddit user purporting to have used an Apple prototype using Sonder technology at an event at Tsinghua University in Beijing, where she worked. The Incubator Innoconn event was organised by Foxconn International Holdings, Apple’s manufacturing partner, for startups it has invested in. The woman’s identity was verified by Reddit moderators. A representative for Sonder confirmed its chief executive, Francisco Serra-Martins, attended the event and that the startup was in talks with Apple’s procurement board. MacOS Sierra: top five things you need to know about Apple's new Mac software Read more Separate to the Reddit report, the Guardian can confirm the Apple CEO, Tim Cook, met with Serra-Martins in China on Tuesday. Both Apple and Sonder have been contacted by the Guardian for comment. The Reddit user said the prototype magic keyboard used an adaptive interface developed by Sonder, similar to that of a early demo unit it publicised on YouTube. Facebook Twitter Pinterest An early demo unit of Sonder’s keyboard. The Reddit user said the chief differences between the Apple prototype and that shown in the Sonder clip was all the keys had a screen and lighting panel, and the display updated instantly with no slow transition from black to white. As a design-for-testing model not due to be released before 2018, the design was far from confirmed but the Reddit user seemed optimistic about the early unit. “It’s really a solid indication of the future of input technology,” she wrote. “Apple has a reputation of making big leaps which are seen to be unpopular but then become the new standard. “Dynamic keyboards are the standard for phones, they will be for laptops and desktops too.” The representative responding to her post said the company was also about to close on procurement contracts with three third-party laptop companies to integrate its technology into their products. Foxconn and E Ink Holdings, both strategic partners of Sonder, were assisting in the discussions with Apple. The company is partly owned by third-party companies and is in the middle of raising an investment round. Sonder’s own keyboard is due for release later this year, with preorders at US$199. Serra-Martins and his twin brother, Felipe, participated in the Genesis startup program at the University of Sydney’s business school last year with the concept for dynamic, affordable keyboards. They were later awarded a grant from the New South Wales state government, as well as the people’s choice award at the 2016 Good Design Australia awards.

But on Saturday, October 15, its doors will open once again, revealing a brand new design – and we've already taken a sneak peak at what it looks like. Regent Street was Apple’s first ever store in Europe, opening 12 years ago. Since then, Apple has served over 60 million customers on the site, marking it as one of the company’s most prized and lucrative retail sites. That’s why it’s no surprise that the Regent Street store is the first Apple Store in Europe to roll out the company’s new retail design concept, which first debuted in the states earlier this year. The Regent Street store will re-open on Saturday, October 15, at 10am, boasting entirely new areas that include the tree-lined 'Avenue', a hands-on 'Boardroom', and a ‘Forum’ space that seats 75 people. The Forum is home to a new (and giant) TV screen, which will be used to promote and feature new store programming under the ‘Today at Apple’ brand. If you’re interest, you’ll be able to find events at the store using the Apple website. Watch our Facebook Live tour of the new Apple Regent Street store here The new store was designed in partnership with Foster + Partners, a prestigious London-based architecture and design firm that has offices around the world. Here’s an excerpt from the company’s website: “Over the past four decades, the practice has pioneered a sustainable approach to architecture through a strikingly wide range of work, from urban masterplans, public infrastructure, airports, civic and cultural buildings, offices, and workplaces, to private houses and product design.” Apple design chief Sir Jony Ive, along with Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s VP of Retail and Online Stores, also helped create the redesigned store, which was based on the new retail design concept that debuted in Apple’s San Francisco store in May this year. According to Ive, Apple has tried to give the new Regent Street store its own unique feel. Speaking to Wallpaper* last month, he said: “Like many great cities, London’s historic architecture has great significance to the community. On Regent Street, we preserved the incredible exterior façade while opening up the interior of the store to enhance the transparency and flood the space with natural light. By choosing materials sympathetic to the historic nature of the building, we’re able to modernise the space while remaining authentic to its surrounds." The actual building features a Grade II Listed exterior façade of portland stone, carrara marble, and hand-cut Venetian Smalti glass tile. Speaking to press at today's briefing, Ahrendts said: "I know how iconic and important Regent Street is, not just to London and the UK, but on the global stage, it's one of the most important streets in the world." She added that a new staff position would be opened up at the Apple Store on Regent Street called Creative Pro: "We're also announcing a new position...experts, pros, if you will, on photography, on gaming, on music – that position is called Creative Pro. We also have Geniuses...we now have a Creative Pro to answer any question you might have on our software and services." Angela Ahrendts speaking to press at the Regent Store re-opening Wendy Beckman, Apple's Senior Marketing Director for Europe, was also on-hand to talk about the new changes: "For those of you that can remember, Regent Street looked quite different in 2004 when we opened up our doors. We were really excited to introduce the iMac G5 and iPod Photo." She continued: "Today marks a new day for Apple Regent Street. The avenues when you walk in, they're inspired by our boulevard and windows. You can sit underneath the trees; it's a really calming environment. It really blurs the line between inside and outside." Beckman also confirmed a major change for the Apple store: the products will be untethered for the first time: "You can pick them up, you can discover, put them in your pocket." Apple's Regent Street store had just 100 employees when it first opened, but now employs 510 staff – 26 of whom have been there since the very beginning. The workforce now spans over 20 nationalities, with staffers speaking more than 30 languages collectively.

Brussels store opened up this time last year as the first EU store with Vintage D, and in the U.K., Brent Cross opened up earlier this year with Vintage D. jimmy October 13, 2016, 3:10 pm you wouldn't expect factually accurate articles here would you?! ha ha LeeTronix October 13, 2016, 3:36 pm The staff all look like Drones that clap on voice command and those tiny school size box chairs what the hell...It just seems so pretentiously fake there is nothing in this store that wants me to visit it especially when it looks like a mental asylum all I need is a white jacket and I would fit right in!!! Seriously T.R why have you written such a pointless article yet again - and you say Apple to do not pay you to promote them...Ahh Ohhhkay sure...riiight...we believe you - NOT (!) Sean Keach October 13, 2016, 3:42 pm Hi Lee, thanks for commenting. They did clap. It was very awkward. I wasn't paid by Apple. I even had to buy my own breakfast granola yoghurt pot. Sean Keach October 13, 2016, 3:43 pm Hi HMNIW, thanks for commenting. I checked up with Apple on this, as we were told that it was the first store in Europe with the redesign. You're right that the Brussels store was redesigned last year with elements of the new design concept, but the Regent Street store is the first in Europe to feature the full new design. Hope that helps! Sean Keach October 13, 2016, 3:44 pm Hi jimmy, thanks for commenting. See my reply above! Sean Keach October 13, 2016, 3:45 pm Hi word-merchant, thanks for commenting. I cannot confirm whether Angela does or does not have feet. We were not made privy to such information, unfortunately. I'll be sure to pass all of your podiatry-related concerns onto my editor, with a view to potentially investigating whether or not any or all Apple executives have feet. I've never been to Biggleswade, but I hear Matalan has some great deals. Will see what I can do. LeeTronix October 13, 2016, 3:46 pm That is terrible I would send Apple an invoice - and did you have to sit on one those children's box thingies when you had your breakfast! :( Sean Keach October 13, 2016, 3:47 pm Hi David, thanks for commenting! Just want to clarify that this is news, not a review. And although I was paid by my editor to write this article, I wasn't paid by Apple. In fact, there weren't even refreshments at the event. Just a load of Apple employees clapping and wooping. As you're probably aware, I can't eat or drink claps and woops. If you want to donate breakfast bars or coffee to TrustedReviews journalists, please get in touch. Sean Keach October 13, 2016, 3:49 pm As an addendum to this, the Brussels store doesn't feature the Boardroom, 'Today at Apple', or the Forum, which are part of the full re-design concept Sean Keach October 13, 2016, 3:51 pm Yes. Fortunately, Apple has designed the boxes with a bum scoop, which made it a little more comfortable. I would recommend boxes with bum scoops in the future. HMNIW October 13, 2016, 4:58 pm Hey Sean. Well, I was working in Field Merchandising during the opening of Brussels, and the stores in UAE, and I'd probably disagree. Vintage D essentially is the Avenues (Accessory bays), the tables, the cieling lights, the stools, the screen, and the Forum area. Everything else, mainly the trees and the 'Boardroom', aren't actually a part of Vintage D, and are additions done on a store by store basis and depending on things like location. They're just like the real nice-to-haves for some of the more exceptional stores (Which most likely won't be mall stores). On the topic of Brussels, it does actually feature the Forum, but on a slightly smaller scale, and whilst I'm unsure what they're currently doing with Today at Apple, they did a number of talks and very interesting workshops with Brussels, including a trial of a photography workshop based on going out into the city with iPhones, and then going back to store after to edit them. Nevertheless, good to see Regent finally get the love it deserved. Borkr October 13, 2016, 8:45 pm Why are all the staff clapping? What's wrong with them? Did they just hear the news they were going to get holiday pay whilst the store was closed for refurbishment during the summer or something? No corporate entity should ever look so smug. It's disgusting. Apple should set an example and ban smiling. Inane grinnery and self indulgent, robotic, clapping should be sackable offenses too. I guess the staff are just glad (and relieved) they don't work on the manufacturing side of things.
