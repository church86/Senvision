By Rene Ritchie Tuesday, Dec 13, 2016 at 12:00 pm EST 46 Comments Google simply isn't held to the same standard as Apple, and that's bad for all of us. Rene Ritchie has been covering Apple and the personal technology industry for almost a decade. Editorial director for Mobile Nations, analyst for iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him on Snapchat, Instagram, or Twitter @reneritchie. Recently, iCloud users began receiving spam in the form of Calendar invitations. It happened around U.S. Thanksgiving, was super annoying, and garnered wide-spread and well-deserved media attention. A couple days later, Apple released a statement to iMore and other outlets apologizing for the issue and promising to address it quickly. Yesterday, Apple rolled out a way to report iCloud Calendar spam on the web, and my guess is we'll see it spread to the Calendar app at some point as well. Apple's statement on iCloud calendar spam. They're sorry and they're working on it. pic.twitter.com/oaSHSywVxG— Rene Ritchie 🖇 (@reneritchie) November 30, 2016 Recently, Google users began receiving spam in the form of shared Docs folders. It happened weeks before U.S. Thanksgiving, was super annoying and, at the time of this writing, has received no real media attention. Google has not released a statement to any outlets that I'm aware of nor promised to address it quickly or otherwise. Far as I can tell, Google hasn't added an easy way to report Docs spam either, and my guess is, unless this piece goes viral, they won't any time soon. Google Docs spam continues, and apparently there's no way to stop it. (Please let iWork collaboration… work!) pic.twitter.com/AKxjX8X2GZ— Rene Ritchie 🖇 (@reneritchie) September 18, 2016 Once upon a time Apple was envied and derided for having a "reality distortion field" — the ability to garner the benefit of the doubt and receive a positive spin for almost anything they did, no matter how poorly it actually held up under scrutiny. It never really existed, of course. Steve Jobs was simply the best spokesperson the industry has ever seen. He resonated with people and his excitement was infectious. Still, it never spared Apple antennagate, MobileMe, and and other, non-distorted problems over the years. Tim Cook's Apple, if anything, has enjoyed an equal and opposite "reality distortion field" of late. It casts almost everything the company does as doomed regardless of how well it actually does. As something Steve Jobs would never do, regardless of whether or not Jobs had actually done it in the past or was involved in the early stages of it getting done now. The truth is, if any company has enjoyed a "reality distortion field" in recent years it's been Google. Even absent anything approaching a Jobs-style leader, the teflon they've found themselves covered in over the years has let them walk safely though situations that would have sunk lesser companies. No matter how many authors books they scanned or Wi-Fi data they scooped up without permission, they stayed golden. In the greatest stroke of genius modern technology has seen, they convinced ardent open source advocates to rally against the closed systems of others... even though all of Google's key businesses like search and advertising are proprietary. Remember Ping and Apple Music Connect? Laughed at to this day. Remember Google Buzz? Google Wave? Hangouts? Google+? Spaces? The just-released Allo? They form a string of social messaging flops far grandeur and far more troubling than any of Apple's social music missteps. Yet there's very little laughter. The same attitude infects the media, most of whom — myself include — use Google services day in, day out for work. Take the recently released Pixel phone for example. When Apple released the very similar iPhone 6s last year, they were tagged for missing "key" features like optical image stabilization on the smaller model, stereo speakers, and water-resistence. And for having a familiar, antenna-line laden design. Yet Google releases that very phone a full year later, still missing those features and aping that design while adding a huge glass RF window that doesn't even reduce the antenna lines, and any criticism of it is largely left as a footnote in the face of rave reviews. It's almost like they're graded on a curve. Previous Nexus phones were always given a pass for bad cameras or missing features because they were cheap. Pixel costs as much as an iPhone, and doesn't even include headphones in the box. And still all the passes are given. Apple is rolling out "Report Spam" for iCloud Calendar. Google Docs spam, meanwhile, is deafening silence. Graded on a curve… pic.twitter.com/ol0GWM6N0R— Rene Ritchie 🖇 (@reneritchie) December 12, 2016 Had iCloud Drive experienced the same problem as Google Docs, the headlines would be coming our way fast and furiously. So, why am I writing all this? Am I asking people and press to calm down when it comes to Apple? Not hardly. I'm asking everyone to amp it up when it comes to Google. Holding Apple to the highest standard is great for Apple's customers. I mean, the clickbait "Apple bites dog" headlines are transparent and literally make us stupider as a consumer society, but whatever. It forces Apple to improve. Google, because of how much they know about us, needs to be held to an even higher-than-the-highest standard. We — yes, including the media — have to be on them quickly and relentless about every little thing, because should a big thing come, it would hurt us far worse than any Apple foible. So yeah, raise a fuss about iCloud Calendar being spammed and get Apple to stop it. Please. Thank you. But also raise a fuss about Google Docs being spammed as well, and don't stop until you get Google's statement and reassurance that they're working on it, and you start seeing solutions. Then keep doing it. You know, like you would if you were grading them on an Apple curve. Like us!

Also, scrutiny can have the same net effect as head-on competition for a company with a wise leader - it's an open opportunity to rise to meet the challenge and ultimately do better. In this area Tim has done far better than many, maybe any, Fortune 500 leaders, including Steve Jobs. Steve had a very difficult time admitting mistakes. I see Tim as a corporate leader that is willing to say, "sorry", if he thinks it's really deserved, and always willing to try and do better whether an apology is required or not. Let Google do its thing - What goes around, comes around - always and without fail. 0 3 weeks ago Reply Tech198 Maybe that is actually "good" for Google.. Think about it.... If its not as viral, the less attention will be drawn to it.. That's probably no reason to not fix anything, but its sure is an escape goat. So a lession..... No one else report this :) 0 3 weeks ago Reply jlgraham I have not heard of Google Docs spam. Not in docs, calendar or any Google services that I use. I use Google docs every day, with three different accounts (work, work and personal). Also, I just did a search for "Google Docs Spam" (and variations) and the only things that came up were at least 2 years old (and I used DuckDuckGo to search, not Google). Also, maybe this is just me, but isn't it tacky to write an article about a problem that supposedly affects a number of people, and the only reference to said problem is the author's own tweets? That's like citing yourself as a source... If this is an issue why aren't you able to find comments from other affected users? I understand that you're talking about how the media is not paying attention, but surely you could find one single Tweet from an outside source? 0 3 weeks ago Reply bobbob1016 I think the difference is layered.: One, new docs added to my Google Docs don't popup alerts on my phone constantly Two, I haven't seen this on my Google Docs Three, Google will likely allow me to fix it from mobile, not requiring I bust out a device they're trying to kill off (and saying their iPad is) Four, not as many people use Google Docs 0 3 weeks ago Reply DanRJones91 Okay, well no-one is "freaking out" about the iCloud Calendar or the Google Docs spam. At most, sensible people are mildly inconvenienced by it. And this essentially reads as "waahh people are being mean to my darling!". Yeah, perhaps people do grade on a curve, but then you always hold Apple to a higher standard than other companies, so you're certainly not one to throw stones. It's a problem of their own making - they were far above the competition for a long time and people came to expect more from them. Now they've had a bland year the perception is they're being treated more harshly because of that, but that's hardly the same as saying people aren't giving other companies **** for their mistakes too. 1 3 weeks ago Reply luimende Because no one uses Google docs obviously.

Not one incident. Posted via the iMore App for Android -2 3 weeks ago Reply bdfortin I've noticed a similar trend lately with Siri and Google Assistant: Despite dozens of comparisons showing that the two assistants are roughly on par Google Assistant is always being praised as being "better" because "it's pretty equal today but soon, really soon, it'll be leaps and bounds better, just you wait!" while Siri is seen as stagnant with no hope for improvement. People also praise Google Assistant for being context aware even though Siri got the same context awareness back in iOS 9 but everyone seems to have forgotten. "Grading on a curve" sounds like exactly what's going on. 2 3 weeks ago Reply VAVA Mk2 Yeah....nooo... Considering the number of blogs and tech writers that have done comparisons between all the major mobile assistants, that is a false claim. Siri is the weakest of them all. Posted from my Nexus 6P -2 3 weeks ago Reply cmdacos Yep, shown time and time again that Siri is falling behind fast. Posted via the iMore App for Android -3 3 weeks ago Reply bdfortin "Siri is the weakest of them all." That's completely false. Right now Google Assistant and Siri are just about even for the top spot (although Google Assistant is currently limited to a few million Pixel and Home devices, only in English, and only in select countries, whereas Siri is available on over a billion Apple devices, in many countries, in many languages), Cortana is a little behind (but with geographic/linguistic limitations like Google Assistant), S Voice is complete garbage (feel free to try to defend that one), and Alexa is pretty good (but also suffers from geographic/linguistic limitations). MKBHD's comparison, for example, walks Google Assistant and Siri through their paces fairly well: Siri misses a few requests, Google Assistant also misses a few requests, Siri has a slight edge when it comes to getting information and integrating with apps, Google has a slight edge when it comes to voice recognition and request parsing. 1 3 weeks ago Reply vinny jr I own both the iPhone 7 & the Samsung Galaxy S7. Google Assistant is far superior than Siri. There's just no comparison. Speed, accuracy & what you can do with them, Google is far ahead of Siri. -1 3 weeks ago Reply bdfortin The Galaxy S7 doesn't even have Google Assistant, it's limited to the Pixel. 1 3 weeks ago Reply blckz28 Google Assistant is also built into Allo so you can have it on just about any phone. -2 3 weeks ago Reply bdfortin Google Assistant in Allo doesn't have the same capability that it would on a Pixel: It can't set a timer, it can't launch apps, it can't look at contact information, it can't make a phone call, etc. Google Assistant in Allo isn't even as capable as Google Now, let alone being as capable as Siri. 1 3 weeks ago Reply ra535i Forget the assistant, Google now is available on ALL phones and is better than anything out there. Google assistant will reach feature parity with Google now soon I'm sure. Can't say the same for Siri. ****, Cortana is better than Siri in IMHO. -2 3 weeks ago Reply bdfortin "Google assistant will reach feature parity with Google now soon I'm sure. Can't say the same for Siri." This is exactly what I meant with my original comment: Google gets praised because it'll be better later (and next year is the year of the linux desktop!) while Siri is seen as completely stagnant without any hope for improvement (except all the improvements it's gotten over the last few years, but we'll ignore all those), which is hypocritical bull****. 1 3 weeks ago Reply ra535i So you agree that google now is better than Siri. Good. At least you're not crazy. Assistant is already on par with Siri. Now is on another level. And like I said before. "Now", "assistant", and "home" will be using the same backend soon. That's a war that Apple can't win without mining data the way that google does. -2 3 weeks ago Reply bdfortin I never agreed to that, I disregarded it because Now, Assistant, and Siri are all on par, and nobody can provide any evidence to back up any claims to the contrary. Why couldn't Google just use the same backend in the first place? Apple already mines data, they just do it in a different way and tend not to brag about every incremental update. For example, the database Apple uses for image recognition is actually twice the size of Google's, but Apple's algorithms let them mine through twice as much data with ~1/3 the computing power. But, again, like I said in the original post, your entire claim is predicated on the idea that Google's offering may not be better today but soon, SO SOON YOU GUYS!, it'll be better, and Siri will forever remain the same as it was back in 2011 (we'll ignore things like being to order an Uber with Siri, things Google Now and Google Assistant can't do). 0 3 weeks ago Reply DannyJJK I'm pretty sure Apple has big plans for Siri, especially with recently bringing it to the Mac and the application integration in iOS 10. Siri's voice recognition works great for me in both English and Spanish (my second language, so my accent isn't even perfect for this). I use it a lot on my iPhone and Apple Watch 1 3 weeks ago Reply cmdacos I'm sure everyone has big plans for their assistant. What's the point? Posted via the iMore App for Android -2 3 weeks ago Reply DannyJJK The point is that people are acting like Siri is falling greatly behind other assistants, when in reality Apple are still adding new things to Siri and improving voice recognition too. Maybe Siri is behind now, but that could easily change 0 3 weeks ago Reply dsignori The reality distortion field "never existed"? I guess, says someone currently caught up in it... I see your overall article point Rene, I do. But again you go too far in taking Apple's side.

You don't think it's possible fans and supporters of both companies have their own personal biases towards those companies? The reputations of both companies are very different as are the methods in which they release products. I think if you looked at this from the same lens you view Apple you'd easily be able to see why the two companies are different. You can't always make these "What about Google/Samsung/insert company name" articles without objectively looking at both sides. Google has ALWAYS released a bunch of different products to see what sticks. Apple hasn't. Apple has always been much more secretive about their products and only released what they felt was a finished (or somewhat finished) product. It's nothing new for Google to release a service and discard of it if it doesn't perform. You can't view these two companies the same. You'll always be disappointed in this "curve" you frequently discuss. -2 3 weeks ago Reply P-DogNC Quis89, that is false equivalency. 0 3 weeks ago Reply lvavila I see the answer to your article as a compliment to Apple. The way I see it: Google is capable of making good products and services... Apple is capable of making great products and services. Does Apple have flops? Yes and boy do I remember Newton and I never "got" Ping. I am a developer and consumer. I really like Google but love Apple so yeah I personally hold Apple to higher standards. Amazon would be my #2 with Google sitting at #3 (along with 5-6 other companies, ie Netflix, Tablo, Kia, etc) in terms of consumer respect.

If I pulled together 10 android users and asked them how many of them used google docs I'd be surprised if 5 of them said yes. So naturally, Apple's issue would affect a higher percentage of users than Google's. One doesn't need a graph to figure this out....

Apple Inc is expected to report Q2 earnings on April 27, 2015. — Reuters picNEW YORK, Dec 16 — “The Maxforce” is the European Union team that ordered Ireland to collect billions of euros in back taxes from Apple Inc, rattled the Irish government, and spurred changes to international tax law. You’d think it might have earned the name by applying maximum force while investigating alleged financial shenanigans. It didn’t. It’s just led by a guy named Max. A European Commission official gave the nickname to the Task Force on Tax Planning Practices in honor of its chief, Max Lienemeyer, a lanky, laid-back German attorney who rose to prominence vetting plans to shore up struggling banks during Europe’s debt crisis. Since its launch in 2013, the Maxforce has looked at the tax status of hundreds of companies across Europe, including a deal Starbucks Corp. had in the Netherlands, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s agreement with Luxembourg, and — its largest case — Apple in Ireland.   Lienemeyer’s team of 15 international civil servants pursued a three-year investigation stretching from the corridors of the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, to Ireland’s Finance Ministry and on to Apple’s leafy headquarters in Cupertino, California. Much of it outlined for the first time here, this story chronicles a growing clash between Europe and the US and a shift in the EU’s approach to the tax affairs of multinationals. The Maxforce concluded that Ireland allowed Apple to create stateless entities that effectively let it decide how much — or how little — tax it pays. The investigators say the company channeled profits from dozens of countries through two Ireland-based units. In a system at least tacitly endorsed by Irish authorities, earnings were split, with the vast majority attributed to a “head office” with no employees and no specific home base—and therefore liable to no tax on any profits from sales outside Ireland. The US, meanwhile, didn’t tax the units because they’re incorporated in Ireland. “I can’t see why the tax liability is in Ireland.” —Irish Finance Minister, Michael Noonan In August the EU said Ireland had broken European law by giving Apple a sweetheart deal. It ordered the country to bill the iPhone maker a record €13 billion (RM62.24 billion) in back taxes, plus interest, from 2003 to 2014. One example the Commission cites: In 2011, a unit called Apple Sales International recorded profits of about €16 billion from sales across Europe. But only €50 million were considered taxable in Ireland, leaving €15.95 billion of profit untaxed, the Commission says. Though the EU says its goal is “to ensure equal treatment of companies” across Europe, Apple maintains that the Commission selectively targeted the company. With the ruling, the EU is “retroactively changing the rules and choosing to disregard decades of Irish law,” and its investigators don’t understand the differences between European and US tax systems, Apple said in a December 8 statement. Apple, which has some 6,000 workers in Ireland, says its Irish units paid the parent company a licensing fee to use the intellectual property in its products. The Irish companies didn’t own the IP, so they don’t owe tax on it in Ireland, Apple says, but the units will face a US tax bill when they repatriate the profits. “This case has never been about how much tax Apple pays, it’s about where our tax is paid,” the company said.  “We pay tax on everything we earn.” Ireland on November 9 appealed the Commission’s ruling at the EU General Court in Luxembourg, arguing it has given Apple no special treatment. Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan has said he “profoundly disagrees” with the ruling and that Ireland strictly adheres to tax regulations. The government says Ireland has no right to tax non-resident companies for profits that come from activities outside the country. “Look at the small print” on an iPhone, Noonan said after the EU released its ruling in August. “It says designed in California, manufactured in China. “That means any profits that accrued didn’t accrue in Ireland, so I can’t see why the tax liability is in Ireland.” In the coming weeks, the EU is expected to publish details of the Maxforce investigation. At about the same time, Apple will likely lodge its own appeal in the EU court. Though Apple will have to pay its tax bill within weeks, the money will be held in escrow, and the issue will probably take years to be resolved. This story is based on interviews with dozens of officials from the EU, Ireland, and Apple, though most didn’t want to speak on the record discussing sensitive tax matters. A Maxforce representative declined to make Lienemeyer available for an interview. Ireland’s Office of Revenue Commissioners (the equivalent of the American Internal Revenue Service) says it can’t comment on specific companies. “Inconsistency and ambiguity” —Tim Cook on the EU investigation  Lienemeyer began assembling the Maxforce in late spring of 2013 with a mandate of scrutinizing tax policies across Europe in search of any favoritism. Direct subsidies or tax breaks to court a specific company are illegal in the EU to prevent governments aiding national champions. His first hire — the person who would oversee the Apple probe — was Helena Malikova, a Slovak who had worked at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich. He quickly added Kamila Kaukiel, a Polish financial analyst who had been at KPMG, and Saskia Hendriks, a former tax policy adviser to the Dutch government. As the four initial members began their investigations, they got a head start from a US Senate probe of the tax strategies of American multinationals. The Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said Apple shifted tens of billions of dollars in profit into stateless affiliates based in Ireland, where it secured a tax rate of less than 2 per cent. At 9:30am on May 21, 2013, senators gathered in Room 106 of the Dirksen Office Building. Included in the evidence presented that day was a 2004 letter from Tom Connor, an official at Ireland’s tax authority, to Ernst & Young, Apple’s tax adviser. Connor’s question: A unit of the tech company hadn’t filed a tax return; Was it still in business? E&Y responded two days later that the division was a non-resident holding company with no real sales. “There is nothing to return from the corporation tax standpoint,” E&Y wrote. The Senate exhibits didn’t include Connor’s response if there ever was one. At the hearing, Arizona Republican John McCain castigated Apple as “one of the biggest tax avoiders in America”. Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan peered over the glasses perched on the tip of his nose and said Apple uses “offshore tax strategies whose purpose is tax avoidance, pure and simple”. Crucially, though, Levin told the crowded room that under US law, there was little the panel could do to force Apple to pay more tax. Apple chief executive officer Tim Cook passionately defended the company’s actions, telling the senators “We don’t depend on tax gimmicks.” The Senate revelations raised eyebrows at the Maxforce’s office in Madou Tower, a 1960s high-rise in the rundown Saint-Josse neighborhood of Brussels. Three weeks after the Senate hearing, Lienemeyer’s team asked Ireland for details of Apple’s tax situation. The Irish tax authorities soon dispatched a representative carrying a briefcase filled with a bundle of bound pages. The Irish could have simply sent the material via e-mail, but they were cautious about sharing taxpayer’s information with the EU and have a ground rule to avoid leaks: never send such documents electronically. While the Irish government remained bullish in its public statements, saying Apple hadn’t received any favors, behind the scenes tensions were rising. Through the summer of 2013, the Finance Ministry assured government ministers that the EU investigation would amount to nothing, according to people familiar with the discussions. But those assertions seemed less confident than earlier communications. There was a sense that Apple had worked out its Irish tax position in a vastly different era, and no one remembered many details of the negotiations decades earlier. In 1980, the four-year-old company — the Apple III desktop had just been released — created several Irish affiliates, each with a different function such as manufacturing or sales, according to the Senate report. Under Irish laws dating to the 1950s designed to shore up the moribund post-war economy, as a so-called export company Apple paid no taxes on overseas sales of products made in Ireland. To comply with European rules, Ireland finally ended its zero-tax policy in 1990. After that, Apple and Ireland agreed that the profit attributed to a key Ireland-based unit, the division discussed in Tom Connor’s letter, be capped using a complex formula that in 1990 would have resulted in a taxable profit of US$30 million to US$40 million (RM134.32 million to RM179.10 million). An Apple tax adviser “confessed there was no scientific basis” for those figures, but that the amounts would be “of such magnitude that he hoped it would be seen as a bona-fide proposal,” according to notes from a 1990 meeting with the Irish tax authority cited by the EU. The equation didn’t change even as Apple began assembling the bulk of its products in Asia. Ireland and Apple started to make changes a few months after the Maxforce began looking into their tax relationship. In October 2013, Finance Minister Noonan announced he would close the loophole that let stateless holding companies operate out of Ireland. And the EU says Apple changed the structure of its Irish units in 2015. As the Maxforce stepped up its probe in June 2014, Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny was wooing potential investors in California. At a San Francisco event to promote Irish entrepreneurs, Governor Jerry Brown quipped that he had thought Apple “was a California company,” but according to tax returns, “they’re really an Irish company.” News clips show Irish officials looking on stony-faced as the governor makes his jest. Enforcement of EU rules on taxation is a matter of “fairness” —EU competition chief, Margrethe Vestager With Lienemeyer’s team digging further into the issue, Apple’s concern deepened. In January 2016, CEO Cook met with Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition chief—and Lienemeyer’s ultimate boss—on the 10th-floor of the Berlaymont building, the institutional headquarters of the European Commission in Brussels. Vestager, a daughter of two Lutheran pastors, has a reputation for being even-handed but tough, cutting unemployment benefits while advocating strict new rules for banks when she served as Denmark’s finance minister. While she has acknowledged that her team had little experience with tax rulings—in a November interview with France’s Society magazine, she said, “We learned on the job”—Vestager says enforcement of EU rules on taxation is a matter of “fairness.” In the meeting with Cook she quizzed him on the tax Apple paid in various jurisdictions worldwide. She told the Apple executives that “someone has to tax you,” according to a person present at the meeting. In a Jan. 25 follow-up letter obtained by Bloomberg, Cook thanked Vestager for a “candid and constructive exchange of views,” and reasserted that Apple’s earnings are “subject to deferred taxation in the US until those profits are repatriated.” Subsequent correspondence became more heated. On March 14, Cook wrote to Vestager that he had “concerns about the fairness of these proceedings.” The Commission had failed to explain fully the basis on which Apple was being investigated, and the body’s approach was characterized by “inconsistency and ambiguity,” Cook said. Apple contended that the EU had backtracked on a 2014 decision recognizing that its two Irish subsidiaries were not technically resident in Ireland, and therefore only liable for taxes on profits derived from Irish sources. Now, Cook said, it seemed the Commission was intent on “imposing a massive, retroactive tax on Apple by attributing to the Irish branches all of Apple’s global profits outside the Americas.” “There is no inconsistency,” an EU spokesman said in a Dec. 15 statement. Only a fraction of the profits of the subsidiaries were taxed in Ireland, the statement said. “As a result, the tax rulings enabled Apple to pay substantially less tax than other companies, which is illegal under EU state aid rules.” Cook’s entreaties did little to sway Vestager, and in August she phoned Noonan to tell him the results of the Maxforce investigation: The Commission was going to rule against Ireland. Late in the afternoon of Aug. 29, Irish officials began hinting to reporters that Apple’s tax bill amounted to billions and “could be anything.” At noon the following day, Vestager told a packed press conference in Brussels that the Commission had decided Apple owed Ireland 13 billion euros. Though that would be equivalent to 26 per cent of the 2015 national budget, Ireland didn’t want the windfall, saying the ruling was flawed because the country hadn’t given Apple any special treatment. The decision sparked a political crisis as left-leaning members of Enda Kenny’s fragile minority administration saw a potential bonanza for taxpayers that the world’s richest company could well afford. Even as Noonan toured television studios vowing to appeal the decision, independent lawmakers demanded that Ireland take the money. Facing a potential revolt that could bring down the government, Kenny and Noonan eventually bowed to demands for a review of the country’s corporate tax system. But they said they would fight the case, and on Sept. 7, Irish lawmakers overwhelmingly backed the motion for an appeal. Officials from Lienemeyer’s team and other EU offices say they have gathered tax information on about 300 companies, looking for what they deem to be favorable treatment by governments across Europe. While they don’t expect all of those to yield payoffs as hefty as that from their investigation of Ireland and Apple, they say a worrying number require the kind of maximum force that the Maxforce can apply. “We focus on outliers where you’re looking at something that is off the radar screen,” Lienemeyer’s boss, 50-year-old Dutchman Gert-Jan Koopman, who is in charge of state-aid enforcement at the EU, said at a Brussels conference in November. “If you’re paying a fair amount of tax then there is absolutely nothing to worry about.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Ford plant turns ‘cemetery’ as Trump wrenches Mexican autos Stocks, dollar recover ground after US jobs report Rising REITs back bets on stronger economy US stocks little changed on mixed jobs report China could keep reserves near US$3t to avoid alarm BMI Research: Things will get worse for the Malaysian ringgit World’s highest-paid expats toil in land of fondue and watches Ringgit to stay under pressure on US interest rate rise Trump tweets GM should make Cruze model in US or pay tax Sterling hits two-week high vs euro after strong manufacturing PMI Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Multiple people dead in Florida airport shooting Jason Momoa stars in ‘Frontier’ Reuters Video: Trump orders Obama's envoys out by inauguration day Reuters Video: Nunes stuns challenger Rousey with first-round title win Reuters Video: Man survives Turkey nightclub attack by pretending to be dead HD video of earth from space will make your heart ache Related Articles Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Facebook rolls out new tools against fake news Facebook has announced that it has begun rolling out new tools to help users report and avoid hoaxes and fake news (The Verge). These include a 'fake news story' option when reporting unwanted items in your newsfeed, flags on stories with disputed content and measures to prevent spammers from masquerading as real news organisations. Facebook is working with Snopes, Politifact, ABC News and FactCheck.org to identify hoax stories as they emerge.

Three-person embryos approved for fertility treatment in the UK The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has given clinics in the UK the go-ahead to use three-person embryos in fertility treatments for patients with specific disorders (BBC). Clinics that wish to use the mitochondrial transfer technique must apply for a licence, and the first babies conceived using the technique could be born by the end of 2017. Three-person IVF is aimed at couples who wish to conceive but risk transmitting a potentially fatal genetic disorder, and works by swapping the mother’s mitochondrial genetic information with that of a healthy donor, while retaining the chromosomal DNA from the mother. 3. Replacement iPhone wireless headphones to cost $69 per ear Apple has revealed the service pricing for its new AirPods - the wireless earphones that Apple wants everyone to use with the iPhone 7 now that headphone ports are no longer cool (TechCrunch). A single replacement AirPod for one ear will cost $69, while replacing batteries worn our during normal use will cost $49. Specific UK prices haven't yet been announced. Apple AirPods are due to go on sale later this month, allowing iPhone users to dispense with their wired EarPods and unwieldy Lightning port adaptor if they're willing to pay a tidy $159 for a pair. 4. Nasa has successfully launched the CYGNSS weather satellite cluster Nasa's Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) has finally been launched into orbit aboard Orbital ATK's Pegasus XL rocket (Gizmodo). Originally scheduled for launch first in November and then on Monday, December 12, the cluster of eight microsatellites will help to improve the quality of hurricane forecasting. The rocket was launched in mid-air from Orbital ATK's L-1011 Stargazer aircraft at 8:37 am EST (13:37 GMT) yesterday, December 15 ADVERTISEMENT Read more WIRED Awake: 10 must-read articles for January 5 WIRED Awake: 10 must-read articles for January 5 By WIRED 5. Alphabet's medical research wing is investigating naked mole rats Medical research firm Calico, a subsidiary of Google parent company Alphabet in partnership with AbbVie pharmaceuticals, is sequencing the genome of naked mole rats in an attempt to learn more about how ageing works (The Verge). The MIT Technology Review took a rare look into the project's inner workings. Calico teams are researching a variety of organisms, from yeast to mice, but the mole rats are particularly unusual. They live up to 30 years - a long time for their size - and are more resistant to cancer than most mammals. 6. Water ice is found lurking in craters on dwarf planet Ceres Water ice has been found on the dwarf planet Ceres, data from Nasa's Dawn spacecraft has revealed (WIRED). Within the shadowed craters of Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, are quantities of water ice according to findings in the journal Nature. The discovery of the ice makes Ceres the third planetary body to have the substance within our solar system, after the Moon and Mercury. "The direct identification of water-ice deposits in permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) on Ceres builds on mounting evidence from Mercury and the Moon that PSRs are able to trap and preserve water ice," researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, in Germany, wrote in the paper. 7. Sky agrees sale to 20th Century Fox Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox has succeeded in its bid to buy out British satellite broadcaster Sky (Ars Technica UK). Fox will pay £11.70 per share for the 61 per cent of Sky that it does not already own. In the absence of challenges from regulators and watchdogs in the UK and EU, Fox will take control of Sky, currently chaired by James Murdoch, by the end of next year. However, there is opposition to the move, with Labour shadow culture secretary Tom Watson saying that "the secretary of state must refer the bid to Ofcom, to assess whether it would result in too much media power being concentrated in too few hands, and whether Rupert and James Murdoch are 'fit and proper persons' to run a broadcaster."

Access declassified CIA maps The CIA is celebrating the 75th anniversary of its cartographic division by releasing a cache of its maps online for anyone to peruse (Smithsonian Magazine). The formerly secret maps span all the way from the 1940s through to the 2010s. The intelligence agency writes that the cartographic division exists "to analyze geospatial information, extract intelligence-related geodata, and present the information visually in creative and effective ways for maximum understanding by intelligence consumers." 9. Nintendo Switch patent reveals VR headset Nintendo has filed patents that appear to show a VR headset for the company's forthcoming Switch hybrid console (IGN). The "HMD (head mounted display)" accessory appears to work like Google and Samsung's mobile VR headsets, requiring the user to insert the console to experience virtual reality through the headset's lenses.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

In addition to Apple’s own retail locations, the company will begin shipping the earbuds to carrier stores and Apple Authorized Resellers starting Monday as well. It’s unclear how many units each store will receive, and availability will likely be constrained. Seeing how fast AirPods sold out online, it’s likely that retail locations will receive very little stock, if any. We expect stock to remain extremely limited all the way through early 2017. Earlier this week, Apple hinted the retail availability for AirPods, but did not give any specifics. While this report hasn’t been confirmed by Apple, it makes sense that they’ll be available Monday morning as we’re in the holiday shopping season.

Instead of just thinking about how to move, the best approach is to instead futureproof yourself for if you ever want to go back in the other direction. Apple and Google both make their ecosystems like honey: sweet and tasty, but awfully sticky. Here are some tips to help you avoid getting stuck while also savoring in the good parts of making the move that you want. Know why you’re switching Don’t listen to The Other Side. Once you’ve decided to switch, you’ll probably be happy. Especially if you are doing so for some of the many reasons worth doing it. If you have an iPhone, you’ll benefit from all the strong tie-ins that Apple has built between it and the Mac. The iPhone 7 and Plus both take excellent pictures and continue to offer a well-built and smooth experience. If you’re all-in with Google, making the move to Android is better than ever. This year saw a number of excellent phones, especially Google’s own Pixel. Nougat is particularly tasty, and Daydream VR is an impressive introduction to virtual reality. Yes, you may come for the hardware but you’re most likely to stay for the apps and services. Move your data the smart way There are three big ecosystems to consider where you may have a home for your essential files like photos, contacts, and core productivity apps: Apple, Google, and Microsoft. With the latter, you will do well to download the rather large slate of Microsoft apps. Outlook is arguably the best email app on iPhone, and it even works with Gmail and other accounts. While iCloud can be the glue that connects your iPhone and services, it doesn’t necessarily need to be. The bottom line is you don’t have to be all-in with Apple services to take advantage of the iPhone. I’ve always used Google to sync my contacts, photos, and am even a Google Play Music subscriber. If you’re on Spotify, a fan of Dropbox, or a user of enterprise-focused Box, you can skip the work of navigating Apple’s Settings to connect services and just download the app and get right to work or play. Tips for moving to Android This is a better time than ever to make the switch to the land of Google. The specifics of making the switch is going to vary depending on what phone you get. Google’s Pixel is best in class, and the device actually ushered in a new migration tool that’s designed to help you switch from the iPhone. The killer feature is the Quick Switch Adapter - it does the bulk of the heavy lifting by transferring over your photos, contacts, messages, and a lot of other essentials. Once you sign in to a Google account, you’ll need to physically connect your old and new phone with some type of peripheral (you’ll get an adapter with a Pixel) that can connect from Lightning to USB-C. It’s the best experience I’ve ever had in moving over iMessages, transforming them into SMS messages and keeping the strands all in tact. I tried it when switching from an iPhone 6S to a Pixel earlier this year, and it was a relief that Google got this right. Google has vastly improved the process when it comes to switching over to Android. For finding apps, you’re on your own. Nearly everything out there in the App Store can be found in Google Play. There’s still the occasional app that launches first on iPhone or gets more attention than the Android counterpart (looking at you Facebook) but as someone who has moved back over to a Pixel full-time after flirting with the iPhone life, I haven’t found anything that I feel is holding me back. Not to mention for all that Google integration, Android is still fairly open in many ways. Gmail isn’t just for Gmail, as it can handle other accounts. Gmail handles a lot more than just your Google mail. Even Apple Music is here, so you don’t have to completely abandon your musical history. And most of the world has moved on to WhatsApp or other third-party messaging services, which work everywhere. The key to switching is that it doesn’t have to be that hard. The main issue: don’t forget to turn off iMessage. Apple has largely fixed the issue of messages disappearing into the abyss, as long as you turn it off before adding your SIM card and using it for messages. Tips for moving to the iPhone If you’re leaving the green pastures of Android and moving to the lovely walled garden, there are a few key tips that you ought to know about. The first is to grab Apple’s Move to iOS app from the Play Store. You install it on your outgoing Android phone and then make an over-the-air connection to your iPhone. Apple’s Move to iOS app will help you make the switch. In all it does an excellent job at transferring over messages, contacts, bookmarks, and images. Keep in mind if you’ve offloaded any Google Photos from your phone to the cloud, they won’t make the journey.  I’ve had some disappearing contacts in the past, so it’s worth double checking that everything went smoothly. Another thing to consider is that if you were on Android you probably kept most of your content in your Google account. This matters because Google does a very good job at building its apps on iOS. And sometimes, as in the case of Gboard, the apps come first to iOS! To me the biggest advantage is iMessage, which here in the U.S. has turned into a universal messaging system. Some people take this seriously: search for “green bubble” on Twitter and you’ll know what I mean. Apple has put a lot of work into ramping up iMessage in iOS 10 with apps, games, and other features. Stay flexible, if you can No matter your move, it’s always possible that you may not stay in that particular ecosystem for life. But it’s not getting easier. Let’s say you pick up a Pixel and love the Google Assistant. The next stop may be a Google Home. And then you could be tempted by a Daydream VR viewer, so you make a bunch of game purchases. Do you want to say good-bye to all those apps down the line? Same goes on the Apple front. By the time you get the kids an iPhone, a family iPad, an Apple TV...you get the idea. Even if the Google Assistant or some other proprietary option looks neat, you may want to stick with an iPhone so you don’t become a green bubble or lose the ability to watch your iTunes rentals. Some things are getting more open, while others are closing up. Weighing the costs are going to be the constant companion going forward when it comes time to ponder leaping from one mobile platform to another.

The lawsuit was first filed in 2011 by four Apple employees in San Diego. They alleged that the company failed to give them meal and rest breaks, and didn’t pay them in a timely manner, among other complaints. California law requires employers to give hourly workers a 30 minute meal break if they’re working more than five hours a day. They’re also require to provide 10 minute breaks for every four hours worked. In 2013, the case became a class action lawsuit that included California employees who had worked at Apple between 2007 and 2012, approximately 21,000 people. Apple made changes to its scheduling policy in 2012. Jeffrey Hogue, one of the attorneys who represented the class action, said the $2 million verdict came down last Friday — but Apple could owe more money. The second half of the case is expected to conclude next week, Hogue told CNNMoney. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) did not immediately reply for request for comment. It’s unclear how much of the $2 million will go to the workers. If divided evenly, it would be just $95 per employee, but it’s likely some of the money will go toward attorney fees. The complaint says Apple’s culture of secrecy keeps employees from talking about the company’s poor working conditions. “If [employees] so much as discuss the various labor policies, they run the risk of being fired, sued or disciplined,” the complaint reads.

Reasons for the delays pointed to troubles syncing audio streams between the two Airpods and the other reason was that Apple was still figuring out how to deal with customers who lose an Airpod or their charging case. Well, shortly after that post, Apple released the Airpods to the market, just in time for the holiday shopping season. Likewise, Apple has also detailed on its website its rules for replacing any Airpod parts. For $160, you get the Airpod earbuds and their charging case. Rather than Apple telling you youre SOL for losing one of the earbuds or charging case and needing to buy a whole second set, Apple will allow customers to purchase a single piece of the set for $69. That will cover a single item: either the left or right airpod, or the charging case. Apple's policy on replacement Airpods If you need a battery replacement for any of the aforementioned items, you can have its battery replaced for $49 for a single Airpod or their charging case. This will only be applicable within the Airpods one-year warranty from the date of purchase. Oh yeah, and those prices are subject to tax and a shipping fee of $6.95. If you really have your heart set on the Airpods though, you can at least rest easy knowing what would happen if you lost or damaged a single Airpod. Otherwise, $70 could go toward a longer-lasting pair of Bluetooth headphones. What do you think of these replacement prices? Do you think the $160 is worth the benefit?

Apple AirPods Won’t Ship for 4 Weeks, But You Can Buy Them in-Store Next Week Apple kicked off orders for AirPods yesterday and within minutes the earbuds sold out, pushing the delivery date as far as 4 weeks. For a lot of customers who were hoping to buy Apple’s newfound earphones, it was a huge letdown. But, Cupertino will give potential buyers another chance at grabbing the AirPods next week as that will be the time they’ll become available in Apple Stores. Given the speed at which AirPods sold out online, we doubt they’ll stick around long enough at an Apple Store. I’ll go as far as saying that one should arrive at an Apple Store ahead of time in order to bag yourself Cupertino’s new wireless earbuds. After all, the holiday season is right on our faces, and consumers will do all they can to put that little white box under the Christmas tree. You don’t want to miss that opportunity, do you? If you have managed to order the new earphones and are awaiting shipment, then you might want to check out the user guides beforehand. They’ll walk you through the process of pairing the device with your iPhone as well as how to use the Charge Case and turn certain features on or off. It’s a handy and quick little walkthrough that can make you an AirPods pro the moment you read them. Advertisement Wrap Up The AirPods have been subject to a lot of delays, and were originally set to arrive in October. Different sources cited a bunch of reasons as to why the delay happened in the first place, but some pundits believe the problem rested in how the earphones handled multiple Bluetooth connections in order to keep audio in sync. Whatever the cause of delay might be, the earphones have finally gone up for order, with Apple giving buyers another chance next week if they are willing to take a walk to their nearest Apple Store.

You’ll Love These 3 Stocks The Motley Fool 6:22 PM 12/15/2016      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5381013 After watching numerous market meltdowns over the past few decades, many people are probably afraid to put their hard-earned cash into stocks. But by avoiding stocks completely, they would have missed out on some huge gains — the S&P 500 has rallied 61% over the past decade, 215% over the past 20 years, and 815% over the past 30. Image source: Getty Images. Therefore, risk averse investors should be picky with stocks, but completely dismissing them means that they’ll miss out on some big potential gains. There’s no such thing as a risk-free stock, but three well-known companies come close — AT&T (NYSE: T), IBM (NYSE: IBM), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). AT&T AT&T is the largest fixed telephone services provider, second largest wireless services provider, and third-largest home internet provider in the United States. Its acquisition of DirecTV last year made it the biggest pay TV provider in the country, and it could soon become one of the top media companies if its proposed acquisition of Time Warner (NYSE: TWX) is approved. That massive moat will help AT&T generate slow and steady growth for decades to come. AT&T faces near-term challenges, including regulatory scrutiny of the Time Warner deal, potential violations of net neutrality with its data-free video plans, and competition from smaller wireless rivals like T-Mobile. There are also concerns about its rising long-term debt levels, which triggered a downgrade of its senior unsecured notes last year. But as I discussed in a recent article, these headwinds will likely dissipate and AT&T will remain a dominant player in internet, wireless, pay TV, and streaming video services. It’s also a dividend aristocrat that has hiked its dividend annually for more than 30 years, and it currently pays a forward yield of 4.9%. Moreover, AT&T still trades at just 18 times earnings, which is much lower than the industry average of 25 for domestic telcos. IBM IBM might initially seem like a risky investment since its revenue has fallen year-over-year for 18 consecutive quarters. However, it looks as though the company’s turnaround plan is taking hold and shares have rallied more than 20% this year on optimism regarding its efforts. Those efforts center on investing heavily in five high growth “strategic imperatives” businesses (cloud, analytics, social, mobile, and security) to offset declines at its older hardware, software, and IT services businesses. Last quarter, IBM reported that revenue from those businesses rose 16% annually and accounted for 40% of its trailing 12-month revenues. It’s also been divesting less profitable businesses — like its x86 server and foundry units — a practice that has hurt its near-term sales growth but could generate better earnings growth in the future. The stock’s downside is also limited by two factors — its P/E ratio of 13, which is much lower than its industry average of 21; and its forward dividend yield of 3.4%. Big Blue has also hiked that payout annually for over two decades. IBM probably won’t take off until it generates top line growth again, but it’s still a decent low-risk, high-income play for conservative investors. Apple Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) might first appear risky due to its heavy dependence on the iPhone. While I believe that Apple’s high-growth days are probably over unless it can launch a new game-changing product, it still has plenty of cash — $20.5 billion in the U.S. and over $200 billion overseas — to expand inorganically. Image source: Apple. In a best case scenario, it may make some investments that will pay off and pave the way for a diversified future beyond iDevices. In a worst case scenario, Apple will simply become a mature, slow-growth tech company like IBM, which relies more on predictable buybacks and dividends to retain investors rather than flashy new products. That’s a good balance between risk and reward considering that Apple trades at just 14 times earnings, which is lower than its industry average of 17. Its forward yield of 2% is marginally lower than the S&P 500’s yield, but I previously noted that Apple can easily double its dividend without breaking a sweat — thanks to its low payout ratio of 26%. Should you buy AT&T, IBM, or Apple? AT&T, IBM, and Apple are less risky than many other tech and telecom plays on the market, but they’re still vulnerable to big market sell-offs. But for investors willing to ride out some short-term volatility, these three stocks are low-risk plays which will be around for decades to come. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Liberty requests 2-year 'rate freeze' in Apple Valley Thursday Dec 15, 2016 at 6:05 PM Dec 19, 2016 at 8:55 AM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — The largest water provider here has requested a one-year delay in filing its next general rate case, a move company officials say will eliminate rate increases for two years in the town. Liberty Utilities, Apple Valley’s current rates will increase nearly 5 percent on Jan. 1, but President Greg Sorensen said those base rates will effectively be locked in until Jan. 1, 2019, if the CPUC approves the company’s request. “During this period,” Sorensen said in a statement, “Liberty will make its mandated annual regulatory filings for a customer credit or surcharge, as the case may be, to ensure it collects only the 2017 authorized revenue levels approved by the CPUC.” Essentially, those filings determine whether a customer surcredit or surcharge is due based on the reconciliation of costs to deliver water and the revenue Liberty receives from customers. Liberty also requested to combine regulatory filings for its California water systems in southeast Los Angeles County and Apple Valley into one General Rate Case filing in 2018 for rates in 2019 through 2021, the statement shows. Combined filings can reduce regulatory costs, with savings passed on to customers, according to Sorensen, who said the request was made “to be more efficient and expand our customer outreach efforts.” In that vein, Sorensen added that the request provides an opportunity to engage residents “more deeply” about the operations and maintenance of, as well as investment in, the water system. “We want customers to have meaningful input regarding how Liberty maintains the water system to support current and future residents,” Sorensen said. “We also want to collaborate with community leaders to support economic development efforts by helping existing businesses and securing new investments that will create new Apple Valley jobs.” Town officials have repeatedly touted local control of the water system as a key driver behind the eminent domain action against Liberty insofar as it would allow residents to air any grievances locally rather than in writing to the CPUC’s Office of Ratepayer Advocates in San Francisco. Liberty’s request, then, is a move that could work to counter that argument as a show of bolstered customer outreach that Sorensen said is the right thing to do “to demonstrate our commitment, transparency and accountability.” Mayor Scott Nassif, however, didn’t agree. He said calling this “cheap PR stunt” a “rate freeze” is misleading. “There is nothing in the request to suggest that this has anything to do with protecting ratepayers in Apple Valley,” Nassif said. “A rate increase for 2017 has already been granted and the rate case they are talking about ‘delaying’ would be applied retroactively to 2018.” An Office of Ratepayer Advocates letter released Thursday opposed the request, which could decrease the likelihood of CPUC approval. In the letter, the ORA cited, among other reasons, a need to examine Liberty’s next general rate case “as soon as possible.” “Going forward, there is uncertainty regarding Liberty Apple Valley’s capital spending relative to the levels adopted by the Commission,” the letter stated. “... If Liberty Apple Valley’s capital spending remains at the same reduced level for 2017 this escalation increase could further exacerbate rates that are too high. “Given this recent decrease in capital spending in 2016, the Commission should require Liberty Apple Valley to move forward with its GRC on schedule beginning in January, 2017 to examine rates that will be effective January 1, 2018.” The ORA also expressed concern over the possibility of Liberty’s customers paying rates “associated with capital budgets that are not being spent on infrastructure” as a result of the requested delay. Nassif again: “In other words, Liberty has charged the ratepayers for capital improvements to the system, but they have collected the money and not spent it to improve the system.” In October, Liberty filed a motion in court for authorization to make improvements to its water system. Officials said Thursday that its decrease in capital spending is a result of not being able to make improvements amid the town's eminent domain action. In response to the letter, Liberty officials said they respect the ORA’s opposition, but added that the decision is ultimately made by the CPUC. The company expects a decision by the end of the year.

In a battle of the two most important companies in the world, this one wins by a hair. Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Dec 15, 2016 at 7:44PM Image source: Getty Images. Let's rewind back to September 1998. Steve Jobs had just rejoined the company he had founded two decades earlier: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Two 20-somethings named Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded a company they thought could help organize the world's information: Google -- which later became Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The former was worth just over $5 billion, while the latter was worth virtually nothing. Fast-forward not even two decades and they are arguably the two most powerful companies the world has ever known, with a combined market capitalization of almost $1.2 trillion! But which stock is a better buy at today's prices? There's no definitive way to answer that question. However, there are many different ways to approach it that will help you get more comfortable picking one of these two titans. Here are the three aspects that I consider to be most important. Financial fortitude Too much cash is a good problem to have. Over the long run, owning a company that has this kind of cash "problem" is very desirable. That's because when difficult times hit -- and they will hit -- companies that have cash have options. They can outspend their more cash-strapped rivals, buy back their own stock, or even make acquisitions. Companies that are debt-heavy, on the other hand, find themselves in the exact opposite boat: struggling just to make ends meet, exploring options to be bought out, or even succumbing to bankruptcy. Here's how Apple and Alphabet stack up in terms of financial fortitude. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Alphabet $78 billion $2 billion $19 billion $24 billion Apple $238 billion $75 billion $46 billion $53 billion Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Cash includes short and long-term investments as well. Net income and free cash flow are presented on trailing-12-month basis. It would be very difficult to find two companies that have stronger balance sheets. While it's clear that Apple's numbers are greater than Alphabet's -- even after accounting for the fact that Apple is valued 11% higher than Alphabet -- the point of this lens is to see if one company has substantially more flexibility due to its cash than another. Once we get to the point that these two companies are at, it's essentially a wash. Winner: Tie Sustainable competitive advantages Of these three factors, this is perhaps the most important. Commonly referred to as a "moat" in investing circles, a company's sustainable competitive advantages are often the special sauce that separate it from competitors. Some might be surprised to hear that I think Alphabet has a much stronger moat than Apple. Apple's moat is two-fold. First, it has a very powerful brand -- even more so abroad. That allows the company to charge more for its products than competitors. Second, the company has been building out an ecosystem that keeps users hooked in the system. For example, if your iPhone is synced with your Mac, your iPad, and your Apple TV, you'd be loath to switch to a different phone. But the major weakness here is that the company has traditionally relied on coming up with "the next big thing" to drive sales. The iPhone was arguably one of the biggest consumer hits ever, but it has been a long time since Apple has released a product that even comes close to touching the iPhone's popularity, and the competition is always clawing for market share. Alphabet, on the other hand, has the type of moat that famed investor Charlie Munger once said might be the widest he'd ever seen. That's because Google has a dominant search market share globally. But search is just one of seven Alphabet products that have over 1 billion users. The others are: Android, Chrome, Maps, Google Play Store, Gmail, and YouTube. Think about Alphabet's moat like this: With each additional user that gets in Google's ecosystem, the company collects copious amounts of data, all of which can be used to offer advertising that's more targeted than anywhere in the world. In the end, those ads are what pays the bills at Alphabet, and with the exception of Facebook, there isn't a company (or government) on earth that can come close to Alphabet's data trove. Winner: Alphabet Valuation Finally, we have valuation. This isn't an exact science, but here are four metrics I like to check when evaluating stocks. Company P/E Ratio P/FCF Ratio PEG Ratio Dividend Alphabet 24 24 1.3 0% Apple 14 12 1.5 2% Data sources: Yahoo! Finance and E*Trade. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings. Alphabet C shares used in calculations. While Alphabet appears to be slightly cheaper relative to its growth potential (PEG ratio), Apple is a better deal on every other metric. It's tough to find a company as successful as Apple that's trading for quite so cheap. And the fact that you get a 2% dividend -- which is both safe and has room for growth -- is the icing on the cake that makes Apple the winner of this round. Winner: Apple Final call: Draw Both companies are solid. Apple is the cheaper stock; Alphabet has a stronger moat. As a tie-breaker, I go where my own skin in the game is: I'd definitely side with Alphabet. The company represents 13% of my family's real-life holdings, while Apple clocks in at just under 4%.

The wireless earbuds went on sale online earlier this week, and will be available in Apple Stores starting Monday. It doesn’t look like Apple will be offering its extended AppleCare warranty on the AirPods, so it has laid out a simple pricing table for what repairs and replacements will cost. Battery service, for example is $49 in the 1-year warranty, $69 out. Here’s the full breakdown: Apple introduced the AirPods during its September iPhone event to much fanfare, thanks to their totally wireless design, W1 Bluetooth tech, and charging case. They cost $160 and are available online (with 6 week shipping) and soon in stores. Source: Apple Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend Apple says AirPods aren’t ready yet, pushes back release date Apple executives miss out on cash incentives as company falls short of sales goals Report: next iPhone to feature Tap to Wake and fast charging Apple removes New York Times apps from Chinese App Store Related Topics AirPods, Apple, Fix, News, Repair, Report M_Hawke Gee, aren’t you glad they did away with the mic jack? therealjjohnson Yes. Still. M_Hawke Well, I’m not. Having this 7 is a joy to use, except for the unexpected different hassles of not having that headphone jack and having it separate from the charging jack. Tommy Is anyone else’s App Store down? avardar same here Diego Milano Yep, same here, kind of. I checked the status page and apparently it hasn’t been updated. Diego Milano $160 is too much in my opinion; I think they should be between $99 and $129 or the like. Also, I am currently using some Jaybird for running and they don’t fall, so I wonder if these could be used for that type of activity. They look nice though (we already know Apple is proficient in terms of aesthetics). Docservlet Compared to Sennheiser, Jaybird, LG Tone etc, they are appropriately priced. John Yeah, cuz you’re only paying for the product and not the R&D or marketing or anything else that goes in to making these products. Diego Milano Well yeah, that’s a good point, that does raise the price for these little toys, no doubt. I think that -as usual- and just like many other brands, you’re just paying for that: branding. What to do… John But let’s be honest, if you were to ask me if I think Apple slaps a premium surcharge on to their devices just because they were Apple, I would absolutely agree but this is their first W1 device. Expect them to drop in price with technology improvements and with experience. Diego Milano I’ve never seen Apple dropping prices lately, in fact they’ve increased it (such as the latest iPhone series). What they do is when a newer iteration of the same device is released, they may (most likely won’t though) continue to sell both but the legacy one cheaper, but I do not believe this will happen anyway. Also, it would be nice if we could optionally somehow tie both pods together and be able to place a cord on the back of our necks as that would prevent accident drops (that is for those who run or do outdoor activities). Sleetui Can anyone confirm if they work on any other devices? Like laptops and androids etc? It “requires” iOS 10 I think for seamless connection. JohannASSburg It will also work with any bluetooth device as well Sleetui Thanks. Does Apple have anything on their site in regards for usage for other devices? Can’t seem to find any. Michael Bemelmans Doesn’t the touch play, pause and tapping mechanisme only work with iOS because of the W1 chip? Or am I wrong? John All the W1 chip does is asset with seamless changing better devices and quick pairing. There’s no play, pause, or other tapping controls besides Siri. JohannASSburg God I wish they were just tethered together, like the BeatsX sort of. They’d 10 hour battery life maybe inductive charging and a real remote ( but not in ear like the BeatsX) and still have the motion and sensor features! I’d pay more money for that!! Lol Amid Abdul The main point of this device is that theres no cable connecting the 2 earpice..:) Docservlet I’d prefer them to be wireless. LOL!

Of course, you’ll then be buried deep within Google’s own ecosystem, but making it easier to switch between the two (and back again) can only be a good thing for consumers. Apple has engineered everything so that once you enter into its ecosystem, you’re not getting out without a fight What It Would Take for This Apple Fan to Switch to Android What It Would Take for This Apple Fan to Switch to Android There's a reason I'm using an iPhone instead of an Android. Here's what could make me switch. Read More . This makes perfect sense from Apple’s perspective, ensuring a steady stream of income for years to come. However, it’s not so good for consumers who value choice above all else. Apple already has an app on Google Play called Move to iOS, which makes moving from Android to iOS exceedingly easy. And now Google has hit back by adding a “Backup” option to Google Drive. This Backup option is detailed on Google’s Switch to Android website. If you’re an iOS user it lets you back your important data up to Google Drive on iOS. This includes your contacts, calendar events, photos and videos. If you then ditch iOS and switch to Android instead, you can access all of that data by simply signing into your Google account. Not Perfect, But Better Than Nothing This isn’t a perfect solution by any stretch of the imagination. For starters, you’ll still lose your SMS text and iMessage messages, and your music collection. Google also warns that these backups can take several hours, so you’ll need to keep it plugged in and receiving a solid internet connection for the duration. However, regardless of its shortcomings this is surely still better than being locked into an ecosystem long after you’ve grown tired of it.

Everyone tells you the iPad is the best tablet, and it really is the best; but you should still buy an Android tablet. Read More should welcome Google’s new effort. Just as they should welcome Apple’s own Move to iOS Android app. Because it’s only when switching between Android and iOS is as simple and seamless as it can possibly be that we will all win. And by “we” I mean consumers, who are the people that actually matter. Have you ever switched from iOS to Android or vice versa? How did you manage it? Were you able to move your data from one to the other? Or did you lose something in the process? What do you think of Google’s new solution? Please let us know in the comments below!

I love MacOS. I wanted to try a new phone and I really like the new Google Pixel! It took a little time to learn some of the differences. I like that the the play store has iTunes and I can play all of my music. I like that Google offers unlimited space with photos. I do however miss iMessage and Fantastical. Any good alternatives? Reply John December 16, 2016 at 2:17 pm I have 4 Apple computers running in my house. My first smart phone was an iphone. I switched to Android years ago because with the Samsung products I could add memory and change battery myself. Now using LG- G4 with 128gig memory card. Have 69 gigs of music in my phone. Am happy! Reply casey December 16, 2016 at 7:05 am Managed to switched from iOS to Android. One of the biggest problem is that iTunes music can't play on any other non-Apple product. I have done a lot of homework to fix this problem. Since Apple music are protected by DRM, so you would need a third party Apple Music Converter to convert the protected audio files to MP3. I am glad that I didn't lose my iTunes music in the process or I would be so disappointed. Reply Raphael December 16, 2016 at 8:13 am Welcome to Android and glad it worked out!

Here’s how much a replacement will cost you Lose an Apple AirPods bud? Here’s how much a replacement will cost you By Michelle Fitzsimmons Mobile phones   Nearly half the price of a full set Shares Apple AirPods are finally for sale! The in-ear buds ship ... at some point, but they're actually shipping! And now we know how much you'll pay to replace a lost one, an event that seems all but certain considering Apple's latest headphones have no wire.  As outlined on the Apple iPhone service pricing page and first spotted by Apple Insider, replacing a lost AirPod costs $69 in the US.  That's not quite half the full Apple AirPods price of $159 (£159.99, AU$229), but it's pretty darn close. Update: A replacement AirPod will cost £65 in the UK, according to the recently updated Apple UK service pricing page. In Australia, a replacement bud costs AU$99, notes the country's service page. Best Christmas gifts for audiophiles 2016 Break pods As for general repairs, Apple AirPods are covered under a one-year warranty, which takes care of defective batteries but not normal wear and tear.  Apple will replace batteries that lose capacity over time for $49/£45/AU$69 per AirPod, and other out-of-warranty repairs cost $69/£65/AU$99.  When it comes to the equally easily losable AirPods charging case, its repair and replacement prices line up with the buds: $49/£45/AU$69 for battery service, $69/£65/AU$99 for out-of-warranty repairs and $69/£65/AU$99 to replace a misplaced case.

You'll Love These 3 Stocks AT&T, IBM, and Apple are attractive long-term plays for risk averse investors. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Dec 15, 2016 at 6:22PM After watching numerous market meltdowns over the past few decades, many people are probably afraid to put their hard-earned cash into stocks. But by avoiding stocks completely, they would have missed out on some huge gains -- the S&P 500 has rallied 61% over the past decade, 215% over the past 20 years, and 815% over the past 30. Image source: Getty Images. Therefore, risk averse investors should be picky with stocks, but completely dismissing them means that they'll miss out on some big potential gains. There's no such thing as a risk-free stock, but three well-known companies come close -- AT&T (NYSE:T), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). AT&T AT&T is the largest fixed telephone services provider, second largest wireless services provider, and third-largest home internet provider in the United States. Its acquisition of DirecTV last year made it the biggest pay TV provider in the country, and it could soon become one of the top media companies if its proposed acquisition of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) is approved. That massive moat will help AT&T generate slow and steady growth for decades to come. AT&T faces near-term challenges, including regulatory scrutiny of the Time Warner deal, potential violations of net neutrality with its data-free video plans, and competition from smaller wireless rivals like T-Mobile. There are also concerns about its rising long-term debt levels, which triggered a downgrade of its senior unsecured notes last year. But as I discussed in a recent article, these headwinds will likely dissipate and AT&T will remain a dominant player in internet, wireless, pay TV, and streaming video services. It's also a dividend aristocrat that has hiked its dividend annually for more than 30 years, and it currently pays a forward yield of 4.9%. Moreover, AT&T still trades at just 18 times earnings, which is much lower than the industry average of 25 for domestic telcos. IBM IBM might initially seem like a risky investment since its revenue has fallen year-over-year for 18 consecutive quarters. However, it looks as though the company's turnaround plan is taking hold and shares have rallied more than 20% this year on optimism regarding its efforts. Those efforts center on investing heavily in five high growth "strategic imperatives" businesses (cloud, analytics, social, mobile, and security) to offset declines at its older hardware, software, and IT services businesses. Last quarter, IBM reported that revenue from those businesses rose 16% annually and accounted for 40% of its trailing 12-month revenues. It's also been divesting less profitable businesses -- like its x86 server and foundry units -- a practice that has hurt its near-term sales growth but could generate better earnings growth in the future. The stock's downside is also limited by two factors -- its P/E ratio of 13, which is much lower than its industry average of 21; and its forward dividend yield of 3.4%. Big Blue has also hiked that payout annually for over two decades. IBM probably won't take off until it generates top line growth again, but it's still a decent low-risk, high-income play for conservative investors.  Apple Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) might first appear risky due to its heavy dependence on the iPhone. While I believe that Apple's high-growth days are probably over unless it can launch a new game-changing product, it still has plenty of cash -- $20.5 billion in the U.S. and over $200 billion overseas -- to expand inorganically. Image source: Apple. In a best case scenario, it may make some investments that will pay off and pave the way for a diversified future beyond iDevices. In a worst case scenario, Apple will simply become a mature, slow-growth tech company like IBM, which relies more on predictable buybacks and dividends to retain investors rather than flashy new products. That's a good balance between risk and reward considering that Apple trades at just 14 times earnings, which is lower than its industry average of 17. Its forward yield of 2% is marginally lower than the S&P 500's yield, but I previously noted that Apple can easily double its dividend without breaking a sweat -- thanks to its low payout ratio of 26%. Should you buy AT&T, IBM, or Apple? AT&T, IBM, and Apple are less risky than many other tech and telecom plays on the market, but they're still vulnerable to big market sell-offs. But for investors willing to ride out some short-term volatility, these three stocks are low-risk plays which will be around for decades to come. Leo Sun owns shares of AT and T.

According to a handful of customers who placed their order early on Tuesday morning, Apple has started charging the credit cards of customers who ordered AirPods. While orders have yet to start shipping, users beginning to be charged suggests that shipments will begin sooner rather than later. The earliest arrival date for AirPods ordered on Tuesday morning is Monday, December 19th. It appears that select customers outside the United States were the ones lucky enough to receive that date. In the United States, early customers received an arrival date of Wednesday, December 21st. So far, customers who have been charged appear to have ordered as soon as AirPods went live on Apple’s website earlier this week. As time progresses, those who ordered later will begin to see charges on their credit cards. While this is purely speculation, it’s possible that Apple will get AirPods to customers a bit earlier than the arrival listed upon ordering. Given that cards are being charged now and Apple Stores will start receiving AirPods stock on Monday, those with December 21st arrival dates may very well see their order arrive before then, perhaps on December 19th. As of right now, it doesn’t appear that any AirPods orders have actually shipped yet, but Apple beginning to charge buyers suggests that shipping will be occurring at some point in the near future. AirPods were available with a reasonable shipping window for about 1 hour on Tuesday morning. After that, shipping times began to slip very quickly and currently sit at 6 weeks in the United States. If you missed out, Apple Stores are expected to start selling AirPods in stores on Monday, December 19th. Have you been charged for your AirPods order yet? Let us know in the comments.

Tech News Downloads Software Store Search for: BetaNews Hot Topics: Windows 10 Microsoft Apple Cloud Tablets Android Security Reviews Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Linked-in RSS I chose MacBook Pro with Touch Bar over Surface Book By Joe Wilcox Published 3 weeks ago 69 Comments Tweet Water smacked the windshield -- a torrent of heavy droplets -- as my wife struggled to feed money into the tollbooth machine. Pelting rain is uncommon during November in San Diego, but we had purpose for driving 36 km through the downpour to Chula Vista and the Otay Ranch Apple Store, where I had never been before. The shop was the only one around that had the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar in stock. Eleven days earlier, Nov. 15, 2016, I received the 13.3-inch model that was ordered on October 27th. While first impressions were wow, the laptop felt slow compared to my previous MBP, and the battery drained in about half the time as specs stated. I worried that Apple produced a defective unit. No store in the area had the smaller laptop in stock, should I want to take advantage of the 14-day return policy. Deadline approached, so I considered as alternative my first 15-incher in more than a decade, tempted in part by quad-core processor and discreet graphics. If Not One, The Other Fast-forward to the present, briefly: In recent days I've seen some stories about shorter-than-expected MBP battery life; customers complain. Hardware is suspected (when isn't it in click-bait news stories). Following a fresh macOS Sierra install on the 13.3-inch laptop and transferring my wife's settings and software from an older MBP, battery life is workday-long-plus. Perhaps the computer had bad factory-installed image or, more likely, despite my sleuthing around for a culprit, something in my setup sucked CPU cycles and energy. (I did investigate!) So if your new MacBook Pro burns the candle quick, check the wick! Returning to weltering November 26th, I stood over the larger MacBook Pro, in awe and despair. The thing felt fast -- almost mind-reading AI-fashion, anticipating keystrokes before I made them. But the screen was huge. Even 13.3 inches is larger than my preference; gimme a laptop that's easily grab-and-go. But the longer time I spent touching and adjusting, perhaps 45 minutes, the more comfortable the laptop became. Decision: Understanding that the computer could be returned within 14 days and recognizing replacement MBP 13 order wouldn't ship, according to Apple Store online, for 4 weeks or more, I made the purchase. My initial angst dissipated within hours after returning home and setting up MBP 15. I have no regrets. Size Matters The 13.3-inch MacBook Pro I had ordered from Apple Store online was a custom config: 2.9GHz Core i5 processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. The laptop replaced my early 2015 model, with 3.1GHz Core i7 chip, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD. My college student daughter accepted the hand-me-down, replacing her somewhat banged and scratched 2013 Apple laptop, with 2.6GHz Core i5 processor, 8GB memory, 256GB SSD. I was surprised how the newer laptop seemed slower than the old. Granted, the comparison was i5 and i7, but also different generation Intel processors. If not MBP 15, I was ready to return the 13.3-incher for refund. Considering how much I had already spent on the 13.3-inch MacBook Pro, a few extra hundred for a lot more computer wasn't a mental (or budgetary) stretch. But I would never spend so much without first experiencing the thing. Understanding: I would return the smaller notebook for refund. Hence, the rainy road trip. Config: 2.7GHz Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, 2GB Radeon Pro 455 graphics, 512GB SSD. The CPU is quad-core, and the difference is quite noticeable compared to MBP 13's dual-core processor. This beauty is a multi-tasking maven like nothing groped by my grubby paws. This also marks the most money I have spent on a laptop. Ever. The custom-configured 13-incher totaled $2,199,  and the larger $2,799. Why MBP? By now you must wonder: "Why?" Well, it ain't for the Touch Bar, which isn't as useless as I expected. The brighter (500-nit), more color accurate screen checks one box.  More significantly, I've pined for Apple's butterfly keyboard since its debut on the 12-inch MacBook, which is way, way underpowered for my daily computing requirements. MBP 15 doesn't disappoint. Typing experience on the second-generation butterfly is absolutely fantastic. While the keys are noisy, they deliver great feel and responsiveness. But in choosing to spend so much more, I also opted for other benefits: greater default, native screen resolution (2880 by 1800); quad-core processor; discreet graphics; and expansive, capable touchpad, among them. Features are meaningless without benefits, and I have some in mind. In late October, I fully returned to work after a forced summer sabbatical related to eye surgery that lets me wear glasses to read but frees me from them for distance. I’m ready to write, write, write, and MacBook Pro with Touch Bar feels -- figuratively -- like the tool to do just that. I am doing more photography and video production, and producing a podcast. I need a laptop that can keep up with several projects open and ongoing simultaneously, without stutters and stops that interrupt my workflow and more importantly disrupt my attention. I'm an older writer now, and interruption can leave a crater where my creative flow was. The bigger screen, and even physical size, better suit my needs than the 13.3-incher. How strange; I thank Apple's supply shortages for putting me in position to challenge my preconceptions and go larger when the market trend is smaller laptops. The other mental barrier: Cost, as I couldn't have ever proactively conceived spending so much on a laptop -- and, honestly, wouldn't if not for bent-up desire to produce content following the summer sabbatical. I feel happy typing on the new MBP, for its dazzling beauty and also for how the Touch Bar contextually changes depending on application or what I’m doing. (You’ll have to wait for my full review for more on the feature.) Joy is a benefit often overlooked by high-tech product designers. Scratching the Surface Surely other laptops could do as much for the same cost, or even less. Yup, I seriously considered Surface Book, about which Microsoft's Brian Hall raved two days ago: "The innovation of Surface coupled with the disappointment of the new MacBook Pro -- especially among professionals -- is leading more and more people to make the switch to Surface". He then linked to PC Mag story "Why I Left macOS for a Surface Book", which begins "The Mac is in trouble". Sascha Segan's experience with the butterfly keyboard differs from mine: "I just couldn't get with the super-flat keyboards. I pound out words all day, and getting rid of almost all the throw on the keys was pretty much a deal breaker". As I writer, I understand the sentiment but, as previously mentioned, have much different experience than does the PC Mag analyst. There is much to like about Surface Book, which I see as the only meaningful competitor to either size MacBook Pro. The design is delightful eye candy, and the 3:2 screen ratio is much better suited to writing and researching content in a web browser (MBP is 16:10). Maximum resolution of the gorgeous 13.5-inch screen, which is fully touch-capable: 3000 by 2000 (MBP 13 is 2560 by 1600 and 2880 by 1800 for the larger). Touch is a bonus if you need it, then there is the stylus. I'm a terrible artist and handwriter. I started using a typewriter at age 14 -- during the mid-1970s -- because my penmanship is so terrible. As such, the stylus has little appeal, while the touchscreen is a nice-to-have that I learned from using Chromebook Pixel and other Windows laptops isn't a necessity. For me. As a middle-aged typist writer, keyboard matters much, and the MBP Touch Bar promises to expand what my fingers can do across the plane where they are constantly active. If I were another person, with different priorities and (artistic) capabilities, Surface Book might be the thing. Apple offers one port-type on new MacBook Pros: USB Type-C (aka Thunderbolt 3), whereas Microsoft serves up the smorgasbord of connection options most people will want. Sixth-generation Intel Core chips are standard from both companies. Cost Comparisons Surface Book pricing is similar or close between comparable configurations for either size MBP. That is when I purchased either. Microsoft is sale crazy during the holidays (don't ever expect deals from Apple). For example: $1999 for MBP 13 or SB with Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD. Of course, Microsoft serves up stylus and touchscreen instead of Apple's tiny Touch Bar -- and the display converts into a tablet (that is too large for my tastes). With i7 chip and double the RAM: $2,499 for the Apple and $2,699 for the Microsoft, but currently discounted to $2,299. While screen sizes mis-match, here's Surface Book with Performance Base compared to MBP 15: Core i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD -- both for $2,799. SB has touchscreen and stylus, but the MacBook Pro packs quad-core processor. For my needs, speed, professional graphics, and bigger screen matter more. And something else that strangely is the opposite of Sascha Segan's deal-breaker: I find typing on the Surface Book keyboard troubling in manner similar to his complaints about MacBook Pro's butterfly; there's too much travel. Ha! Hey, this is why companies can compete: Different priorities and tastes among potential users. Fanboys, don't get into a pissing match about which is better. Because both matter right now, and Microsoft gets good bang from the competition between them. Earlier today I asked Stephen Baker, NPD vice president and primary hardware analyst, about MacBook Pro and Surface Book sales. They are "key parts of the turnaround in the consumer PC market in terms of pointing it in a more premium direction", he says. "While they aren’t the share leaders, the advertising being spent and the marketing have helped lift all the Windows boats—and it of course hasn’t hurt that all the Windows brands have stepped up their premium product development". Wrapping up, the best laptop is the one with the benefits that matter most to you. That's how I came to choose 15.4-inch MacBook Pro -- and love it. Hehe. Who knows, maybe in an alternate universe, heavy rains led my wife and I to drive to closer-distance Fashion Valley Mall, where there is Microsoft Store, inside which an irresistible Surface Book offer hypnotized me.

Featured Story: 5 Things You Didn't Know Your iPhone's Home Button Could Do iOS Gadget Hacks: Unchaining iPhone & iPad to get tomorrow's features today — WonderHowTo News: iOS 10.2 Update for iPhone Snuck Star Ratings Back into the Music App Justin Meyers 3 weeks ago iOS 10.2 Update for iPhone Snuck Star Ratings Back into the Music App When Apple released the iOS 10.2 update to the public on December 12, 2016, iPhone users got a slew of new features, including new emojis, a brand new TV app, the ability to save camera settings, and more. But out of all of these new features, the one that interests me the most is something they didn't even include in the release notes—star ratings are back in the Music app! I was highly doubtful that star ratings would ever return to the iPhone, since Apple had been making small strides in weaning us off them ever since iOS 8.4 in favor of the love/dislike option that's better suited for the Apple Music subscription service. In the end, it probably only made its way back due to user complaints (mine included), and there's no guarantee it will stick around. But to get this comeback feature up and running right now, make sure you've updated to iOS 10.2, then head to the "Music" option in your Settings app and make sure Show Star Ratings is toggled on. To rate songs with stars, just pull up the Now Playing screen in the Music app, then hit "Rate Song" and give it your 1-5 rating. It's not quite as easy as tapping on the album cover as in previous iOS versions, but I'm happy enough with it. While you still can't rate songs from the Control Center or the lock screen player like you could in the past, it's good enough for now. Plus, you can still do any of the workarounds for rating stars that were needed before this iOS 10.2 update came out, like using Siri to rate songs with stars.

If you didn’t place an order right away, though, you’ll probably have to wait weeks for your AirPods to be delivered. If you don’t feel like waiting that long, you could try hitting up an Apple Store next week. Apple will begin selling AirPods in its retail stores the morning of next Monday, December 19. That’s according to a retail source speaking to MacRumors. Apple previously said that it’ll begin selling AirPods in Apple Stores, Apple Authorized Retailers, and select carriers next week, but there’s been no official announcement about which day the AirPods will hit stores. AirPods cost $159 for a pair. The totally wireless earbuds can quickly and easily pair with an iOS device, but because they work over Bluetooth, they can also be used with non-Apple devices, they’ll just be without the fancy Siri integration and quick connections.

The announcement that Silicon Valley executives Elon Musk and Travis Kalanick will advise Donald Trump as part of his Strategic and Policy Forum came the same day as a genial meeting between tech industry leaders and the president-elect.  Monitor's Best: Top 5 The obvious Obamacare problem no one's talking about Behind Facebook Live attack, unseen scourge of crime against disabled Why 'Father of the 401(k)' says he regrets pushing the retirement plan Despite hard times for Macy’s and Sears, physical retail stores are booming Passcode Why doubts still cloud Russian hacking allegations Popular Now Inhabit What really happened during the supposed climate change 'hiatus'?

Andrew Kelly/Reuters | Caption Gretel Kauffman @gretelkauffman December 15, 2016 —All things considered, Donald Trump's meeting with tech industry leaders could have gone much worse.  The president-elect and a number of high-profile Silicon Valley executives – including Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, and Apple's Tim Cook – convened at Trump Tower on Wednesday for a genial gathering, during which Mr. Trump referred to his guests as "amazing" people and reminded them that he was "here to help you folks do well." The meeting, described by one technology reporter as a "watershed moment" for the tech industry, came hours after an announcement that Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick, both outspoken critics of Trump during his campaign, would be taking on strategic adviser positions as part of the president-elect's Strategic and Policy Forum.  To industry observers, Wednesday's developments marked a distinct shift in tone for the relationship between Trump and an industry that overwhelmingly supported his rival, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, for president. And while it's still too early to tell what that relationship will look like over the next four years, they see potential for cooperation following a heated campaign during which the president-elect openly feuded with some of the very executives who gathered at Trump Tower this week.  "Certainly the tone has changed dramatically on both sides," says Larry Downes, project director at the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy, in a phone interview with The Christian Science Monitor. "I think it is significant. We're starting to see this shift from Trump as candidate to Trump as senior administrator."  While significant, Mr. Downes says he didn't find the tone of the meeting particularly surprising, as "there have been a lot of signs" since the election "that at least when it came to tech, Trump was going to move closer to what you might consider a more traditional Republican view" that would be welcome to industry leaders: "A traditional Republican administration wouldn't want to interfere with new technologies and would want to let innovation happen in a largely unregulated form ... and that has been the preference of Silicon Valley all along."  Foreign companies that beat Silicon Valley at its own game Both Downes and Aaron Ginn, co-founder of the Lincoln Network, an initiative that aims to bridge the gap between Silicon Valley and the government, view the shift in tone as a practical acceptance by both Trump and the tech industry that, like it or not, they'll need to work together to achieve their goals.  "This is Silicon Valley coming to the realization that, OK, he's going to be president for the next four years ... so we need to be practical and do the duty of our country," Mr. Ginn tells the Monitor in a phone interview.  On the other side, Downes says, "I think if not Trump, then at least his senior advisers, understand that ... if you’re going to get anything done in the next four years you’re going to rely on a strong tech economy. He can’t really afford to have the whole Silicon Valley hostile to him, and vice versa."  Wednesday's meeting was arranged by Peter Thiel, the PayPal co-founder and now-Trump adviser who was ostracized by some in the tech industry for supporting the Republican candidate throughout his campaign. Now, as Trump prepares to take his place in the White House, Mr. Thiel could be a key player in bridging the divide between the president and Silicon Valley. His presence on the Trump transition team alone is a "pretty major step for the influence of the tech community" under the Trump administration, Ginn says.  The next four years could also mark a difference in the culture of socially liberal Silicon Valley – a change that some say has already begun to take place. The backlash against Thiel after he came out as a Trump supporter sparked renewed debate over ideological diversity in the tech industry even before Trump was elected, as Zhai Yun Tan reported for the Monitor in September:  In recent elections, some of the most high-profile Silicon Valley executives have been publicly donating to Democratic candidates. Republican employees in the tech sector, however, have been reported to hide their identities and views for fear of judgment. Tensions may be particularly acute this year as the Republican presidential candidate has attacked tech giants – Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg, and Apple CEO Tim Cook – for their position on policy issues ranging from privacy to immigration. But after PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel’s high-profile endorsement of Mr. Trump and Facebook’s outreach to Republican groups after allegations of bias in excluding conservative news sites in its trending topics, more scrutiny is being placed on what some call Silicon Valley’s lack of ideological diversity. As of September, Justin Danhof, general counsel for the conservative political foundation National Center for Public Policy Research, told the Monitor he didn't feel the increased attention had translated into actual political diversity in Silicon Valley.  "I think it’s more just a recognition," Mr. Danhof said at the time. "There is more light being shed on the fact that they are liberal and unwelcoming to conservatives but I think the light hasn’t done anything. In fact, there has been more impunity."  But Ginn says that, since Trump's election, he's begun to see signs of a changing tech culture, such as Trump supporters wearing "Make America Great Again" hats at work and conservatives growing "much more vocal" about their views.  Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Sign-Up × Still, he notes, it'll take concrete action, not just complimentary words, for the president-elect to earn the full respect of the tech industry going forward.  "It's a good gesture for both the camps to meet, but to really win over a lot of the hearts and minds of people in the Valley you need to implement some good policies and actually take the advice that Travis and Elon are giving and implement these changes," Ginn says. "It’s a steep hill to climb. It's not insurmountable, but it's going to be a heavy lift."  Next Up Foreign companies that beat Silicon Valley at its own game By Karis Hustad Trump tells anxious tech leaders: 'We're here to help' By Jonathan Lemire and Michael Liedtke First Look True menace or 'straw man'?

Club MacStoriesWeekly Extras MENU ABOUT CONTACT NEWSLETTER ADVERTISE SECTIONS APP REVIEWS LINKED STORIES iOS 10 WWDC 2016 3D Touch for Power Users My Favorite iMessage Apps and Sticker Packs of 2016 My Must-Have iOS Apps & Web Services, 2016 Edition The Businesses Apple Has Left Behind By Stephen Hackett This year, Apple has exited the external display business and is rumored to be discontinuing its AirPort wireless routers. These developments have left a bad taste in many users' mouths, but 2016 isn't the first time Apple has shuttered an entire product line. By my count, there are five major categories of products or devices that Apple has abandoned over the years. Digital Cameras In 1994, Apple launched one of the first consumer digital cameras, the QuickTake 100. The sandwich-shaped camera could store eight photos at 640×480 resolution. It had no focus or zoom controls, but did include a flash. The camera had to be hooked up to a computer to view, import or delete files. The QuickTake line would evolve quickly. The 150 came with a snap-on lens that would allow for closer focus. The 200 — in a more traditional body —  added controls for both focus and aperture and could store images using a removable media card. The QuickTake 100 Like many Apple hardware accessories from this time, they were developed in conjunction with other companies. In this case, Kodak developed the 100 and 150, with Fujifilm building the 200. The QuickTakes never sold well. While Apple may have been one of the first companies to market, once mainstream camera companies joined the party, sales continued to fall. The QuickTake project was ended in the Great Product Bloodbath that took place when Steve Jobs returned at the very end of 1996. Printers Apple's printer business started four years before the original Macintosh made its debut in 1984. That first printer — the Silentype — brought 80-column thermal printer to the Apple II and Apple III. The ImageWriter came along in 1984, bringing its dot-matrix goodness to Macintosh users who had $675 to burn. The next year, Apple released the LaserWriter, the company's first network printer. The ImageWriter dot matrix and LaserWriter printers spun off several subsequent models each, until Apple had a robust line of personal and professional printers spanning numerous models. The LaserWriter Pro image via The Computer History Museum In 1990, the StyleWriter black and white ink jet printer replaced the ImageWriters. In 1993, Apple added a color ink jet printer to its line. By the mid 1990s, the company was offering all sorts of options to its customers. Steve Jobs killed them all off in 1998. Scanners In 1988, the Apple Scanner was released. It was a 16 level grayscale, 300 dpi flatbed scanner that attached to any Mac with a SCSI port. It was short-lived product, replaced by the Apple OneScanner just three years later. Apple OneScanner image via Stephen Edmonds The OneScanner offered 256 levels of grey, with 1995's OneScanner adding color support. Later models picked up goodies like automatic document feeders and support for higher resolutions. The OneScanner line was discontinued in 1997 by You Know Who. External Speakers Over the years, Apple has stated that music is at the heart of what the company does. While that's meant things like the iPod or Apple Music, Apple has released several sets of external speakers over the years. The first was back in the early and mid 1990s. The AppleDesign Speakers initially came in Platinum to match the Mac line of the time, while the second generation came in gray to match the PowerBooks and the ill-fated PowerCD music player. In January 2001, Apple shipped the Apple Pro Speakers. These speakers were built in partnership with Harman/Kardon. The speakers and electronics are encased in clear acyclic globes with flat bottoms to prevent them from rolling away. The speakers were part of many Power Mac, Cube and iMac G4 setups. As Apple transitioned to G5-powered systems, the speakers quietly went away. iPod HiFi The last stand-alone speaker product Apple shipped 2006's iPod Hi-Fi. The iPod-powered home stereo product included two 80mm speaker cones and a 130mm subwoofer. It retailed for $349 and was on sale for just a year and a half. External Storage Devices Apple's first external storage product was the ProFile drive. With support for the Lisa, Apple IIe and Apple III, the drive was 5 MB and cost $3,499 when introduced in 1981. In the late 80s, Apple introduced an 20 MB external hard disk with the Macintosh 512K and then a series of drives ranging from 20 to 80 MB. By 1989, these products were gone, and Apple didn't sell anything else noteworthy in this category until 2003 when it introduced the Xserve RAID: With prices ranging from from $5,999 - $10,999, the Xserve RAID was designed for enterprise customers who needed rack-mountable storage attached to their Xserves over fiber for high-speed data access. While the Xserve would last until January 2011, the Xserve RAID was taken off the market in 2008. Now what? When Jobs came back to Apple, many products met their demise as he forced Apple to focus on just a few products. That drive led to the greatest turn-around in this history of technology companies. Today, Apple is bigger then ever, both in terms of headcount and in cash on hand. Are things like the Thunderbolt Display and Time Capsule going away to help the company focus, or are they merely victims caught in the Post-PC crossfire? Will ditching these products result in the same gains as killing off printers and scanners and cameras once did? Beats me. Here's hoping they haven't died in vain.

Here are some new products that can turn any remote office into a productivity zone. Apple MacBook Pro (starting at $1,899) The fanciest thing about the new MacBook Pro from Apple (above) is the Touch Bar, a multitouch OLED strip across the top of the keyboard that replaces the function keys. While it might seem like it’s just a gimmick, the contextual controls—insert, delete, and spell-check buttons when you’re in a word-processing program, for example—really do make a difference when it comes to productivity. The new laptop is also the thinnest, lightest, most powerful laptop Apple has ever created, with a brighter and more efficient display. It’s available in 13-inch and 15-inch models. HP DeskJet printer ($90) Many of us are finding we need printers less and less these days. But when you need a printer, you really need one. The HP DeskJet 3758 is great to have on hand because it’s got a small footprint, so it won’t take up much space—and it’s wireless, so you can have it stashed out of the way. Despite the size, it can do everything you need a printer to do, including print documents and photos and copy and scan documents. Varidesk Pro Plus 36 ($590) The standing-desk trend came about as a result of research indicating that the amount of sitting we do is harmful to our health (that’s where the phrase “sitting is the new smoking” came from). But you don’t have to spend thousands on something new because Varidesk transforms your existing desk into a standing one. The top surface is big enough for two 24-inch monitors, and a lower tier provides space for a keyboard and mouse. Available in black or white, you can move from sitting to standing in seconds, clicking into the position that is ideal for your height. Leef iBridge3 ($80 to $230) These days, our smartphones have plenty of storage space on them. Until they don’t. The iBridge3 connects to your iPhone or iPad and adds between 16 and 128 GB of storage space for those photos and videos you’re taking while on holiday. You can even configure the iBridge3 to work with your Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, and iCloud accounts. Leef also has a microSD Reader for iPhones and iPads ($70) that makes it easy to transfer files from other devices. OWC USB and Thunderbolt 2 docks (US$149 and US$218)     One of the ways that laptops can constantly become thinner and lighter is by removing the ports to which you’d normally connect peripherals. At the same time, we’ve got more things we want to plug into our machines: external disk drives, mobile devices, and multiple monitors. That’s where these docks come in. The USB-C Dock from OWC adds 10 ports to your system, including two USB-C connections and ports for secondary monitors (also for those that display in 4K resolution). The Thunderbolt 2 Dock, meanwhile, has a total of 12 ports to expand the possibilities of your Mac: two Thunderbolt 2 ports, multiple display connections, one FireWire 800, one gigabit ethernet, and five USB 3.0 ports. Archer C3150 router ($288) The beauty of MU-MIMO technology is that it can take one Internet connection and make it available to a number of different devices at the same time. The “MU” stands for “multi-user”, and routers like the Archer C3150 are different from the previous generation of routers that could only send out one Wi-Fi signal at a time. The Archer also ensures that it is using the signal band that is best for the device it’s communicating with. It’s easy to set up and has built-in parental controls, too. Whoosh screen wipes (products starting at $15) These wipes come from a Toronto company and are designed to clean the many screens in your life. From smartphones and tablets to laptop screens and computer monitors, these wipes will not only remove fingerprints but disinfect at the same time. The company also creates screen-cleaning solution and antimicrobial cloths. Star Wars Force Band ($100, $250 with a BB-8) Anyone who works from home knows how lonely it can get. That's why so many of them got a Sphere BB-8 droid for Christmas last year. This year, you can get them a Force Band, which provides wearers with the power to control a BB-8 with a wave of the hand. Before you know it, you’ll be able to send BB-8 to fetch coffee. Philips goLite Blu energy lite ($200) Coffee and chocolate are good pick-me-ups to get over those afternoon slumps, but you can also use the goLite Blu to energize with a dose of light that simulates bright daylight. It’s got a rechargeable battery so you can use it wherever you need it. And although the light is bright, it is also diffuse so you don’t have to worry about eyes aching from the glare. The LED light is UV-free, too.

Not only will it mark the iPhone?s 10th anniversary, it is also believed that the phone will include massive design improvements. So far, news about display and the body have circulated all over the internet. Now, it is also believed that the iPhone 8 will also sport a wireless charging feature. A startup company, Energous, who specializes in long range wireless charging has made a deal with chip supplier Dialog. Dialog is also a known semiconductor supplier for Apple and has supplied parts for various Apple products in the past. Because of the partnership, it is now believed that Apple will use Energous? wireless charging technology on the iPhone 8. READ ALSO: Apple iPhone 7s News, Rumors: iPhone 7s to Feature Less Than 1mm Bezel LCD Display? According to Energous? CEO Steve Rizzone, Dialog has invested around $10 million into his company as part of the deal. This deal will give Dialog sole access to all of Energous? technology. Dialog will also be Energous? exclusive supplier on all its components. Meanwhile, Energous is granted access to all of Dialog?s sales and distribution channel. Apple iPhone 7 Plus Jet Black (via apple.com) Last March 2015, Energous teased the public about its supposed development agreement with Apple. The Cupertino company, at that time, was investigating the possibility of wireless charging on the iPhone. According to Energous, Apple is looking for something that will surpass technology from other companies like Samsung. READ ALSO: OnePlus 4 Leaks, Specs & Release Date News & Updates To those who might not know it, Apple is Dialog?s ?biggest client so far. In fact, more than three quarter of its revenue came from orders emanating from Apple and its subsidiaries. The deal between Dialog and Energous sparked rumors that Apple will use its technology on the next iPhone. This is mainly due to the close connection between Apple and Dialog. However, it is still unclear whether Apple will indeed use Energous long range wireless charging on the iPhone 8. That being said, with Apple being what it is, it could be working on its own version of wireless charging. The truth of the matter is, the company already hired two design experts from the company uBeam. uBeam offers the same wireless charging capability like Energous.

Follow TechnoBuffalo A jury in the US District Court for the Northern District of California recently ruled against Apple in favor of Core Wireless, agreeing with Core Wireless’ assertion that Apple infringed on two smartphone patents. Core Wireless is a subsidiary of Conversation Intellectual Property Management, a firm that also recently won a suit against LG. “We are very pleased with the verdict,”Conversant CEO John Lindgren said. “We appreciate the efforts of the court and the jury. This confirms the strength of the Core Wireless portfolio, especially following our success against LG earlier this year in two cases in the Eastern District of Texas.” The patents involved inventions for improving smartphone battery life (guess it didn’t work that well) and boosting signal quality. Conversant said many of Apple’s iPhones, ranging back to the iPhone 3G, and all of its iPads, infringed on the patents. Apple was ordered to pay $7.3 million in damages. Patent trolls One of the problems with these companies, like Conversant Intellectual Property Management, is that they often own patents but don’t actually put them to use building products. Sometimes they’ll buy patents knowing they can then go after a company that uses the tech. A company like LG or Apple, for example, might actually already have a product on the market that infringes on the patent. Eventually, Apple or LG or any other firm ends up in the courtroom. As such, firms like this are often referred to as “patent trolls.” In any case, that’s the law and the jury ruled against Apple for a reason.

The app, called Super Mario Run, hit Apple’s App Store on Thursday. For Nintendo fans everywhere, it’s the end of a long wait that started when the app was announced at Apple’s annual iPhone launch event in September. It’s also a key moment for Nintendo, which has had a hard time dealing with the shift to casual gaming on smartphones and has resisted calls to put its classic characters into apps. Smartphones have introduced more people than ever to games – as the Pokémon Go craze illustrated – but can also shift buyers away from game consoles and handheld devices such as Nintendo’s 3DS. By making a mobile game, Nintendo is saying that it’s finally ready to imagine an audience beyond its own hardware.

Super Mario Run is a lot of fun. The designers have managed to make a game that blends nostalgia and the new technology of the touch screen well. The story, such as it is, is exactly the same – Bowser has taken Princess Peach and you have to save her – and you also must rebuild your kingdom. The setting is familiar, and goombas and koopas are still trying to block your way to your goal. Longtime Nintendo fans with memories of gripping their Super Nintendo controllers will see a lot they already love. But this time, they can play with one hand. This is not simply a classic Super Mario game transported to the iPhone. Some things have been streamlined for the touch screen. Super Mario Run is an endless running game, which means you’re almost always running forward. That could frustrate some players who might wonder why they can’t move Mario all the ways they could when he was an 8-bit sprite. You can’t go back and pick up coins you missed. You can’t take little jaunts down the pipes. What you can do is jump. A lot. Tapping the screen will make Mario catch some air – the longer you hold down your finger, the higher he goes before gravity kicks in. He can also vault off cliff edges and walls, which lets you reach higher places in the levels. Once you accept your perpetual forward motion, figuring out how to get where you want to go becomes a fun puzzle. Players will definitely get replay value out of the game, especially since it’s easy to run past things you might want to pick up. Going through a level again will let you go down roads not traveled before. Players also collect different-colored coins throughout the game, and the color and placement of those coins changes as you meet your objectives. So even if you play a level again, you should find something new. The coins feed your rebuilding efforts. Coins of different colors let you buy buildings and other swag to decorate and rebuild your kingdom. There’s also a second mode to the app, called Rally, which pits you against another real-world player and helps you win residents for your kingdom. You’re scored on how many normal coins you collect, as well as how much flair you exhibit while you’re racing. Over time, you can restore and repopulate your little patch of the world. The main drawback of Super Mario Run is that, in its free version, it’s very short. The free download gets you only three levels – that doesn’t even get you to the first castle. The full version of the game costs $10. That price would probably feel right on an e-store for the 3DS or the Wii, and there is enough to do in the app to justify that price tag. But people who play games on smartphones have different expectations, and $10 is a lot to swallow when most other games are free or, at a stretch, $2. In some ways, the high app price could be seen as a signal that Nintendo, while definitely coming around on smartphones, still doesn’t get the platform – or, at least, hasn’t fully given in to it. It is obvious that mobile games are going to be just a part of Nintendo’s future, since the firm is on the verge of introducing a new console called the Switch. For most players, though, the high mobile price tag means they’ll get a taste of how fun Mario could be on the smartphone, but stop short of paying to see his full potential.

Blue Sky Innovation Technology The inside story of Apple's $14 billion tax bill Apple Mark Lennihan / AP A person stands near the Apple logo at the company's store in Grand Central Terminal, in New York. The European Union's crackdown on corporate tax avoidance has landed on Apple with its demand that the U.S. tech giant pay Ireland up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) plus interest in back taxes. A person stands near the Apple logo at the company's store in Grand Central Terminal, in New York. The European Union's crackdown on corporate tax avoidance has landed on Apple with its demand that the U.S. tech giant pay Ireland up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) plus interest in back taxes. (Mark Lennihan / AP) Gaspard Sebag, Dara Doyle and Alex WebbBloomberg "The Maxforce" is the European Union team that ordered Ireland to collect billions of euros in back taxes from Apple Inc., rattled the Irish government, and spurred changes to international tax law. You'd think it might have earned the name by applying maximum force while investigating alleged financial shenanigans. It didn't. It's just led by a guy named Max. A European Commission official gave the nickname to the Task Force on Tax Planning Practices in honor of its chief, Max Lienemeyer, a lanky, laid-back German attorney who rose to prominence vetting plans to shore up struggling banks during Europe's debt crisis. Since its launch in 2013, the Maxforce has looked at the tax status of hundreds of companies across Europe, including a deal Starbucks had in the Netherlands, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles's agreement with Luxembourg, and — its largest case — Apple in Ireland. Lienemeyer's team of 15 international civil servants pursued a three-year investigation stretching from the corridors of the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, to Ireland's Finance Ministry and on to Apple's leafy headquarters in Cupertino, California. Much of it outlined for the first time here, this story chronicles a growing clash between Europe and the U.S. and a shift in the EU's approach to the tax affairs of multinationals. The Maxforce concluded that Ireland allowed Apple to create stateless entities that effectively let it decide how much — or how little — tax it pays. The investigators say the company channeled profits from dozens of countries through two Ireland-based units. In a system at least tacitly endorsed by Irish authorities, earnings were split, with the vast majority attributed to a "head office" with no employees and no specific home base — and therefore liable to no tax on any profits from sales outside Ireland. The U.S., meanwhile, didn't tax the units because they're incorporated in Ireland. —  In August the EU said Ireland had broken European law by giving Apple a sweetheart deal. It ordered the country to bill the iPhone maker a record 13 billion euros ($13.9 billion) in back taxes, plus interest, from 2003 to 2014. One example the Commission cites: In 2011, a unit called Apple Sales International recorded profits of about 16 billion euros from sales outside the U.S. But only 50 million euros were considered taxable in Ireland, leaving 15.95 billion euros of profit untaxed, the Commission says. Though the EU says its goal is "to ensure equal treatment of companies" across Europe, Apple maintains that the Commission selectively targeted the company. With the ruling, the EU is "retroactively changing the rules and choosing to disregard decades of Irish law," and its investigators don't understand the differences between European and U.S. tax systems, Apple said in a Dec. 8 statement. European Union orders Apple to pay nearly $15 billion in back taxes Tribune news services The European Union ordered Apple on Tuesday to pay nearly $15 billion in back taxes to Ireland, plus billions more in interest, in a move that dramatically escalates the fight over whether America's biggest corporations are paying their fair share around the world. While Apple could easily afford... The European Union ordered Apple on Tuesday to pay nearly $15 billion in back taxes to Ireland, plus billions more in interest, in a move that dramatically escalates the fight over whether America's biggest corporations are paying their fair share around the world. While Apple could easily afford... (Tribune news services) Apple, which has some 6,000 workers in Ireland, says its Irish units paid the parent company a licensing fee to use the intellectual property in its products. The Irish companies didn't own the IP, so they don't owe tax on it in Ireland, Apple says, but the units will face a U.S. tax bill when they repatriate the profits. "This case has never been about how much tax Apple pays, it's about where our tax is paid," the company said. "We pay tax on everything we earn." Ireland on Nov. 9 appealed the Commission's ruling at the EU General Court in Luxembourg, arguing it has given Apple no special treatment. Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan has said he "profoundly disagrees" with the ruling and that Ireland strictly adheres to tax regulations. The government says Ireland has no right to tax non-resident companies for profits that come from activities outside the country. "Look at the small print" on an iPhone, Noonan said after the EU released its ruling in August. "It says designed in California, manufactured in China. That means any profits that accrued didn't accrue in Ireland, so I can't see why the tax liability is in Ireland." In the coming weeks, the EU is expected to publish details of the Maxforce investigation. At about the same time, Apple will likely lodge its own appeal in the EU court. Though Apple will have to pay its tax bill within weeks, the money will be held in escrow, and the issue will probably take years to be resolved. This story is based on interviews with dozens of officials from the EU, Ireland, and Apple, though most didn't want to speak on the record discussing sensitive tax matters. A Maxforce representative declined to make Lienemeyer available for an interview. Ireland's Office of Revenue Commissioners (the equivalent of the American Internal Revenue Service) says it can't comment on specific companies. — Lienemeyer began assembling the Maxforce in late spring of 2013 with a mandate of scrutinizing tax policies across Europe in search of any favoritism. Direct subsidies or tax breaks to court a specific company are illegal in the EU to prevent governments aiding national champions. His first hire — the person who would oversee the Apple probe — was Helena Malikova, a Slovak who had worked at Credit Suisse Group in Zurich. He quickly added Kamila Kaukiel, a Polish financial analyst who had been at KPMG, and Saskia Hendriks, a former tax policy adviser to the Dutch government. As the four initial members began their investigations, they got a head start from a U.S. Senate probe of the tax strategies of American multinationals. The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said Apple shifted tens of billions of dollars in profit into stateless affiliates based in Ireland, where it secured a tax rate of less than 2 percent. At 9:30 a.m. on May 21, 2013, senators gathered in Room 106 of the Dirksen Office Building. Included in the evidence presented that day was a 2004 letter from Tom Connor, an official at Ireland's tax authority, to Ernst & Young, Apple's tax adviser. Connor's question: A unit of the tech company hadn't filed a tax return; Was it still in business? E&Y responded two days later that the division was a non-resident holding company with no real sales. "There is nothing to return from the corporation tax standpoint," E&Y wrote. The Senate exhibits didn't include Connor's response if there ever was one. At the hearing, Arizona Republican John McCain castigated Apple as "one of the biggest tax avoiders in America." Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan peered over the glasses perched on the tip of his nose and said Apple uses "offshore tax strategies whose purpose is tax avoidance, pure and simple." Crucially, though, Levin told the crowded room that under U.S. law, there was little the panel could do to force Apple to pay more tax. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook passionately defended the company's actions, telling the senators "We don't depend on tax gimmicks." The Senate revelations raised eyebrows at the Maxforce's office in Madou Tower, a 1960s high-rise in the rundown Saint-Josse neighborhood of Brussels. Three weeks after the Senate hearing, Lienemeyer's team asked Ireland for details of Apple's tax situation. The Irish tax authorities soon dispatched a representative carrying a briefcase filled with a bundle of bound pages. The Irish could have simply sent the material via e-mail, but they were cautious about sharing taxpayer's information with the EU and have a ground rule to avoid leaks: never send such documents electronically.

Through the summer of 2013, the Finance Ministry assured government ministers that the EU investigation would amount to nothing, according to people familiar with the discussions. But those assertions seemed less confident than earlier communications. There was a sense that Apple had worked out its Irish tax position in a vastly different era, and no one remembered many details of the negotiations decades earlier. In 1980, the four-year-old company — the Apple III desktop had just been released — created several Irish affiliates, each with a different function such as manufacturing or sales, according to the Senate report. Under Irish laws dating to the 1950s designed to shore up the moribund post-war economy, as a so-called export company Apple paid no taxes on overseas sales of products made in Ireland. To comply with European rules, Ireland finally ended its zero-tax policy in 1990. After that, Apple and Ireland agreed that the profit attributed to a key Ireland-based unit, the division discussed in Tom Connor's letter, be capped using a complex formula that in 1990 would have resulted in a taxable profit of $30 million to $40 million. An Apple tax adviser "confessed there was no scientific basis" for those figures, but that the amounts would be "of such magnitude that he hoped it would be seen as a bona-fide proposal," according to notes from a 1990 meeting with the Irish tax authority cited by the EU. The equation didn't change even as Apple began assembling the bulk of its products in Asia. Ireland and Apple started to make changes a few months after the Maxforce began looking into their tax relationship. In October 2013, Finance Minister Noonan announced he would close the loophole that let stateless holding companies operate out of Ireland. The EU says Apple changed the structure of its Irish units in 2015. As the Maxforce stepped up its probe in June 2014, Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny was wooing potential investors in California. At a San Francisco event to promote Irish entrepreneurs, Governor Jerry Brown quipped that he had thought Apple "was a California company," but according to tax returns, "they're really an Irish company." News clips show Irish officials looking on stony-faced as the governor makes his jest. — With Lienemeyer's team digging further into the issue, Apple's concern deepened. In January 2016, CEO Cook met with Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition chief — and Lienemeyer's ultimate boss — on the 10th-floor of the Berlaymont building, the institutional headquarters of the European Commission in Brussels. Vestager, a daughter of two Lutheran pastors, has a reputation for being even-handed but tough, cutting unemployment benefits while advocating strict new rules for banks when she served as Denmark's finance minister. While she has acknowledged that her team had little experience with tax rulings — in a November interview with France's Society magazine, she said, "We learned on the job" — Vestager says enforcement of EU rules on taxation is a matter of "fairness." In the meeting with Cook she quizzed him on the tax Apple paid in various jurisdictions worldwide. She told the Apple executives that "someone has to tax you," according to a person present at the meeting. In a Jan. 25 follow-up letter obtained by Bloomberg, Cook thanked Vestager for a "candid and constructive exchange of views," and reasserted that Apple's earnings are "subject to deferred taxation in the U.S. until those profits are repatriated." Subsequent correspondence became more heated. On March 14, Cook wrote to Vestager that he had "concerns about the fairness of these proceedings." The Commission had failed to explain fully the basis on which Apple was being investigated, and the body's approach was characterized by "inconsistency and ambiguity," Cook said.

(Jasper Juinen / Bloomberg) Apple contended that the EU had backtracked on a 2014 decision recognizing that its two Irish subsidiaries were not technically resident in Ireland, and therefore only liable for taxes on profits derived from Irish sources. Now, Cook said, it seemed the Commission was intent on "imposing a massive, retroactive tax on Apple by attributing to the Irish branches all of Apple's global profits outside the Americas." "There is no inconsistency," an EU spokesman said in a Dec. 15 statement. Only a fraction of the profits of the subsidiaries were taxed in Ireland, the statement said. "As a result, the tax rulings enabled Apple to pay substantially less tax than other companies, which is illegal under EU state aid rules." Cook's entreaties did little to sway Vestager, and in August she phoned Noonan to tell him the results of the Maxforce investigation: The Commission was going to rule against Ireland. Late in the afternoon of Aug. 29, Irish officials began hinting to reporters that Apple's tax bill amounted to billions and "could be anything." At noon the following day, Vestager told a packed press conference in Brussels that the Commission had decided Apple owed Ireland 13 billion euros. Though that would be equivalent to 26 percent of the 2015 national budget, Ireland didn't want the windfall, saying the ruling was flawed because the country hadn't given Apple any special treatment. The decision sparked a political crisis as left-leaning members of Enda Kenny's fragile minority administration saw a potential bonanza for taxpayers that the world's richest company could well afford. Even as Noonan toured television studios vowing to appeal the decision, independent lawmakers demanded that Ireland take the money. Facing a potential revolt that could bring down the government, Kenny and Noonan eventually bowed to demands for a review of the country's corporate tax system. But they said they would fight the case, and on Sept. 7, Irish lawmakers overwhelmingly backed the motion for an appeal. Officials from Lienemeyer's team and other EU offices say they have gathered tax information on about 300 companies, looking for what they deem to be favorable treatment by governments across Europe. While they don't expect all of those to yield payoffs as hefty as that from their investigation of Ireland and Apple, they say a worrying number require the kind of maximum force that the Maxforce can apply. "We focus on outliers where you're looking at something that is off the radar screen," Lienemeyer's boss, 50-year-old Dutchman Gert-Jan Koopman, who is in charge of state-aid enforcement at the EU, said at a Brussels conference in November. "If you're paying a fair amount of tax then there is absolutely nothing to worry about." Bloomberg's Stephanie Bodoni and Aoife White contributed.

For those of you with Apple Watches, eager for Niantic's promised launch of Pokemon Go, I've got some good news. A report from 9to5mac suggested that the version has been shelved, but Niantic has just come out and confirmed that it is indeed still in development and is coming "soon." Initially, the version was due out by the end of 2016, which while highly unlikely, is still possible. "Pokemon Go for Apple Watch is coming soon," Tweeted the official Niantic Twitter. "Stay tuned." The Apple Watch version of the game, announced back in September, actually functions a lot more like the Pokemon Go Plus perhiphreal rather than the full version. Players will be able to hatch eggs and visit Pokestops, but they will not be able to capture new Pokemon. Hopefully, versions of the game for other smartwatches will follow in the near future!

Roku Express – $29 Roku Streaming Stick $48 Amazon Echo Dot 9to5Toys named it the product of the year and for good reason.

Tile Mate – $25 Apple Watch Dock If the person you’re buying for is an Apple Watch user, then you can’t go wrong with a solid Apple Watch dock. A variety of options exist around $50 and well under. It’s important to note that while these docks don’t include built-in chargers, the charger included with the Apple Watch should work without issue. Head below for a few of my personal picks: Spigen S330 Apple Watch Dock – $10 Ziku Aluminum Apple Watch + iPhone Dock – $39 Renoj Aluminum Apple Watch Dock – $15 Bentoben Apple Watch Dock – $13 Oittm Apple Watch Charging Stand with 3 built-in USB ports – $32.99 iDevices Switch – HomeKit Smart Plug At just under $50, the iDevices Switch is a perfect stocking stuffer this holiday season.

The iDevices Switch is a great starter product for anyone looking to get into the HomeKit game this holiday season. iDevices Switch – $49.99 Apple Watch Bands A variety of solid Apple Watch bands exist for $50 or less, both from Apple itself or a third-party. From Apple, you can get either a Sport band or a Woven Nylon band for $49.99, but a variety of third-party bands come in at a lot cheaper than that: Official Apple Watch Sport band – $49 Official Woven Nylon Apple Watch band – $49 Space Black Milanese Loop-like Penom band – $16 Sport band-style silicon Apple Watch band – $10 Apple Watch Nike+ replica – $19 Vintage Leather Apple Watch band – $20 Space Gray Stainless Steel band – $24 UE Roll Bluetooth Speaker The UE Roll is one of the best and most versatile speakers on the market and in refurbished condition, you can get one for just under our $50 limit. The UE Roll is waterproof and shockproof, featuring a design that offers 360-degree sound, 65-feet Bluetooth range, and 9 hours of battery life. It’s worth noting that at this price, you’re getting a refurbished model. Though, Amazon says it is “tested and certified to look and work like new.” Additionally, you get a 90-day warranty. If you’re looking for something that’s a bit cheaper and comes brand new, below are a couple of options in addition to the UE Roll.

My person pick for a pair of touchscreen gloves for men are the Timberland Magic Gloves.

Timberland Magic Gloves – $10 iGotTech Texting Gloves – $9 Anker Astro E1 5200mAh Battery Pack Battery packs are getting smaller and more powerful every day and one of the best options on the market right now is the Anker Astro E1, especially in terms of its size.

Author: David Pierce. David Pierce Gear Date of Publication: 12.17.16. 12.17.16 Time of Publication: 6:30 am. 6:30 am Review: Bragi Headphone Wireless Earbuds Bragi Ambition is the enemy of success. At least if you’re Bragi, the headphone maker whose first product, the Dash, did a thousand things without doing any of them particularly well. The Dash in-ear headphones slash head-mounted computer tried to tackle fitness, translation, gesture control, mixed-reality audio, and more. Which all might have been fine, except the Dash could barely hold a Bluetooth connection long enough to finish a song. This time Bragi’s back with a pair of headphones that do a lot of headphone things and not much else. As if to prove the point beyond all doubt, they’re even called The Headphone. For $149, these truly wireless earbuds pop out of their charging case and into your ears, where they’ll connect to almost any device. And, praise be, they tend to stay connected. The Headphone may not be the ear-puter of the future, but it’s a perfectly good set of truly wireless headphones. And that’s no small feat. WIRED If you’ve never spent a day with truly wireless earbuds, you’re missing out. The Headphone, like a lot of the good models in this space, are just small and light enough that you forget they’re there. Eventually it feels like beautiful music is just playing inside your head. The quarter-sized Headphone buds are much easier to hide or disguise than the long AirPods or the large Beats Solo. They fit snugly in my ears, and the tips create a nice seal. (You should experiment a bit, though, to find which of the included options fits best in your ears.) Bluetooth connection is solid, if not quite flawless yet. Once you get them working, these buds have reasonably dynamic, powerful sound, certainly more than I expected from a gizmo this small. Their neat audio-transparency feature lets you decide how much real-world sound you want to hear, You control playback with three buttons on the right earbud, which takes some getting used to but is much easier than the Dash’s inscrutable set of swipes and taps. TIRED Connecting the Headphone via Bluetooth is as simple as any pair of headphones, even if doesn’t have the one-touch magic of the new Apple devices. The Headphone’s battery doesn’t always hold up to the advertised six hours, and because the case doesn’t double as a charger you’re hosed if even one bud dies while you’re out. And oh, by the way, they don’t turn off when you put them in the case. I learned this the hard way. It can be awkward to know where to put these headphones when they’re not in your ear, which is why Bragi put the case on a lanyard so you can have it with you always. (Don’t wear the case, folks.) The membrane buttons don’t click, they smush. All of the Headphone’s parts, from the case to the buds themselves, feel a little cheaper than I’d like from a $150 set of earphones. Like the Dash, the Headphone’s microphone isn’t even good enough to dictate text messages accurately. They’re water-resistant enough for a run, but not a swim. RATING 7/10 – Their build doesn’t inspire much confidence, and some of the advanced tech needs some work, but The Headphone proves this kind of truly wireless earbud really can work. Go Back to Top.

But in recent months, as every company with an Amazon profile has scrambled to put something in your ears with fewer cables and more capabilities, every imaginable color, shape, and size has been tried. Most of them are so big they’re hard to wear, or so small their batteries only last through half a Brian Eno track. But Beats, which has been making wireless headphones a lot longer than most, knows what it’s doing. The new Powerbeats3 Wireless earphones look just like the Powerbeats you already know from all those commercials. They’re not exactly understated; nothing from Beats ever is. And they don’t have the same sort of futuristic vibe you get from the totally wireless AirPods, either. But if you’re looking for a pair of headphones you can wear all day, every day, no matter the weather or your activity, these are pretty tough to beat. WIRED In addition to the buds that jam into your ear canals, the Powerbeats3 have big adjustable hooks on both sides that wrap over your ear to keep everything secure. As a result, they’re the most stable, comfortable wireless headphones I’ve ever tried. I can wear them all day without pain. The in-line remote is handy and useful, and the microphones in both buds are excellent for phone calls and Siri. Beats If you use Apple devices, the included W1 chip makes pairing absurdly easy and rock-solid, just as it does with AirPods and the Solo3 on-ear headphones. In two weeks of using the Powerbeats3, I’ve only had the audio drop out once, and only for an instant. The extra Bluetooth power means I can walk three rooms away and still be connected. The battery lasts at least the 12 hours advertised, which means I’ve only been charging them about once a week. They sound a little Beats-y, with big highs and lows that make everything a little more dramatic than it needs to be, but the mids come through really nicely and even out the sound a bit. TIRED Pairing the Powerbeats3 is really easy, but sort of opaque: you press the button on the headphones, hold them close to whatever device you’re pairing, and… wait for something to happen. It almost always works, but it’s still too much mystery. (If you pair it with any non-Apple device, it’s just like any other set of headphones.) The play/pause button on the remote is just mushy enough that I can never tell if I’ve actually pressed it. If you’re looking for true sound isolation, look elsewhere: the Powerbeats3 go into your ear, but not quite far enough to drown out the world. In Apple’s world of USB-C and Lightning, it’s dumb that these headphones charge with Micro USB. And, like all Beats products, the Powerbeats3 are both very expensive ($199) and very conspicuous. RATING 8/10 – You’re paying a little too much for the Beats brand and getting a little too much of that Beats sound, but these are fantastic workout headphones—and great for everything else, too.

It’s unwieldy at first and not for everyone, but there is no substitute for the immediacy and control. Sure, most people get by with the squishiness of those membrane keyboards Apple and Dell throw in the box, but those sheep live in a blissful state of unawareness. Mechanical keyboard people are woke. Yes, they are noisy. That only makes typing more fun. Sentences flow like music. Rhythmic lines blast by in quick succession. Tempos ebb and flow, each percussive phrase punctuated by the sharp thwack of the Enter key—which, on a quality keyboard, sounds like a gunshot. Passages express the range of human emotion, from the crack of an angry email to the pitter-patter of a gossipy Slack. Das Keyboard is among the premiere manufacturers of mechanical keyboards. Its latest, the Prime 13, is priced near the middle of the range at $149, but the Cherry MX Brown switches help it perform like a higher-priced model. These are quality German key mechanisms—the good shit. Under the keys, lies a soft backlight system powered by pure white LEDs. The black keycaps sport glowing white letters in a chunky typeface, and they’re nestled within a plate of matte-black anodized aluminum. In a product category that tends to skew garish and geeky, it’s refreshing to see something so austere. Just black and glowing white. So smooth. Even the 6-foot black braided cable looks the business. The Cherry Browns are renowned for a tactile “bump” at the point where the keystroke registers. The keys provide just the right amount of friction under the fingertips, and just enough clack-clack-clack to stimulate the brain’s pleasure center. This choice of switch makes the Prime 13 eminently approachable. If you’re looking for a place to start with mechanicals, you won’t find a better point of entry. WIRED A comfortable and smartly designed mechanical keyboard that’s a joy to type on; one of the best I’ve tried. Fast typists will love that tactile Cherry brown action. Key clicks are quiet enough not to totally annoy cubemates, but can get satisfyingly loud if strokes are delivered with authority or emotion. Rugged build—the entire top of the shell is a nice, thick aluminum plate. USB pass-through cable for connecting a mouse or another peripheral. TIRED It’s heavy (nearly three pounds) and not at all compact. Mechanicals are always on the larger side anyway, but the girth here clashes with the minimal aesthetic of the black-on-black, backlit design. Desktop ergonomics are mostly good, but there’s no getting around the bulk. Properly mapping the function keys and media keys on macOS took some trial and error. RATING 8/10 – Excellent.

(The second rule is “When in doubt, selfie.”) Phones don’t use optical zoom, which re-focuses a camera on a smaller frame, helping preserve image quality. They use digital zoom, which is just cropping. When you fling your fingers apart to see the band bigger on your phone screen, all you’re doing is chopping your photo down to a teeny-tiny rectangle. It won’t get sharper, or brighter. It will just suck. Don’t do it. Optical zoom is what you want, but optical zoom also requires a lot more lens hardware. Which would mean a bigger camera. Which would mean a bigger phone. Which you don’t want, most of the time. But “most of the time” is exactly what the Moto Z is trying to do away with. The modular phone lets you click on accessories when you need them, and yank them off when you’re done. Moto’s newest mod? The Hasselblad True Zoom, which adds a big lens with 10x optical zoom, a shutter button, and a flash to the back of your phone. It costs $250 if you buy it at a Verizon store, or $300 straight from Motorola, which makes no sense at all. When you attach the True Zoom, it actually covers the Z’s internal camera — it uses your phone’s software, but its own hardware. It turns your phone into something much more versatile than your average Android. WIRED As soon as you put on the True Zoom, it just becomes part of the Moto Z. It’s black and gray and looks like a camera, rather than the crazy phone-accessory contraption it really is. Having a dedicated shutter button, and a physical button for launching the camera app, is amazing. The True Zoom launches the camera app automatically as soon as it’s attached, so you’re up and firing quickly. Somehow Motorola resisted the urge to add a million settings to its software, so the Moto Camera app is clean and simple. You can control the camera manually if you like, and even shoot RAW, but things are automatic. Having 10x zoom (25-250mm, in 35mm terms) for smartphone photos is fantastic. It’s the difference between capturing the whole mountain, and the cool house at the top. The zoom is fast and smooth. It’s not just the zoom, either. All my photos look better through the True Zoom. All the specs are roughly equivalent to a decent point-and-shoot camera, but with this one you get access to Instagram, Google Photos, and every editing app you love. TIRED Your fancy new camera only shoots 1080p video, whereas the phone itself can capture in 4K. The True Zoom’s aperture range goes from f/3.5-f/6.5, which means your photos are going to look darker than you expect through this lens. A lot darker, in some cases, especially when you zoom all the way in. Don’t use this in low light. The shutter button’s a little mushy, and the image stabilization’s a little subpar, which together means I have a dozen otherwise in-focus photos that became blurry when I smashed the shutter trying to get it to work. Half-pressing the shutter to focus is nice, but it’s sloooow. When you flip the Moto Z around to take a selfie, the True Zoom turns off. Then you want the rear camera again, and the True Zoom has to whir back to life. Everything about the operation—the zooming, the turning on, the capturing a photo—is a little slow and a lot loud. Both phone and mod are thin and light, but put the two pieces together and your phone’s barely pocketable at all. Also, regardless of how good the True Zoom is, you have to be truly committed to Motorola to be able to use it at all. RATING 6/10 – Your phone deserves a better camera. This is a better camera, even if using it doesn’t always feel great. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. cameras Hasselblad modular phones moto z Motorola Reviews Skip Social.

Josh Valcarcel/WIRED The first Libratone speaker I remember testing was the company’s debut product from 2011, an AirPlay sound bar called the Lounge that mounted on the wall. After that there were other speakers, all covered in cloth, all rather large, and offering premium sound. There was the Loop, the Live, and the smaller, portable Zipp. Now, Libratone has redesigned the Zipp from the inside out, and the speaker is currently the company’s only product. Libratone doesn’t sell any of those old, big speakers anymore—just portables. Consider this a rebirth, I guess. The new Zipp is small, cylindrical, and battery-powered, all things that are very much in vogue. The speaker actually comes in two sizes, the 10-inch tall Zipp ($299) and the 8.8-inch tall Zipp Mini ($249). Both have little leather straps for handles, and both are covered in cloth. In fact, you can buy additional mesh cloth covers for $29 each, and you just (yep) zip them on. This portable boombox has a couple of cool tricks that set it apart from other wireless speakers. First, you can link up to six speakers together via Wi-Fi and place them around the house to spread out the sound. You can make them all play the same music, or play different tracks in each room and control it all from a single phone app, sort of like Sonos. Second, it supports multiple wireless options: you can use it as a Bluetooth speaker, or (once you connect it to your Wi-Fi network using Libratone’s app) you can stream music via AirPlay, DLNA, or Spotify Direct. WIRED Great sound for a small speaker. Inside the larger Zipp, there’s a 100-watt Class D amp, a 4-inch woofer, two 1-inch tweeters, and two 4-inch passive radiators. These are all placed around the face of the cylinder so the sound spreads out in a circle. It gets very loud, and while some small speakers sound like a car horn when you crank them, the Zipp sounds pretty natural at higher volumes. I played a lot of bass-heavy jams (Erykah, Nicola Cruz, Peter Tosh) and the little thing really thumps. The Zipp Mini (60 watts, 3-inch woofer, and one tweeter) doesn’t sound nearly as good, and I can’t recommend it—spend the extra $50 and get the bigger one. App makes connecting to your Wi-Fi network easy. Battery lasts longer than the quoted 10 hours; more like 12 in my testing at moderate volume. Also the speaker can charge your phone via a USB port in the base. TIRED The on-board controls are a mess. All interactions—changing volume, skipping tracks, linking multiple speakers together, favoriting songs—are accomplished via a big button on the top. There’s a capacitive metal ring on the outside of this button that you run your finger around to change the volume, but it’s garbage. Swipes and taps simply would not register half the time. One thing that does work is the “Hush” feature: hold your hand over the button for a second and the sound mutes. But that’s not enough to make me feel better. I wound up using my phone for skipping songs and changing volume, which is actually just fine because that’s how most people interact with a wireless speaker anyway. Charging is accomplished with a proprietary, wall-wart-style charger. This means you have another chunk of plastic to pack with you on vacation, and it means you can’t charge it with a USB cable like every other gadget in your home. RATING 6/10 Nice sound, nice features, but tough to really love. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. AirPlay Speakers bluetooth speakers libratone portable audio wireless speakers Skip Social.

The aluminum sound-dome comes pre-accessorized with a quaint leather strap. Loop it through your belt, hang it on a door knob. Cute! The A1 is the smallest Bluetooth speaker in B&O’s Beoplay line of mobile products. It’s about 5 inches in diameter and about 2 inches tall, or about the size of a Quarter Pounder with cheese. Inside you’ll find two drivers: a 3.5-inch aluminum cone for lows and mids, and a 3/4-inch dome tweeter to handle the tippy-top end. A pair of 30-watt class D amps powers them. The rest of the A1 is seemingly all battery (it weighs a hefty 1.3 pounds)—a 2200 mAh cell that B&O claims gives you 24 hours of playback. The bottom half is rubberized, and you place the A1 on a table perforated side up so it fills the room with a fountain of audio waves. It doesn’t look like a big silver hockey puck, but rather a beautiful big silver hockey puck. As I carried it around the office, colleagues showered it with an unbroken stream of praise. “Oh, it’s gorgeous” and “That’s too pretty to be a speaker” and “I don’t know what it is exactly, but I want it.” That’s the nut of it. Smart design always has been the primary reason to buy a Bang & Olufsen product. You can find scads of excellent Bluetooth speakers for less than the $249 you’ll pay for an A1. But none of them will turn heads like an A1. Credit that to Cecilie Manz, who also designed the slightly larger Beoplay A2, and the lunchbox-like Beolit 15. The A1 and the A2, of course, share the same design language, right down to the leather strap and the perforations on the speaker grill. They display a visual sophistication that elevates these speakers above the slew of products that perform the same functions. So yes, if you want a speaker, there are many. If you want a beautiful speaker, this one’s among the beautifulest. WIRED Superb sound. B&O applies some gentle digital signal processing to keep the audio distortion-free as you crank it up, though it succeeds in keeping things crisp at all volumes. Music rarely sounds overly processed. The low end is far more powerful than expected from something this small; the fuzz bass in Ty Segall’s reading of “Diversion” rumbled the whole table. Gorgeous industrial design with a noticeable attention to detail. Leather strap makes it simple to mount on a wall, or anywhere really. Battery life is great—I got five days of heavy use out of it between charges. The USB-C charger blasts electrons to the battery with unmatched fury, bringing it from fully depleted to fully ready in less than 100 minutes. Works as a speakerphone. Choose between matte silver and mossy green. TIRED At $249, too pricey for most people. You’re buying this speaker because it sounds great and runs for a long time, but you’re mostly buying it because you like the way it looks. The cheaper UE Boom 2 ($200) doesn’t have the big bass or the big battery, but it is excellent in its own right and it’s waterproof. The Beoplay A1 is not waterproof—don’t hang it in the shower. The USB-C cable means that you can’t charge it with any of the 641 USB-not-C cables already in your home. What, no rose gold? RATING 8/10 Great sound, great design, but that’s a lot of Satoshis.

Moleskine is living proof of this as a successful journal company whose revenue still chiefly comes from its paper products. But we live in a world where digital rules, and Moleskine knows it needs to participate. The Smart Writing Set ($200) caters to that segment of the population who still like jotting down ideas in an honest-to-goodness journal, but also want the convenience of automatically digitized notes. Pen, paper, and an app technically make up the writing set, but your smartphone provides much of the operating power needed to make the system work. Yes, there are other products that bridge the gap between analog and digital, letting you draw sketches or take notes then creating a shareable, editable version. (So many of them.) But how many can claim to be from a legendary brand? WIRED Moleskine has waded into digital products before, but it leveraged partnerships with other companies who already own a piece of that world (Evernote, Livescribe). The Smart Writing Set represents the company’s first effort to brand an entire pen-paper-and-app set by itself, and it’s clearly picked up a few smart things from experience. The black aluminum pen (a Neo smartpen) feels solid and sleek compared to Livescribe’s bulkier versions, and it incorporates some cool tech: a hidden camera that traces and digitizes your every stroke of the pen. The notebook itself—which Moleskine calls a Paper Tablet—is a big part of the offering, too, and it’s every bit a pleasure to write in as the company’s other journals. The app, meanwhile, lets you liven up your notes and sketches with colors or even erase portions of your notes. (It’s iOS only for now, with Android coming soon.) You can tag, search, or export each page, and sharing is compatible with a plethora of applications and devices, including iCloud, Google Drive, Evernote and Adobe. Oh, and the thing digitizes everything—and can even capture audio—as you write. There’s still something oddly hypnotizing about watching your pen strokes appear instantly on your mobile device, as if by magic. TIRED As a longtime Livescribe user, my biggest beef with Moleskine’s Smart Writing Set is that its recording capabilities are limited. There’s no way to hook up microphone earbuds, so I couldn’t use the paper tablet and pen to record phone calls—a crucial part of my job as a reporter. The system actually outsources much of its functionality to the smartphone. It relies on your smartphone’s mic to record audio, for one, and digitized notes take up smartphone memory—which is clever, since it allowed Moleskine to keep the pen’s design slim and sleek. But for $200, there isn’t a lot of tech on the pen itself. That also means constant fussing with the app to make sure your notes are being digitized properly. (Personally, I ran into problems with my notes going accidentally unrecorded when I forgot to power on the pen.) The pen’s battery lasts for five hours of continuous writing, which is pretty good—but it may have you running out of juice unexpectedly after a full day of note-taking. Basically, if you’re the kind of person who just wants to have fun occasionally digitizing or sharing your notes or drawings (a student, an artist), Moleskine’s Smart Writing Set will work just fine. But if your profession relies on your ability to take down highly accurate notes, you’ll be better off exploring other options. RATING 7/10 – Will make you look like a serious design nerd—but the emphasis is on creative fun, not meticulous function. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Just take a look at its configurations for the table-top light: Everything from the patterns cut into the hardware to the font used on its packaging are deliberate choices. Why so much work for just a lamp? Probably because the Fade Task Lamp isn’t just a lamp, it’s a functional piece of furniture that happens to be beautiful, and actually fun to use. Yes, a lamp that’s fun to use. The LED array is perched at the end of an articulated arm you can bend without any cranking or prodding. A thick metal ribbon serves as the structural backbone. It’s flexible, so you can bend and reposition the arm with a smooth, gliding action. Once you find a position you like, magnets hidden inside the arm’s body hold it in place. The base has a control that lets you not only dim or brighten the light, but also change hues, just by sliding around a toggle on the base. Of course, such attention to detail and build quality translates into dollar signs! WIRED It’s beautiful. The Fade Task Lamp has a super simple, utilitarian design, which makes the fact that this lamp has “features” even better. On the base, there’s an x-y controller that you push around with one finger to change the temperature of the light from warm to cool, and the strength from dim to bright. It’s surprisingly pleasing, much more so than twisting a sticky knob. Seriously: You think pushing a small circle around inside of a bigger circle won’t be that fun, but watching it transform the light in the room is hypnotizing. The armature has a ton of movement, so you can angle the lamp however you want, for whatever surface you put it on. And it’s not so big that it looks ridiculous on a desk, but not so small that if you had it totally vertical it couldn’t sit on the floor. Oh, and there’s a USB port in the base for charging a mobile device, which is the clincher. TIRED $250 is a lot to spend on a lamp that doesn’t take up a corner of your home. Sure, like I said, if it’s totally vertical, the lamp could take residence on your floor. But then, you lose the purpose of the base’s swivel function to dim and brighten and change warmth. The lamp’s only con is it’s fairly high price—but anyone willing to spend a little extra on the ultimate desk companion will be happy to spend it. RATING 8/10 – There’s a higher end version of everything, right? Even lamps. This is that lamp. You will love lamp. Go Back to Top.

A smartphone rig earns you convenience and portability, but you give up quality and utility. That’s where the DxO One comes in. It’s a palm-sized camera assembly for iPhone and iPad that plugs into your Lightning port and gives your mobile photos a serious performance boost. The 1-inch, 20-megapixel sensor sits behind a nice lens with an f/1.8 aperture. The software offers a suite of shooting modes and gives you full manual control over the camera’s operation. Plug the $499 DxO One into your iPhone and fire up the companion iOS app, and all of a sudden, the photo frame on your phone’s screen suddenly looks closer to what you’d see in the viewfinder of a Nikon D. WIRED The photos it takes are stunning, and the tiny device is discreet enough to carry on any outing. The build feels sturdy and the device is comfortable to hold when attached to the phone. The app is incredibly easy to use, and within moments of downloading, plugging the camera in, and firing it up, you’re shooting photos that simply could not have been taken with an iPhone. TIRED It’s a $500 iPhone accessory, which is really steep considering you could get a capable pocket camera for around $600. But of course, that camera isn’t going to let you use your smartphone for everything, and it’s not going fit in your pocket as easily. We ran into some performance issues with the DxO One. It’s slower than our testing committee liked, it crashed several times, and it was prone to overheating. At one point, it overheated, shut down, and we weren’t able to wake it back up. Clipping it in easy, though I found it a little awkward to get it to switch on so it could be plugged in. You have to slide the panel covering the lens on the side down, hold it, and then the Lightning plug will swing out—don’t try to force the plug to pop up! RATING 6/10 – The DxO One was super fun to use, and the photos we took with it are beautiful. But it’s a little expensive and a little crashy. Go Back to Top.

From the famous Klipschorn design to the company’s signature copper-colored “Cerametallic” speaker cones, its products have swagger. The company’s new crop of excellent in-ear headphones, with their zinc flourishes and unique ear tips, carry the tradition. These in-ears are branded as “Reference” products—a term that, to audio nerds, signifies a flat frequency response and an un-messed-with sound free of the bass-boosting and audio-sweetening so prevalent today. The Klipsch Reference X6i in-ears cost $179, the least expensive of the new line. The most expensive, the X20i, are $549. I’m almost always attracted to the most affordable option, so I tried these for a few months. Even for the “budget” end of the line, they’re phenomenal. The X6i are my new go-to recommendation for reference in-ear headphones under $200. They’ve unseated my previous pick, the $150 Etymotic hf3. The Klipsch’s have comparable sound, but better cables, better ear tips, and better overall design. WIRED The sound is pretty much perfect; crisp without being sterile and loud without being fatiguing. The unique oval ear tips (Klipsch holds a patent on the design) provide an excellent, no-fuss seal within the ear canal. That seal is what enables an in-ear headphone to deliver good bass, and in this case, the bass is clear and dramatic. The box includes tips of many sizes, including flange tips that also create an excellent seal. Light and comfy; all-day wear is no problem. The cable is thick and coils easily. It never tangled or knotted, even when jamming the headphones into my back pocket and sitting through a meeting, or balling them up and tossing them into my carry-on when it came time to board the plane. The remote is large and forgiving. $180 is a great price for in-ears this nice. TIRED That big thick cable means lots of microphonic cable noise. You’ll need to use the clothing clip to keep your Rachmaninov from being smothered by rubbing noises. There are zinc elements in the earpieces, but otherwise there’s just a lot of plastic here. Anyone looking for bling will be disappointed. The wallet-like carrying case is interesting—you coil up the headphones then slip them into a pouch that folds in half—but I miss a fully-closing zipper case. These are all teeny quibbles!

And while that’s true (look!), the manufacturing giant produces much more than handsets. There have been a steady stream of TVs, routers, and audio products released over the last couple of years under the company’s consumer-facing Mi brand name. This November, Xiaomi released a new set of Mi in-ear headphones. They debuted in China for 99 yuan, which means they’ll be priced at around $29 when they make their way to US consumers in the new year. Not a bad price for a nice set of metal earbuds. WIRED The fit and finish is exemplary for something this inexpensive. The sound chambers of the buds are made of machined aluminum and not only feel sturdy, but look really nice. Visually, they’re restrained and sophisticated. Even the plastic pieces feel like quality. Inside each chamber are two drivers: one balanced armature driver for the highs, and one traditional dynamic driver for the lows and mids. This design gives them a walloping low end—if you’re always aching for more bass, these might make you happy. But unlike other bottom-heavy earbuds, the vocals and the high end of the mix have their own driver, so they’re not obliterated by all that low-frequency muscle. There are a few different sizes of rubber tips in the box, so you can find a comfy fit pretty easily. The cables are Kevlar-reinforced, in case you need to take a bullet for a friend. TIRED Kudos to the dual-driver design for keeping things tidy on the high end. But that low end is so big and boomy, it’s overwhelming—most music ends up sounding murky. I found myself rolling off the lows inside my iPhone’s EQ settings during testing, and I still couldn’t clean up that bass. The hardware is smart, but it’s tuned in a way that diminishes the design. The tiny and oddly-shaped buttons on the inline remote make it difficult to manage. The cables are coated in rubber from the ears to the Y-joint in the middle, but from there down to the plug, the cable is protected by a braided sheath. The result is a cable with two different weights and textures, which I found odd. For $29, they sound good, but there are better cheap in-ears for the same money (Mrice, JLab, Soundmagic) as long as you’re OK with a lower-quality build.

TIME TIME’s new line of footwear began as a Kickstarter project to make high-end slippers designed to look like sneakers. They’re now available for sale to the public in three styles: lows, mids, and high-tops (I tried out the highs). They look quite a bit different than the Kickstarter prototypes (much better, in my opinion), but the basics are pretty much what the designers had in mind at the outset of their crowdfunding campaign: Super soft leather uppers that are both flexible and strong. Insoles made out of the same material as yoga mats. Linings that are cozy but don’t cause sweaty feet. Stretch laces that make the shoes easy to slip on. The results are pretty great. TIME’s slippers are convenient, durable, and super comfortable. And while they’re pricey—you probably haven’t ever spent over $100 on slippers before—they look enough like outdoor shoes that you can easily get away with wearing them to hit the gym or go do errands. So you’ll get more use out of them than you would with standard house shoes. WIRED Straight up, these are just about the most comfortable things I’ve ever had on my feet. The soles are super flexible, but not flimsy. The wool lining is warm but breathable. And TIME’s designers made lots of smart choices that make these extra easy to wear. For instance, there’s a small slot above the heel that you grip with your thumb and use to take the slippers on and off. That might sound superfluous, but having the feature on these has made me want something similar on all of my high-tops. TIRED I really like these. And I don’t mind spending a little extra money on things that I really like. But $150 is a lot for high-top slippers! Even the low-tops are $95. If you do decide to wear them out into the real world, you’ll notice that the bright white midsoles will begin to look dirty pretty quickly, and that they’re a little difficult to scrub clean. I wish there was an option to get these in all-black. I’d like the look better, and black midsoles would keep the slippers looking fresher a little longer.

Both devices are meant for playing games, and that cheap little glass remote isn’t going to cut it when you really get going in Disney Infinity. Apple doesn’t make an official controller, and you can use lots of Bluetooth-enabled accessories, but the SteelSeries Nimbus is the unofficial controller of choice. It’s the one they’ll tell you to buy at the Apple Store. For $50, you get a black controller that looks just like an Xbox or Playstation controller. The Nimbus has two analog sticks, a diamond of colored buttons, shoulder and triggers on each side, and a giant all-purpose Menu button. It doesn’t feel like a console-quality object; it feels like an add-on, not a critical piece of the experience. Still, it’s a solid controller, and it’s a whole lot better than mashing your fingers on the screen trying to thread your pass in FIFA. If you’re going to game on your new Apple device, this is a must-have. WIRED If you’ve ever played on a console—any console—you’ll figure the Nimbus out quickly. It works with iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and even Mac, so one controller will work for everything. Setup is insanely easy, just turn it on and pair it via Bluetooth. Charges via Lightning, so you almost certainly already have its charger plugged in to an outlet somewhere. Joysticks and buttons are solid and comfortable, and incredibly responsive in almost every way. You’ll finish Final Fantasy V long before the battery runs out. Companion app offers a running list of games that support the controller. TIRED The controls aren’t consistent across games, and it can be hard to figure out what does what. Many iPad and iPhone games don’t extend controller support through menus, so you’re still going back and forth to the touchscreen. The companion app is handy, but not optimized for the new devices. Shoulder buttons and triggers are mushy. The four numbered lights on the front are totally inscrutable—sometimes they mean battery, sometimes they show you’re connected, but you never know what you’re seeing.

It may seem weird that Apple would release a new type of product unannounced, and it may also seem weird that the company chose to enter the competitive market of battery cases. But given Apple’s track record of trying out new things, and the fact that anything with that logo will sell, maybe this isn’t that surprising. Sure, you could speculate that Apple created the Smart Battery Case to supplement the unimpressive battery life of the iPhone 6s, but don’t mistake this as an admittance of failure. It’s more likely an attempt by Apple to branch out into a potential new market—right in time for the holidays. But is it worth your money? WIRED This case is designed to be forgotten about. Just put it on and enjoy the extra battery life. There are no indicator lights that show the case’s battery, and no on/off switch that will initiate charge, instead the case acts like it’s part of your battery. If you put your phone in the case when it has less than 100 percent, the case will start to charge it. When the case’s battery is gone, your iPhone will use its own battery. How do you know what percentage the case is at? Pull down the Notification Center and an icon will appear near the top telling you how much juice is left in your phone and case. It’s a cool little detail that shows off Apple’s inter-device compatibility, but it’s also the only way you can gauge the case’s battery. The case has a Lightning port for charging, which means you can plug in your iPhone in its case and charge both at the same time. This adds to the illusion that your case becomes one with your iPhone, and you never have to take it off. Besides performance, the material is quite nice. The silicone is super soft and feels like much higher quality than a lot of cheap silicone cases on the market. The case also manages to walk the middle ground between the slipperiness of a naked iPhone 6s, and those high-friction cheap silicone cases that are hard to pull out of tight pockets. It isn’t too bulky either, like a lot of battery cases out there, so you might get accustomed to the way it feels in your front pocket (depending on how tight your skinny jeans are). TIRED OK, so there’s no ignoring that hump. Apple was so focused on making their new iPhones as sleek as possible that it seems comical that their battery case has a strange-looking growth on its backside. Personally, it reminds me of an Almond Joy, except Almond Joys are delicious. But even if you get over the hump, the performance of the case isn’t that great. The 1,877 mAh battery won’t even give you a full charge from zero percent. Even if you don’t need that much charge, it puts the Apple case at a distinct disadvantage compared to other battery cases. And compared to other battery cases, this one is not cheap. The Smart Case sells for $99, which can get you a Mophie Juice Pack Air case with much better battery life (and no hump). Or you can buy a Mophie Juice Pack Reserve for $60 that has a comparable 1,840 mAh battery. It may seem harsh to keep bringing up Mophie, but you have to consider your options. The lack of buttons and indicators on the battery case also mean you don’t have any say in when your phone should be charging. If you’re used to other battery cases, this lack of control may be unsettling. If you like to your battery case on and off to give it a little bit of juice when needed, this case isn’t for you. But if you just want a case to put on once and never think about, then maybe this is worth the $99. RATING 6/10—A solid product with some issues Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Of course you do—the speaker was a hit a few years ago, and it was everywhere. An extension of the headphone brand, it came with that brash sound, that brash red “b” logo, and of course it fit inside this thing, which is certainly the silliest accessory in the history of mobile audio. Oh yeah and also, that Pill didn’t sound very good. Now that Apple has bought the company, we’re starting to see some of Cupertino’s product design savvy rub off on the Beats hardware. This new speaker, the Pill+, features not only a revamped design, but also a revamped audio engine and feature set. It’s too pricey at $230, but if you’re all-in on Apple hardware, the Pill+ is a nice companion to your iOS devices. WIRED Sound is very good, and on par with the best of the Bluetooth speakers of this size. New design is sharp—it comes in white or black, and the “b” logo is now much more subtle (and no longer red). Mobile app to control it works on iOS and Android. It has that now seemingly ubiquitous feature where you can pair multiple devices so you and your friends can take turns playing songs. Works as a speakerphone. Wirelessly join two speakers into a stereo pair. Charges over Lightning, so the 12-hour battery rejuices quickly, and the speaker’s battery can be used to charge your iPhone—just flip the cable around. TIRED It’s too expensive. There are a few speakers with better battery and comparable sound (some fully waterproof) for $30 less. The inclusion of the Lightning cable and 12.5-watt Apple charger is probably the reason for this, but if you don’t own any iOS devices, those things don’t matter as much. The sound can get kinda crunchy if you turn it up to levels sufficient to be heard in a small gathering of chatty friends. It’s the same with many small speakers, but here it’s more noticeable.

But many artists still prefer to use a pen and paper to draw or sketch. Wacom’s latest product is something that might be a better fit for them. The Bamboo Spark ($160) bridges the divide between the analog sketchbook and the digital sketchbook by tracking your pen strokes on real paper, then transmitting the results to your device. It’s three pieces: a folio with a receiver inside, a ballpoint pen with a transmitter inside, and a pad of regular paper. We’ve seen devices like this before—products that let you write or draw something on a piece of paper, then create a digital copy—but few have been executed this successfully. WIRED The device pairs to a mobile phone via Bluetooth, and transfers take only a few seconds per page. (Wacom’s app works on iOS and Android.) Within the mobile app, you can “replay” each line in your drawing, undoing each pen stroke and stopping at any time to export the page in that particular state. The case’s memory holds 100 pages, so you can sync in batches. Wacom offers cloud storage for Bamboo Spark pages, and the files are easily shared to Dropbox, to Evernote, or as PDFs. The feel of the pen is nice; better than a cheap ballpoint pen, with a nice girth and weight. (Wacom knows pens!) Battery in the folio lasts weeks between charges. Folios come in three configurations to hold a phone, a small tablet, or an iPad Air 2. TIRED The system tracks each stroke with perfect accuracy—as long as you don’t accidentally bump your pad of paper. In that case, the digital copy of the drawing will be off. If you anticipate this happening, I recommend securing the pad with a binder clip or rubber band. Not ideal, but it keeps the thing put. If you don’t like the pen, there isn’t much for you here. The company is positioning the product not only as an artist’s tool, but also as a platform for visual thinkers in the business world. So, while the pen is ideal for sketching flowcharts and brainstorming concepts, those looking for a more refined drawing tool may feel constrained. Same with the size of the paper—there’s a slot in the case where you can insert a backing board for a tablet of standard A5 paper, but bigger pads won’t work, and neither will those thicker than 50 pages. If the battery runs out mid-drawing, Welp! RATING 8/10 – Excellent, with room to kvetch Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. artists capsule reviews pens Wacom Skip Social.

The first version had an expandable back. When you popped out the box-like extrusion, it increased the interior volume of the speaker enclosure and improved the sound. It also changed the footprint of the speaker, allowing you to tip it back so the drivers were facing at an upward angle. This new Sound Kick 2 doesn’t expand or blow up or anything, but it does still tip back. The expanding enclosure has been replaced by a fixed enclosure that has a little kickstand. Overall, the updated speaker is more portable and has excellent sound, and it remains one of our favorite options at $100. WIRED Sound is crisp and well-balanced, and exemplary for a speaker of this size. New design is 1.5 inches thick, and has rounded edges. It’s also water resistant—I left my test unit out in the rain for two downpours and it still plays fine. There’s a USB port on the back that lets you use the speaker’s battery to charge up a dying mobile phone if needed. The kickstand on the back gives the speaker box some added stability. Touch controls on the top are convenient. Handsome looks. TIRED Doesn’t get that loud. It’s also not as small as other speakers at this price that tout portability as a primary feature. Battery lasted about 8.5 hours in multiple tests; fine, but over ten hours is standard within this category. Not fully waterproof (though it seems to handle wet environments just fine).

So it shouldn’t surprise you that it’s the first out of the gate with an add-on to support the new, bigger iPad Pro, where these keyboards are more important than ever. The $150 Logi Create Backlit Keyboard Case with Smart Connector is cheaper than Apple’s Smart Keyboard, and adds a lot more functionality. (Logi also offers a virtually identical case, sans keyboard, for $80.) It’s not quite as sleek and well-integrated as Apple’s own case, but if you’re looking to buy an iPad Pro to replace your laptop, this is the keyboard accessory you want. WIRED The row of shortcut keys—for changing volume, going home, launching search, and the like—is unbelievably useful. The backlit keyboard will let you work even in dark rooms. If you’re not typing, the case folds almost flat for a better touchscreen experience. The clacky keys will feel familiar to anyone used to a laptop keyboard. Since it works with the iPad Pro’s Smart Connector, getting the keyboard set up and working takes no time at all, and you’ll never need to charge the accessory. Just close the magnetized case, and the tablet turns off too. TIRED Getting the iPad Pro into the case requires an uncomfortable amount of shoving and pushing. Keys are a little mushy. The rubbery design takes away from the sleek polish of the iPad Pro. Tablet plus case is a pretty heavy package to toss into your backpack. The case covers up the power and volume buttons with harder-to-press rubber ones, and obscures the speaker holes a little bit. The connector can be finicky, disconnecting for no reason sometimes. A few of the buttons are inscrutable; why are there two ways to switch to the on-screen keyboard? RATING 7/10—Very good, but not quite great. Go Back to Top.

Facebook Twitter 200 Email Print Comments 0 hello Article to: (required) Article from: (required) Add a message (optional) Success - Article sent! close Uber took this driverless car, a Volvo, out for a test drive in San Francisco this week. The ride-hailing company is attempting to launch a self-driving service in the city. Associated Press   By Keith Naughton and David Welch Bloomberg News When cars drive themselves, passengers may not care if they ride in a Chevy or a Ford. After a century of building automotive brands based on how they drive, carmakers face an existential threat in the coming age of autonomy. If a customer no longer pilots a vehicle, the marque of its maker may become irrelevant. After all, most people don't reserve a flight because it's on a Boeing or an Airbus, so automakers are trying to turn today's cars into a connected extension of the home or office to keep their names vital. "In the long term, automotive brands are gone," said retired General Motors Vice Chairman Bob Lutz, 84, who greenlighted BMW's "The Ultimate Driving Machine" slogan when he ran global marketing for the German automaker in the 1970s. "If you get on a city bus or an airplane, do you care who made it? There won't be anything left to car brands in 20 years." Any diminution of automotive brands would be a seismic shift for the industry. Car companies have derived much of their strength and earnings power from the value of their makes and models. The world's top 15 automotive brands are worth a combined $256 billion, with Toyota alone valued at $53.6 billion, according to marketing consultant Interbrand. Since the dawn of driving, auto marques have pitched themselves with their mechanical prowess, from Volkswagen's "Drivers Wanted" slogan to the "Have You Driven a Ford Lately?" tagline and Mazda's catchy "Zoom, Zoom" campaign. Lately, though, carmakers have pushed built-in technology like Wi-Fi as a selling point. That approach pits them against tech giants Google and Apple Inc., which are accelerating their own research into self-driving cars. Promoting comfort When autonomous vehicles begin to hit the road in the next decade, it's not yet clear that legacy auto brands will take top billing on the hood of those cars, said Mark Short, a global automotive and transportation leader for consultant Ernst & Young. "The biggest question on the table today: Is it going to be a Chevy powered by Apple or is it going to be an Apple vehicle or a Google vehicle?" Short said. Eventually, Ford Motor Co. and other carmakers hope to offer people access to all forms of mobility -- driverless cars, robot taxis, trains, bikes and buses -- from the touch of an app that would bear their brands. Initially, though, automakers will promote the comforts that make their self-driving cars stand out. GM President Dan Ammann points to how airlines differentiate themselves with their services and amenities. He cites Singapore Airlines Ltd., which advertises the showers, enclosed passenger compartments and lounges it offers to its first-class fliers. "It will be about connectivity, comfort and all of that," Ammann said. Mobile office Connectivity in the car will grow to become a $750 billion business by 2030, according to consulting firm McKinsey & Co. GM is counting on connecting with customers with a deal with AT&T Inc. to offer Wi-Fi hot spots in cars to build on the 12 million autos it's already outfitted with internet connections. GM also developed a partnership with IBM Watson that can mine a car's data and figure out a driver's preferences and habits. Using artificial intelligence, a car's interactive infotainment system will then be able to direct the driver to gas stations, restaurants and other products and services their driving and shopping patterns suggest they need, said Mark Lloyd, GM's consumer online officer. Automakers are already showing concepts of how autonomous cars could be used as a mobile office or a comfy living room on wheels. Mercedes-Benz's F 015 concept features four seats that face each other while the walls of the oval-shaped luxury cruiser are covered with six digital tablets that communicate with the outside world. The idea is to create an experience that could take the role of a short flight, said Michael Hafner, director of driver-assistance systems and active safety for Mercedes. "It's how comfortable a passenger is and how nicely the car takes turns," Hafner said. "There are things that we do with our cars and suspensions that make them more comfortable. That will be important, and it makes the difference with brands." Two roads Hakan Samuelsson, chief executive officer of the Volvo Car Group, sees automotive brands heading down two roads in the coming age -- sticking a company's badge on the nose of robo-taxis as well as on self-driving cars that are privately owned. To that end, Volvo is supplying self-driving cars to Uber Technologies Inc. for a test that the ride-hailing service is running in Pittsburgh. GM and Toyota Motor Corp. also have vehicles in similar tests to get their brands in front of ride-sharing consumers. Volvo plans to take the model it puts in robo-taxi fleets and add features to make it a premium car that it would sell to affluent suburban families. The principal selling point would be a full autopilot system, a $10,000 option, that wouldn't require the driver to take the wheel in an emergency, Samuelsson said. Such a car will be on the road in five years, he said. "To make a premium car even more premium, you would offer a full autopilot, not a supervised version, but really one where you can sit back and watch a movie," Samuelsson said. "Nobody will buy an autopilot that you have to supervise." Brand trust In the autonomous race, car marques have a key advantage: trust. Luxury and established brands are viewed more favorably by consumers than tech companies, in part because of the safety reputation automotive brands have built up over decades, according to a recent survey by the consultant PricewaterhouseCoopers. "When you have no control and you're putting your life purely in the hands of a robot, you care even more about the credibility of that brand," said Evan Hirsh, an adviser to auto executives at Strategy&, a unit of PwC. "I'm not sure how much confidence I would have in a Lenovo car." Building a trust bridge to the future is an important element of brand-building that has already started. In the meantime, carmakers are trying to figure out what the self-driving car of tomorrow will look like. At GM, designers use cardboard and furniture to mock up future cabins that will keep people coming back for their cars. And they rest knowing they have time to figure it out before the robots take over, said chief designer Mike Simcoe. "People will still be driving for a long time," Simcoe said.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Dec 17, 2016 at 6:42AM Analysts with BlueFin Research Partners say that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) will begin manufacturing Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) A11 processor in late April (via Barron's). The A11, BlueFin says, will be manufactured in TSMC's 10-nanometer manufacturing technology. Interestingly, BlueFin says -- as is widely expected -- that Apple's A11 chip won't be the first processor to ramp into production on TSMC's 10-nanometer technology in 2017. The A10X that will power next-generation iPad models, as well as MediaTek's upcoming Helio X30 mobile applications processor, should ramp up before the A11 does, BlueFin's commentary suggests.  "This may be fortuitous for [TSMC] given that yields are well below 50% presently, according to our research," the analysts write. In this article, I'd like to go over why, if the reported yield rate is correct, this is, in fact, "fortuitous" for TSMC. Image source: Apple.  Understanding semiconductor manufacturing economics When a chipmaker builds a wafer of chips, there will inevitably be chips that come off the wafer either totally broken or simply without meeting performance or power specifications. The percentage of usable chips of all the chips produced from a given wafer is known as the manufacturing yield rate. Since it costs a fixed amount to produce a finished wafer of chips, the effective manufacturing cost of a chip is directly related to the number of chips that come off a wafer. So, for a given chip design, a lower yield rate means more expensive chips, while a higher yield rate means cheaper chips. So, what does this have to do with TSMC? Well, TSMC generally sells wafers rather than individual chips to its customers, but if yields are as bad as they sound right now (sub-50% is really bad), then it's likely that any potential customers aren't going to be willing to pay as much per wafer as they would if a higher percentage of the chips worked. Lower revenue per wafer, if wafer costs are fixed, translates into relatively low gross profit margins on those wafer sales. A10X and Helio X30 are small potatoes; A11 requires tons of volume The first TSMC 10-nanometer products should be the Apple A10X and the Helio X30, both of which should be low-volume products compared with the A11. This suggests that the early 10-nanometer shipment volumes for TSMC should be relatively modest and comprise a small portion of its overall revenue until the A11 chips start to ship in significant quantities. What this means is that TSMC can deal with reduced margins on those early 10-nanometer wafer shipments without diluting its overall gross profit margins too much. However, when it comes time to start mass-producing the A11 and shipping those wafers to Apple in the large quantities required to support the iPhone 8, the yield rate is going to need to come up substantially for TSMC to be able to both enjoy strong margins on those products and simply meet Apple's demand. Remember, if yield rates are low, then the effective number of chips that a chipmaker can produce on that low-yielding technology is reduced for a fixed amount of capacity (and capacity can't be put in place overnight). Not being able to meet Apple's unit demands would be a negative for TSMC, as it might drive Apple to be more aggressive about trying to find a second source for future chips (as it did with the A9 chip, which was manufactured by both TSMC and its rival Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF)). It'd also be a negative for Apple, as a chip-related supply bottleneck would reduce the number of iPhone 8 models that it'd be able to ship during the all-important holiday season.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Tech News Downloads Software Store Search for: BetaNews Hot Topics: Windows 10 Microsoft Apple Cloud Tablets Android Security Reviews Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Linked-in RSS I chose MacBook Pro with Touch Bar over Surface Book By Joe Wilcox Published 3 weeks ago 69 Comments Tweet Water smacked the windshield -- a torrent of heavy droplets -- as my wife struggled to feed money into the tollbooth machine. Pelting rain is uncommon during November in San Diego, but we had purpose for driving 36 km through the downpour to Chula Vista and the Otay Ranch Apple Store, where I had never been before. The shop was the only one around that had the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar in stock. Eleven days earlier, Nov. 15, 2016, I received the 13.3-inch model that was ordered on October 27th. While first impressions were wow, the laptop felt slow compared to my previous MBP, and the battery drained in about half the time as specs stated. I worried that Apple produced a defective unit. No store in the area had the smaller laptop in stock, should I want to take advantage of the 14-day return policy. Deadline approached, so I considered as alternative my first 15-incher in more than a decade, tempted in part by quad-core processor and discreet graphics. If Not One, The Other Fast-forward to the present, briefly: In recent days I've seen some stories about shorter-than-expected MBP battery life; customers complain. Hardware is suspected (when isn't it in click-bait news stories). Following a fresh macOS Sierra install on the 13.3-inch laptop and transferring my wife's settings and software from an older MBP, battery life is workday-long-plus. Perhaps the computer had bad factory-installed image or, more likely, despite my sleuthing around for a culprit, something in my setup sucked CPU cycles and energy. (I did investigate!) So if your new MacBook Pro burns the candle quick, check the wick! Returning to weltering November 26th, I stood over the larger MacBook Pro, in awe and despair. The thing felt fast -- almost mind-reading AI-fashion, anticipating keystrokes before I made them. But the screen was huge. Even 13.3 inches is larger than my preference; gimme a laptop that's easily grab-and-go. But the longer time I spent touching and adjusting, perhaps 45 minutes, the more comfortable the laptop became. Decision: Understanding that the computer could be returned within 14 days and recognizing replacement MBP 13 order wouldn't ship, according to Apple Store online, for 4 weeks or more, I made the purchase. My initial angst dissipated within hours after returning home and setting up MBP 15. I have no regrets. Size Matters The 13.3-inch MacBook Pro I had ordered from Apple Store online was a custom config: 2.9GHz Core i5 processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. The laptop replaced my early 2015 model, with 3.1GHz Core i7 chip, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD. My college student daughter accepted the hand-me-down, replacing her somewhat banged and scratched 2013 Apple laptop, with 2.6GHz Core i5 processor, 8GB memory, 256GB SSD. I was surprised how the newer laptop seemed slower than the old. Granted, the comparison was i5 and i7, but also different generation Intel processors. If not MBP 15, I was ready to return the 13.3-incher for refund. Considering how much I had already spent on the 13.3-inch MacBook Pro, a few extra hundred for a lot more computer wasn't a mental (or budgetary) stretch. But I would never spend so much without first experiencing the thing. Understanding: I would return the smaller notebook for refund. Hence, the rainy road trip. Config: 2.7GHz Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, 2GB Radeon Pro 455 graphics, 512GB SSD. The CPU is quad-core, and the difference is quite noticeable compared to MBP 13's dual-core processor. This beauty is a multi-tasking maven like nothing groped by my grubby paws. This also marks the most money I have spent on a laptop. Ever. The custom-configured 13-incher totaled $2,199,  and the larger $2,799. Why MBP? By now you must wonder: "Why?" Well, it ain't for the Touch Bar, which isn't as useless as I expected. The brighter (500-nit), more color accurate screen checks one box.  More significantly, I've pined for Apple's butterfly keyboard since its debut on the 12-inch MacBook, which is way, way underpowered for my daily computing requirements. MBP 15 doesn't disappoint. Typing experience on the second-generation butterfly is absolutely fantastic. While the keys are noisy, they deliver great feel and responsiveness. But in choosing to spend so much more, I also opted for other benefits: greater default, native screen resolution (2880 by 1800); quad-core processor; discreet graphics; and expansive, capable touchpad, among them. Features are meaningless without benefits, and I have some in mind. In late October, I fully returned to work after a forced summer sabbatical related to eye surgery that lets me wear glasses to read but frees me from them for distance. I’m ready to write, write, write, and MacBook Pro with Touch Bar feels -- figuratively -- like the tool to do just that. I am doing more photography and video production, and producing a podcast. I need a laptop that can keep up with several projects open and ongoing simultaneously, without stutters and stops that interrupt my workflow and more importantly disrupt my attention. I'm an older writer now, and interruption can leave a crater where my creative flow was. The bigger screen, and even physical size, better suit my needs than the 13.3-incher. How strange; I thank Apple's supply shortages for putting me in position to challenge my preconceptions and go larger when the market trend is smaller laptops. The other mental barrier: Cost, as I couldn't have ever proactively conceived spending so much on a laptop -- and, honestly, wouldn't if not for bent-up desire to produce content following the summer sabbatical. I feel happy typing on the new MBP, for its dazzling beauty and also for how the Touch Bar contextually changes depending on application or what I’m doing. (You’ll have to wait for my full review for more on the feature.) Joy is a benefit often overlooked by high-tech product designers. Scratching the Surface Surely other laptops could do as much for the same cost, or even less. Yup, I seriously considered Surface Book, about which Microsoft's Brian Hall raved two days ago: "The innovation of Surface coupled with the disappointment of the new MacBook Pro -- especially among professionals -- is leading more and more people to make the switch to Surface". He then linked to PC Mag story "Why I Left macOS for a Surface Book", which begins "The Mac is in trouble". Sascha Segan's experience with the butterfly keyboard differs from mine: "I just couldn't get with the super-flat keyboards. I pound out words all day, and getting rid of almost all the throw on the keys was pretty much a deal breaker". As I writer, I understand the sentiment but, as previously mentioned, have much different experience than does the PC Mag analyst. There is much to like about Surface Book, which I see as the only meaningful competitor to either size MacBook Pro. The design is delightful eye candy, and the 3:2 screen ratio is much better suited to writing and researching content in a web browser (MBP is 16:10). Maximum resolution of the gorgeous 13.5-inch screen, which is fully touch-capable: 3000 by 2000 (MBP 13 is 2560 by 1600 and 2880 by 1800 for the larger). Touch is a bonus if you need it, then there is the stylus. I'm a terrible artist and handwriter. I started using a typewriter at age 14 -- during the mid-1970s -- because my penmanship is so terrible. As such, the stylus has little appeal, while the touchscreen is a nice-to-have that I learned from using Chromebook Pixel and other Windows laptops isn't a necessity. For me. As a middle-aged typist writer, keyboard matters much, and the MBP Touch Bar promises to expand what my fingers can do across the plane where they are constantly active. If I were another person, with different priorities and (artistic) capabilities, Surface Book might be the thing. Apple offers one port-type on new MacBook Pros: USB Type-C (aka Thunderbolt 3), whereas Microsoft serves up the smorgasbord of connection options most people will want. Sixth-generation Intel Core chips are standard from both companies. Cost Comparisons Surface Book pricing is similar or close between comparable configurations for either size MBP. That is when I purchased either. Microsoft is sale crazy during the holidays (don't ever expect deals from Apple). For example: $1999 for MBP 13 or SB with Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD. Of course, Microsoft serves up stylus and touchscreen instead of Apple's tiny Touch Bar -- and the display converts into a tablet (that is too large for my tastes). With i7 chip and double the RAM: $2,499 for the Apple and $2,699 for the Microsoft, but currently discounted to $2,299. While screen sizes mis-match, here's Surface Book with Performance Base compared to MBP 15: Core i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD -- both for $2,799. SB has touchscreen and stylus, but the MacBook Pro packs quad-core processor. For my needs, speed, professional graphics, and bigger screen matter more. And something else that strangely is the opposite of Sascha Segan's deal-breaker: I find typing on the Surface Book keyboard troubling in manner similar to his complaints about MacBook Pro's butterfly; there's too much travel. Ha! Hey, this is why companies can compete: Different priorities and tastes among potential users. Fanboys, don't get into a pissing match about which is better. Because both matter right now, and Microsoft gets good bang from the competition between them. Earlier today I asked Stephen Baker, NPD vice president and primary hardware analyst, about MacBook Pro and Surface Book sales. They are "key parts of the turnaround in the consumer PC market in terms of pointing it in a more premium direction", he says. "While they aren’t the share leaders, the advertising being spent and the marketing have helped lift all the Windows boats—and it of course hasn’t hurt that all the Windows brands have stepped up their premium product development". Wrapping up, the best laptop is the one with the benefits that matter most to you. That's how I came to choose 15.4-inch MacBook Pro -- and love it. Hehe. Who knows, maybe in an alternate universe, heavy rains led my wife and I to drive to closer-distance Fashion Valley Mall, where there is Microsoft Store, inside which an irresistible Surface Book offer hypnotized me.

Some things have been streamlined for the touch screen. Courtesy of Nintendo Super Mario Run players collect coins throughout the game that feed your rebuilding efforts. Coins of different colors let you buy buildings and other swag to decorate and rebuild your kingdom. Courtesy of Nintendo   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Nintendo is really getting serious about its play for mobile screens, launching its first real smartphone game starring its most iconic character: Mario. The app, called Super Mario Run, hit Apple's App Store on Thursday. For Nintendo fans everywhere, it's the end of a long wait that started when the app was announced at Apple's annual iPhone launch event in September. It's also a key moment for Nintendo, which has had a hard time dealing with the shift to casual gaming on smartphones and has resisted calls to put its classic characters into apps. Smartphones have introduced more people than ever to games -- as the Pokémon Go craze illustrated -- but can also shift buyers away from game consoles and handheld devices such as Nintendo's 3DS. By making a mobile game, Nintendo is saying that it's finally ready to imagine an audience beyond its own hardware. So far, so good. Super Mario Run is a lot of fun. The designers have managed to make a game that blends nostalgia and the new technology of the touch screen well. The story, such as it is, is exactly the same -- Bowser has taken Princess Peach and you have to save her -- and you also must rebuild your kingdom. The setting is familiar, and goombas and koopas are still trying to block your way to your goal. Longtime Nintendo fans with memories of gripping their Super Nintendo controllers will see a lot they already love. But this time, they can play with one hand. This is not simply a classic Super Mario game transported to the iPhone. Some things have been streamlined for the touch screen. Super Mario Run is an endless running game, which means you're almost always running forward. That could frustrate some players who might wonder why they can't move Mario all the ways they could when he was an 8-bit sprite. You can't go back and pick up coins you missed. You can't take little jaunts down the pipes. What you can do is jump. A lot. Tapping the screen will make Mario catch some air -- the longer you hold down your finger, the higher he goes before gravity kicks in. He can also vault off cliff edges and walls, which lets you reach higher places in the levels. Once you accept your perpetual forward motion, figuring out how to get where you want to go becomes a fun puzzle. Players will definitely get replay value out of the game, especially since it's easy to run past things you might want to pick up. Going through a level again will let you go down roads not traveled before. Players also collect different-colored coins throughout the game, and the color and placement of those coins changes as you meet your objectives. So even if you play a level again, you should find something new. The coins feed your rebuilding efforts. Coins of different colors let you buy buildings and other swag to decorate and rebuild your kingdom. There's also a second mode to the app, called Rally, which pits you against another real-world player and helps you win residents for your kingdom. You're scored on how many normal coins you collect, as well as how much flair you exhibit while you're racing. Over time, you can restore and repopulate your little patch of the world. The main drawback of Super Mario Run is that, in its free version, it's very short. The free download gets you only three levels -- that doesn't even get you to the first castle. The full version of the game costs $10. That price would probably feel right on an e-store for the 3DS or the Wii, and there is enough to do in the app to justify that price tag. But people who play games on smartphones have different expectations, and $10 is a lot to swallow when most other games are free or, at a stretch, $2. In some ways, the high app price could be seen as a signal that Nintendo, while definitely coming around on smartphones, still doesn't get the platform -- or, at least, hasn't fully given in to it. It is obvious that mobile games are going to be just a part of Nintendo's future, since the firm is on the verge of introducing a new console called the Switch. For most players, though, the high mobile price tag means they'll get a taste of how fun Mario could be on the smartphone, but stop short of paying to see his full potential.

 How the hot startup that stole Apple's thunder wound up in Silicon Valley's graveyard Steve Kovach Dec. 17, 2016, 8:00 AM 107,813 facebook linkedin twitter email print Eric Migicovsky Craig Barritt/Getty Images for AOL Inc. For a moment, it looked like the story would have a happy ending. As struggling smartwatch maker Pebble discussed selling itself to Fitbit, a larger competitor in the wearable technology market, the chatter among the Pebble team was that they would continue working on their product under the wing of a new, more stable corporate parent. Fitbit’s co-founder James Park even visited Pebble’s offices and, following a brief introduction from Pebble CEO Eric Migicovsky, talked reassuringly about how excited he was to welcome Pebble into the Fitbit family. But within a month it became apparent that Fitbit’s $40 million acquisition wasn’t a lifeline for Pebble, it was a fire sale. Choice assets and employees were cherry picked, the rest discarded. Most employees out of Pebble's staff of about 100 were laid off, their stock suddenly worthless. It was a sad ending for a company once seen as a brilliant example of Silicon Valley chutzpah, a scrappy startup that had forced tech giants like Apple, Samsung, and Google to play catch-up. But it also capped a tumultuous year of poor sales, supplier problems, failed acquisition talks, and a general lack of consumer interest in smartwatches, according to several sources that Business Insider spoke to.  "By the time we got into late spring and june of this year, I was like, OK, it does not look good," one Pebble insider said. "I didn't think we were going to make it to 2017. It was dragged out forever." At a time when Silicon Valley is racing towards the next big thing, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars, the demise of Pebble is a stark reminder that even the most promising and buzzed about innovations don’t always survive the harsh realities of the marketplace. Early success According to the sources Business Insider spoke to, the signs of trouble for Pebble began to appear early on, though they were often ignored among the excitement of a nascent smartwatch business that many believed would be as big as smartphones. Pebble burst on to the scene in 2012 after launching what was then the most successful Kickstarter campaign in history, raising $10.2 million to fund the production of the first smartwatch. Pebble proved there was interest in the wrist-worn gadgets, well before Apple introduced the Apple Watch and other big tech companies followed suit. The first Pebble launched in early 2013 to positive reviews. Although it appealed mainly to techies, the product was a solid first attempt at a modern smartwatch. The watch could display notifications like incoming texts and calendar alerts and run a bunch of apps ranging from ESPN to Evernote. Pebble continued to launch new products, including the Pebble Time, the first device with Pebble’s new take on a smartwatch operating system. Antonio Villas-Boas/Tech Insider But things started getting hairy in 2015 when Apple, the world's largest technology company, released its long-awaited smartwatch.  Migicovsky was unfazed by the new competition, telling Business Insider shortly after the Apple Watch was announced that he wasn't worried Apple might cut into his sales. "I think it will drive a lot more interest and a lot more volume at Pebble."  The Apple Watch did initially boost interest in Pebble, as consumers viewed Pebble's product as a cheaper, more capable alternative. But sales eventually began to shrink, sources say. Apple's brand was so strong, recalls one insider, that it sucked up all the oxygen.  And Apple's decades of product-building experience gave it another big advantage. Sources familiar with Pebble's supply chain said the company had difficulty paying suppliers building the products in Taiwan throughout 2015, especially payments related to production of the Pebble Time Round. In some cases, these suppliers would call for payments on outstanding purchase orders and get no response from Pebble. Some of those outstanding orders still remained unpaid by the time Fitbit entered acquisition talks with Pebble. Some people close to the company also blamed Pebble's supply chain team for playing favorites, attempting to move a lot of production from Taiwan-based Quanta Computer to Compal Electronics. Pebble continued to raise money through Kickstarter, sales of current products, and other private sources. But it wasn't enough to fund the production of new products.   The expected wave of consumer demand for smartwatches never materialized; even Apple appeared to be having trouble convincing the world that a smartwatch — like the iPhone — was another must-have gadget. The market was not as big as everyone had hoped, and the market was getting crowded. Layoffs and deal talks When Pebble's head of sales sent an email to his team after the Black Friday/Cyber Monday holiday shopping weekend in 2015, there was no more ignoring the magnitude of the problem. Sales during the biggest shopping weekend of the year were down from the year before. If things didn't improve, the email warned ominously, adjustments would have to be made.  Apple CEO Tim Cook unveils the Apple Watch Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Pebble's business never fully rebounded, and internal discussions began after the holiday shopping season about what changes needed to happen so that the company could survive. In March of 2016, Pebble laid off 25% of its staff, as Business Insider first reported. Pebble began searching for more outside investment or a possible buyer. One insider said they were asked to compile internal data about sales, which fueled speculation Pebble was trying to sell itself. By May of 2016, Migicosvky admitted to the staff that the company was trying to sell, but that a deal had recently fallen through. That deal turned out to be from chipmaker Intel, which wanted to buy Pebble for about $70 million. It's not clear why the deal fizzled, although it was Intel that ultimately walked away, not Pebble. (The Pebble side wanted the deal to happen.) One source close to Migicovsky said they were told that Intel's offer was initially higher than $70 million, but was lowered after due diligence. "Something rubbed him the wrong way and he was uncomfortable," the source close to Migicovsky said regarding the failed Intel deal. A high-profile collaboration with Japanese watchmaker Citizen also proved disappointing.  Pebble had hoped to learn from Citizen's expertise building and designing traditional watches. But throughout the development of the Time Round — a version of the Pebble watch with a circular screen that the two companies collaborated on — the Pebble team felt that Citizen lacked the technical chops in software and hardware development to be of much use, according to sources. Plus, Citizen typically took a lot longer to develop and launch products, often a year or more, which didn’t jibe with Pebble’s desire to push out new products faster. In the end, Pebble thought Citizen's designs were too thick and chunky and ultimately went with a design from internal Pebble employees. Pebble did pay Citizen about $50,000 for its work, according to one source with direct knowledge of the deal. Citizen did not respond to a request for comment. While TechCrunch reported that Citizen considered acquiring Pebble for roughly $740 million in 2015, no deal ever happened. One source directly familiar with Pebble's acquisition talks said Citizen never discussed buying Pebble, and accused someone of spreading a false rumor to TechCrunch. The Pebble Time Round, which was designed with help from Citizen. Antonio Villas-Boas/Tech Insider Facing the music Following the failed acquisition talks and the round of layoffs, Migicovsky leveled with his remaining employees late this spring. If they wanted to stay and see Pebble through to the end, their shares in the company would be doubled. If they wanted to cut their losses and leave, they would receive a severance package. While some took the buyout offer, most Pebble employees stuck with the company, hoping new products like the Pebble Time 2 watch and Pebble Core, a tiny device that lets you listen to Spotify music offline, would reinvigorate sales. In fact, Pebble Time 2 and Pebble Core were on track for their launch at the beginning of 2017. As recently as a week before discussions with Fitbit began, Pebble employees were visiting their manufacturing partners in Asia and finalizing production plans for the new devices, sources say. In a  recent  interview with  Steven Levy of Backchannel , Migicovsky said  he spent the summer months scrambling across the globe, trying unsuccessfully to raise money from private equity funds and other private investing groups.  Pebble was out of time and out of money. In October, at least one bank that gave  money to Pebble called in its loan, unconvinced Pebble would be able to raise more funding or sell enough product to solve its cash flow issues and debt to suppliers. Keep your resumes Once Migicovsky decided to sell the company, sources close to him say that his main goal was to find a buyer that would honor the consumers on Kickstarter who backed the Pebble Time 2 or Core — either by refunding their money or building the product.  The Pebble Core was canceled following Fitbit's acquisition. Pebble Fitbit turned out to be the only suitable buyer willing to do that. While the Time 2 and Core products have been canceled, Kickstarter backers will at least get their money back. Other aspects of the Fitbit deal have not unfolded as expected, however. The original deal discussions had Fitbit, which makes wearable products focused on health and fitness, acquiring all or most of Pebble, including the staff, several sources told Business Insider. But something changed as the deal was negotiated and Fitbit ended up buying only the software technology that runs Pebble's products and hiring certain employees.  One source speculated that Fitbit was worried about its stock price after delivering a disappointing sales forecast for the fourth quarter, which caused its stock to tank about 30%. Taking on all of Pebble could’ve looked extra risky to Fitbit investors. A Fitbit spokesperson declined to comment. On the day Fitbit’s team came to visit Pebble’s office about a month before the acquisition closed, many Pebble employees had concerns about what would happen to upcoming products. One source said Fitbit largely dodged those questions and that their true intentions didn’t come to light until they began interviewing Pebble employees. During the interviews, Fitbit quizzed Pebble employees on their roles at the company, but in the end Pebble employees learned there was no interest in the hardware team. Fitbit didn't even ask for resumes, according to one source, instead just pulling in their LinkedIn profiles. Once it became clear these interviews were going nowhere, Pebble hardware employees were encouraged to apply to open positions on Fitbit's website. By the time it was all over, most Pebble employees were sent home with severance packages. Many others took the Fitbit offer, and several former Pebble employees now list Fitbit as their employer on LinkedIn. As for Migicovsky, he'll be working at the startup incubator Y Combinator next year. Pebble's software may live on within Fitbit products, but it's now up to other companies to prove whether Pebble's pioneering product represents the future of computing or just an interesting footnote in history.

According to the report, the firms were asked if they would sell their services to help create a national Muslim registry -- an idea recently refloated by President-elect Donald Trump's transition team -- and only Twitter said no. Nearly 10 days later, Facebook broke the silence and said that it would not help US President-elect Donald Trump's administration to create a list of Muslims present in the US. In a statement to the Intercept, Facebook said: "No one has asked us to build a Muslim registry, and of course we would not do so."

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox News Tech Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air Tech Home Computers Google Video Games Military Tech War Games Slideshows Tablets 5 things you didn't know your tablet can do By Kim Komando Published December 17, 2016 The Kim Komando Show Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print  (Apple) It’s hard to believe the first iPad was released in 2010. We use tablets for entertainment, work and even to pay for a mocha at the local café. The device that once looked like science fiction is now a staple of American homes. But most of us don’t realize how many different ways we can use our tablets. Switch around a few settings or download the right app, and you can perform all kinds of digital magic tricks. Here are five things you didn’t know your tablet can do. 1. Use your computer from your tablet Desktops are a double-edged sword: They’re powerful and have large screens, but they also tend to sit in one place. What happens when you’re on the road and you need to nab some files that are sitting on your desktop at home or in the office? It’s not a problem if your tablet and PC or Mac are loaded with Splashtop. Simply download the free Splashtop Streamer software and install it on your desktop computer; then get the app for either iPad or Android; then create an account and log in to both devices for instant remote access. This way, you can be holding your tablet on a beach in Maui and be staring at your computer’s desktop back home in Minnesota. Related: Yahoo fesses up to another data breach - 1 billion customer accounts exposed Hide your email address on public sites How to delete your Facebook account The app costs $9.99, and an annual subscription costs $16.99. For folks who travel a lot or need regular access to files and software that aren’t portable, Splashtop Personal is a great way to go. Click here to learn more and get the direct download link for Android and iOS tablets. The Mac’s latest operating system, Sierra, also has a feature that allows you to keep your Documents and Desktop folders in the cloud (via iCloud Drive) and then access the files in them on your iPad or iPhone, too.   2. Transfer files wirelessly from your tablet to your computer Have you ever emailed a file, such as a photo or a document, to your Mac from your iPhone or iPad, even as you sit right in front of your Mac? Yes, I've done it too, just like nearly every other Apple user on the planet. That's because using email to move files around works pretty well as long as your file is small enough to be attached. There's a better way to move files among your gadgets or even among your friends. Apple AirDrop is a built-in feature that lets you seamlessly move files back and forth between nearby desktop Macs and iOS gadgets like iPad, iPhone or iPod touch. It’s a quick and convenient way to transfer files from an iOS gadget to a Mac using a Bluetooth connection. This is particularly handy for iPad owners, who can start AirDropping in a matter of seconds. To enable AirDrop on an iPad, swipe up on the Home screen to access the Control Panel. From here, you can set AirDrop to receive from Contacts Only, Everyone, or Off. Newer Mac computers also have this ability, and you can find AirDrop in Finder. Fun tip: AirDrop is also an especially efficient way to share photos between friends, as long as each person is using an iPhone or iPad and has AirDrop turned on.   Not to be outdone, Android tablets have a nearly identical system in a third-party app called Airmore. You can move music, movies, photos and apps from your Android tablet to any compatible device, along with your call logs and text messages. Click here to get more steps on how to use AirDrop and Airmore. 3. Turn your tablet into a powerful TV remote Tablets are designed to be intuitive, and sometimes they’re more intuitive than a time-tested gizmo like a TV remote. With the right system in place, you can replace your remote entirely. Some tablets are designed with television in mind. The Galaxy Tab, for example, has a built-in IR transmitter that you can use as a universal TV remote. As with your old-fashioned remote, you’ll have to aim the Tab directly at the TV. IPads and Androids don’t have an IR transmitter, but if you’re feeling handy, you can buy an external transmitter that attaches to the audio jack, just like your earbuds. There’s a more sophisticated way to control your television from a distance. You can invest in a Harmony Home Hub or the Bluemoo, which are designed to turn your smartphone or tablet into a remote control. Not only can you change channels on your TV, but you can activate any Bluetooth gadget in your home, including speakers, smart lamps, and security devices. The best part: You don’t have to aim your tablet at anything, you just have to be within the Bluetooth’s range. Click here for the details on controlling your TV and gadgets from your smartphone or tablet. 4. Show your photos and videos on your TV Many smart TVs already give you access to YouTube, Vimeo and Flickr, so you can easily upload your online content, including home videos, and watch them on your TV. But with your tablet, you don’t have to use these services. For example, if you have an iPad and Apple TV, you can use AirPlay to project your tablet’s display on the big screen. Just swipe upward from the bottom, and you’ll see the AirPlay icon. If you don’t have Apple TV, or you’re not near a Wi-Fi signal, you can find a VGA adaptor and plug your iPad directly into the set. For Android users, there’s another option: You can use an app called AllCast, which will connect your Android to many different services, including Amazon TV, Apple TV and Roku. Here’s a link to how to use it. 5. Tune your guitar Professional musicians tend to carry electronic guitar tuners. But if you’re a weekend strummer who wants a quick tune-up, or you want a backup device during your concert tour, look no further than Guitar Tuna, a free app for iOS and Android. Using your iPad or Android tablet’s built-in mic, Guitar Tuna is fast, accurate, and easy to use. What’s more, it works with all popular string-based instruments, from guitars and basses to ukuleles and mandolins. The app also has advanced tools, like a metronome, guitar learning tools and alternate guitar tunings. Click here so you never play out of tune again.

Both of these huge consumer electronics market players will be intending to innovate significantly with their next generation devices, so what can we expect from the iPhone 8 and Galaxy S8? Image Source: ReleaseDatePortal Galaxy S8 With the Galaxy S8 appearing earlier in the year, there is more information available regarding the Samsung flagship. Any innovations linked with this device are far more likely to be concrete, with Samsung expected to unveil the handset at the Mobile World Congress in February. Thus, it is interesting to note that a recent report has suggested that the Galaxy S8 will include Bluetooth 5.0 support. This will deliver greatly enhanced data transfer speeds, while also ensuring that longer range is possible for Galaxy S8 users. There is still a question mark regarding whether or not this will be included in the Galaxy S8, as the Bluetooth SIG consortium, which includes Samsung as a member, stating that it will arrive within two to six months. This suggests that the Galaxy S8 could be one of the first devices to benefit from Bluetooth 5.0, but it will depend on the technological logistics. Bezel-less display Samsung is also expected to slim down the bezels included in the Galaxy S8, and possibly even produce an edge-to-edge display. This is becoming increasingly voguish in the smartphone marketplace, with Apple also expected to significantly reduce the bezils in the iPhone 8. Home button Samsung is increasingly being linked with an eradication of the Home button in the Galaxy S8, again following on from rumors associated with the iPhone 8. This suggests that Samsung will embed the fingerprint sensor within the display glass at the bottom of the device. Dual assistants It is also expected that Samsung will launch artificial intelligence assistance with the Galaxy S8, and that this will be based around a dual assistant system. Samsung has already named the assistance that will be included with the Galaxy S8; Bixby and Kestra will thus provide male and female assistance as required. 4K resolution Samsung has been linked with producing a 4K resolution smartphone for some years now, and it could be that this finally comes to fruition when the Galaxy S8 is released. Samsung has typically saved its innovations for the Galaxy Note series, but considering the bad press that the corporation has suffered recently, it may be necessary for the Korean consumer electronics giant to really push the boat out with the Galaxy S8. Internal memory There have also been murmurings from close to the Samsung supply chain that the corporation will massively upgrade the memory of the Galaxy S8. This would enable Samsung to ensure that its next generation flagship is even slicker than previous well-reviewed models. Image Credit: Veniamin Geskin / Twitter iPhone 8 Recent iPhone releases have been criticized for being a little bit…well, boring. Apple has taken a conservative approach to its flagship smartphone range over the last couple of years, and Apple fans are hoping that it delivers something more revolutionary when the iPhone 8 is released. And indeed this is expected, considering that the iPhone 8 will mark a very special tenth generation for the world’s most successful smartphone. Wireless charging Firstly, Apple is reportedly working on a complete wireless charging solution for the iPhone 8. Apple has reportedly struck a deal with wireless charging company Energous, which will enable it to Include technology in the iPhone 8 which enables users to charge the device from 15 feet away. Single sheet of glass Another intriguing recent comment relates to Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive, who reportedly intends for the iPhone 8 “to appear like a single sheet of glass”. Slimming down bezels looks like being a signature of the smartphone marketplace this year, and a wraparound display is thus being prepared for the iPhone 8. Home button Apple has been linked with the elimination of the physical Home button from the iPhone 8 for some time, yet Apple has chosen not to pioneer this feature as of yet. This has effectively opened the door for Samsung to deliver this in the Galaxy S8 before Apple is able to do so. But the Touch ID fingerprint sensor will be embedded beneath the glass display of the iPhone 8, if recent reports are to be believed. Curved design When the iPhone 8 is released, consumers will have the choice of purchasing a curved screen device for the first time in Apple history. This innovation has proved hugely successful for Samsung, and now Apple wants to join in the curved display revolution. USB Type-C connectivity In addition to the wireless charging linked with the iPhone 8, it has also been suggested that Apple could switch from its Lightning port to a USB Type-C connection. This is perhaps has a relatively low chance of appearing in the iPhone 8 generation, but it is something that Apple is undoubtedly tinkering with behind the scenes. OLED display Apple has also been negotiating with various suppliers with the intention of including OLED technology in the iPhone series in the foreseeable future. This could occur for the first time with the iPhone 8, with OLED offering numerous advantages over the existing LCD technology included in the iPhone 8, as well as generally being considered to provide superior display quality. Dual lens standard It has been suggested in some quarters that Apple will arm every device in the iPhone 8 range with a dual-lens camera. This would not be an innovation as such, as the iPhone 7 featured dual cameras. But Apple could yet produce a smartphone with dual-lens technology. Battery life Finally, Apple is expected to seek both hardware and software solutions to producing an iPhone 8 with an increased battery life; a perennial bugbear of the smartphone range.

Has a Long Way to Go to Be Perceived as a Services Company But what if you considered part of the iPhone business as a service? Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Dec 17, 2016 at 9:30AM Image source: Apple. Over the past year or so, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has made a concerted effort to shift investor focus from unit sales and product cycles toward recurring-revenue sources like services and subscriptions. The iPhone maker started highlighting non-GAAP financial metrics like installed base purchases, which represented the gross value of digital content that users purchase in aggregate, irrespective of how those purchases end up being accounted for on Apple's financial statements. Interestingly, Apple didn't disclose this figure last quarter, but that could be more about the SEC's broader crackdown on non-GAAP metrics that's been going on all year. The company is still very much trying to highlight services growth, noting the services business hit an all-time record last quarter. Here's CEO Tim Cook on the last earnings call: We had a record-setting quarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion. App store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music.  ... We remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our growing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be the size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. For reference, the bar to make it into the Fortune 100 for 2016 was about $28.1 billion, and Apple's services revenue for fiscal 2016 was $24.3 billion. Goodbye, Gene Longtime Apple analyst Gene Munster is leaving Piper Jaffray to pursue a new career in venture capital, but the analyst is giving investors a parting research note. Munster has similarly taken note of how Apple has been trying to change investor perception, but the analyst believes that services will need to comprise at least 30% of revenue before investors start to "give it more credit." If Apple wanted to be classified as a services company, it would probably need to bring in half of revenue from services, in Munster's view. This percentage has been rising as Apple's services business grows, but services comprised just 11% of sales last fiscal year. So Apple still has a long way to go before investors start to give the segment any real respect (at least if we go by Munster's thresholds). Apple will need to come up with many more services if it hopes to get there. Apple Pay is growing, but the company has never really been too forthright about the mobile payment service's economics. Perhaps more importantly, it's really difficult to see a path toward services becoming this large in terms of the overall business, simply because the iPhone dominates Apple's financials...although in some contexts you could consider the iPhone itself as a service. iPhone-as-a-Service (iPaaS)? I know what you're thinking: The last thing we need is another "as-a-Service" acronym, and you're right. But hear me out. This isn't some new idea; investors have long relied on ongoing upgrades as part of the Apple thesis. But Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program is the clearest attempt to create long-term recurring revenue from annual upgrades in a structured way. Apple outsources the financing of this program to Citizens One, so for the most part it recognizes the related revenue upfront (net of a guarantee liability associated with the trade-in right). But I'd argue that iPhone Upgrade Program revenue could be considered a form of services revenue, even though it shows up as iPhone revenue. The AppleCare component of the iPhone Upgrade Program is likely already being classified as service, but you could effectively consider the hardware component recurring revenue, too. That rationale would also apply to customers that participate in early upgrade and leasing programs offered by carriers, which would shift the accounting to the carriers' balance sheets. The point is that you could take a subset of iPhone users that are committed to regular upgrades, either through Apple directly or via carrier programs, and arguably consider those sales as service given the long-term and recurring nature of the relationship. These data aren't available, but if you look at it this way, services actually comprise a larger percentage than what's officially reported. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Dec 17, 2016 at 10:00AM For over 15 years, David Allen has been sharing his insights on productivity with countless organizations and individuals via his Getting Things Done methodology. On this episode of Rule Breaker Investing, David Gardner welcomes Allen to the show to share the story of how he developed this expertise after working dozens of jobs and how Fools can apply his experience to their own lives. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Nov. 23, 2016. David Gardner: And welcome back to this week's Rule Breaker Investing podcast. I'm David Gardner. Happy Thanksgiving to all of us in the United States of America. Wherever you are, I hope you've had and are having a wonderful holiday. Well deserved, no doubt. So I'm really excited, once again, to have another great entrepreneur join us for this Entrepreneur Month for Rule Breaker Investing and it's David Allen. David Allen is somebody who, as you'll shortly discover, is a productivity coach and guru. Somebody who wrote a wonderful book called Getting Things Done -- a book that certainly improved my life. By the way, I never really like to say "changed" my life. I don't like the whole "change life." Really, when you think about it, everything that happens at any moment is changing your life, so whenever people say "that changed my life," that kind of rings hollow for me. I like to say -- and this isn't always true of things that change our lives -- it "improved" my life. And certainly Getting Things Done has done that immeasurably for me personally and so I'm excited to share David with you in case that feels relevant to you. In case that might be helpful to you, here, as we hit the busiest time of every year. At least for me, the busiest next six weeks of every year. So I hope you really enjoy this interview with David. David has a methodology called Getting Things Done. That is the name of his book. We're going to lightly speak to that. There's no real way to do an A to Z primer for that; however, I'm excited to say that David has generously agreed to do a Rule Breaker-extra. So this week as we sometimes have -- maybe every month or two -- we have an extra. Thank you to my producer, Rick Engdahl, for putting in some (speaking of extra) extra time during a busy week to make that happen for you. But yes, we're going to go over Getting Things Done in a little bit more detail. So if you're either new to the methodology and you're interested by what we talk about (as we talk about entrepreneurs this podcast), then you're going to want to listen to the extra this weekend. Or maybe you're an old GTDer, like me, and it's good to hear from the master himself. Brush up your Shakespeare a little bit and be reinspired, I think, by my conversation this weekend with David. I should note, though (I don't think there's anything particularly time bound about this) that we recorded this interview last week. __ Gardner: And now I'm so pleased to be joined by David Allen, himself, from Amsterdam. David, welcome to Rule Breaker Investing. David Allen: Hey, delighted to be here with you guys. Gardner: Well, it's a real pleasure. You and I have gotten to know each other some over the last 10 years or so. I read Getting Things Done, your seminal work, somewhere around the first year it came out. Maybe 2003 or 2004? Somewhere like that, David? Allen: It was 2001 hardback. Paperback in 2003. Gardner: Good. I was paperback in 2003 and it was a total game and life changer for me. I've tried to give back here, some, over the years by just always mentioning how grateful I am for your work. I'm just really pleased to be joined with you this week. I wanted to start by asking you -- let's go with the superhero origin story. When did you discover that you were a superhero? How did it happen? Tell us a little bit about your early life or early employment life. Allen: Oh, my God. I had 35 jobs by the time I was 35. I didn't know what I wanted to do when I grew up. I was looking for God, truth of the universe. I was an American cultural history major in graduate school in Berkeley in 1968. If you can remember being in Berkeley in 1968, you were not there. I discovered that instead of studying people who were enlightened, I wanted my own. Graduate school didn't seem to be the source of that, so I dropped out and did all kinds of things. Karate. Meditation practices All kinds of spiritual explorations, etc. I was more interested in the inner world and how it connected to the big, big, big outer world out there. And so to make a long story short, I wasn't for rice bowl and cave. That wasn't my style. I like good chardonnay and good-looking women, etc., so I said, "You know, I still have to pay the rent while I'm on this inner exploration." It turned out I had a lot friends in a network. A lot of them had aspirations and were entrepreneurs who were starting their own businesses, so I became a really good No. 2 guy. I would just walk in and look around at what they were doing because I'm so lazy to begin with. I mean, that's why I developed GTD. I don't like to expend any effort that's not required. So I'd walk in and look around at what they were doing and say, "God, we could do this a lot easier if we did X, Y, and Z." So then we'd do X, Y, and Z and improve the situation, and then I'd get bored. And I'd go, "Okay, let me go find something else to do." And then one day I discovered they'd pay people to do that and they called them something -- so consultant. I couldn't spell it, but now I are one. So in 1981, I hung out my shingle and started Allen Associates, my own little consulting process. So then I got hungry. Being as lazy as I was, I didn't want to have to make up whatever I was doing whenever I walked into a new client. If it wasn't obvious what I could do to help improve their situation, it'd be nice to have a model, or some models that I could pull out of my quiver and be able to use that as a way to help them ask the right questions. Answer the right stuff. What I'm sure you do, David, with all that stuff that you do. So I got very hungry for that. Also, because of my other work, I had gotten very attracted to clear space. You know, in martial arts there's a lot of practice about how you clear your head so when four people jump you in a dark alley you don't want 2,000 unprocessed emails hanging in your psyche. You need a clear head to function most productively. So this sort of love of clear space. And then as my world got more complex, I started to find, "Well, wait a minute. What are some models I can use to stay clear so I can stay more focused strategically [and] have more creative room in my head, etc.?" And I began to cobble together different techniques from different people. So I had two or three different mentors and explored a lot of things. There was no one big epiphany -- just a long string of "epiphanettes" -- for about three or four years back in the early 1980s as I was starting to do this. And then I went, "God, this is really cool." I found stuff that really worked for me. Then I turned around and applied the same techniques with my clients and it turned out that it produced the same results. More results. More control. More space. More creativity. More room to think about meaningful stuff in meaningful ways. And I said, "Well, that's kind of cool." And then some guy from the big corporate world showed up. The head of human resources at Lockheed. He said, "David, our whole company sort of needs that result. Can you take what you've come up with, there, and put it into some sort of educational format?" And so I did a pilot program for a thousand executives ... Gardner: Wow. Lockheed is a big dog. Allen: Yeah, it's a big dog. We did that in 1983 to 1984. Before you were born, David, I think. Maybe. You know, somewhere back there. Gardner: I was only 17. Come on, now. Allen: And I didn't have any experience in the corporate world or in the corporate training world. I have had no traditional business or psychology courses in my life. Gardner: Beautiful. Allen: Everything I learned I learned on the street. I learned out there with my sleeves rolled up working with real people and finding out watching this stuff, really, and how it affected people. But then I didn't know what I'd figured out, frankly. I was just trying to keep a good job. I found something that people thought was valuable and they were willing to pay me to come in and do it. And I wasn't particularly entrepreneurial or aspirational at that point, anyway. I just wanted to keep doing that and support my own lifestyle. So I kept it a fairly small, boutique consulting practice. There was a couple of partners over time. And it really took me 25 years to figure out what I'd figured out. I never did any marketing. I just picked up the phone with people who referred me to other people that referred me to other people and other companies, etc. And then at some point I realized, "Gee, I might get run over by a bus." I think it was time to write the book, as it took me 25 years to figure out that what I'd figured out was unique. That nobody else had figured it out and that it was bulletproof. Nobody could punch a hole in it. Believe me, this was tested in some of the most challenging environments you could imagine of the busiest, brightest, best people in the world, and it would go viral inside of those environments. And those are people making more money in a year than I'll probably see in my life. And if this stuff was viral with those kind of people, I figured, "OK, now I feel like I have the confidence that I could put this out." That's when I wrote Getting Things Done. Gardner: And how did the book come about, David? I mean, you've described it as a 20-year journey to realizing that it should be a book. What was the actual machination by which you did a book deal? Went with the book. I mean, that was a huge shift. That's the way that I found out about you and many, many others [found out about you]. That you really had just shifted from a corporate world consulting business to all of a sudden a mainstream media business. Allen: Yeah. Well, one point ... and here's a real tip for any of the budding entrepreneurs out there. At least once at least have an ad hoc advisory group of folks that are friends of the court who will be honest with you and have some experience in different aspects of this stuff. That's what I did. I brought them together in my little yard underneath an oak tree in Ojai, California and said, "OK. Give me some advice, guys. What do I do with this tiny, little business that I've built?" And the conclusion was they said to write a good business book. And I went "Oh! OK. How do I do that?" It had been on my "someday maybe" list for a while, anyway, because I really thought about doing that. And I'd made some fits and starts but hadn't really done it. And then I said, "OK, I better just pull the plug on this," and I actually made that a real project called "(a) publish book." And I didn't know how the hell to do that, so I went and did some research. It took four years from the time I pulled that trigger until it was actually on the shelf at Barnes & Noble. That was quite a process. The first thing I had to do was figure out, "Well, first of all, how do you sell a book to somebody who's going to sell a book?" So I read whatever current literature there was on how you write a book, and that's a challenging thing, because if you're trying to sell a publisher to publish a book, you've got to write a business plan for the book. What's unique? Why is this different? Who needs this? Who's your target market? Show us an example that you can write. Creating a book proposal was an agonizing but very valuable event and stuff to do. So that took a little while to do. Also to figure out whether you should self-publish. Whether you should go directly to an editor or a publisher you know, or whether to get an agent. And luckily I had a good friend in the book business and he said, "Look. If your book has potential value outside of a particular niche ..." In other words, it might have national value for a wide audience. It's not like here's a book about the sex life of retired nomads that maybe had a niche market. "But if you have a general audience of something like that, and you don't have a name, you better have an agent." And he said, "By the way, my next-door neighbor is a good one." So he turned me on to a really good agent. She still is. She's been a great partner. She's been worth every cent of the 15% they get off of this, because she came from the publishing world. She knew the game, so she got me my first deal at Viking Penguin back then, and that's how it all started. And then it took a year to really make that happen, and then it took a year to write the first draft. The first draft didn't meet my standards. I tore it up. I took another year to write the second draft. This is now year three. And then year four, it took that year to figure out the look and feel. To get the title. And by the way, I have 400 used titles I'll sell you real cheap... Gardner: Wow! Allen: ... for this book. Zen and the Art of In-basket Maintenance was one of my favorites, but we thought that was a little cheapie. That was an agonizing process. So it was not a simple game to go from here to there to get it out. And I also had no idea how much the market would buy into this. I had high aspirations but no expectations for it, because GTD, as you know, David, is subtle stuff. It looks quite simple, but it's not your typical time management tips and tricks kind of thing. There was a whole lot of that out there in the market, [and] I wasn't sure that the world would pick up on the uniqueness and the potential power of what this methodology really was. So it was bemusing, and fun, and certainly valuable to find it was a best seller. The first year I think it sold 60,000 copies which they figure is a best seller in the nonfiction world, anyway, in the U.S. Gardner: I'm guessing you earned out your advance. Allen: I did. And actually they kept it in hardback for a second year, which they don't usually do, but they make more money on the hardback, so they figured it was popular enough that they would still make more money. That's why it was 2003 before they did a paper version of it. Gardner: Got it. Allen: And then when the paper version hit, that really hit a nerve out there because the timing was perfect. That actually hit about the same time that the blog world took off. I don't know where you guys were in 2003, but around then was Guy Kawasaki, and Robert Scoble, and a lot of the folks who were the big bloggers. A lot of them were champions of my stuff, too. So all of that was kind of a perfect storm that got GTD and Getting Things Done sort of spinning out there in the tech world. It became the first non-tech name to really spread through the tech world. And the whole GTD idea -- GTD, those three letters -- were just our internal shorthand for Getting Things Done. And it was a brand that ran out from under us. Gardner: Yeah! Allen: Suddenly the world is talking about GTD, and I went, "God, what do we do with that?" So we spent the last 13 years chasing the brand that ran out from under us. That's a short version of a very long story. Gardner: Well, and it's a story that I wish we had lots more time to talk about, but I need to drive forward very shortly to some tips that you'll have for entrepreneurs listening. That's been the focus this month. But before I go there, let me just ask you. Now, here, in 2016 reflecting back on the last 10 or 15 years, any thoughts about business or insights? Just reflecting on your own journey. Allen: Hoo! You know, it's constantly sort of eating my own dog food and working on, "OK, wait a minute. What's the vision of where we're going? What does that look like?" And our business has changed a lot. A lot of things have happened economically since that time that have affected the business. And essentially we always thought that we were going to be the holders of an intellectual property, and the only way we were going to scale it, if we wanted to scale it at all, was through partnerships and through technology. And that really hasn't changed. It's just taken various different kinds of forms. So fast-forward to today and we've got two (potentially three) partnerships that will essentially take over and already are starting to take over the marketing, sales, and actually delivery of our training programs that we've now designed to go [global]. So we have global franchises, now, for our training program. We're working with a potential partner, now, for the U.S. And that always was essentially part of the vision. We had no idea how the hell to get from here to there, but we just kept that out there as guidance about how we were making decisions about how to do it. We thought we could grow a lot of that capability internally, where you maintain higher margin and maintain essentially more control. So it's been a little dance, there, between how much we can give away and how much [we can] give up in terms of quality control but, at the same time, [get] a whole lot more reach. That's been a lot of our strategy back and forth. Our internal committees and certainly of our own heads. You know, we all have committees in our head and sometimes they start throwing plates at each other in there. And which way do you go? Which way do you travel? Gardner: David, to what extent was your move from California to Amsterdam a personal one or a professional one? Allen: Yes. Gardner: I get it. I get it. Love it. And last question, and then we are going to drive forward to our tips for entrepreneurs. How active, or what is your role today in the business? Are you the visionary and people are coming to you? Are you still out there giving seminars? What are you doing? What does the movie of you look like today? Allen: Well, one of my official titles is "Fool on the Hill," which you should probably relate to pretty easily. Gardner: You know we love that. We love that! In fact, I think you owe us five dollars for some kind of an intellectual property violation. Allen: Yeah! So, that's pretty much it, and I'm sort of the final arbiter of some of the quality in terms of just the content of the stuff. And that's primarily it. And I'm sort of the holder of the flag and the maintainer. Now we're franchising ourselves globally -- and there's a whole lot of piracy of GTD out there around the world -- so it's important when we have a real exclusive partner (that we set up, now, in 40 or 50 countries), that I show up, pat them on the back, and they see that I have now vetted them as they are the exclusive distributor because we're now licensing their master trainers and certifying them. We've got a great team of people out there, so I figured one of the reasons to be over here, in Amsterdam, was it was certainly much more the center of the world than Santa Barbara was. I'm flying tomorrow to Milan and then Sunday to Moscow giving keynote speeches. So I'm still doing that, kind of ad hoc, as the world is knocking on my door to do that and also, at the same time, helping support our new franchisees in these areas. So last year I spent a week in Thailand, a week in Tokyo, a week in South Korea, a week in Budapest just doing that. Gardner: Wow! Allen: We're getting a lot of press, because the new edition of the book, which came out last year, is now being translated into the 20 to 30 languages that the first edition was published in. So the launch of that book -- I get a chance to show up and get a lot of press... Gardner: Great. Allen: ... in those countries. So tomorrow morning I'll be on a Skype into Taiwan. They just published my book in Chinese in Taiwan, so that's a lot of what I'm doing ... Gardner: Yeah! Allen: ... and it's different every week. Gardner: You remain just as busy as ever. I do want to just remind listeners that we are going to have a pullout extra this week. David is graciously sharing some extra time going through some of his GTD tropes. That's how I think of it -- concepts. A little bit of tips and tricks. I'm going to keep it light, but a little GTD primer which I highly recommend for all Rule Breaker listeners if they're not already familiar with David's material, or even if they are. David, let's now shift to the aforementioned tips for entrepreneurs. I know that you've spent your life as an entrepreneur. You also have constantly offered coaching and other insights to entrepreneurs. I just want to get some of your best ones right now -- maybe three to five and maybe a minute or two on each -- and I just am going to let you go because I know you can go well. Allen: Well, I'm going to give you the big one. Hang on! Your head is a crappy office ... Gardner: All right. Allen: ... and virtually everybody out there is trying to use [their] head as a way to keep track. As a way to be reminded. As a way to see relationships between priorities. And you cannot do that. Your head evolved over a million years to keep track of about four things you couldn't finish when you thought of them in the moment. That was it. I mean, your brain is absolutely brilliant with what it does. Recognizing patterns based upon long-term history. But you go to the store to buy lemons and you come back with six things that aren't lemons. So your head sucks. It does not do that very well. [With] virtually every entrepreneur I meet (and I'm coaching a couple of them right now -- serious major league) the whole thing is building the external brain. You've got to get that stuff out of your head. So there's a whole process about getting stuff out of your head which, as you know, I'll go into. In our little extra I can add some more juice to that. But basically if it's on your mind, and it's on your mind more than once, that means you're not appropriately engaged with it. You need to write it down. You need to make decisions about [whether it is] something you need to act on, yes or no. And if it is, what's the very next action you need to take. So when it's popping into your head about a potential merger, or increasing your bank credit line, or potentially hiring somebody, or whatever, there are two questions. What outcome is a successful outcome for you to get this person hired and have the right person in the right place, and what's the very next action? Oh, God. Maybe I should call this friend of mine who hired somebody like that and see if they have some tips. So outcome and action. If you like to watch any kind of a ball game like basketball, or soccer, or football, the two things on anybody's mind out there on the field are where's the goal and where's the next play. So you need to build that into your entrepreneurial life. Gardner: That's a great one. And yes, we will definitely be riffing off that a little bit in our podcast extra. David, let's think about somebody who's about to open up a restaurant. It's his very first shot at opening anything. It's a business where people are failing left and right, all the time. I definitely can imagine some Rule Breaker Investing listeners who are right in that very situation. You might have opened a David Allen restaurant, for all I know, but what are a couple of things that should be on that person's mind that would be non-obvious? Allen: Well, one thing that people are thinking about in some way, probably (or they wouldn't even be there) is what would wild success look like? Wild success would look like what? And how would you know when you were there? And what exactly does that mean to you, because wild success means very different things for very different people, and so that's one of the first things that you probably need to get clear about. Look, what would cause me to not have this on my mind? And it's coming back to the GTD methodology -- that you don't have to go very far -- and oftentimes that's what people often miss. The thing that's most bugging you, or distracting you, or exciting you ... what do you need to do to get that off your mind? Because when it's on your mind, there's an inverse relationship between on your mind and getting done. So start to notice what most has your attention about this restaurant, and about the opening, and about whatever. So it could very well be those two things: thinking about vision and making sure that that's real clear, as clear as you can get it. I mean, oftentimes there's a ready, fire, aim. Sometimes you've got a vision that kind of got you started, and then you need to get started, and then you need to mature your thinking as you get started and then keep recasting the vision about what success is. But there's probably some signature that's yours personally. And I like for people to start to recognize what's your signature. I don't care what kind of business you're in or what kind of profession you're in. You've got your own signature, and when you're playing in that key, everything seems to work much better. If you're playing not in that key, nothing seems to work very well. I think looking for what's unique about you and your signature that you might tap into if you're thinking about wild success. And then more tactically and operationally, what's most got your attention about this thing, and what do you need to do to get that onto cruise control? Those would be my tips and tricks. Gardner: That's great. Let's stick with the same thread and let's fast forward it a little bit. And our entrepreneur is, at least in his mind, having wild success because he's just now opening up his third restaurant in the same metropolitan area, and that's two more than he ever thought he'd be running. What is the biggest danger that person needs to be thinking about? What would you be coaching him to do, or not to do, given wild success? Allen: Well, first of all I'd check in and say, "Is this the success that you assumed would be there?" And oftentimes people overrun their goals, and if you have an overrun goal, you're going to run into really weird space psychologically. Meaning you've actually met your goal and then you start fumbling, and you don't know what to do. You start fumbling yourself around. So if you're an A, and you want to get to C, as you get closer to C, guess what happens to your energy? Gardner: It goes down. Allen: It goes down. So if you actually want to get to C, you better have a D. Because come on, David. I haven't been at your house, but I'll bet you never fully moved in. Gardner: [Laughs] Allen: I'll bet there's a box or two that never got unpacked. Gardner: Guilty as charged. It's more than one box. Six years later. Allen: Right? [crosstalk 00:24:44] Because you had the picture, and you were there, and you had all that stuff, and then you started to get the refrigerator [voice starts to slow], and you got the music, and you got your furniture, and then plll! Then you got used to that, and that can be extremely dangerous and very subtle, and something very few people recognize. When they reach their goal, or get close to it, their energy starts to sag or wag. Now that doesn't mean you need to open three more restaurants. It could very well be that what you're going to do with your three restaurants is make them really unique, now. So again, what success would look [like] you may need to be rethinking, now. "Hey, I got this far, but is where I want to go quantity or quality? Or do I want to serve the community? Or do I want to create an environment where people can do X, Y, and Z? Have a place where I can support new artists performing in my restaurants?" I mean, there's all kinds of ways that one could think about, I would imagine. Adding more creativity, and adding more success, and more juice, and more quality to what people are doing. Because those people get older. Now I know neither you nor I are getting older... Gardner: It's true. Allen: ... but while those other people out there are getting older; oftentimes it's more quality than quantity in terms of what success really means. Gardner: OK, I think we have to end it. Well, not quite right there. I mean, time is running out, so we do need to end it, but David, how about one final money tip for entrepreneurs? The thing that I needed to ask you about 10 minutes ago that I haven't asked you? Allen: Relax. Gardner: Love it. We're just going to leave it right there. It's a beautiful ending. David Allen of Getting Things Done fame. A friend of The Motley Fool. A friend of mine. Thank you so much for spending time with us this week with Rule Breaker Investing. Allen: My pleasure, David. Take care. __ Gardner: Well, that was a real treat. I hope you enjoyed it half as much as I did. In that case, you would have had an awfully good time. So whether you're an entrepreneur, or an entrepreneur wannabe, or just somebody who enjoys listening and thinking about starting your own business, throughout the month we've heard from people who have done just that. I hope you've enjoyed hearing from them and being inspired by them. And I'm happy to say that we're going to close it out in a special way next week. So next week is not only the last week of the month, and therefore it's Mailbag week, but we're going to have much of the episode dedicated to our final, fifth entrepreneur of the month, and that's going to be Guy Kawasaki, the very famous Apple evangelist from back in the day. The author of a wonderful book for entrepreneurs called Rules for Revolutionaries. I think I'll focus my talk with Guy there. But I'm really excited to share Guy Kawasaki with you. If you're not familiar with him, one of those guys (kind of like David Allen) who has a million followers on Twitter and has influenced many lives for the better. Has improved -- not just changed -- has improved many lives. All right, and before I close just a little bit of bookkeeping. Let me mention that you can check out past episodes of Rule Breaker Investing (and actually all of The Motley Fool's podcasts) at our podcast center. I don't think I mention this one enough. It's Podcasts.Fool.com. Please avail yourself of that. I'm sure many of you are already aware of it. While you're there, you can check out our subscription services, too. Now, a new issue of our Rule Breakers service comes out with two new stock recommendations from me the last Wednesday of the month. You can check it out by going to the podcast center, again, and scrolling to the bottom of the page. That's Podcasts.Fool.com. And let me mention. If you haven't already, you can subscribe to this podcast on iTunes or Spotify and give me a review. Throw me some stars. Let us know how we're doing. Final note. It is Mailbag next week so please -- through RBI@Fool.com by email (or certainly you can just tweet it out to @RBIPodcast on Twitter) -- we would love to get a few of your questions to highlight next week. In the meantime, just a reminder again. The David Allen extra this Saturday. Happy Thanksgiving. Fool on! As always, people on this program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

The company yesterday gifted its retail employees a limited-edition t-shirt and a printed copy of the Apple credo. As noted by MacRumors, the gifted t-shirt is gray in color and depicts two circles. Look closer, however, and you’ll see that the circles are made up of a text list of all of Apple’s retail locations around the world. Of note, the t-shirt gifted to Apple retail employees in similar in style to that of one sold at the company’s campus store in Cupertino. As you can see in our walkthrough of that store from October, Apple sells a shirt with a similar design, but that shirt instead lists all of the company’s products within the circle opposed to retail stores like the gifted shirt. Apple sells the product shirt in its company store for $29. The other aspect of this year’s gift is a printed copy of Apple’s credo. The text is printed on a heavy card stock and is six paragraphs long. The credo is the same as what Apple introduced back in August, written in a poetic style and focusing on the company’s goal of enriching lives. Enriching lives We are here to enrich lives. To help dreamers become doers, to help passion expand human potential, to do the best work of our lives.  At our best We give more than we take. From the planet, to the person beside us. We become a place to belong where everyone is welcome.  Everyone. We draw strength from our differences. From background and perspective to collaboration and debate. We are open.  We redefine expectations. First for ourselves, then for the world. Because we’re a little crazy. Because “good enough” isn’t. Because what we do says who we are.  We find courage. To try and to fail, to learn and to grow, to figure out what’s next, to imagine the unimaginable, to do it all over again tomorrow.  At our core We believe our soul is our people. People who recognize themselves in each other.People who shine a spotlight only to stand outside it. People who work to leave this world better than they found it. People who live to enrich lives. This year’s retail gift isn’t quite as impressive as last year’s, when the company gifted employees a pair of urBeats earbuds and a 9-month subscription to Apple Music. The year before that, Apple gifted retail employees an Incase Staple backpack. While this year’s gifts might be less impressive from a monetary standpoint, Apple fans will likely appreciate the limited edition t-shirt, even though it resembles one sold in its corporate store.

Has a Long Way to Go to Be Perceived as a Services Company But what if you considered part of the iPhone business as a service? Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Dec 17, 2016 at 9:30AM Image source: Apple. Over the past year or so, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has made a concerted effort to shift investor focus from unit sales and product cycles toward recurring-revenue sources like services and subscriptions. The iPhone maker started highlighting non-GAAP financial metrics like installed base purchases, which represented the gross value of digital content that users purchase in aggregate, irrespective of how those purchases end up being accounted for on Apple's financial statements. Interestingly, Apple didn't disclose this figure last quarter, but that could be more about the SEC's broader crackdown on non-GAAP metrics that's been going on all year. The company is still very much trying to highlight services growth, noting the services business hit an all-time record last quarter. Here's CEO Tim Cook on the last earnings call: We had a record-setting quarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion. App store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music.  ... We remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our growing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be the size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. For reference, the bar to make it into the Fortune 100 for 2016 was about $28.1 billion, and Apple's services revenue for fiscal 2016 was $24.3 billion. Goodbye, Gene Longtime Apple analyst Gene Munster is leaving Piper Jaffray to pursue a new career in venture capital, but the analyst is giving investors a parting research note. Munster has similarly taken note of how Apple has been trying to change investor perception, but the analyst believes that services will need to comprise at least 30% of revenue before investors start to "give it more credit." If Apple wanted to be classified as a services company, it would probably need to bring in half of revenue from services, in Munster's view. This percentage has been rising as Apple's services business grows, but services comprised just 11% of sales last fiscal year. So Apple still has a long way to go before investors start to give the segment any real respect (at least if we go by Munster's thresholds). Apple will need to come up with many more services if it hopes to get there. Apple Pay is growing, but the company has never really been too forthright about the mobile payment service's economics. Perhaps more importantly, it's really difficult to see a path toward services becoming this large in terms of the overall business, simply because the iPhone dominates Apple's financials...although in some contexts you could consider the iPhone itself as a service. iPhone-as-a-Service (iPaaS)? I know what you're thinking: The last thing we need is another "as-a-Service" acronym, and you're right. But hear me out. This isn't some new idea; investors have long relied on ongoing upgrades as part of the Apple thesis. But Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program is the clearest attempt to create long-term recurring revenue from annual upgrades in a structured way. Apple outsources the financing of this program to Citizens One, so for the most part it recognizes the related revenue upfront (net of a guarantee liability associated with the trade-in right). But I'd argue that iPhone Upgrade Program revenue could be considered a form of services revenue, even though it shows up as iPhone revenue. The AppleCare component of the iPhone Upgrade Program is likely already being classified as service, but you could effectively consider the hardware component recurring revenue, too. That rationale would also apply to customers that participate in early upgrade and leasing programs offered by carriers, which would shift the accounting to the carriers' balance sheets. The point is that you could take a subset of iPhone users that are committed to regular upgrades, either through Apple directly or via carrier programs, and arguably consider those sales as service given the long-term and recurring nature of the relationship. These data aren't available, but if you look at it this way, services actually comprise a larger percentage than what's officially reported. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

Microsoft, for instance, has mock apartments to record volunteers speaking in a home setting. The companies use such data to teach their computers how to understand and respond.  Share story By Jing Cao and Dina Bass Bloomberg News Amazon’s Echo has made tangible the promise of an artificially intelligent personal assistant in every home. Those who own the voice-activated gadget (called Alexa, after its female interlocutor) are prone to proselytizing “her” charms, applauding Alexa’s ability to call an Uber, order pizza or check a 10th-grader’s math homework. The company says more than 5,000 people a day profess their love for Alexa. On the other hand, devotees also know that unless you speak to her very  clearly … and … slowly, she’s likely to say: Sorry, I don’t have the answer to that question. “I love her. I hate her, I love her,” one customer wrote on Amazon’s website, while still awarding Alexa five stars.  “You will very quickly learn how to talk to her in a way that she will understand, and it’s not unlike speaking to a small, frustrating toddler.” Voice recognition has come a long way in the past few years. But it’s still not good enough to popularize the technology for everyday use and usher in a new era of human-machine interaction, allowing us to talk with all our gadgets — cars, washing machines, televisions. Despite advances in speech recognition, most people continue to swipe, tap and click. And probably will for the foreseeable future.

So Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and China’s Baidu have embarked on a worldwide hunt for terabytes of human speech. Microsoft has set up mock apartments in cities around the globe to record volunteers speaking in a home setting. Every hour, Amazon uploads Alexa queries to a vast digital warehouse. Baidu is busily collecting every dialect in China. Then they take all that data and use it to teach their computers how to parse, understand and respond to commands and queries. The challenge is finding a way to capture natural, real-world conversations.  Even 95 percent accuracy isn’t enough, says Adam Coates, who runs Baidu’s artificial-intelligence lab in Sunnyvale, Calif. “Our goal is to push the error rate down to 1 percent,” he says.  “That’s where you can really trust the device to understand what you’re saying, and that will be transformative.” Not long ago, voice recognition was comically rudimentary. An early version of Microsoft’s technology running in Windows transcribed “mom” as “aunt” during a 2006 demo before an auditorium of analysts and investors. When Apple debuted Siri five years back, the personal assistant’s gaffes were widely mocked because it, too, routinely spat out incorrect results or didn’t hear the question correctly. When asked if Gillian Anderson is British, Siri provided a list of English restaurants. Now Microsoft says its speech engine makes the same number or fewer errors than professional transcribers, Siri is winning grudging respect, and Alexa has given us a tantalizing glimpse of the future. Much of that progress owes a debt to the magic of neural networks, a form of artificial intelligence based loosely on the architecture of the human brain. Neural networks learn without being explicitly programmed but generally require an enormous breadth and diversity of data. The more a speech-recognition engine consumes, the better it gets at understanding different voices and the closer it gets to the eventual goal of having a natural conversation in many languages and situations. Hence the global scramble to capture a multitude of voices. “The more data we shove in our systems the better it performs,” says Andrew Ng, Baidu’s chief scientist. “This is why speech is such a capital-intensive exercise; not a lot of organizations have this much data.” When the industry began working seriously on voice recognition in the 1990s, companies like Microsoft relied on publicly available data from research institutes such as the Linguistics Data Consortium, a storehouse of voice and text data founded in 1992 with backing from the U.S. government and at the University of Pennsylvania. Then tech companies started collecting their own voice data, some of it garnered from volunteers who came in to read and be recorded. Now, with the popularity of speech-controlled software gaining ground, they harvest much of the data from their own products and services. When you tell your phone to search for something, play a song or guide you to a destination, chances are a company is recording it. (Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon emphasize they anonymize user data to protect customer privacy.) When you ask Alexa what the weather is or the latest football score, the gadget uses the queries to improve its understanding of natural language (although “she” isn’t listening to your conversations unless you say her name). “By design, Alexa gets smarter as you use her,” says Nikko Strom, senior principal scientist for the program. One of the key challenges is getting the technology conversant with multiple languages, accents and dialects. Nowhere, perhaps, is this more crucial than in China. Seeking to harvest dialects from all over the country, Baidu launched a marketing campaign during Chinese New Year earlier this year. Calling the push a “dialect conservation initiative,” the search giant promised people that if they contributed they would help usher in a future when they would talk to Baidu using their dialect. In two weeks, the company recorded more than 1,000 hours of speech to plug into its computers. Many people did it for free simply because they were proud of their hometown dialects. A high school teacher in Sichuan was so excited about the program, he asked a class of students to record more than 1,000 ancient poems in Sichuanese. Another challenge: teaching voice-recognition technology to pick up commands over background noise — the clamor of happy hour, say, or the cacophony of a sports stadium. Microsoft has deployed an Xbox app called Voice Studio to harvest conversation over the din of users shooting villains or watching movies. It offered rewards including points and digital apparel for avatars and lured hundreds of subjects willing to contribute their game chatter to Microsoft’s speech efforts. The program worked gangbusters in Brazil, where the local subsidiary promoted the app heavily on the main Xbox page. The data was used to create the Brazilian Portuguese version of Cortana, released this year. Companies are also designing voice-recognition systems for specific situations. Microsoft has been testing technology that can answer travelers’ queries without being distracted by the constant barrage of flight announcements at airports. The company’s technology is also being used in an automated ordering system for McDonald’s drive-thrus. Trained to ignore scratchy audio, screaming kids and “ums,” it  can spit out a complicated order, getting even the condiments right. Amazon is conducting tests in automobiles, challenging Alexa to work well with road noise and open windows. Even as companies scour the world for data, they’re figuring out ways to improve voice recognition with less of it. The technology being tested at McDonald’s is more accurate than other systems that use much more data, says Xuedong Huang, Microsoft’s chief speech scientist, who has been working on voice recognition at the company for more than two decades. “You can always have breakthroughs even without using the most data.” Google generally subscribes to a less-is-more philosophy, deploying a piecemeal approach that uses unintelligible units of sound to build words and phrases. With its speech-recognition system, it aims to solve multiple problems with just one change. For its data sets, Google strings together tens of thousands of audio snippets that are typically two to five seconds long. The process requires less computing power and can be more easily tested and tweaked, says Google researcher Françoise Beaufays. For its part, Baidu is working on more efficient algorithms where learning one language makes it easier to learn the next 12. That’s particularly important for those spoken by tens of thousands of people rather than millions, where there just won’t be huge swaths of data no matter what, says Ng, the company’s chief scientist. Ask researchers like Ng when it will be possible to speak naturally to your digital assistant and they get wistful. No one really knows. Neural networks remain mysterious even to those who understand them best. And much of the work is trial and error. Based on the current technology and methods, the process will probably take years. But Ng, Huang, Beaufays and other scientists say you never know when a breakthrough will arrive, catapulting research forward and turning Alexa and Siri into true conversationalists.

Ironically, it wasn’t the announcement of a water-proof device or upgrades in processors that generated all the amazement It was the reveal of the Super Mario Run release for iPhone. Advertisement The reveal of Super Mario Run shocked a lot of people this morning – particularly fans of the Mario franchise. Published and developed by Nintendo, no Mario game has ever made it onto the platform of another company. In fact, Nintendo uses its most popular brands to boost sales of its Nintendo 3DS handheld. Earlier this year, the company said that it would focus more on mobile while still trying to lure users to the Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo 2DS. Super Mario Run will bring Nintendo’s most popular video game character to smartphones for the very first time. Here’s what we know about the upcoming game. Super Mario Run Release Date Confirmed in a press release well after the game’s original announcement, Nintendo has finally confirmed a Super Mario Run release date. iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch users can expect the game to arrive on December 15th. The game will require devices to run Apple’s iOS 8 operating system. Advertisement Nintendo has planned a staggered, country by country launch of the game. Support for Russian, English, Japanese, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch and Russian are confirmed. Chinese languages will be supported to. It’s coming to 151 regions and countries. Advertisement As for the Super Mario Run release time, no one really knows. Presumably, New Zealanders will be the first to get the game in their version of the iTunes App Store, followed by other time zones in sequential order. Super Mario Run Release: Exclusive to iPhone Nintendo took the stage to announce Super Mario Run just as Apple was giving the press a look at the iTunes app store’s performance. The point was clear, through working with developers of all kinds, Apple devices will continue to have access to the most interesting, well-made apps out there. Super Mario Run won’t immediately be available on anything else but devices that run iOS, Nintendo confirmed on-stage at the reveal. That’s a big change in direction for Nintendo. The company’s first-ever game for mobile devices was Miitomo. It came to both Android and iOS. Advertisement Super Mario Run Release: Run & Tap Controls Perfect for One Hand Super Mario Run looks a lot like the console versions of the game that you might have seen before. Certainly, the point of the game hasn’t changed a lot. You’re still Mario. You’re trying to reach the end of levels by avoiding cracks in the ground and collecting coins. It’d have been easy for Nintendo to abdicate responsibility for controlling the characters in this game. After all, Super Mario Run is an offshoot of a game that focuses heavily on physical controls and has been around for a very long time. The company didn’t. The Run in Super Mario Run’s title comes from some pretty important changes to the game’s mechanics. In the franchise’s other platformers, players are free to stop, run or turn around. Run doesn’t give players that opportunity at all. Mario keeps moving forward at break-neck speed. Only through dodging the different obstacles quickly will players make it to the end of the level. Through finger taps users force their character to jump. In a press release sent out after the reveal, Nintendo said that it hoped users would be able to enjoy the entire game with just a single hand. Advertisement Super Mario Run Release: Multiplayer Besides the basic mode, Nintendo also gave users a look at the game’s dedicated Toad Tally Mode. This feature lets users compete with the scores that other players have managed to rack up on their own. Super Mario Run Release: Price Too often, one thing that seriously puts a damper on mobile games is their business model. In the early days of the iTunes App Store, games had cover charges. You could buy a game for a flat fee and play it as long as you wanted. All of that changed when the so-called Games-as-a-Service phenomenon took over. Developers started giving away their games for free to attract as many people as possible. With users hooked, the game’s economy would kick in. Players needed in-game tools or currency to make the game they were playing a less time consuming. Now almost all mobile games feature some kind of economy like this. Advertisement Super Mario Run won’t require or encourage extra digital purchases, Nintendo says. Instead, it’ll have a cover charge so that user’s don’t need to keep spending money on in-game items and currency that they can’t use anywhere else. There’ll be a free and a paid version of the game, Nintendo has confirmed. The game will sell for $9.99. This version provides unlimited access to everything that Super Mario Run has to offer. The free version will let users try all of three of its modes, but only on a limited basis. Super Mario Run Release: Online Only When you finally do get your hands on Super Mario Run, plan to have an internet connection. Like other popular smartphone games, the game will require that users have an internet connection to play. Why Nintendo made that decision is unclear, but some speculate it’s because it wants to ensure some enterprising users aren’t able to get the game for free. There’s only hours left until the Super Mario Run release. It’s sure to be a big day for Nintendo fans around the world. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

By Beth J. Harpaz Associated Press Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS NEW YORK – As a native New Yorker, a licensed city tour guide and a volunteer Big Apple Greeter, I’ve answered lots of questions from tourists over the years. Among them: “Is it safe to drink the water?” (Yes.) “What does ‘curb your dog’ mean?” (Dogs should not use sidewalks as a bathroom.) And my favorite: “Where are all the supermodels?” (I don’t know.) The Big Apple Greeter organization matches out-of-towners with locals for free neighborhood visits and other outings, and as a greeter, I’ve also shepherded tourists from around the world on their first subway rides, visits to Harlem and Brooklyn, and tastes of local delicacies (like bagels). Along the way I’ve given lots of advice on enjoying the city while staying safe, having fun and sticking to a budget. Here are some tips. Safety Street food is safe to eat. Crime is very low but safeguard your wallet from pickpockets and don’t drape your purse over your chair. Many people will accost you, trying to sell you things. Keep walking. It’s not uncommon to hear of pedestrians hit by bikes or even cars. Look both ways when crossing the street. Use seatbelts in cabs. The best things in New York are free Staten Island Ferry: Great views of the Statue of Liberty, Lower Manhattan and New York Harbor. Runs 24 hours a day. Beautiful at night with the city lit up. No. 1 subway to South Ferry or 4 or 5 trains to Bowling Green. 9/11 park: A powerful symbol of the city’s resilience, with One World Trade rising above. Reflecting pools built in the footprints of the twin towers are a moving tribute to those who perished. Be sure to stop at the Survivor Tree. Check out the Oculus nearby, a cool and curious white-winged structure with shops and eateries inside. Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge: Take the C or A train to the High Street stop on the Brooklyn side and walk back to Manhattan. Central Park: New Yorkers live in tiny apartments. City parks are our collective backyards. Enter at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue, just north of the Manhattan White House, aka Trump Tower. The High Line: This vertical park built on an old rail line 30 feet above the street runs for about a mile from 34th Street west of 10th Avenue to just below 14th Street. Expect crowds. Grand Central, 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue: Notice the famous four-faced clock, cathedral windows, grand staircases and zodiac signs in the ceiling. A black rectangle in the northwest corner of the ceiling is a reminder of the days prior to a 1990s renovation when the entire ceiling was black from decades of tobacco smoke. Times Square: New Yorkers hate this place. Under new rules, tip-hungry costumed characters and half-naked painted women must stay confined to a teal-colored zone. The subway It’s noisy, dirty and confusing but generally safe and efficient. Chances are you will encounter homeless people, panhandlers, musicians and trains so crowded you can’t get on. It runs 24 hours a day, though trains and riders thin out overnight. Trust your gut: If someone is acting strangely or aggressively, make like a New Yorker and walk away. If you bump someone accidentally, a sincere apology is expected. Get a free map from a manned booth. There’s also a map in every car of every train. Most New Yorkers can provide basic directions but this app is good for route-planning: citymapper.com/nyc. Trains are sometimes rerouted on weekends; see web.mta.info/weekender.html. Each one-way ride costs $2.75. Best deal is an unlimited seven-day pass for $31. Or put $20 on a regular pay-per-ride MetroCard and the machine will give you a free 11 percent bonus, $2.20, covering 8 rides total. If you pay in cash and don’t have exact change, you’ll get coins back. If you pay by credit card and you’re from abroad, type in 99999 as your ZIP code. There’s a $1 fee for the card, but you can refill it. Prices are likely to rise in spring 2017. Attractions Buy online timed tickets for attractions when available. Otherwise arrive a half-hour before opening time to reduce your wait. Empire State Building, Top of the Rock or One World Trade observatories? I prefer the first two because they’re in the middle of Manhattan, whereas much of what you see from One World Trade is the harbor and New Jersey. Many museums schedule a few free hours each week. The Metropolitan Museum of Art lists a suggested admission but you don’t have to pay it. To me, the Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collection is worth the steep $25 admission (don’t miss Van Gogh’s “Starry Night”). Neighborhoods A few of my favorites: In Harlem, have a bite at Marcus Samuelsson’s Streetbird on 116th Street and walk across the neighborhood’s main street, 125th Street. Joe Shanghai on Pell Street in Chinatown is cheap, crazy, fun and good; be prepared to wait for a table and beware the hot broth inside the pork dumplings. From Chinatown, walk to Little Italy for dessert at Ferrara’s, 195 Grand St. Hang with the hipsters in trendy Brooklyn: Take the L train to Bedford in Williamsburg or Jefferson in Bushwick. Among many options for great pizza, I like Lombardi’s, C train to Spring Street.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    This week, after four and a half years of faithful service, I finally replaced my old laptop. I will not bore you with the litany of troubles that led to this decision. The only interesting thing about my decision to replace my old 15-inch Macbook Pro is what I chose to replace it with: a nearly identical Macbook, about four years newer. But not quite the newest model. For the first time in my life, I decided to sit out an upgrade cycle and buy the older model, now being sold at a discount like day-old bread. I won’t say that the discount played no role in my decision. But in previous years, I’d have swallowed hard and handed over the money, because I am, in the laptop world, a hardcore power user. I game on my laptop. I frequently have a dozen or so applications open, two or three of which are browsers with many tabs open. Faster processors, more memory -- these things are sufficiently valuable that I’m willing to pay for them, because they make me more productive. The trouble is, the upgrade cycle is no longer delivering those things. The processors in the latest model were marginally faster than in the previous one, but you couldn’t add memory, which I needed more. Instead, Apple is focusing on things I care about a lot less, like making the laptop thin -- even though that meant losing USB and SD card ports that I still use, and losing a lot of “play” from the keyboard. As a friend pointed out to me, Apple has become obsessed with thinness to the point of anorexia. But my decision is not primarily evidence of Apple making poor design decisions. Instead, it’s a lesson in the limits of the form -- and the way that’s affecting upgrade cycles, and very probably, Apple’s future revenue. For decades, we’ve been talking about “Moore’s Law” -- the rule of thumb that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every 18 months. More transistors mean more processing power. And in my early years as a computer user, that mattered a great deal. Each new generation of computer delivered a massive improvement in performance—more hard drive, more memory, faster processor. Those things meant that the software that ran on those computers rapidly developed more bells and whistles that took advantage of all that new power. People who used that software found themselves forced to upgrade, because trying to run it on an old system was unbearably slow. But we’re starting to hit the limits of Moore’s Law. As Peter Bright of Ars Technica recently wrote: “Constrained by heat, clock speeds have largely stood still, and the performance of each individual processor core has increased only incrementally. What we see instead are multiple processor cores within a single chip. This increases the overall theoretical performance of a processor, but it can be difficult to actually exploit this improvement in software.” Improvements on both laptops and phones are increasingly coming from more marginal features: sharper displays, solid-state drives, better cameras, different sets of ports. In contrast, more computing power is a general-purpose improvement that provides a lot of different benefits to different kinds of users -- and can force users to upgrade, as their old devices become unusably slow. Nicer accessories or thinner form factors do not necessarily trigger a stampede to the Apple store. And we’re seeing this in upgrade cycles. My 4.5 years is actually on the low side for replacing a computer; the average now is nearly six years, which of course means that a substantial number of users are waiting longer than that. For replacing mobile devices, too, consumers are waiting longer, in part because phone companies are no longer subsidizing the phones to get you to invest in a contract, but also, I suspect, because devices are just not getting better as fast as they once were. We used to upgrade our phones every two years because the new operating systems ran on old phones as if they’d been given high doses of valium. Now we’ll wait until the batteries won’t hold a charge -- and if it were possible to replace the batteries, we might wait even longer than that, because I’m not willing to pay hundreds of dollars to get a better camera while losing my headphone jack. And that may be the biggest reason that upgrades are slowing down. The old improvements in processing power meant that upgrades were pure upside. The new improvements outside of processing power often require tradeoffs. The latest iPhone design is thinner and more waterproof than older models. But to get there, Apple had to lose a headphone jack that people were pretty fond of. This hardly means that technology companies are going to go out of business. But it may well slow revenue, and in turn, slow innovation. Investing in a big overhaul every year or so makes sense when consumers were reliably swapping out their gadgets at the two-year mark; that gives you a very big market over which to defray the cost of all that R&D. As the market for each new model shrinks, companies may make each new overhaul less flashy, or alternatively, stretch out the cycles so that they’re introducing big improvements only around the time that consumers are ready to replace their last model. As Apple did with the Macbook Pro. In other words, personal computing is completing the shift from an early-innovation market, which sees massive changes in form and power every few years, to a mature market in which people treat products like cars: Gee, that feature is nice, but I can probably wait a few more years to have it.

We had heard a similar story to the reddit post from a 3rd party that was working with Niantic on the Pokemon Go Watch.  That person explained that Niantic was focusing on their own wearable and not the Apple Watch App.] At this point it is clear that our source was wrong and we were wrong. Sorry for blowing that one, we’ll do better in the future. Niantic is working on its own wearables.  Pokemon Go is available at the app store.  Pokémon Go for Apple Watch is coming soon. Stay tuned. — Pokémon GO (@PokemonGoApp) December 17, 2016 Back in September, Apple and Niantic announced that the popular game Pokémon Go was coming to the Apple Watch before the end of this year. Since then, however, no news has come concerning that release and now it appears that the plans have been scrapped altogether… After rumors emerged claiming that Niantic had ceased development of Pokémon Go for Apple Watch, 9to5Mac has confirmed with a source with knowledge of the plans that the Apple Watch app has for now been shelved. Reports claim that what Niantic demonstrated on stage at Apple’s iPhone event in September was an “unfinished port.” Referring to the Apple Watch app as a “port” is somewhat interesting as it was originally described as being a companion app, with features such as the Apple Watch tapping your wrist as you approached a Pokéstop. At this point, Niantic hasn’t offered up any official details as to why it ceased development of the Pokémon Go Apple Watch application. In a customer support email response, an alleged Niantic representative stated that while plans have been ceased, “if demand for an Apple Watch port increases, we will continue development of a port.” Of note, 9to5Mac reached out to Niantic earlier this week to confirm if the company would hit its end-of-year target ship date for the Apple Watch Pokémon Go app, but the company didn’t offer a statement one way or the other. The Pokémon Go app for Apple Watch was widely believed to be a way for Niantic to continue tempting users to regularly play the game. While the game was initially a smash success, interest has waned over recent months. Niantic has been rolling out features such as a special one-day events and rewards for using the app daily as a way to drive users to the app. Niantic notably released its own wearable for Pokémon Go back in September. Called Pokémon Go Plus, the wearable connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth and flashes a built-in LED light to notify you of nearby players and Pokémon. Niantic’s Pokémon Go Plus wearable makes the company’s decision to cease development of the Apple Watch app even more interesting. The wearable sold out nearly instantly, thus signaling that there is a market for Pokémon Go on the wrist and that the Apple Watch app would have been popular had it come to market. It’s unclear what the decision to stop development for Apple Watch means for the game coming to other hardware devices or the future of the company’s own wearables. Perhaps the opportunity with its own hardware was part of the reason it’s not planning to release for Apple Watch. Most recently, Pokémon Go added more Pokémon including a holiday-themed Pikachu and characters from Gold and Silver video games. Additionally, it was revealed that Pokémon Go was teaming up with Starbucks and Sprint for promotions. While the Apple Watch Pokémon Go app may be no more, you can still download the original app from the App Store and everything will continue as normal.

Portrait mode is designed to create those stylish and effective shots that professional photographers manage, where the subject is in sharp focus but the otherwise-distracting background is moodily blurred. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 117.91 +1.30 +1.11% It’s called the bokeh effect, created by a deliberately shallow depth of field. Depth of field is the distance between the foreground and background that’s in focus. Bokeh, Japanese for blur, is used to describe the quality of the blurry parts of the picture. Although the Portrait mode was announced in September, Apple said it would follow later, due to the need to test it thoroughly in every situation, tweaking the effect. That’s because, unlike traditional photography, this is achieved using software algorithms as well as the iPhone 7 Plus’s two cameras. A regular SLR camera achieves the effect by opening the aperture wide – the larger the aperture, the shallower the depth of field. Often, you’ll want a smaller aperture so as much of the picture is in focus but this means a longer shutter speed to let more light in. Mobile phone cameras, however, can’t adjust the aperture. Apple’s solution is to use both the close-up and the distance cameras at the same time, then apply complicated algorithms to the result and artificially blur what the iPhone’s brain deems to be background. It’s not foolproof, but the effects are pretty striking. It’s easy to use: launch the camera and choose Portrait from the range of options which previously just had Photo, Video, Square, Panoramic, Slo-mo and Time-lapse. Then take note of messages onscreen. For instance, you need a certain level of lighting for the effect to work. Brighter light makes better portraits. You’ll also get a message if you need to change your distance from the subject. I’ve tried the Portrait mode with an occasionally amenable subject. I should just say that this mode is meant for humans, and as you’ll undoubtedly have noticed, my subject is a dog. Note that in one of the shots her tail is deemed to be part of the background rather than her, though I quite like the result. On the whole, a background that’s a bit further away makes the depth of field more noticeable and higher contrast between front and back helps, too. So contrasting colours are good. The best thing about the Portrait mode is that it, like high-end cameras, gives a real-time preview of the effect so you can judge if it’s arty enough for your liking. The camera saves two versions, one without the Portrait feature and labelling the other as Depth Effect, though you’ll probably have spotted which is which. This software effect is not as brilliant as using the right lens on an SLR, of course, as it blurs everything equally where the right piece of SLR glass will specifically render out-of-focus points of light which creates the right bokeh. But for the camera you always have with you, and one that doesn’t make your pockets bulge like an SLR would, it’s a pretty cool effect.© Provided by Independent Print Limited Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Officers responding to a dispatch call found a badly damaged 2016 Kia Soul abandoned on the sidewalk near the scene at 340 University Ave,” Andersen reports. “Officers then located a second vehicle at 445 Bryant Street, just across the street from the Apple Store, with numerous Apple computers and phones lying on the ground nearby, which they recovered.” “Officers searching the area detained four individuals for questioning, all of whom were later placed under arrest for burglary, vandalism and conspiracy felony charges,” Andersen reports. “Police arrested 19-year-old Shaquin K. Ferguson and 18- year-old Erica Jaynisha White as well as two teenage males.” Read more and see the mughots in the full article here.

Typical. “If I had a son, he’d look like Shaquin, but he’d be much lighter since I’m a mulatto myself.” – Barack Hussein Obama, racist divider who failed in his attempt to destroy the US from the inside out Bradford Monday, December 5, 2016 - 10:03 am · Reply I’m not so sure Obama was attempting to destroy the U.S. I think he was, instead, simply ill-equipped for the job (look no further than his inability to build any consensus and tendency to stay cloistered in the White House, totally unable to work across the aisle) and subscribed to a statist ideology that was destined to fail. The job growth Trump will unleash will be Reganesque. As for Obama being a racist divider, that he certainly was. No president would say “If I had a son…” if he wasn’t trying to incite racial tensions, unless he was just too ignorant to know better or too narcissistic to care. thetheloniousmac Monday, December 5, 2016 - 10:29 am · Reply I’m kinda sure about it. If he wasn’t, he’s a blithering idiot. If he was, dust off the chess table, the man is a genius. Gollum Monday, December 5, 2016 - 11:38 am · Reply Shame on all three of you. This is not a political post. It’s about crime at an Apple Store. Thankfully the perps got caught without anyone getting hurt. For the record Obama was working with a congress that vowed to block him at every turn. Even if he proposed change that the GOP wanted, they wouldn’t give him any air to breath. It was all about him being in the White House, and you know it. To Hell in a hand basket, 1/20. Chris Monday, December 5, 2016 - 11:44 am · Reply You do realize President Obama’s party did control Congress for his first 2 years, right? Instead of building across the aisle his response was “I won”. AHA can be reformed Monday, December 5, 2016 - 5:58 pm · Reply It took 2 years to implement the AHA. It was a formerly republican plan (Romney implemented it in MA). And of course it was a major gift to insurance companies in order to gain corporate support. But end result is that millions gained insurance. The last 6 years of the Obama administration, the republican congress vowed to replace the AHA but never did. They vowed to repeal it and spent an inordinate amount of time revoting it, a total waste of time and taxpayer money. In the next few years, if the republican party does do anything related to healthcare, please be intellectually honest and evaluate them on persons covered versus costs incurred and by whom. I would be willing to be that no cost to anyone will go down unless you choose the freedom of being a parasite on society and live with no insurance, expecting emergency room care at top taxpayer dollar to resolve easily preventable issues that the AHA ensures that every American should have as a minimum standard. Ironic how the extreme righties want high standards for everything but the health of their fellow countrymen. Gollum Saturday, December 17, 2016 - 1:48 pm · Reply Yes and it was a waste of time. When things could have happened, it was a lot of infighting and mistrust. occasionalposter1 Monday, December 5, 2016 - 12:05 pm · Reply You LIKE Obama. He can do no wrong in your eyes. That is the problem with people we like. It isn’t what is right in our eyes, it is WHO is right and it usually is those we side with, unfortunately. I didn’t vote for him because he didn’t express my values. He WAS (and still IS, at the moment) my president. I hoped that he would bring some healing to this country and do some things for the poverty level, but it only got worse. (I live an a large generational poverty area of the country and see it daily. It has gotten worse. No, it wasn’t the Republicans blocking him as you “see” it. Remember the times he wanted HIS budget and refused to pay the military and other governmental bills, blaming it on Republicans? And then spent 50 times that in what he tried to hide as secret money to Iran? Shut the government down, blame the other side, send much more money than that is secret pay off in cash to another country. Nothing, no way to justify that or explain it. CitizenX Monday, December 5, 2016 - 2:37 pm · Reply Stupid, stupid, stupid. That was Iran’s money. Can you say that slowly, that was Iran’s money. You do know that congress spends money? Not the President. Oh wait, no you don’t. Truth is so foreign to you. peterblood71 Monday, December 5, 2016 - 9:41 am · Reply Oh yeah, totally worth it. Well thought out plan. Iron clad course of action if your intent was to be caught easily and live for an extended period behind iRon bars. TomInTulsa Monday, December 5, 2016 - 10:53 am · Reply Sadly we will have to go through a lot of these until word gets out that it doesn’t work. Apple knows what equipment was stolen, the computers and phones will be worthless. I hate the property damage but am glad there were no injuries. BoycottMacdailynews Monday, December 5, 2016 - 11:01 am · Reply This has become the Breitbart, white nationalist Mac user group page. Can’t do it anymore. Plenty of other sites with real Apple related news. Not to mention site design has always sucked. Looks like an amateur blog so it kinda makes sense. See ya. Truax Monday, December 5, 2016 - 11:27 am · Reply Watch out for that door hitting’ you in the ass! yolo Monday, December 5, 2016 - 11:28 am · Reply How can we miss you if you won’t go away? Pirate Monday, December 5, 2016 - 11:47 am · Reply Or perhaps, there are more folks that share an anti-liberal politics view than you think? Perhaps most Americans outside of NYC and CA are sick and tired of their country focusing more on bathroom rights for a handful of Americans, rather than jobs for all of those unemployed? Perhaps this is why we elected an outsider to shake up Washington? Did that ever cross your mind? Reality Check Monday, December 5, 2016 - 11:57 am · Reply It is just like Germany in the 1930s where people’s racist bigoted tendencies were made ‘legitimate’ by a ‘strong’ leader. We have not yet seen the rise of the Brown Shirts to coral the rest of us but the Bigot in Chief hasn’t even taken office yet. Give it a chance yet. Maybe it won’t be very bad. After the masses realize that a government of the rich by the rich is for the rich, maybe they will finally resist and stop the rise of the oligarchy. In the meanwhile, we have to endure this political abuse. Its only 8 more years after all. Yes, the US voters are that thick. gasior Monday, December 5, 2016 - 12:28 pm · Reply We need tougher penalties for such crimes, including property destruction.

Image Credit: Illustration via Harrison Weber/VentureBeat Google first made waves in the hardware market when it purchased Motorola in 2011 for $12.5 billion. A company on the scale of Google getting involved in hardware put some established manufacturers on edge, though anxiety abated when Google later sold Motorola to Lenovo for $3 billion. Without being directly involved in hardware production, Google has continued to exert a huge influence over the market. Numerous hardware companies supported Android early on, helping it become the de facto alternative to iOS. Now, smartphone companies have no choice but to embrace Google. The development sounding alarms throughout the tech world, however, is the recent launch of the Google Pixel smartphone. The stars truly aligned for the Pixel’s launch, with missteps from Samsung and Apple providing an ideal window for the new device. While Samsung struggles with the worst manufacturing mistake in the history of the mobile industry, Apple has been under fire for its “courage” to release an iPhone without a headphone jack. The conditions are ideal for the Pixel to succeed. That thought should signal terror in the tech world. Playing favorites Google has a near monopoly of the mobile operating system marketplace, with about 88 percent of the market, according to the International Data Corporation. In the same way Google first destroyed its search engine competitors, I believe the company is on a path to dominate the hardware arena. Companies such as Samsung, LG, and others that have come to rely on the Android OS suddenly find themselves in a precarious position. They will have no way to compete once Google begins to give its own devices preferential treatment through software updates and new features. The last time Google attempted to break into mobile hardware with its $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility, Samsung seemed ready to jump ship from Android OS. The latest shot across the bow of the smartphone world puts companies such as Samsung and LG in a terrible spot, likely forcing them to seek business outside of the mobile marketplace. HTC — the original equipment manufacturer of the Pixel — has already started to diversify its portfolio by entering the virtual reality space with its Vive. Google’s products differ from competitors because the company can leverage the mountain of data in its ecosystem. The Pixel’s Google Assistant artificial intelligence surpasses Microsoft’s Cortana and Apple’s Siri by drilling down into users’ existing Google accounts to personalize every interaction. Google has snared billions of users with its intuitive and essential services, giving it an incredible advantage over competitors. Some have dismissed the threat of Google’s hardware ambitions, pointing to legendary smartphone failures from Amazon and Microsoft. Others hope privacy concerns raised by Google’s growing digital hegemony will spark consumer backlash, hamstringing Google’s hardware push before it builds momentum. It’s a mistake to see Google’s focus on hardware as a market disruption. The Pixel is primed to upend the mobile marketplace. Google’s growing ambition The Pixel smartphone is part of a pipeline of new Google products set to invade various verticals. Google Home will compete with Amazon’s Echo. Google Wifi is designed to make all other Internet routers obsolete; Apple recently ceased development of its own line of wireless routers. And the Google Daydream headset could quickly take over the nascent VR market. Startups and established business alike should rethink their strategies in response to Google’s hardware aspirations: Build a moat. No matter how unique you think your startup might be, you will eventually face competition from Google and other companies. File patents early in the creation process to protect your intellectual property and protect your company against duplication or displacement. Microsoft famously had to pay $290 million in damages to small Canadian company i4i after allegedly infringing on i4i’s patent by using an XML feature in Word. Don’t become reliant. Many companies become vulnerable to Google because their infrastructure relies on the tech giant’s creations. Smartphone manufacturers had a choice between creating their own operating systems or outsourcing that work to Google. HTC, Samsung, LG, and others opted to embrace Android OS because it was the easy solution. Android-based phones have been successful for years, but these companies face an existential crisis as Google enters the hardware fray. Independent development is a major undertaking, but it’s the only way to create something Google cannot. Smaller organizations can contract with a third-party developer if they lack the internal infrastructure. Stay fresh. Google has deep inroads with customers via Gmail, YouTube, and myriad other offerings. The only way a competitor can hold out against Google is by offering unique products and bringing diversity to its lineup. You might be a hardware company right now, but you’ll need to branch out into software over time. FitBit, Skull Candy, and Blackberry have all learned this lesson the hard way. Focus on your organization’s core mission, and brainstorm new ways to meet that goal. I believe the image is changing of Google as a benevolent tech giant more interested in innovation than monopolization. Companies would be wise to take steps to protect themselves from losing ground to Google, as the Silicon Valley giant is poised to dominate the hardware space for the foreseeable future.

(YouTube/iFunography) Share Written by Mike Murphy December 17, 2016 When Apple launched the latest version of its streaming device, the Apple TV, in 2015, it unveiled a set of stunning slow-motion screensavers for the device. The short videos that play when the box is idle depict aerial footage of some of the most famous skylines and landscapes around the world, and yesterday, Dec. 16, it introduced some new ones, including the skyline of Dubai, and the snowy hills of Greenland. Love the Apple TV Aerial screensavers. The new ones today are stunning. https://t.co/p12N640Elu pic.twitter.com/uEODd3yoBF — Owen ⚡️ (@ow) December 16, 2016 For some reason, Apple has confined this set of beautiful screensavers to the Apple TV. But if you’d like to have these vistas greet you when you return to your idle Mac laptop or desktop, there’s actually a pretty simple way to do that, according to Cult of Mac. To add the screensavers to your Mac, follow these steps: Download the Aerial project from GitHub. (It should automatically download from that link, but if it doesn’t, try reading this.) Open the .zip file and double-click the file “Aerial.saver” to install it. If your system’s setup doesn’t automatically allow downloads from untrusted developers, open System Preferences, click on “Security & Privacy,” and there should be an option to open the file after you enter your admin password. Return to System Preferences, click on “Desktop & Screen Saver,” then “Screen Saver.” Scroll down to find Aerial and select it. Click Screen Saver Options to customize which scenes Aerial uses. There are different options that you can choose to determine which flyovers you want to use as a screensaver, but by default, it’ll randomly choose one every time the computer is idle. And that’s it, you should now have some stunning flyovers available as screensavers that are far more interesting than the standard Mac options.

Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp, CFP (TMFAlison) Dec 17, 2016 at 2:04PM On this episode of Motley Fool Answers, the cast turns their attention to investor health beyond retirement accounts and stock holdings. Instead, they welcome the Motley Fool's chief wellness officer Sam Whiteside onto the show, as she shares some important tips with listeners on how to make healthier choices amid the many temptations that accompany the holiday season. You can still enjoy your eggnog and holiday meals while building momentum for the new year. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Nov. 22, 2016. Alison Southwick: This is Motley Fool Answers. I'm Alison Southwick and I'm joined, as always, by Robert Brokamp, personal finance expert here at The Motley Fool. He's also the advisor on Motley Fool's Rule Your Retirement newsletter. Such a great newsletter. Robert Brokamp: Well, thank you very much, Alison. Southwick: It's the holidays -- that special time of year where we don festive sweaters and get stressed-out drunk and a little more chubby. But it doesn't have to be that way. The Motley Fool's chief wellness officer joins us with five ways to maintain and not gain over the holidays. We'll also answer your question about creating a portfolio of ... bonds? Brokamp: A special type of bond fund. That's what we're going to talk about here. I know. I know you're excited. I know. Alison is falling asleep, everyone out there in Podcastland. Southwick: Well, no. I mean, obviously we got a question about it, so it matters to someone. It just doesn't matter to me and I am naturally predisposed to kind of fall asleep whenever the word bond ... It's like The Manchurian Candidate where I hear the word "bond" and it's just like boom. She falls asleep rather than like activates and tries to assassinate someone. Brokamp: Yes. Well, I prefer that you fall asleep, rather than the other one, since I'm the only one in this room with you right now. Southwick: Who knows? Maybe there is a word out there. You've got to be careful what you say. Brokamp: OK. Southwick: All that and more on this week's episode of Motley Fool Answers. __ Southwick: All right, it's time for Answers, Answers and today's question comes from Steve. Are we sure this isn't Steve Broido? Brokamp: It's not Steve Broido. Southwick: Our in-house bond expert? Brokamp: No. Southwick: All right. Steve writes: "I continue to hear about the risk that rising interest rates pose to traditional bond funds, as well as the benefits of laddering individual bonds, but I'm intimidated by picking and maintaining a portfolio of individual bonds. What are your thoughts on laddering target-dated maturity bond funds such as Guggenheim's corporate bonds or iShare's muni bonds?" All right, Bro. Make this interesting to me. Brokamp: OK. Well, I don't know if I can do that, but, Steve, your concerns are valid. Interest rates are at historic lows. Just for an example, a 10-year Treasury, pretty much the main benchmark rate, in July hit historic lows. But when rates go up, the values of existing bonds go down. So actually, rates have gone up since July. So if you look at, for example, the Vanguard Total Bond Index Fund, the biggest bond fund in the world, it's actually down 3% over the last three months. And you think, "Well, bonds are safe. Oh, my goodness. My investment has dropped 3%," so this is a concern for anyone who's looking for an alternative to the stock market. Some people will recommend individual bonds. You buy a bond for, let's say, $1,000. A five-year bond. Rates go up. The value of it in the marketplace will go down, but as long as you hold it to maturity and the company is still in business, you'll get your $1,000 back in five years. Southwick: And that is what we talked about with the Steve Broido episode. Brokamp: Right, exactly. Bond funds, though, fluctuate in value. You don't know what you're going to get. But buying individual bonds can be complicated and you do have to own many to be specially diversified. So a company called Guggenheim, and then followed by iShares, came up with a solution. They have what are called target-date maturity bond funds in that you buy, for example, the 2018 bond fund and it only holds bonds that mature in 2018. At the end of 2018, you just get all your money back, because all the bonds have matured. Southwick: Oh! Brokamp: So it's a way to get the benefits of holding individual bonds but instant diversification, so it's actually a pretty good deal. Let's take a look very quickly at the bond fund that's going to mature this year, 2016. It matures at the end of the year. Over the last five years, it has earned an average of almost 3% a year. That's about what the overall bond market has earned, so that's good. And when you compare it to -- I mentioned that Vanguard is the biggest bond fund -- the second biggest bond fund, PIMCO Total Return, that's actually earned a little over 3% a year. The next is NatWest. The total return -- that's earned over 4% a year. So while I like these Guggenheim target-date bond funds, you probably won't get the same returns as you might get with another type of fund, but you also won't get the fluctuation. I mentioned how a lot of bond funds have actually come down over the last three months. This 2016 Guggenheim fund has actually made a little bit of money. Why? Because it's 2016. This is the year these bonds are maturing, so actually half that bond is already in cash, because those bonds have matured. So I think it's a great option if you are looking for something that's going to earn a little bit more than cash. You want a little bit more security about the money. But over the long term, I don't think that they will have quite the same returns as a traditional diversified bond fund that you hold for the long term. Southwick: Can you address the laddering part? I kind of understand laddering. Brokamp: Laddering is you buy different bonds -- and you can do it with CDs, too -- of different maturities. So maybe you put some of your money in a bond that matures one year, then two years, three years, four years, and five years. Every year you have bonds coming due -- so you have some liquidity there -- but you also have some bonds that are longer dated, because the longer the bond is, the higher interest rate you're going to get. Southwick: And every year that they mature, then you buy another year out. Brokamp: Right, exactly. And these target-date ETFs actually can be good for that. In fact, on Guggenheim's website, you even have a tool in there where you put in how long you want your ladder to be, how much you want to put in your ladder, and it will tell you which ETFs to buy and how much to invest in those ETFs. Southwick: So generally speaking, bottom line, not a bad idea, Steve. Brokamp: Not a bad idea. Especially if you're retired and you want to protect money that you need in the five years, it's a great idea. If you're just buying bonds for diversification to your long-term portfolio, a regular bond fund is probably OK. __ Southwick: Bro, how much weight do you think you gain over the holidays? If you had to guess? Brokamp: If I had to guess? Three to five pounds. Southwick: Three to five pounds. You know what? That is actually what most people say -- is that they gain about five pounds over the holidays. Brokamp: What you're saying is I'm just average. Is that what you're saying? Southwick: Well, no. Well, a little. But sometimes it's OK to be average. Studies vary on how much weight people actually gain on average. Some stories will say that it's like seven to 10 pounds, especially if it's a reporter who's writing a story about the epidemic of gaining weight over the holidays. The New York Times says actually the average is closer to one pound; however, if you're already overweight, you're likely to gain closer to five pounds. Brokamp: Mm. Southwick: So, I don't know how that makes you feel. Brokamp: It might be the type of food. There's so much more rich and sweet food you just feel worse because you're eating it. Maybe that's why I feel it more. The eggnog. Oh, my gosh, the eggnog. Southwick: I'm sure you consumed five pounds of food. Brokamp: Oh, I love the eggnog. Southwick: Well, anyway. Today we are joined by the Fool's chief wellness officer, Sam Whiteside, and she brings us her best advice to maintain and not gain over the holidays. Hi, Sam. Sam Whiteside: Hi, Fools. Southwick: Thanks for coming back to the show. Whiteside: Absolutely. It's been too long. Southwick: It has been too long. Brokamp: It has. Southwick: So what I like about your "Maintain, Don't Gain" challenge that you do here at the Fool is the idea that, "Listen. We know you're going to overindulge. Just try to maintain. I'm not asking you to lose weight. Just try not to get fatter." Whiteside: Exactly. It's more about being cognizant in the moment, and making sure that you're aware of the choices that you're making. Southwick: Yeah, those choices. All of the choices. Whiteside: All of the choices. Brokamp: So many choices. Southwick: Because many of those choices are around the holidays, and take place at a party or among friends and family, I think it only makes sense for us to eavesdrop, a little bit, on a get-together and discover what trips people up the most over the holidays. Shall we go eavesdrop on a party? Brokamp: Let's do that. Southwick: Let's! [Door opens. Sounds of people talking at a party] Brokamp: I love living in New Hampshire! Southwick: Fill the pool with whiskey! Cannonball! Brokamp: Cannonball! [Door shuts] Southwick: So, yeah. Drinking alcohol. That happens a lot around the holidays. Whiteside: It sure does. Every single party [or get-together] I'm sure we will all attend this holiday season will have some sort of booze. Have you been to a party without booze during the holidays? Brokamp: Not that I'm aware of. Southwick: No. No. Maybe like a kid's birthday... Whiteside: No ... Southwick: ... no, even kids' birthday parties these days have like ... beer. The funny thing about alcohol is not only does alcohol have a lot of calories, but the mixers have a lot of calories and then you end up eating all this horrible food after you drink alcohol. It's just horrible. Brokamp: Did I mention eggnog yet?  Whiteside: Well, it's a funny thing. Let's take a guess. How many calories do you think an average pour of eggnog has? Southwick: Bro looks so sad right now. Brokamp: [Sobs] Don't confront me with reality! Whiteside: I'm going to tell you. It's 340 calories. Southwick: Wow! Whiteside: And 19 grams of fat. Brokamp: But eggs are good for you! Whiteside: Twelve grams of sugar ... Southwick: Wow. Whiteside: ... in a typical eggnog concoction ... Brokamp: Mm. Whiteside: ... so that brings me to my first point. The holidays -- don't use that as an excuse to overconsume and overindulge, specifically on alcohol. There are calories in those alcoholic beverages and just because it's liquid, it does not mean it doesn't count. It definitely goes into your total caloric intake. And so I usually recommend trying some alcohol-free days, specifically during the week when you know that you have a party to go to that Friday or Saturday. Number two. Every other alcoholic beverage -- maybe swap it out for a glass of water. Have that glass of water in your hand when you're walking around the party. That way someone won't come up to you and be like, "Hey, you don't have a drink in your hand." Southwick: Oh, yeah. Fools do that. Whiteside: How many times does that happen? That does happen a lot here. Your hands are empty! Brokamp: Every day, all day long. Southwick: No, not at work. Well, sometimes at work, but not often. Whiteside: So that will reduce someone coming up to you and saying, "Your hands are empty. You don't have anything in your hand." You do, and every other drink is a glass of water. Southwick: Great. Shall we head back to the party? Brokamp: Let's go. [Door opens. Sounds of people talking at a party] Southwick: I'm going to eat all the carbs. Brokamp: And the dairy. Cheese everyone. Cheese! [Door closes] Southwick: So sometimes going to parties, there's a lot of food. No, always there's food. We're Americans. Of course, at every party there is food and it's not always the healthiest. Whiteside: Yeah. And funny that you mentioned cheese. Most of the vegetables that you will likely see at holiday parties will be covered in cheese or... Southwick: Ooh, fondue! Whiteside: Right, fondue! Southwick: Cannonball! Whiteside: ... are going to be covered in things you might not typically cover vegetables with. Brokamp: Eggnog, for example? Whiteside: Eggnog, yes. Dipped in asparagus. Southwick: Ooh! Whiteside: That sounds amazing. And so I usually instruct Fools or clients to not only make sure you prepare for these parties, [but to] bring a healthy dish; specifically if it's a potluck get-together. Be the change in the world by bringing a healthy dish to an unhealthy party. Brokamp: You'll be so popular, too. Southwick: Well! Whiteside: And don't just bring a crudités plate or a vegetable tray that you picked up at your local grocery store. Make it fun. I usually do a sweet potato dish that's diced sweet potatoes, red potatoes, and purple potatoes drizzled with olive oil and a little bit of pesto. Stick it in the oven. Pull it right out five minutes before and top it with goat cheese. Not exactly the healthiest option you could ever eat in your entire life, but it's definitely one of the healthier options you might be able to bring to a holiday party. Southwick: You know what blew my mind when I had it? And we had it here at the Fool and we had a nutritionist come. And it was cauliflower to be made like mashed potatoes. Brokamp: I have heard of this, but I never tried it. Southwick: [Whispers] It was amazing. Brokamp: Really? Southwick: It was just cauliflower, salt, and like olive oil. Whiteside: It's hard, sometimes, to tell the difference between a really good cauliflower mash and regular mashed potatoes. Brokamp: Wow! Whiteside: So a good resource that I use a lot is a website called SparkPeople.com. On that website you can easily find all kinds of fitness and nutrition tips and you can also search for recipes that are low in sugar, or heart-healthy recipes, or that might be more diabetic friendly. Or with a specific vegetable. That website I definitely recommend for anyone looking for a healthy option. Southwick: I would also recommend making the recipe at least once before you take it to the party. Whiteside: That, too ... Southwick: Because I have made that mistake so many times where I just show up with this casserole dish and I'm like, "I'm sorry." I hand it over and then I walk away. Whiteside: It looks bad, but it might taste good. Brokamp: So let's say someone doesn't want to gain over the holidays, they go to a party, and they overindulge. Is it reasonable to compensate the next day by basically fasting or just eating vegetables? Can you counteract what you do by going the extreme other way on the next day or for the following week? Whiteside: That's a great question. I'm never really a great proponent of fasting. Your body is a machine. You need to feed it for it to perform, and so I definitely do not recommend fasting. Increasing your vegetable count during the holidays is always a good idea. And it's funny that you mentioned that. The Washington Post actually came out with a piece today that says "11 strategies for getting through the holidays without weight gain," and one of those strategies was to increase your vegetables during this time. So I would recommend that. I would definitely not recommend fasting. Southwick: You also recommended in the past eating before you go to a party. Whiteside: Absolutely. Southwick: So there you go. Get your vegetables in then, Bro ... Brokamp: OK. Southwick: ... so you can pound all the eggnog you want. Brokamp: And my asparagus-nog. Southwick: All right, are we ready to head back to the party? Brokamp: Let's go! [Door opens. Sounds of people talking at a party] Southwick: I am way too busy researching Westworld fan theories online and there is no time left to exercise. [Door closes] Southwick: It's always funny to me how people are like I don't have time. I don't have time. I don't have time. But, like me, I do have time to research fan theories on Westworld online, and I do have time to do a lot of stuff. So I make these excuses to not exercise and do a lot of things when the truth is I do have time. I just choose not to use that time for things that are good for me. Whiteside: That's a great point. Especially during the holidays we're going to be surrounded with not only numerous indulgences and tempting offers, but we have family coming in and out of town. We're travelling. These are all things that can definitely weigh heavily on the fact that we only have 24 hours in a day. If you have 10 minutes, you have time to exercise. There should really be no excuse to make sure that you're taking care of yourself, especially during a stressful time. There are numerous apps out there that can provide you with free, really easy body weight workouts. If you're traveling and you know you're going to be staying in a hotel, make sure that hotel has a gym before you make the reservation. A lot of hotels out there, now, are even renting or giving [away new workout clothes]. Southwick: Oh! Brokamp: Really! Whiteside: Yes, you can actually rent ... Brokamp: Everything cleaned? Whiteside: I would hope so. Brokamp: OK. Whiteside: You can rent workout clothes or a pair of shoes. So that is another way to make sure that you're reducing those barriers. Southwick: Right, so no excuses if there's clothes, there. Whiteside: Yes, reduce the excuses and the barriers. Again, if you have 10 minutes, you have time to exercise. Even if you spend that 10 minutes taking a walk, it is much better than going ahead and taking a seat on that couch. Southwick: You talked about the importance of having a friend or a family member to hold you accountable. Whiteside: Absolutely. Specifically, you want somebody who can help hold you accountable that hopefully lives within a close-enough distance to where you guys actually interact. Not necessarily on a daily basis, but possibly on a weekly and definitely on a monthly basis. Making sure that you have those interactions. For me, I have a couple of cousins in the area, and we schedule morning walks during the time that we know it's stressful. We're both off of work, there's stuff going on, but we're making sure that we're holding each other accountable. Southwick: Or a co-worker, perhaps. Whiteside: Or a co-worker. Brokamp: Hm? Southwick: I could do a better job holding you accountable, huh? Brokamp: You could. What would you say is like a healthy amount of weight loss over a given period of like a month? Or maybe even a week? Southwick: You're not even looking to maintain. You're looking to lose? Is that what you're saying? Brokamp: Because I've been working with Sam and I've had trouble sticking with things, so I'm like, "Here we are talking about this. Talking about accountability ..." Whiteside: Yes. Brokamp: I'm going to put some money on the line. Southwick: Oh! Brokamp: Like what's a healthy amount? Whiteside: Are we putting money on the line right here? Southwick: Right now. Brokamp: I'm just talking about it. I'm thinking about it. So you tell me. Southwick: He backed out of that pretty quickly, didn't he? Brokamp: What's a healthy amount of weight for someone to expect to lose in a week that isn't crazy? Whiteside: I am a big believer of the two-to-three pound rule. Of course, it's going to depend on how much you weigh, male or female, your current level of activity, how many calories you're currently consuming, and how many calories you plan to possibly cut. But two to three pounds of weight loss per week is a safe number depending on those things that I just mentioned. Brokamp: So someone losing 10 pounds between now and the end of the holidays would be quite an accomplishment? Whiteside: Are you promising that you're going to lose 10 pounds... Southwick: Wow! Whiteside: ... in my "Maintain, Don't Gain?" Brokamp: I think so. Whiteside: I'll take that challenge. Brokamp: All right. I'm putting $200 on the line. Southwick: Two hundred? Whiteside: Two hundred? Brokamp: Two hundred dollars on the line. So by December 31st. Is that the end of the holidays or are we saying January 2nd? Southwick: No, after New Year's. Whiteside: Yeah. I'm giving all Fools until the end of the first week in January to weigh out. Brokamp: All right. Southwick: All right. Brokamp: So $100 ... Well, $200 ... Southwick: You said $200! Brokamp: I was going to say $100 for each of you and then I looked at Rick. I'm like, all right. You guys are going to have to figure out how to split up the $200. Southwick: Rick and I can split up the $200. Brokamp: All right, so we've got to do a weigh-in after this. OK. All right. Whiteside: Bring it on. Southwick: This is fun. I know for me personally, I never lose weight. It's just when I exercise more, I think I must gain muscle, and then my clothes fit better, but I never, ever lose weight. Whiteside: And that's something else to be cognizant of. Don't just rely on the number on the scale. That is not an indicator of your total health. That definitely does not correlate with how hard you've been working. We see it all the time in the show The Biggest Loser. Those individuals are working their tails off for that entire seven days. They go to weigh in and sometimes they gained weight. Your body will fluctuate, and your body will sometimes see things as a stressor. So that's also really important why you need to maintain your stress during the holidays, as well. Southwick: Oh, hey. That's a great segue into our next trip to the holiday party. [Door opens. Sounds of people talking at a party] Brokamp: Everyone in my family has opinions on how to cook the turkey and fix our economy. I'm so stressed. [Door closes] Southwick: Yeah, so stressed. I'm actually pretty lucky that my holidays are usually pretty stress-free, but for other people like old Bro, over here ... Brokamp: I think this holiday season will be very interesting, given the recent election, for people who come from mixed political families like I do. So it will be interesting. Whiteside: It will be interesting. So a great way, and an easy way, and a way that will not take very much of your time to make sure that you're handling, managing, decreasing your stress is the "M" word, meditation. The "M" word ... Brokamp: The "M" word ... Whiteside: Some people are so scared of meditation. You'll be so surprised. Or they think, "Oh, gosh. That's not for me. I can't do that." Or, "That's too left field." The idea of meditation is simply to find a quiet space and to try and put more time in between the thoughts that come through your mind. It's not about doing yoga, or standing on your head, or having a certain pose, or being completely quiet and having no thoughts come in. It's basically trying to put more space in between the thoughts that come through your brain. Because we're humans, our brains are consistently trying to create stories around things that come through, and it's basically just trying to decrease that. [To] give yourself more quiet space in your brain. There's some really great apps out there. Some free ones. Calm, Headspace, Omvana, Take a Break, and Smiling Mind are some of the top free apps out there. Some cheap ones are Buddhify and Simply Being. And with each of these apps you can go anywhere from five minutes to 45 or 60 minutes of meditation. You can play with the music. Different themes. There can be guided imagery. An easy way to make sure that you're taking care of yourself and decreasing that stress. Southwick: So what does that mean, though? I think when people think of meditation, they think of someone sitting in the lotus position. Is that what it's called? And just being like, "Ohhmmm." Whiteside: Right. Southwick: While incense is wafting through, and chimes, and stuff like that. Brokamp: Boomm ... Southwick: So what are you going to get from one of these apps? What is this app going to ask me to do? Because if there's some funky mind control in there by some tech company... And yes, maybe I got these conspiracy theories from watching Westworld, but ... Brokamp: Pull out your credit card ... Southwick: What's going to happen when I use one of these apps? Whiteside: That's the great thing about all the apps that I mentioned. There's a lot of different variability that you can play with. You can play with different music or the different sounds. Or having someone speak to you. Or, "No, I don't want to listen to anyone talk right now. I just want to listen to some waves crashing on the beach." And so you definitely have all of those choices with all of those apps that I just mentioned. Brokamp: In a previous episode I mentioned the Beck Diet Solution, which is based on cognitive therapy ... basically how you think affects how you act, and one of the premises of the book is we have all these permission-giving thoughts about eating when we know we shouldn't, and I think stress is a big part of that. I'm very stressed. I know I shouldn't eat this, but I'm so stressed I'm going to go ahead ... Whiteside: Exactly. Brokamp: ... and eat this, or I need that drink because I'm so stressed. Whiteside: Right. We place a link between those things, and there should be no link. Don't give yourself an excuse to have two brownies just because you're stressed out. If you're stressed out, find a different coping mechanism. Find a positive one that's going to impact you in a positive way. Southwick: I'm currently in the process of trying to link running and destressing. Brokamp: It will work, too. Southwick: It does work. I just have to keep reminding myself that I will feel better, and I will feel less stressed if I go run for a little bit. Whiteside: Right. Southwick: But it's like reprogramming myself. Whiteside: Right. And as a Western culture, we associate food with happiness and food with decreasing stress. Or food as a gift. Those are things in our culture I see we can probably work on. It definitely plays a huge role in a family unit. Every time that you get together with your girlfriends, or you have a big family outing, we all eat, or drink, or eat and drink a lot. That's something that provides a lot of joy, but you can find joy in other ways. Southwick: Make it a sometimes. Sometimes food. Well, we are done with the cocktail party, but I do want to hear Sam's bottom-line, best piece of advice for everyone over the holidays, and it is... Whiteside: Shoo! That's a hard one, but if I had to choose one thing, it would definitely be to volunteer. Give back. Specifically during the holiday season, we not only are stressed out, but we're making possibly poor decisions. We're being pulled at all different angles and what I call "keeping your tank full"... Our tanks start to decrease. We start to feel frazzled. So for me, an easy way to keep my tank full or to refill that tank is to give back in some capacity. An easy way to do that for me is to go onto a couple of different websites. One is HandsOn Network. It's definitely an easy way to find local volunteer opportunities wherever you are. If you going to PointsofLight.org/HandsOnNetwork, you will be able to find local volunteer opportunities pretty much in whatever zip code you live in. I have been using that network, probably, for about six or seven years. On Thursday morning on Thanksgiving Day, I will be volunteering at New Hope Housing's Thanksgiving lunch, so I will be making dinner rolls the night before and a potato dish of some kind, and a healthy... Brokamp: A healthy one, of course. Southwick: I've heard of one that has sweet potatoes and regular potatoes. Whiteside: Yeah, where'd you get that from? Brokamp: And asparagus-nog. Southwick: Someone is making asparagus-nog. That's like the meanest thing you could make for someone. Whiteside: That is horrible. That sounds gross. And so I will be serving that food to some of our chronically homeless here in Alexandria. So, yeah. Brokamp: Good for you. Southwick: Yeah! Brokamp: That's great. Southwick: I love that idea, because if you're volunteering, you're not eating, you're not overindulging, and you're also not spending money which we also like to do. Whiteside: Save that money. Brokamp: Could you imagine serving food to the homeless and then overindulging? Taking all their food? That would be horrible. Absolutely horrible. Whiteside: That is not giving back well. That is not going to help you lose those 10 pounds. Brokamp: I'm here for the free food. Southwick: If you did donate asparagus-nog, you would get it all to yourself, so you could overindulge in that case. Thank you so much for joining us, and coming in today, and sharing your great advice. This has been really wonderful. Whiteside: It's been wonderful to be here, and I hope it isn't another six or 12 months before I see you again. Brokamp: It won't be. Whiteside: I mean I see you around the office, but... Southwick: No, it won't be. Brokamp: It might be just the beginning of next year when I'm not giving you $200. Whiteside: Boom! I want that money though. Brokamp: There you go. Whiteside: I kind of want that money, though. Southwick: I'm going to spend it all on wine, and cheese, and crackers. Whiteside: And carbohydrates. Southwick: And all the carbohydrates. __ Southwick: Well, that's the show. I want to thank Harris and Shoots who sent postcards from Dubai and Helen of Montana, respectively. Brokamp: Very nice. Southwick: I love it! They still come in! Amy at the front desk will come up, and she'll drop them off at my desk, and then she'll cover her ears, because I'll squeal. And then my husband -- he sits like 15 feet from me. People will be like, "What happened?" And Ron will say, "Ugh, Alison just got some more postcards from listeners." Oh, I love him so much.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About January 6, 2017 Apple II Web Server Written In BASIC 17 Comments by: Lewin Day December 17, 2016 The Apple II was the machine that many say launched Apple as a company. As with many popular computers of the 1980s, the Apple II maintains a steady following to this day who continue to develop new hardware and software to keep the platform alive. [deater] had scored an Uthernet II Ethernet interface for his Apple IIe, based off the venerable W5100 chipset. He decided to have some fun and wrote a webserver for the Apple II in BASIC. The program sets up the Ethernet card with a series of PEEKs and POKEs, and then listens out for incoming packets before responding with the requisite data loaded from floppy disk. The server can deal with HTML, text, and even JPEG and PNG images. It’s even compliant with RFC 2324. It does suffer from some limitations however — the disk format used can only hold 140 kB, it can only serve an 8kB file at a time, and due to using a lot of string manipulation in the code, is painstakingly slow. Before you get too excited, the machine is running on a local network only, so you can’t check it out from here. However, [deater] has kindly released the source code if you wish to run it for yourself. If you’re thirsty for more 8-bit action, check out this Apple II playing animated GIFs.

I also used peek and poke for modem stuff with a 286. It was mostly around a FOSSIL system though. Report comment Reply deater says: December 17, 2016 at 11:53 am Use a modem as in just connecting to some other machine (a rasp-pi for example) and kicking out webpages over a serial port? That’s a lot simpler than programming an ethernet card. Using a modem and implementing PPP or SLIP would be more impressive, but I’m not sure if I’d want to tackle that in BASIC. Report comment Reply Erik Johnson says: December 17, 2016 at 11:57 am Option one is the most common fake “on the internet” lie propagated on these retro-machine-online fluff articles. Being a serial terminal is not impressive. Agreed on #2, At least this one is using native hardware and code… Report comment Reply Erik Johnson says: December 17, 2016 at 12:01 pm Er I guess the uthernet is modern and a bit of a cheat, but this is still cool in that the httpd is all apple basic Report comment Reply deater78 says: December 17, 2016 at 2:56 pm The anachronisms here are tricky. By the time the WWW was invented the Apple II line had more or less reached end-of-life. I think the traditional way of doing this in a “what they could have done at the time” way would be getting a contemporary 8-bit ISA Ethernet card for the PC and then remapping the pins so it could interface with the Apple II expansion slot. You’d also then have to do the entire TCP/IP stack in software, which people have done on the Apple II, but in assembly language not in BASIC. The wiznet 5100 chip used on the Uthernet II is 10 years old as is though, so that’s even getting retro depending on how young the crowd you hang out with is. Report comment Erik Johnson says: December 17, 2016 at 3:23 pm 10 years old these days is basically contemporary, we’ve pretty much stagnated in tech ability offerings. Only gotten cheaper and smaller Report comment deater78 says: December 17, 2016 at 4:13 pm > 10 years old these days is basically contemporary Try telling that to a room full of 18 year olds. Report comment Comedicles says: December 18, 2016 at 10:51 pm Near the end of the line, a Platinum IIe like in the photo, or a IIgs, owned by a typical enthusiast would have a 4 or 8 MHz (some were 10) accelerator, RAMDisk and 1M extended RAM, and hard disk that was seen as a collection of Profile drives by ProDOS. Basically the speed of an Arduino Uno if it had 64K of RAM, and rather zippy with the software of the day. For the last 10 or 15 years, Rich Dreher has been selling a card that takes an external drive or an SD card or CF card and appears as a collection of Profile partitions IIRC (with some firmware help by Dave Lyons, who was in the Apple II DTS group at Apple). Instant booting on an Apple II. An Apple IIe filled out to match a typical nit of the time, would serve the pages up over 10 times faster and anything bound by disk access, 100 times faster or more I would think. This device uses DMA. http://dreher.net/?s=projects/CFforAppleII&c=projects/CFforAppleII/main.php Report comment Gordon Aplin says: December 20, 2016 at 1:30 pm “The anachronisms here are tricky. By the time the WWW was invented the Apple II line had more or less reached end-of-life.” is a pretty accurate statement. In 1993-1995 I still used my Apple //gs to connect by modem to Atlantis multi-line BBS in Charlotte from my apartment near UNCC. On campus, I used Sun workstations running NCSA Mosaic web browser to view web pages. I set up a web server on SunOS.. I remember people at UNCC musing “wouldn’t it be nice if there were a version of Mosaic that would run on a PC”. and people on the BBS learning how to hop to other BBS’s running similar software across the country once the sysop added a modem dedicated to connect to a network of BBS’s. I was using Unix at school and GSOS or really just a terminal program on PRODOS at home. When I moved to California January 1996 I still had my GS until I finally broke down in late 1996 and went to one of the dark sides and bought a PowerPC Mac. I ran Netscape with a modem over an Apple approved dial up service. In 1998 I was one of the first customers to get DSL in Palo Alto. I remember the google beta screen. At work I of coarse used HP Unix. I had co-workers who were among the first to have cable modem and noted they could view files on the computers of any neighbor nearby who didn’t have a firewall which was all of them. In 2000 I moved to Boise and had to go back to dial up being too far from downtown to get DSL. I got AOL (gag) and met my wife in an AOL chat room in 2000. She was 18 and gave me her address to pick her up for a date. Tell that to a 2016 18 year old who has been hearing about the evils of chat rooms their entire live and they will fall off their chair. :-0 Report comment ellisgl says: December 17, 2016 at 2:01 pm You might be able to conver uIP to basic for SLIP stuff. https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20050212095825/http://www.sics.se:80/~adam/uip/ https://github.com/adamdunkels/uip Report comment Reply xorpunk says: December 18, 2016 at 11:30 am PPP and SLIP actually aren’t hard you just need to learn interrupt models(unless you have drivers) and work with Bell 202, Hayes etc..

Report comment Reply Glenn Jones (@a2retro) says: December 30, 2016 at 7:38 pm deater, I think it’s a pretty cool achievement as it demonstrates the card is approachable for non assembly language programmers (not sure how many of those there are left though ;) Thanks for sharing! Report comment Reply starhawk says: December 17, 2016 at 12:30 pm This sounds like something pretty hard to achieve in BASIC. I know I couldn’t do it, and BASIC’s about all I know… …mine’s a little more up to date though, I think… Microsoft QuickBASIC PDS 7.1… my excuse is that I learned it on a 386 when I was a lot younger. Never really finished, tho. Report comment Reply D Finn says: December 17, 2016 at 3:08 pm The cool part about this setup is that all the heavy lifting— the TCP/IP stack— is on the Uthernet II card. So the Applesoft BASIC interface is fairly simple. It’s just opening the equivalent to a Berkeley socket and then reading or sending its payload. Check out the A2RetroSystems web site to learn more about the Uthernet II card. This thing is still not being used to its full potential… yet! Report comment Reply brucedesertrat says: December 17, 2016 at 6:50 pm “The Apple II was the machine that many say launched Apple as a company. “ Yes if ‘many’ == ‘everyone who’s ever talked about it’. The Apple I got them some attention, but it was a crude kit. The Apple II was a bona-fide commercially produced computer you could buy in a store. If you want to know what ‘launched apple as a company’ you have to look past hardware. It was VisiCalc. VisiCalc was the thing that essentially launched the entire personal computer industry. I know a number of people who bought Apple II’s as ‘VisiCalc’ machines, they never ran anything else, to the point that the top row and first column were permanently etched into the monitor screens.

Core Wireless was awarded $7.3 million in damages after Apple was found to have violated two patents owned by the company. Apple was found to have infringed upon Core Wireless' patents in iPhones and iPads, taking advantage of technology that "provide innovations that improve battery life and signal quality in mobile phones". The company is expected to appeal against the ruling, but this is not the only case it has lost. Core Wireless is a subsidiary of Conversant Intellectual Property Management, and Conversant CEO Inc, and John Lindgren said: "We are very pleased with the verdict. We appreciate the efforts of the court and the jury. This confirms the strength of the Core Wireless portfolio, especially following our success against LG earlier this year in two cases in the Eastern District of Texas". In addition to the $7.3 million damages, Core is also seeking interest on the award dating back to 2011. Earlier this week, Apple lost another case too. A San Diego Superior Court jury ruled against the company in a California Labor Code violation case. Apple was accused of failing to provide legally required meal and rest breaks for a period of four years. Apple was ordered to pay $2 million, and is again expected to appeal.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox News Tech Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air Tech Home Computers Google Video Games Military Tech War Games Slideshows Laptops The best laptops of 2016 By Brooke Crothers Published December 16, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print  (Apple.) The laptop landscape changed at the end of 2016 with the introduction of the new MacBook Pros. With that in mind, here are laptops worth a look this year.  Best new laptop: 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro. The new MacBook Pros have arrived with the plenty of fanfare. Not only because they’ve been a very long time in coming but because the new lower-end MacBook Pro is offered as a replacement for the widely-used (but aging) 13-inch MacBook Air. So, it’s a big reset of Apple’s popular laptop lineup – and the market in general. The revamped MacBook Pros boasts a thinner chassis, the best Retina display yet (with support for more colors), updated processors, and Apple's new “Butterfly” keyboard, all while maintaining the same weight of the 13-inch MacBook Air, at about 3 pounds. The pricier MacBook Pro model adds a faster processor and the Touch Bar -- which, in effect, moves a touch display onto part of the keyboard. It has lots of potential but is a work in progress as we wait for major players like Adobe and Microsoft to offer support. For now, Apple offers helpful Touch Bar shortcuts for apps like Safari and Photos and the first Touch ID for a Mac, allowing you to unlock the MacBook Pro with a quick fingerprint scan. The 15-inch Pro (also sporting a Touch Bar) adds quad-core processing power, discrete AMD graphics chips (for things like video editing), and a surprisingly totable weight of only 4 pounds. THE 5 BEST SMARTPHONES OF 2016 The MacBook is an institution with lots of loyal followers. So the redesign will be a welcome change for most, despite the usual bugs and glitches that come initially with any product redesign. Price will be off-putting for some but, let’s face it, new MacBook redesigns have never been cheap. The entry 13-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1,499, the 13-inch Touch Bar version at $1,799, and the 15-inch MacBook Pro at $2,399. Best Deal: HP Chromebook 13 G1. Chromebooks have historically been ignored by most consumers. But that may be changing. They’re cheap, fast, stable, and avoid the constant, annoying update intrusions that plague Windows and Macs. Think of the Chromebook as a laptop running Android. OK, so Chrome OS doesn’t support all of the apps that Android does but core apps are there, including Google Docs, Google Play Music, photo editors, social apps, and basically anything you can access online like Skype or Microsoft Office. The HP Chromebook 13 G1 is a surprisingly high-quality, all-metal design with a very-high-resolution display. But it starts at only $499. And note that Chromebooks from Dell, HP, Toshiba, Acer, Lenovo, and Asus are often below $300. The Toshiba Chromebook 2 is a great deal starting at $269, and Dell offers a good high-end Chromebook for $429. 5 BEST TABLETS OF 2016 Best all-around consumer laptop: HP Spectre series. HP is making a slow but steady incursion into Apple’s hallowed turf. HP’s premium consumer laptops now offer excellent build quality and drool-worthy aesthetics. The Spectre (minus  the x360 suffix of the other model) is impossibly sleek at only 0.4 inches. A combination of aluminum and carbon fiber yield a feather weight of 2.45 pounds. And it offers both a good display and fast processors (laptops as thin and light as the Spectre usually come with slower Intel Core M chips). A standard configuration comes with a beefy 7th-generation Intel Core i7 processor, 256GB of solid-state storage, a 13.3-inch 1,920-by-1080 (non-touch) display, USB-C ports, and 8GB of RAM. Battery life isn’t fantastic but most users can probably expect 6-7 hours. Pricing for the Spectre starts at a reasonable $1,149.99. The 13.3-inch Spectre x360, based on the same ultra-thin design motif as the Spectre, offers a touch display that can be rotated 360 degrees, an extra-large trackpad, and lower price. Battery life is good, providing all-day use on one charge (based on an average workload). The Spectre x360 with a 7th generation Intel Core i5 chip, 8 GB memory, 256 GB of solid-state storage, and a 13.3-inch 1,920-by-1,080 touch display is $1,049.99. 5 BEST FITNESS TRACKERS AND SMARTWATCHES OF 2016 Best business laptop: Dell XPS 13 (late 2016). The XPS 13 may be the best balance of size, weight, performance, and battery life. To keep the weight down (about 2.7 pounds), Dell uses generous amounts of carbon fiber in addition to aluminum. And an almost-bezel-less display allows Dell to squeeze a 13.3-inch chassis into dimensions that are closer to a 12-inch laptop. Performance is excellent for an ultra-thin design with configurations that come with the latest 7th-generation Core i7 processors. Battery life is good. While the high-resolution display version (3,200-by-1,800 pixels) delivers between six and eight hours on average, the lower resolution display configuration can last well over 10 hours. Pricing starts at $799.99. Best luxury laptop: Microsoft Surface Book. Microsoft is the duke of detachables, which can separate the keyboard from the display/tablet component. The Surface Book isn’t cheap, but Microsoft has come closer than anyone to the holy grail of a tablet that can convert to a full-fledged laptop via its ingenious “Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge.” Salient specs include a 3,000-by-2,000 resolution display, 6th Generation Intel Core processors, and a detachable base with a great keyboard. The most powerful Surface Books are very pricey, well above $2,000. But there are deals at retailers like Best Buy where you can grab one often for $1,299.99.   Advertisement Trending in Tech 1 Apple removes The New York Times' apps from the App Store in China 2 No turning back the dial: Norway starts killing FM radio 3 Chess-playing robot at CES learns from experience 4 Make Way for the Selfie Drones 5 TV news report prompts viewers' Amazon Echo devices to order unwanted dollhouses See all Trends Scitech Connect Subscribe to the daily Geek Sheet for the top science and technology stories.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Dec 17, 2016 at 2:28PM I regularly scan Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) job boards to try to get a sense of the technologies and products that the iDevice maker is working on. Apple, like most major companies, doesn't divulge too many specifics on the projects that it's developing in these listings. Nevertheless, it's not hard to get some sense of what broad themes and ideas the company is investing in by carefully observing these listings. Image source: Apple.  In this article, I'd like to go over two items that caught my eye during my most recent perusal of Apple's latest job listings. Continued investment in liquid crystal display technology Apple is widely expected to deploy displays based on organic light emitting diodes, or OLEDs, in at least one of its next generation iPhone models. Apple is still expected to utilize more traditional liquid crystal displays, or LCDs, in its mainstream iPhone models next year, though.  Although it might have seemed as though Apple's plan is to move as quickly away from LCDs to OLEDs in future products, potentially ditching LCDs altogether fairly soon, a job listing for an Optical Display Engineer on Apple's site seems to suggest otherwise.  Apple wants somebody who "will serve as a focal point in designing, developing, characterization and optimization of the LCD optical performances for the portable displays." This individual will also "investigate up-to-date LCD technologies and generate new approaches to further enhance Apple portable display optical performances." It's quite clear from this listing that Apple's product portfolio will continue to utilize LCDs in some fashion for a long time to come, even if the company utilizes OLEDs in some of its products. This is sensible as LCDs can be much more cost effective than OLEDs. So, for lower-priced devices in Apple's product stack, sticking with LCDs (and, of course, continuing to improve them) may be the right business move for years to come. Designing its own image sensors? There is a lot of secrecy around Apple's camera technologies. A recent tear-down by Chipworks reveals that Sony (NYSE:SNE) builds the front-facing and rear-facing image sensors used in Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones. It's not clear, though, whether these sensors are the product of a joint design effort between Sony and Apple (with Sony serving as the manufacturer), or if it's a custom design by Sony aimed at meeting Apple's specifications. At any rate, Apple has a listing on its job board for an Image Sensor Analog Design Engineer. This individual, per the listing, will work as part of Apple's Camera Hardware Engineering group, which "is responsible for all research, design, development, test and qualification of camera hardware for Apple products." Once hired, the engineer will "be at the center of [an] image sensor design effort" and the job entails "scoping and documenting sensor architectures, engaging in design execution and driving sensor validation." If Apple hasn't already been designing its own image sensors, it certainly appears to be in the process of doing so now. Considering how important the quality of the camera experience is in today's smartphones, it's not a surprise that Apple wants to invest in building differentiated camera technologies for its devices.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Dec 17, 2016 at 2:26PM Liberty Media (NASDAQ:LMCK) (NASDAQ:LMCA) has recently approached Pandora (NYSE:P) with an acquisition deal -- and considering Pandora's history, the latter would probably be wise to take it. In this clip from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and David Kretzmann take a look at Pandora's less-than-spectacular 10-year run in the streaming business, how its competition became so incredibly difficult to face off against, and why it's going to be so hard for Pandora to recover its edge. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Dec. 9, 2016. David Kretzmann: Pandora is in an interesting position, looking over the past 10 years or so of financials that are available for Pandora. This is a company that has never been profitable, it has never produced positive free cash flow. So, when I see that...they lost $270 million over the past year, and they burned over $300 million in cash, you're probably not in a position where you can be overly picky when you're trying to find suitors to potentially acquire you. So, I think Pandora needs this more than Sirius or Liberty or whoever, Apple or Amazon or whoever they think might want to acquire them. I look at this and I don't think Pandora has a whole lot of negotiating leverage at this table. Dylan Lewis: And I think the further and further out we get, if you had talked about Pandora as a business two years ago and what they offer versus on-demand streaming, you'd say, "Yeah, I think the two can co-exist." I was a firm believer in that, because of the passive listening, the music recommendation side of Pandora, seemed strong enough to protect them from people who just wanted to listen to the music they wanted to listen to at that time. Spotify has done a really good job with their curated playlists, and their offering is a lot more compelling now because you can get that curated feel, and listen to the new Bon Iver album that you just want to plow right through. Kretzmann: You can listen to anything, anytime. And that's a really compelling value proposition for consumers. Spotify now has 40 million subscribers to that service. Apple Music, which just launched last year, has 20 million subscribers already. Those are the big players. Amazon just came out with a service for Prime members that's $8 a month, or $4 a month if you're just listening through your Amazon Echo device. YouTube Music is also getting off the ground a little bit. And Pandora still hasn't come out with an on-demand streaming service. Supposedly, it's going to come out later this year. But the company is still very dependent on that free, ad-based model. They do have about 80 million active listeners, people who listen every month or so. But Pandora has just been very slow adapting to what is a very clearly shifting landscape with music streaming. Lewis: Yeah, they've let competition pass them by in a way that's kind of surprising because they were really the first player out here doing this, and making music available in this way as a mainstream service. The tough thing for them is, even when they roll out this on-demand streaming option, it's going to be an uphill battle because they're competing against people that have commoditized music in a lot of ways, right? Kretzmann: Yeah, it's hard to differentiate yourself with music now. Are you going to be able to listen to songs that you can't get on Apple Music or Spotify or Amazon? I don't know, that's a tough thing to do. Maybe you see some of these companies start doing what Netflix is doing with original content with TV and movies. Maybe something like that happens. But it's hard if you're not already part of an established ecosystem like Apple and Amazon. Those are great examples where the music just fits into an ecosystem that they already have with the App Store or Amazon Prime. Pandora doesn't really have that. So, it's going to be an uphill battle, like you said, to acquire customers from people who are already used to streaming through Spotify, Amazon, Apple, or a lot of the other solutions already out there. Lewis: And those big businesses don't need music to be meaningful for them financially. If anything, it can be a loss leader for them, if it makes their core offering that much stronger. If you're a stand-alone business trying to make it work on your own, it's a lot tougher. Kretzmann: Yeah. I look at that, and music streaming is really becoming more of a commodity type of business, which you wouldn't have really anticipated five years ago. But Amazon is already upping the ante, saying, "We'll charge $8 a month." And I think, inevitably, you're just going to keep seeing that price ticking down. It will be an increasing challenge for companies to offer something that's different from the other competing options out there. So, I think consolidation is inevitable at this point. But I don't know if Pandora is really all that attractive of a target, if a company is trying to amp up their offerings. David Kretzmann owns shares of Amazon.com, Netflix, and Sirius XM Radio.

"In relation to the hypothetical of whether we would ever help build a 'Muslim registry' -- we have not been asked, of course we would not do this and we are glad -- from all that we have read -- that the proposal does not seem to be on the table," Buzzfeed quoted a Google spokesperson as saying on Saturday. But if it's ever asked to participate, "of course (Google) would not do (it)," the spokespserson added. An Apple spokesperson also noted that the company "thinks people should be treated the same no matter how they worship, what they look like, who they love". "We have not been asked and we would oppose such an effort," the Apple spokesperson added. Uber also clarified with a "No," stressing that it would not help Trump build a Muslim registry. On December 4, US-based news website Intercept reported that of the nine major tech giants, including Facebook, Apple and Google, only Twitter declined to help if US President-elect Donald Trump seeks to create a national Muslim registry. According to the report, the firms were asked if they would sell their services to help create a national Muslim registry -- an idea recently refloated by President-elect Donald Trump's transition team -- and only Twitter said no. Nearly 10 days later, Facebook broke the silence and said that it would not help US President-elect Donald Trump's administration to create a list of Muslims present in the US. In a statement to the Intercept, Facebook said: "No one has asked us to build a Muslim registry, and of course we would not do so." Facebook broke its silence after 22 different advocacy groups petitioned those companies to respond. Microsoft returned with an answer saying, "We're not going to talk about hypotheticals at this point." "We oppose discrimination and we would not do any work to build a registry of Muslim Americans," Microsoft PR head Frank X. Shaw was quoted as saying. Oracle CEO Safra Katz, who is slated to join Trump's transition team, declined to respond to Buzzfeed News' question. Meanwhile, IBM, IT giant SRA International, Canada-based Information technology consulting company CGI and Management consulting company Booz Allen Hamilton were yet to respond. --IANS qd/sku/na/vm SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features Supreme Court bans use of religion and caste in politics Trump, the Time Person of the Year In pictures: Jayalalithaa's final journey Amma passes away: Jayalalithaa's journey as most prolific Tamil actress Rs 500 fine for using PM Modi's photo in advt About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2016.

Ever since tvOS launched, the clips that showcased different landmarks and places have always been the same. Thanks to today’s news, tvOS users get a glimpse of a new series of screensaver clips on their device. As reported by 9to5Google, about twenty new clips were added by Apple. These new clips feature some of the most famous landmarks in the world, among which include the Liwa desert, the snowscapes of Greenland, and the skyscrapers in Dubai. Additionally, Apple has added numerous cities and countries into the collection. There’s an awesome videography of Los Angeles, Dubai, Hong Kong, Greenland, as well as three new videos of landmarks in China. If you use Apple TV’s Aerial screensaver, you’ll see the following new content: Los Angeles: Three day videos (1, 2, 3), one nighttime (1) Dubai: Four day videos (1, 2, 3, 4), two nighttime (1, 2) Greenland: Two day videos (1, 2), one nighttime (1) Hong Kong: Three day videos (1, 2, 3), one nighttime  (1) Liwa desert (1) Chinese landmarks (1, 2, 3) Since Apple TV randomly selects clips to showcase, it may take a while before you see these new clips on your device. But if you want to get new videos faster, you can go to Apple TV settings and choose Every Day to download new videos.   Tags: Apple, Apple TV, tvOS About Christine Torralba View all posts by

Photo / AP Innovation doesn't always go to plan, which is exactly what some of the biggest tech companies learnt this year. We decided to take a look back at some of the biggest blunders the tech world gave us in 2016. 1. SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 7 Forget 2016, Samsung'sGalaxy Note 7exploding battery saga will likely go down in the hall of fame as one of the worst product launches in history. When the smartphone was first released, it was met with overwhelming praise for its design, water resistance, iris scanner and improved S Pen features. All things pointed to the South Korean manufacturer creating the device of the year, but then disaster struck with reports of Samsung Galaxy Note 7s having issues with exploding batteries. The tech giant was forced to recall the devices and issues replacements. This didn't work as planned because the replacement devices were having the same issues. Samsung had no choice but to halt sales of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone entirely. Following the unprecedented worldwide product recall, Samsung announced the "direct cost" of the incident would reach $3.9 billion over the next two quarters. Continued below. Related Content Here's your ultimate guide to buying gadgets this Christmas Gear Friday: 3DR Solo and new GoPros Mark Gurman: How Apple alienated Mac loyalists The news came just days after Samsung announced the second recall of the smartphone saw the company's stock price fall more than $22 billion in one day. 2. APPLE'S IPHONE 7 While a move to wireless isn't the worst, Apple failed to deliver on its own solution. Photo / AP Apple's September launch of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus generated hype, but a number of delays left customers upset. It started with the diehard Aussie fans waiting outside Apple's flagship for three days. only to find out there would be no iPhone 7 Plus or jet black iPhone 7 units available. Apple said it had already sold out of its limited stock, with the jet black model of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus became increasingly rare - people ordering the phone had to wait until November. According to a research note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the global shortage was due to the new high-gloss finish being too challenging for the Apple's manufacturers. "[The jet black iPhone 7] suffers from a low casing production yield rate of 60-70 per cent," the research note read, reported MacRumours. And who can forget the removal of the headphone jack and the controversy that move caused. While a move to wireless isn't the worst, Apple failed to deliver on its own solution. The company had showcased its AirPod wireless earbuds, which took until this week to be launched in stores. 3. THE CENSUS DRAMA Photo / Supplied Remember when the Census and Australian Bureau of Statistics websites were shut down after a cyber attack. People were quick to vent frustration online, although the bureau assured the two million Australians who completed the Census before the site was shut down that their data was safe. It also said those who were unable to complete the Census because of the crash had no reason to worry. "ABS would remind Australians that they have plenty of time to complete the Census, to well into September, and again note that fines will not be imposed for completing the Census after Census night," ABS statistician David Kalisch said at the time. While it wasn't the first time census had been available online, many believed the government's heavy promotion resulted in too many people heading the website at once. Angry Aussies took to social media to slam the organisation responsible for collecting and safely securing private data, with many noting the irony of being unable to log on to the secure form. In the wake of the incident, the Australian Bureau of Statistics blamed foreign hackers and claimed it took the precaution of closing down the system to ensure the integrity of the data. The ABS said the online Census form was subject to four distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks of varying nature and severity. 4. DONGLEGATE Apple released its MacBook Pro line-up, with the products being the thinnest and fastest ever released by the tech giant. The laptops were also designed with a customisable OLED touch bar at the top of the keyboard, with hopes to make touchscreen displays obsolete. As part of its innovative approach, Apple removed all of its MacBook Pro legacy ports except for the 3.5mm headphone jack, which was worthy of its own story. This meant there were no longer ports for USB 3, HDMI, SD Card or even Apple's MagSafe connector, with the tech company opting for four USB Type-C ports. So in order to effectively use their new MacBook Pro, consumers needed to buy a number of dongles - $370 of them to be precise. As the latest iPhone 7 charging cable was USB 3 to Lightning, a dongle was needed to charge Apple's latest smartphone on its most recent MacBook Pro. With no HDMI port on the new laptops, another dongle was required to hook the new MacBook up to a television screen. While the full list is much more extensive than those mentioned above, the overall backlash caused Apple to reduce the price of its dongles. 5. GOPRO KARMA Just two weeks into the market, GoPro recalled its Karma Drone and give out free Hero 5 cameras as compensation. Photo / AFP It was only a matter of time before GoPro released its own drone device and in September this became a reality. GoPro founder and chief executive Nick Woodman showed off the much anticipated product during an event in California. "We transformed GoPro into an end-to-end storytelling solution," he said. The folding drone shipped in a backpack and featured a removable stabiliser, which fitted any GoPro model. Impressively, the drone boasted a maximum speed of 54km/h and offered 20 minutes of flight time per charge. Retailing for $1195.95 without a camera or $1649.95 with a new GoPro attached meant the device didn't come cheap, but it seemed worth the money at the time. Well, at least it did until the product started losing its power midflight, which caused it to literally plummet from the sky. Just two weeks into the market, GoPro recalled its Karma Drone and give out free Hero 5 cameras as compensation. - news.com.au By Matthew Dunn of news.com.au Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming CES 2017 GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: CES 2017 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / Mobile Phone News / LG Display will reportedly supply foldable OLED screens to Apple, Google, and Microsoft LG Display will reportedly supply foldable OLED screens to Apple, Google, and Microsoft by Joe Roberts 17 December 2016 0 shares Read Comments There's been a lot of talk about foldable displays this year, as several patents featuring the technology have emerged, but it seems there's some significant developments going on behind the scenes. That is, if a report from Korea's ETNews is to be believed. The report claims LG Display has partnered with outside companies including Apple, Google, and Microsoft, to supply those firms with foldable OLED screens. LG's display division is said to be "developing ‘out-foldable’ displays for smartphones" – technology which will apparently be used on phones for the three tech giants. Related: CES 2017 It follows a report from July which claimed LG was looking to invest $1.75 billion in the foldable OLED market, with the new report stating the company will begin mass-producing the foldable handsets in 2018. Though LG has shown off prototypes at tech shows in the past, the new report claims it has developed a new prototype with a 'significantly high' technical level – suggesting the latest concepts bring the technology much closer to consumer product level. ETNews also says Apple could introduce iPhones with flexible OLEDs in 2017, though most reports claim at least one of the iPhone 8 models will arrive with a non-flexible full-face screen that does away with the home button. Apple is said to be working on three new models for the iPhone 8, though flexible OLED seems unlikely Samsung, thought to be the other big player in the nascent flexible OLED market, is said to be developing its version of the technology entirely in-house, instead of taking the route LG has reportedly taken by partnering with outside companies. Last week another report from ETNews claimed Samsung was working on two foldable phones – one with two screens either side of a hinge, and another model with a fully flexible OLED display that would be released once the company gauged conumer response to the first model. Related: iPhone 8 Microsoft is also said to be considering flexible display tech for a Surface device, which could be the as yet unconfirmed Surface Phone. As with the rest of these claims, however, this is yet to be confirmed. None of the report's statements have been verified as legitimate, and LG has not given away any details about its flexible OLED display developments recently. But if LG has partnered with outside companies, it could be a big step in bringing the technology to the mainstream, so we're hoping ETNews is on the money with this one.

NEW YORK: Soon after Facebook and Twitter clarified that they will not help US President-elect Donald Trump's idea of developing a Muslim registry, tech giants like Google, Apple and global cab-hailing app company Uber also said they will also oppose such an effort. "In relation to the hypothetical of whether we would ever help build a 'Muslim registry' -- we have not been asked, of course we would not do this and we are glad -- from all that we have read -- that the proposal does not seem to be on the table," Buzzfeed quoted a Google spokesperson as saying on Saturday. But if it's ever asked to participate, "of course (Google) would not do (it)," the spokespserson added. An Apple spokesperson also noted that the company "thinks people should be treated the same no matter how they worship, what they look like, who they love". "We have not been asked and we would oppose such an effort," the Apple spokesperson added. Uber also clarified with a "No," stressing that it would not help Trump build a Muslim registry. On December 4, US-based news website Intercept reported that of the nine major tech giants, including Facebook, Apple and Google, only Twitter declined to help if US President-elect Donald Trump seeks to create a national Muslim registry. According to the report, the firms were asked if they would sell their services to help create a national Muslim registry -- an idea recently refloated by President-elect Donald Trump's transition team -- and only Twitter said no. Nearly 10 days later, Facebook broke the silence and said that it would not help US President-elect Donald Trump's administration to create a list of Muslims present in the US. In a statement to the Intercept, Facebook said: "No one has asked us to build a Muslim registry, and of course we would not do so." Facebook broke its silence after 22 different advocacy groups petitioned those companies to respond. Microsoft returned with an answer saying, "We're not going to talk about hypotheticals at this point." "We oppose discrimination and we would not do any work to build a registry of Muslim Americans," Microsoft PR head Frank X. Shaw was quoted as saying. Oracle CEO Safra Katz, who is slated to join Trump's transition team, declined to respond to Buzzfeed News' question. Meanwhile, IBM, IT giant SRA International, Canada-based Information technology consulting company CGI and Management consulting company Booz Allen Hamilton were yet to respond.

 Tech titans are meeting with Trump today Rob Price Dec. 14, 2016, 4:29 AM 10,796 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook is one of the expected attendees. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Some of the most powerful and high-profile leaders from the technology industry are scheduled to meet with US President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday. The meeting has the potential to be a tense affair: Silicon Valley was overwhelmingly opposed to the Republican president-elect before the election, and during the campaign he repeatedly railed against the business practices of the industry. The discussion is likely to centre on jobs and immigration — issues on which the tech community and Trump seem likely to clash. The meeting, due to be held at Trump Tower in New York, has a star-studded guest list: Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Larry Page and Eric Schmidt from Google parent company Alphabet, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Tesla's Elon Musk, IBM's Ginni Rometty, and Brian Krzanich from Intel are among the attendees, according to a roundup from The New York Times. (Sidenote: Jack Dorsey, the cofounder and CEO of Twitter — a social network beloved by Trump — was not invited.) It's all about jobs A key issue on the table will be jobs and immigration. Silicon Valley is heavily reliant on immigrant workers, hiring engineers and other employees from all over the world — but Trump ran his campaign in opposition to immigration, promising to build a wall along America's southern border and to halt Muslim immigration altogether. Trump has been critical of the H-1B skilled-worker visa program, which the tech industry uses heavily, saying in a statement in March: "I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions." Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, has expressed concern that there are too many Asian CEOs in Silicon Valley. The attendees will be hoping that Trump is prepared to be more pragmatic about the issue than his rhetoric on the campaign trail might have suggested. The tech industry and Trump do not get along Several of the attendees at the meeting have previously been the subject of Trump's ire. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly went after Bezos, the Amazon CEO who also owns The Washington Post, which aggressively reported on Trump during the campaign. President-elect Donald Trump. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Trump said Bezos had "a huge antitrust problem because he's controlling so much," while Bezos countered that Trump's strategy of targeting the news media "erodes democracy." (Bezos later promised to keep an "open mind" after Trump's election.) Trump attacked Apple over its refusal to help unlock an iPhone for the FBI in February, asking, "Who do they think they are?" and calling for a boycott. He has also targeted the company for building its iPhones in China. One of Trump's few backers in Silicon Valley is Peter Thiel, the Paypal cofounder turned billionaire investor and Facebook board member. Thiel supported Trump's candidacy, speaking at the Republican National Convention in the summer. He now sits on the president-elect's transition team, and he helped organise Wednesday's meeting. In November, Trump sat down for a similar off-the-record meeting with media executives. It was reportedly an awkward affair, with Trump attacking the assembled execs over their coverage of his campaign and their failure to anticipate his victory.

While Apple was initially interested in developing its own electric car from scratch, the New York Times relayed that Apple’s automotive initiative was being scaled back due to a lack of significant progress. Nonetheless, Apple doesn’t appear ready to give up on its automotive dreams completely. In the wake of reports that Apple has shifted its focus towards developing self-driving automotive software, Reuters is reporting that Apple not too long ago hired Alexander Hitzinger, the former “technical director of Porsche’s race car program.” Don't Miss: Is Apple looking to ‘kill’ the Galaxy Note? An engineer by trade, Hitzinger previously worked on a few Formula One racing teams before joining Porsche in 2011. Apple’s decision to bring Hitzinger on board is particularly intriguing given what he managed to accomplish at Porsche, specifically his involvement in developing the Porsche 919 hybrid race car. Porsche’s new race car won Le Mans and the endurance racing world championship in both 2015 and 2016 using largely unproven technology, which beat far more established rivals. Hitzinger helped hire and build a development team and organizational structure at Porsche, expanding from ten staff to over 150 employees. Hitzinger’s managerial experience is particularly noteworthy given that one of the reasons why some believe Apple’s automotive plans fell by the wayside is that the project lacked direction and leadership once Steve Zadesky, the previous head of Apple’s secretive Project Titan program, left the company for undisclosed personal reasons. While the idea of Apple designing and releasing its own branded car remains, in my estimation, a fantasy, the recent hire of Hitzinger along with Apple’s recent letter to the NHTSA regarding self-driving car technology suggests that Apple is still angling for an ‘in’ of some sort into the automotive industry.

Hitzinger helped Porsche return to endurance racing and to develop the 919 hybrid sports car from scratch, much in the same way Apple is now looking into building its own vehicle.Reuters | Updated: Dec 17, 2016, 03.26 PM IST Highlights Alexander Hitzinger helped Porsche to the 919 hybrid sports car He played a key role in Porche's victorious return to the Le Mans endurance race While he has not made any official comment, the move is being seen as Apple's push towards developing its own self-drive carsAlexander Hitzinger (Photo sourced from Porsche AG) FRANKFURT: Apple poached the technical director of Porsche's race car programme earlier this year, a company source said on Friday, hiring a project manager who helped engineer the sports car company's victorious return to the Le Mans endurance race. Alexander Hitzinger is the latest auto specialist to be recruited by technology giant Apple as it explores building its own car. Earlier this month, Apple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on developers of self-driving cars. Hitzinger could not be reached for comment. The move was first reported by Germany's Manager Magazin. Officially, Porsche only confirmed Hitzinger had left the luxury carmaker in the spring. Apple was not immediately available for comment. Hitzinger helped Porsche, owned by Volkswagen, return to endurance racing and to develop the 919 hybrid sports car from scratch, much in the same way Apple is now looking into building its own vehicle. Porsche's new race car won Le Mans and the endurance racing world championship in both 2015 and 2016 using largely unproven technology, which beat far more established rivals. Hitzinger helped hire and build a development team and organisational structure at Porsche, expanding from ten staff to over 150 employees. Hitzinger's LinkedIn profile states he left Porsche in March and joined a "Technology Company" located in the San Francisco Bay Area as an engineering executive in April. Hitzinger is quoted by Manager Magazin as saying he wanted to do something "which has a significant and direct impact on society", but did not confirm he now worked at Apple.

According to reports that cites Apple’s Taiwanese supply chain, the next iPhone dubbed iPhone 7S might come in a flashy red colour. Japanese blog Mac Otakara also claimed that the phones might get a hardware refresh. “Basic design etc does not change, it seems that it will be only updates such as loading A11 chip, and it says that it does not seem to be wireless charging or glass chassis,” the blog explained adding that the new phones will be an update to the 7 and the 7 Plus — and will be called 7S and 7S Plus. Otakara also said that the only update will come in the form of a faster CPU — the A11 chipset and the phones will also not support wireless charging. This, however, is in contrast to KGI Securities’ Apple analyst Ming-Chi, Kuo who had earlier predicted that Apple’s next iPhone models to incorporate an all glass chassis design with integrated wireless charging. Mac Otakara’s source said both standout features are unlikely to debut in 2017, at least for the “iPhone 7s” series. The feature might be reserved for the 10th anniversary edition — iPhone 8 — expected to be launched later in 2017. Kuo and other experts also believe that Apple is primed to debut a third model alongside its usual 4.7- and 5.5-inch smartphone offerings. The special edition variant will be positioned at a price point above the “iPhone 7s” series and feature a 5.1- or 5.2-inch OLED display with “invisible” home button, all-glass housing, wireless charging and other exotic technologies. Mac Otakara has a strong track record when it comes to iPhone predictions. The Japanese blog was first to report on iPhone 7’s 3.5mm headphone jack deletion, as well as this year’s Jet Black colour option.

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Apple FLASH SALE: Driver Booster 4      40% OFF! iPhone 8 Could Copy Samsung Galaxy Note’s Signature Feature GO Apple Pencil support suggested by new patent application Dec 17, 2016 06:15 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  ​ Apple is working on giving the iPhone 8 a complete overhaul of the existing generation, and according to new information, introducing Apple Pencil support might be one way to achieve that. A patent application spotted by PatentlyApple reveals that Apple is very serious about bringing stylus support on a future iPhone model, and there’s a good chance that the 2017 version is the one. This isn’t the first time we hear about stylus support on the iPhone, and people with knowledge of the matter previously hinted that Apple wanted to introduce this feature on a supposed Pro SKU for the iPhone 7. Although at first it seemed that these sources were wrong, this doesn’t appear to be the case, as Apple indeed planned on bringing the Apple Pencil on the iPhone, but only on a later model. The patent suggests that the Apple Pencil would work on the iPhone just like the S Pen on Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7. A dedicated menu would automatically fire up when the Pencil is close to touching the screen, while also offering certain options when the iPhone is locked. Users will be able to take notes, draw on the screen, crop, and work with the pen just like a typical Samsung user. Exclusively offered on the iPhone Pro? The Pro version of the iPhone, if Apple indeed launches one, could come with a bigger screen that would make sense for the Pencil to be introduced in the iPhone lineup. Rumor has it that the iPhone Pro could feature a display that’s larger than 5.5 inches, and previous reports claimed that Apple was aiming for 5.7- or 5.8-inch panels. It’s not yet clear if this is still the case, but the plan seems to be to introduce a display larger than the one on the Plus (5.5 inches). At this point, the Apple Pencil is exclusively available on the iPad Pro lineup, and given its dimensions, the accessory would have to be redesigned to be used on the iPhone. The patent doesn’t reveal if Apple plans to offer a built-in system for carrying the Pencil together with the iPhone, similar to what Samsung does on the Note. The next-generation iPhone is expected to launch in the fall of 2017, and given that it marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, such makeovers are indeed possible. But since we’re so far away from the moment when it’s supposed to debut, everything can change overnight.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (5 Images) #Apple#iPhone 8#iPhone#Apple Pencil#Samsung Galaxy Note subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it New patent application from Apple (5 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news iPhone 6s Bursts Into Flames Just like a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 - Report Super Mario Run for iPhone and iPad Now Available for Download Apple Releases First Betas of iOS 10.2.1, macOS Sierra 10.12.3, and tvOS 10.1.1 Court Orders Arrested Man to Reveal iPhone Passcode Nokia E1 Could Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Alongside Nokia D1, Here Are Its Specs 2015 VPN Android Bug Still There in Nougat (And It’s Pushing Users to iPhones) KillDisk System Destructive Malware Now Targeting Linux FBI Hack Most Likely a Hoax, CMS Maker Says Google Assistant on Pixel Phones to Get Support for Keyboard Input Galaxy S7 edge Blue Coral Variant to Land in Europe Soon Samsung Galaxy C5 Pro Allegedly Leaks in Live Blurry Image Google Calendar for Android and iOS Integrated with Fitness Goals 5 photos    Patent drawings showing how the pen would work on an iPhone new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments iPhone 7 Plus Cameras Turn Black and Stop Working, Users Complain more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Microsoft FLASH SALE: Driver Booster 4      40% OFF! Microsoft, Apple Working on Foldable OLED Displays for Future Phone Models GO LG Display said to be partnering with tech giants Dec 17, 2016 06:00 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  ​ LG Display has reportedly signed deals on foldable OLED displays with three of the largest technology companies out there, namely Microsoft, Apple, and Google, all of which are said to be planning on bringing these panels on their future devices. A report from etnews reveals that LG Display has already developed a prototype of a foldable display and this convinced companies like Microsoft and Apple to sign deals with the company that would have all of them invest into improving the tech. Not much is known about the collaboration because of the confidential nature of the deals, but the aforementioned source claims that LG Display is trying to gain an early advantage in its race against Samsung Display, which is investing in foldable panels as well. What’s important to note, however, is that production of this new display technology is not scheduled to start until 2018, which means that the first devices featuring it could only see daylight in late 2018 or early 2019. Apple has been looking into foldable displays for years, and the company even has several patents, but for the moment, Cupertino is yet to step into this side of the market because it’s believed that the technology is still in its early days and it’s not evolved enough to be mass produced. New Microsoft product categories On the other hand, Microsoft seems to be looking at foldable displays as a potential ingredient for inventing new product categories, a thing that the company has been investing in with its Surface lineup. Devices like the Surface Pro, the Surface Book, and Surface Studio have all been used to invent new categories, and Microsoft might be looking into doing the same thing with foldable displays. LG’s technology is specifically designed to be used on phones and tablets, but this doesn’t mean that Microsoft’s eagerly-anticipated Surface Phone will adopt it. Most likely, Microsoft could use it for a new Surface model, if it ever sees daylight - the Surface Phone is projected to launch in the fall of 2017, so foldable displays won’t be ready in time for this debut. No company commented on these new rumors pointing to investments in foldable displays, but it goes without saying that more information will emerge in the coming months, as all three tech giants are going forward with their long-term plans focusing on this type of panel. #Microsoft#Apple#Google#LG Display#foldable display subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft to Attend MWC 2017, No Surface Phone Though Windows 10 on ARM Already Generating Interest from PC Makers Snapdragon 820 Windows Phones Could Become Available Worldwide Existing Windows Phone Flagships Won’t Be Able to Run Desktop Apps Nokia E1 Could Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Alongside Nokia D1, Here Are Its Specs 2015 VPN Android Bug Still There in Nougat (And It’s Pushing Users to iPhones) KillDisk System Destructive Malware Now Targeting Linux FBI Hack Most Likely a Hoax, CMS Maker Says Google Assistant on Pixel Phones to Get Support for Keyboard Input Galaxy S7 edge Blue Coral Variant to Land in Europe Soon Samsung Galaxy C5 Pro Allegedly Leaks in Live Blurry Image Google Calendar for Android and iOS Integrated with Fitness Goals    Foldable displays could help Microsoft invent new product categories New Apps LangOver: Easily translate texts and search the Internet using Google by pressing hotkeys, with the help of this easy to use system tray application Portable Jutoh: Enables you to easily create electronic books in EPUB, MOBI, TXT, MP3, HTML and ODT formats, from existing files or from scratch SynciOS Data Transfer: Transfer contacts, messages, calendar entries or multimedia items directly from one phone to another or backup phone data to the computer WonderFox DVD Video Converter: Convert video and audio files to other formats, rip DVDs and download videos from the Internet with this powerful and intuitive application DreamPlan Home Design Software: Plan and design a house or condo for personal or professional use, with the help of multiple features such as texture settings, decorations or 3D renditions Moneydance: Keep up to date with your budget statements, transaction records and general financial trends, with this comprehensive application WifiHistoryView: Extracts information about the current and past wireless network connections of your computer, displaying a complete list you can export Reader comments Lynda.com Hacked, 55,000 Passwords Reset more on: Lynda.com i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple gives employees t-shirt and credo print for the holidays By Cody Lee, Dec 16, 2016 Tweet 39 Comments Apple this year is giving each of its retail employees a special edition t-shirt and credo printing gift for the holidays. MacRumors has photos of the presents, which show a gray t-shirt featuring a two-circle design made up of all of Apple’s retail locations. As for the credo, it’s printed on what appears to be glossy, heavy paper and it even comes in a protective envelop. Apple introduced the 6-paragraph statement earlier this year, which starts off “we are here to enrich lives, to help dreamers become doers.” While the gift is a nice gesture for the holidays, it’s a bit of a step-down from Apple has given its employees in recent years. For example, in 2015 it handed out urBeats headphones and an Apple Music subscription, and in 2014 it gave out backpacks.

Poor apple employees. They deserve more. ConduciveMammal Deserve more? You mean like their salary? They do their job and get paid for it. Mark S More than most get from their employer. We didn’t get anything in government and I don’t expect anything. Anonymouse Yes but to be fair you don’t do anything in Government. 🙂 ericesque That’s harsh. Oxygen can’t convert itself into CO2… Anonymouse That is funny..Oh my, what have I started!!! Shadowelite123 I don’t see anyone laughing… Anonymouse It is extremely difficult to see someone laughing whilst you’re looking at a pc screen, tablet or mobile device screen. That may explain your problem. Shadowelite123 It’s actually not. You must be thinking about emotions. In basic English, seeing someone send a text based message with phrases like “haha” or “lol” are usual indicators of laughter. Emotion is not necessary with laughter as there are many forms of which have varying emotions depending on the choice of words. So there is no problem, with seeing someone laughing, just your perception of the English language. Jay Deserve more. They have a lot of employees now, well have had them for quite some time. Even this small inexpensive gift was expensive to give to every single employee. Ungrateful and selfish people like you are the new scum of the earth. Feeling entitled for no reason and just not thinking of the big picture. Anonymouse How do you know they feel entitled for no reason and haven’t thought of the big picture from a company with one of the largest savings account in the world? Sources? Then you label them ‘scum of the earth’. What do you label criminals, rapists, murderers etc? Is it ok to label you A$$clown of the month? kiboi Obviously Jay is a d1ck. Anonymouse Now I think I agree with you Jay They are all included in scum of the earth. Just because the company makes a lot of money doesn’t mean the grunts( prople the do the heavy lifting) are gonna get the good perks. They don’t all feel entitled of course the the few that do are really ungrateful. They don’t have to get a gift at all. Fact is that they got something should be enough as other companies do much less for their employees on a big scale like that. Anonymouse Apple themselves set the precedent when they started giving fairly pricey gifts a few years back. From kiboi’s comment there’s nothing to suggest he’s an employee whingeing in fact quite the opposite. It’s your prerogative how you rate people, but a worker (or grunt worker) worker nonetheless who may or may not expect a nice gift from his employer due to previous experience is labelled equally with someone that murders, rapes etc. Really? I don’t accept it, I think you’re upset over something else you’re not that bad a person. As for other companies they should be trying to excel over their competition with treatment of their staff rather than copying each other. Imagine if the tech industry has that mindset…oh wait a minute… Jay Uh, were did I assume they kiboi was an employee? I only stated that they shouldn’t just expect Apple to give its employees expensive gifts just because they have a lot of money. I’m a grunt as well and get paid for what I do just like they do, I don’t complain when I don’t get a bonus or when I get an inexpensive gift. Apple is not obligated to gift anyone. I didn’t mean to sound so harsh but some people in this world is extremely ungrateful now and I am upset at that. I don’t expect a gift at Christmas time because that isn’t what it was originally about it’s just what it has become, which is unacceptable. People who think they deserve from life in general is what I am mad at. This is a first world issue and they shouldn’t cry about getting an inexpensive gift after getting an expensive one.. As for the last thing you are saying.. How are they treating their staff bad by GIVING them a gift for FREE? Anonymouse I assumed you were referring to kiboi as an employee when you commenced your comment about Apple employees then continued with, “Ungrateful and selfish people like you are the new scum of the earth”. My last point was in regard to your comment, “Fact is that they got something should be enough as other companies do much less for their employess”. I’m saying companies should be looking to excel in their treatment of their workers rather than copy ‘as other companies do’. Yes you’re right Christmas has become a pain in the neck and commercialised to the max. Companies like Apple make a killing over this probably more so than other companies. I’ll bet articles will be written highlighting the top gifts given this year and an Apple product in the top 5. Wouldn’t any company profitting from such a thing pass on some of the profits? Just a thought. Merry Christmas Jay 🙂 Jay Wouldn’t any company profiting from such a thing pass on some of the profits? No, what would be the point of advertising/spending more just to give it back to the front line employees? that money is reserved for the higher CEO’s. Anonymouse Companies should be looking to excel in their treatment of their workers. This is not gift related this is across the board 365 days per year. Is that clear. Moving on from that if you want to discuss gifts. As for expensive gifts, define expensive. Steve Jobs in 2007 announced every employee who had been worjking over one year part time included were to receive a new iphone. Last year from memory I think Beats headphones and/or Apple music subscription was gifted. Previous to that there were backpacks, bottles I think and some other useful gifts. I was always taught that it is the thought that counts not the value. This shirt has the incorrect spelling of one of the stores, the card has printed some words. Do you know what is printed? There is no thought here from the executives, it is offensive, I’ll bet the shirt is not made in USA, iI’ll bet the paper isn’t recycled from USA. Either way I don’t care because like I said previously, it’s all commercialised crap, personally I wouldn!t want any gift but that’s me. As for marketing, I don’t think Apple really needs to worry about reminding the good folk it’s Christmas. People are also taught to be grateful, however they are not taught to be grateful for breadcrumbs. When yoi were a kid growing up i wonder what Jay said/thought when he was hoping for a bike but got a pair of men’s underpants with the trap door in the front. People have been conditioned from an early age and now people are complaining about gratitude attitude. That horse bolted and it will take a few generations if you want to change the mindset. Angela got $60 million as a sign on fee, then she got approx $30 million this year, Tim got $60million odd, Craig approx $20 million etc etc etc. i find this all hilarious when Apple recently lost a case in California for breeching workers rights with respect to their break period and you put that against the words on the card. It truly is hilarious. As for who the scum of the earth really us, someone needs a reality check. Ho ho ho Jay If they aren’t happy with a free gift they are scum, if you expect a better gift, also scum. When I was a kid of course I wanted gifts but that was because I was a kid. Those workers aren’t kids either. The person who needs the check is in your mirror looking right back at you. Anonymouse My point is flawed is it? Did you hear from someone else it’s flawed because that’s how you seem to operate. So now they’re scum when previously you said you didn’t mean to sound so harsh. You lost credibility tinkerbrll. You said before some people are ungrateful and you’re upset about this. Why you poor poor thing, Jay is upset over this, wipe your eyes princess have a spoonful of cement and harden the hell up. Jay Im solid as a rock it was you and boi crying that they should get more. When I said I didn’t mean to sound harsh I was felt as though I was taking my anger out on boi, which was wrong. They were just sharing an opinion. Same you did calling me a$$ clown, no tears there either. It is definitely falwed as you haven’t specified how it isn’t after I made a valid point on why it was. Try again. Anonymouse Point out where I’m crying that they should get more. You have a habit of stating things that weren’t said or implied and you base your findings on what you allegedly heard. I think A$$clown is appropriate under the circumstances for you. So I’ve heard. Jay So still beating around the bush on making a point are you? When folks like you don’t have any valid points or excuses you end up name calling.. which like I said doesn’t hurt one bit. So its really pointless to stoop to that level. Also I based my crying comment on the very beginning on this discussion in which you think Apple should treat there employees “better”, a mere shirt isn’t enough and they deserve more. Then you also imply that they should get better gifts every year after.. Anonymouse My use of name calling is generally used for replacing a name or humour. I also add them after making a valid point or before one. You do not make it easy on yourself when you base your points on hearsay evidence. Further you seem to interpret or dare I say assume an explanation to bolster your argument or worse. I did not imply they should get better gifts., in fact I questioned the definition of expensive. I’ll reframe my point to make it clearer on companies and treatment of employees. Pay attention: If a company treats its employees honestly and fairly and with respect, seeks ways to continually improve their workplace 365 days per year, you’ll find the employee wouldn’t expect a gift at christmas (telling the boss don’t worry about it) in fact the employee would buy a gift for the employer instead. When a gift is given and it has a ‘token’ ‘non genuine’ ‘politically correct smell’ sense about it, the monetary value of the gift is irrelevant it feels false. In that case nothing is more appropriate.. Apple and their history of employee workplace relations is not the best. The genesis of Apple is llittered with mistreatment of its employees, Mr Wozniak has provided a few examples. My Christmas is commercialisd comment is my observation and I do express them. No I haven’t bumped my head, if you did it wouldn’t matter because you’re a numbskull. You see that, the clever use of a counterpoint whilst seguing your rhetorical comment and providing light hearted humour. kiboi Stop crying Jay. Jay The only cry baby was you. Waaaa.. they should get more.. grow up. Anonymouse I wonder if all the executives get the same t-shirt and piece of paper fpr christmas? For those that go dumpster diving and bin dipping around the stores will score a few t shirts this year it seems. Mark S If these people are smart they will ebay that crap. Some apple fan boy will gladly pay through the nose to own official apple Christmas presents and display them in a glass case in their living room as if it was the second coming. Anonymouse That’s a good idea I like your style. Although as for khobi being labelled scum of the earth by Jay I think is a bit extreme. Tommy If only they could just say merry Christmas Mark S With Mr. Redefinition of Marriage as the CEO? Right… Tommy Well yea that’s why I said if only haha Mike mukweem That would be very insulting, not all of apples employees are Christian. Christmas is a religious Christian holiday. Jay Other religions celebrate it as well. It’s not really the holiday they are celebrating anymore though. I think its just more so the decorations and gifts, some even forgot what it was even about. Bill Insulting? Perhaps you should petition the government to rename the day from “Christmas Day” to “Holiday” or even better, just “Day” since even the word Holiday is derived from “Holy Day”… FFS. It’s Christmas. Say Merry Christmas, or don’t. No one really cares, except where people don’t say it “because it might offend someone”… what utter garbage. “Politically correct” can go F itself, along with anyone who’s “offended” by a word. Poor, poor wittle snowfwakes. (None of this is directed at Mike mukweem personally, just toward his words.) Mike mukweem What now?

Siri appears to help a user in macOS Sierra Credit: Apple More like this Hands on: ‘Siri, what’s new in macOS Sierra?’ Review: Four ways to manage Macs in a Microsoft world Physical RAM attack can root Android and possibly other devices Video IT security: 3 things you need to know now Without the macOS update released this week, Apple's disk encryption can be easily defeated by connecting a specially crafted device to a locked Macbook. The attack is possible because devices connected over Thunderbolt can access the computer's RAM directly before the OS is started through the direct memory access (DMA) feature. The DMA mechanism is typically used by disk drive controllers, graphics cards, network cards, and sound cards because accessing the memory through the CPU would otherwise keep the processor busy and unavailable for other tasks. Apple's macOS has DMA protections, but they only kick in when the OS is running. However, the EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) -- the modern BIOS -- initializes Thunderbolt devices at an early stage in the boot process and this enables them to use DMA before the OS is started, security researcher Ulf Frisk said in a blog post. The second problem is that the password for Apple's FileVault 2 disk encryption is stored in memory in plain text if the disk has been unlocked once. This means that when a Mac has its screen locked or returns from a sleep state, the password will still be in memory. Furthermore, the password doesn't get scrubbed from memory on reboot and is only shifted around to a different location within a fixed memory range, according to Frisk. The only time the password is removed from memory is when the Mac is shut down because that's when RAM contents are completely cleared. The researcher created a hardware device running his custom software that he dubbed PCILeech. The device is capable of extracting FileVault passwords via DMA. "This makes it easy to just plug in the DMA attack hardware and reboot the Mac," Frisk said. "Once the Mac is rebooted the DMA protections that macOS previously enabled are dropped. The memory contents, including the password, is still there, though. There is a time window of a few seconds before the memory containing the password is overwritten with new content." Frisk presented DMA-based attacks against the Linux, Windows, and OS X kernel at the DEF CON security conference in August, but he discovered the implications for Apple's disk encryption after his presentation. He kept his findings secret until now at Apple's request. The researcher confirmed that the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 update released this week fixes the security issue, at least on his MacBook Air. "The solution Apple decided upon and rolled out is a complete one," Frisk said. "At least to the extent that I have been able to confirm. It is no longer possible to access memory prior to macOS boot. The mac is now one of the most secure platforms with regards to this specific attack vector."

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

The obviously-named spaceship will eventually house Apple’s staff, keep the R&D department in a hermetically sealed blogger-proof building, and give Apple its own auditorium to show off courage to the eager public. Construction has been moving quickly over the last six months, and a pair of drone photographers have been keeping us up to date with progress thanks to montly flyovers. One of them, Matthew Roberts, has made a year-end wrap-up that shows all the changes that have happened over the last six months. Don't Miss: Amazon is letting people gift 3 months of Prime! As it currently stands, most of the big construction is done. The main building has a structure, something that looks like a roof, and most of its walls. The iHill mountain of dirt has been graded, access roads and parking lots are nearly done, and aesthetic touches like glass walls are starting to go up. The scale of Apple’s new HQ is always difficult to grasp from the drone footage, but the occasional glimpse of tiny workers is enough to remind you how ambitious this project is. Construction will cost around $5 billion — expensive, for sure, but a lot less than Apple’s hundreds of billions of cash sitting offshore. (It’s less than Apple’s back tax bill to the European Union, for that matter.)

Advertisement In early September, Apple confirmed its highly anticipated iOS 10 release date. And on September 13th, the company rolled out the iOS 10 update for select iPhone, iPad and iPod touch models around the world. iOS 10 is a solid replacement for iOS 9 but it far from perfect. iOS 10 problems have been plaguing iPhone and iPad owners in the months since release and many users are calling for a new iOS 10 update to address these lingering problems. Fortunately, help is on the way in the form of a massive iOS 10.2 update for iPhone, iPad and the iPod touch. Apple’s confirmed an iOS 10.2 release and today we want to go over the most important things to know, right now, about the second major update to the iOS 10 operating system. This roundup takes a look at what we know for sure about the iOS 10.2 update. It also outlines a few things you can expect from the upcoming iOS 10.2 release for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch including the iOS 10.2 release time in the United States and countries around the world. Advertisement We’ll continue to add new information to this roundup so check back for regular updates. iOS 10.2 Beta If you want to try the iOS 10.2 update on your device right now, you can. Apple’s pushed an iOS 10.2 beta to developers and the general public. Anyone with an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch can download the iOS 10.2 beta, for free, via Apple’s Beta Software Program. The iOS 10.2 beta is pretty big and there are some very good reasons to think about trying it out on your iPhone, iPad or iPad touch ahead of the official release date. Advertisement You can test the iOS 10.2 update’s new features and you can also test its performance on your phone or tablet which might be a good idea if you’re using an older device like the iPhone 5 or iPad mini 2. Before you install the iOS 10.2 beta, make sure you prepare your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. A little prep work will go a long way toward preventing iOS 10.2 beta problems. And yes, there are a number of issues with the current version of the beta. We’ve noticed lag, issues with connectivity, random reboots, occasional abnormal battery drain, and issues with various apps. If you download the beta, there’s a good chance you’ll encounter an issue or two. To help you prepare, we’ve put together a guide that will take you through the beta installation process. If this is your first time installing a beta on your iPhone or iPad, make sure you take a look at those before you go through with the process. They could save you some time. If you do decide to give the iOS 10.2 beta a go, make sure you report issues as you see them. This will help Apple improve the final product. You might also want to look at our list of reasons to, and not to, install the iOS 10.2 beta on your iPhone or iPad. iOS 10.2 beta and its list of features make it tempting but there are definitely some reasons to avoid the beta. You Can Downgrade from iOS 10.2 Beta If you’re currently on the iOS 10.1 update or the iOS 10.1.1 update you can try the iOS 10.2 beta and drop back down if you decide you don’t want/like the beta. As of right now, you can download the iOS 10.2 beta and drop back down to iOS 10.1 or iOS 10.1.1. Unfortunately, you can’t downgrade to anything older than those two updates. The downgrade process is pretty straightforward. For a detailed list of instructions, take a look at our iOS downgrade guide. iOS 10.2 Release Date Earlier this year, Apple confirmed a new iOS 10 update for December. The update, it said, would deliver the company’s new Apple TV app to iOS users. Apple’s iOS 10.2 beta 2 delivered the new Apple TV app to beta testers so it looks like Apple will release iOS 10.2 sometime later this month. This isn’t confirmed but it appears likely at this point.  The only time Apple confirms specific iOS release dates is when it confirms them on stage during media events. And with no other media events rumored or likely for 2016, we probably won’t get an official iOS 10.2 release date ahead of time. That said, Apple’s left us a potential clue. The company hasn’t confirmed anything but it says it plans to address iPhone 6s random shutdown issues in an upcoming iOS update. That update will apparently arrive next week. From a support document on the company’s website: Outside the affected batch, a small number of customers reported an unexpected shutdown. Some of these shutdowns may be normal, because the iPhone will shut down to protect its electronic components. To gather more information, we will add an additional diagnostic feature to the iOS software update that is released next week. This feature collects a variety of information in the coming weeks that may help us improve algorithms for managing battery performance and shutdown operations. If such improvements can be achieved, we will deliver them through further software updates. The support document was posted on December 6th which means an update should arrive during the week of December 12th, maybe on December 12th itself. (Apple’s gotten into the habit of releasing new iOS software on Monday’s.) Next week or not, the iOS 10.2 release is close. iOS 10.2 Release Time The exact iOS 10.2 release date is difficult to predict but the iOS 10.2 release time isn’t. If Apple sticks to its usual release protocol, and there’s no reason to believe that it won’t, iOS 10.2 will arrive around 10AM Pacific on release day. The same can be said for all of the upcoming iOS 10.2 beta releases. Here’s what that looks like for regions in the United States and countries around the world including Australia and Japan: Eastern – 1 PM Central – 12 PM Mountain – 11AM London – 6 PM Moscow – 9 PM New Dehli – 10:30 PM Shanghai – 1 AM Tokyo – 2 AM Melbourne – 3 AM Auckland – 5 AM Apple probably won’t confirm the release time ahead of release so you’ll want to keep an eye on your device(s) around this time Monday-Friday. iOS 10.2 Update The iOS 10.2 update appears to be a pretty sizable upgrade for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch and we could see even more added to it as Apple tweaks the beta ahead of its official release date. The crown jewel of the iOS 10.2 upgrade, for most people, will be the new emojis. Unicode 9 emoji are included in iOS 10.2 beta. Notable additions include an avocado, shark, croissant, a shark, a carrot, a squid, bacon, a kiwi, and an owl. iOS 10.2 beta includes new emojis. There are also new wallpapers, a setting that allows you to preserve your last known camera settings called “Preserve Settings”, performance improvements, a new Celebration messages effect, new wallpapers for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and some smaller tweaks. It also, as we’ve noted, brings the new Apple TV app. The iOS 10.2 beta also brings a new TV settings section in Settings and a new SOS mode. The SOS mode is only available for users in India in iOS 10.2 beta 3. It was available to a much wider range of users in iOS 10.2 beta 2. Here’s a list of features that arrived with iOS 10.2 beta 1, here’s a list for the more recent iOS 10.2 beta 2 release, and here’s a list of changes on board the iOS 10.2 beta 3. The iOS 10.2 beta 4, 5, 6, and 7 updates are much smaller and didn’t bring any significant changes to the iOS 10.2 update. iOS 10.2 Jailbreak Don’t expect an iOS 10.2 jailbreak on the iOS 10.2 release date. Developers are reportedly working on an iOS 10 jailbreak but well-known security expert Luca Todesco is warning jailbreak users to avoid the iOS 10.2 update when it’s released. Those looking to jailbreak iOS 10 should remain on iOS 10.1.1 because there’s a higher likelihood we’ll see a jailbreak for that version of iOS 10. For more on the iOS 10 jailbreak, take a look at our roundup. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.2 & 6 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.2 If You Want Better Security 1 / 10 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.2 update on your iPhone or iPad.  The iOS 10.2 update brings 12 known patches for potential exploits including one where an "attacker with an unlocked device may be able to disable Find My iPhone."  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.1.1 update and/or the iOS 10.1 update, know that iOS 10.2 brings their security patches with it. If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.2 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.2 is probably worth a download right now. 1 / 10 24 Responses 09/22/2016 Franklin Marder Reply Why do you waste so much space discussing a release date that has not been announced. It’s as if you are using a template and leave in all of the extraneous stuff. To be useful your posts need to get to the point. 10/02/2016 Scott Reply Thanks for wasting my time reading this. 10/31/2016 juansamaniegor Reply love the new #iOS10 #iMessage but the only thing missing is have profile picture. 10/07/2016 Nick Reply Brevity is unfortunately not your strong point. 10/12/2016 Shitt Reply Bullshitting 10/16/2016 Clyde Reply This article is so badly written, I wouldn’t allow him/her to write a postcard after reading it! 10/16/2016 Franklin Marder Reply My issue is not the quality of the writing but the utterly misleading headline. It is in Beta and there is no known release date. I m a developer and I would know. This is also the second publication of essentially the same article and it just regurgitates Apple’s developer documentation. Publishing anything about a Beta release as if it is final information is misleading and shouldn’t be allowed by any responsible news site. 11/01/2016 liviaemily_6 Reply Guess Apple came 2nd this time since android had it first with the release of nougat… 11/19/2016 moo Reply there was always a squid emoji… 11/25/2016 David OBrien Reply What’s really getting on my nerves with the latest 10.2 beta is that when I go to write a text message… and choose a contact, if I come across one I’ve previously deleted, when I press the “I” and try to remove from recents, NOTHING HAPPENS! And it’s driving me mad! I’ve not seen anyone else reporting this, am I alone? 11/28/2016 Sick Of Adam Mills Reply These articles your write about “X You Should Know About OS Y.Z” have been trash from the beginning, when you first started doing them. Please make it stop! They are awful. It is painfully obvious you know nothing about software, or software development. Please pick any other topic you can think of to write about, excluding software. 11/30/2016 Theo Reply Wish Apple would go back to iOS 9.3.5. I detest so many things about iOS 10. Previously I could swipe to get rid of the lock screen. Now, I/we have to press the Home button. I have an iPad 4 with a non-operational home button. Now I have to spend money on a repair? The whole idea of a touch-screen is to get away from mechanical switches! Another thing: when I get a notification from Gmail of a new email, there is this broad banner that takes up unnecessary real estate on the screen. Then, when I open the email, the keyboard comes up and blocks half the screen. Mostly, I just want to read the email, not reply to it. Previously, a particular app allowed adjustment of font sizes. This feature disappeared with the “up”grade. A “pox on you”, Apple, for killing my enjoyment of my iOS devices! 12/04/2016 Don S Reply I have version 10.0.2 on my iPhone 6s. Am I way behind the times and in danger from security issues? 12/06/2016 Christi Reply iOS being the second biggest mobile platform in terms of volume and first in terms of developers remuneration. iOS apps development are a part of improving business, setting signature presence and building a great brand. Thanks for sharing 12/13/2016 Robert Kazi Reply On this new iOS 10.2 it is impossible to watch my old “home videos” wich I use to sync through iTunes. No way to see those videos on the new “TV” App 12/13/2016 Franklin Marder Reply You may want to look at the iOS version of the VLC app as it is a bit of a can opener for multi-media files. You may have to sync the files via iCloud Drive or Dropbox. 12/16/2016 Nota Reply I can’t find my country for the new security feature after installing ios 10.2 Curaçao, Dutch Caribbean Area code +5999 HELP 12/16/2016 Nora Reply When are you going to fix issue for iMessages’ names disappearing/ not appearing/ or saying ‘maybe’ this person??? 12/22/2016 homemade electronics toys Reply Thiѕ paragraph іѕ trսly a pleasant one it assists new internet visitors, աho are wishing for blogging. 12/31/2016 The Shepherd’s Diet Reply As I website owner I believe the content here is really great, thanks for your efforts. 01/01/2017 enjoy video games Reply Sοme genuinely inteгesting info, weⅼl ѡritten аnd ցenerally ᥙser genial. 01/02/2017 toys electronics gadgets trade Reply Ι read thіs paragraph ϲompletely on the topic of the comparison οf hottest аnd preceding technologies, іt’s remarkable article. 01/02/2017 kyle leon muscle Reply Ι go tto ѕee daily а fеԝ web sites and websites tto reaԀ content, hoever thіs blog proviⅾes feature based articles. 01/05/2017 รับผลิตครีม Reply Have you ever considered publishing an ebook or guest authoring on other websites?

The ‘cheaper,’ 10.20” x 12.75” version costs a bargain $199, but, if you really want to stand out from the crowd, the $299 13” x 16.25” option could be a better buy. If, for some bizarre reason, you’ve not felt compelled to splash out almost one-third of a thousand dollars on some glossy pictures of iMacs and Apple Pencils, the company has just released a simply stunning promo video for “Designed by Apple in California.” Apple’s Chief of Design, Jony Ive, fronts the clip, which, if you’re able to watch all the way to the end, will doubtlessly convince you to buy a book of photos that costs the same price as an iPad Air. After all, money shouldn’t be a factor when it comes to a publication that uses specially milled German paper, gilded matte silver edges, and low-ghost inks, whatever the hell they are. While Ive reminds us that “Ideas are not predictable in terms of when you’ll have them, and how many you’re going to have,” he doesn’t really explain why the book is so comically expensive. It may be constructed from materials that sound like they’re from an RPG, but it seems this is another case of Apple’s “it’s expensive, which makes it great” marketing at play. Still, nothing would show just how rich and gullible you are than having a copy of “Designed by Apple in California” sitting on your gold and diamond-encrusted coffee table.

Four mattress Best Buys revealed for 2017 Nutribullet price hits record low in 2017 Cash Isa deals of the week: 05 January 2017 Best Windows 10 laptop of 2016 revealedTop scoring Best Buy PC unveiled in latest testing 17 December 2016 The new Apple MacBook Pro is among the laptops we've just tested We've had to wait 12 months, but it's been worth it – our latest batch of laptop reviews includes the very finest Windows machine that we've tested in 2016. It's not as if it's been free of stern competition. This year has witnessed some genuine computing innovation. From Microsoft's own-brand Surface Book with a detachable screen, to the remarkably thin HP Spectre 13. And over in the Apple camp, there have been plenty of innovations. The launch of the new MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar where the function keys used to live, is among the most talked about tech moments of the year. But it's a Windows 10 laptop that has set our test labs alight this December, with a fantastic screen, super speedy processor and brilliant portability. The best laptop we've tested this year sits at the top of our best Windows 10 laptops table - click the link to reveal all Best Windows laptop of 2016 Best Buy laptops come in all shapes, sizes and price ranges. But they all have some of the same things in common – batteries that last an age, fantastic ease-of-use, bright, vibrant screens and a processor that can handle multiple tasks at once. Our 2016 champion computer has all of these benefits and more. Which? laptops expert Adam Marshall describes our top model as 'easy on the eye, a pleasure to use, and priced competitively. If you're looking for a new laptop, you may well have found it.' The battery lasts for more than 10 hours, which, for a laptop with such a powerful processor, is astounding. An Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of Ram and 256GB solid-state drive combine to give you the speed to carry out even the most complex of home computer tasks. Video editing and gaming work seamlessly on this laptop. Very few screens on the market can compete with this one, and we found its touchpad and backlit keyboard to be well crafted and comfortable. Both are snappy and responsive, with excellent feedback. Want to know what our best Windows laptop of 2016 is? Then click to read our best Windows 10 laptops Mac or Windows PC? As well as Windows 10 laptops from the likes of Acer, Asus, Dell and HP, our latest laptop reviews also include the Apple MacBook Pro. With its 13-inch 2,560x1,600-pixel resolution Retina display, Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of memory and 256GB solid-state drive, you can't argue with its specifications. But it will cost you at least £1,449 and includes a miserly offering of ports, so it won't be for everyone. Apple MacBooks aren't universally loved by all. As well as the off-putting price, some people just don't get the knack for using Apple's MacOS operating system. And instead of the likes of Word and Excel programs that are familiar to Windows users, Macs have their own word processing (Pages) and spreadsheet (Numbers) software. If you want to open a Word or Excel document from your old computer or that somebody has emailed you, then you'll have to purchase Office for Mac or download a third-party program. If you're weighing up buying an Apple Mac and want to know more about how they differ from Windows laptops, we put them head-to-head in our expert guide to Macs v PCs. More on this...

And I'm martyred by the way to be here with you as I always Adam thank you buy a modern day and in this is part of that much five point plan which has and hasn't really. It'd stride yet it's tough they're they're really not here consistently enough that you would not. I've not been here now you have not golden and other directions by the radio station or buy vacation days except our idea is sort of like it's sort of like a coach when he's tired they were gonna do this and do that do this and execute 20% of it happens yeah. Spot up but I'm honored that you designate media as the guy who comes in and and talks nonsense gold borrow anything now because I live I think some of the more off topic. Yet coherent shows I've done in my radio it's been a much too with two people you in many. Okay you and I on the original but Bradford which by the way should never have been canceled. Think everyone agrees that. Is it factions still be on self censorship that the federal yeah maybe maybe it will be I don't know. But it started it. The it started as VW week yeah I doubt whether you show by with a way it wasn't canceled I still haven't really gotten word from management that is that was not handle all that well all the wanna shot now things got him saarc regulars but it was not handled well was. It was called the WEEI dot com show that was that was literally for a week yeah it was not long and on the dial up being just mutt and Bradford and before he became DJ being of you know such features as that the DGB no the intern.

It's one of those things that I I've really not thought about that part of it since with a 78 years ago at this point writer had open. But the behind the scenes of is Pedroia going to get this piece of equipment off my game that he's at station was going to give him was. IU weekly. Soap opera with the EU and other people here at the station it would it it took up all of our time off the air during that show is Pedroia going to get his. Both flex don't know water it was so out of through this in thirty seconds ago. Dustin Pedroia. We you do this when you do this want to week appears to this on the month Bradford show yet sure what you want eyes wanting on Apple's that's right it's once something like in part okay. That becomes. A what is called a power play. As via power plated slight that's Ottawa as what you put that power plays price that you put on a barn you bench. And okay well it turns low power play cost 9000 dollars. And as as much support. Actually as they were putting behind the mutt Bradford show. For those Saturday mornings they were not really ready for 89000. Dollars and it's Dustin Pedroia interviews and yes it became a thing in Irving oil was good to lest they often will we like Irvin lawyer I've made her re oil.

On her own apps and some are. Now producer called you think it's got. Its aftermath. And peaceful like. I bet for all over. I know forego that I L I hope those girls have a plan B up opportunities for the next 24 beats both at. Yes that would. I got our terrible at. All. No I digest I just got yours debacle at the much you know Kirk the mutt five point plan was to bring it or bring in Smart to bring in Smart people. Right and then I failed Friday Friday is my designation for the month five point plan. We'll recruit you read up. I. Caught separately today we. May. You said that you are all. God it's not an accurate quote I that you are so in that of mine. All right. Yes also the head of mutt which was. Which flies when we did the what he does interviews on the hot stove show now he's always worried about how they're going to appear in the morning joy in my right about that but is there a little bit of that no yeah on loss on we have money Michael Culp guy Cooper you pretended with a guy that nobody cares about anyway you pretended. To know about a reality show and you duke got caught lying on the air just admit that it endeavors we talked about I would I was a winner brought up but the Aggies yeah we didn't know any better the better example I would use with the week before when you were with the mossy you're giving an argument right. And you said this would be appearing on the morning show when you're very happy because he also be key toss is that on the year I have a gaping hole he says that on the year that's going to be pulled out of context he going to be used against it much like what. That I hope I think it's if it got quite a fight with it if I. Urge you are frustrated there rot or. I'd make it up like other folk that. Want to have these yes Joseph rocket right like ought. Much but I think it's necessarily a radio error error. Rob and I said except that you have idea roster were certain you know is this is an open book I other news ever get away your weighed between Myanmar and it caught a cold pack I I I I had other things. Other things going on a Wednesday that was more focused on the fighting with rob Michael Culp back and to be in the first half hour doing which grew around a little bit and move on we did that we yelled each other next ninety minutes and and -- back where it was credits. Or. Not a critical that was excellent it's very well spoken. Out. Does other things going on the radio station. And I would.

Golf fans get your WEEI dot com had a question I mean we clarified why she never actually clarified the question is is the answer the original question just OX I hate being wrong. He said his first time on the show remembered being in here for an extended period but that's not what I was saying I don't think he was here when the show's start. I thought he jumped then we tagged out I tagged out. I remember him being here for an entire show when you couldn't be here remember him view anyway I don't was the traveling for I forget what it was but it was actually in the studio. Yeah British a lot of it sure was he was standing up railing and rave and rant against Jim writes. I'd argue they are not know he was ten feet away from the microphone not saying anything until she writes is named him. 6177797937. Is the phone every can Texan as well 37937. This is why we call it. I view you thought if I throw Everett right Friday as well wanted Wear anything comes up to coming back into I'd it's a guy like that ash. It's picked up I think nobody's spotted two. On Twitter to three and zero year old fry what does that give you says from the Buick gambling when you get a free roll. No wonder our show was canceled. Oh OK but you'll come back and how old bill will be here portrait. Alice city abuzz now Joseph on Twitter says muscles and radio hash tag free roll Friday it's the only that the only one response so far to the I have time I want to give you credit when you have good ideas and I think it's a good idea. The good idea how to be here as a copycat of I don't style trial I introduced sitting there on your couch thinking. Have to have a different patched now what that's what we'll be forbidden in it and free role came when you're ahead of us. We what every guy that we can do better than that so I'm not I'm not gonna put tariffs on too bad the development by last Friday show of the as good a year as a might million shares sponsored. The parents I mean I feel like I should be part of this decision. You if you like what was something else rob you're welcome to you that you quite frankly looking back you and Lonnie you be here much more on Fridays and that's true in the last. Billy two months I called him being that last for no. Was last Friday called and Gilani talked about Bobby Valentine was a Friday. Of the Bobby V news broke last week yeah blast try to distort him that it was talked about sort of the winner me yes. Yes yes like called pipe and not Val bella doesn't lose its chorus calling gonna send China and Japan to war that little less that was. That's going to happen now convinced that was a response. I can see Bobby Valentine's standing at the border. Holding up a hand in each direction. Saying peace people please let that was staged photo of him in order way. Yes and holly did the issue I would have scares we agreed agreed agreed the other night that Bobby Valentine would be great ambassador this is what he was born to do. The problem is if you get into a really tricky predicament like that. His history is it's he's narco real there and he's gonna cut a push at Ford well you know. Did mark my Lanston did Marc Galanter did you know was he was really throwing them the what the pages that I wanted to throw. Mark Ralitsa we've throwing the what are you talking about. You always was the Kevin Youkilis. Always advancing it always pushing at Ford always putting the gas on so when China's coming in and they say something the gas is coming on. And it's only gonna get worse but if you like about likes the spotlight so whatever can put him back in the spotlight he will be fan of that in the media com yeah but you know Bridget I don't think you get what I'm saying I win the biggest big difference between Tito. It even Ferrell and Bobby Valentine thought this was what of this is the biggest difference was in Boston you have to have the ability to real stuff written. But it suddenly comes out the controversy comes out real then. It would Bobbie it Oilers. It wasn't reloaded it. At this it was pushed no he threw gasoline on a. Virus that Steve Burton that that night was that I don't know or the U cliffs. Was it normally receive overseen a that I also on the night before what's up with Kevin yeah I was not playing with passion and Daniel the next day today at Pretoria stuff afterwards minutes. That the that a successful coaches and managers here in town. Have had that ability structured baseball and football I mentioned Ferrell and Valentine and were talking earlier about. Michael Floyd and you're coming out July. In that ballot check you go to his track record of what could have become stories weather was. Bledsoe Brady. Aaron Hernandez. Tim Tebow. Rob none of the stuff affects the team negatively Regis he just. As the media by the balls he'd beaten down so much that they know what the answer is Ian again. It's about next week about that opponent and so they don't harp on it yet maybe one day out of what could be four or five day story. And that's all she wrote and be right Valentine's the act opposite in bella check on me it's a lot fleet 180 the law. Easier to do in football that it is baseball you would agree was that because baseball there's a lot more access it's every single day. Dan. And you have you have access to the players you have axis of manager that day. That okay you're clueless he says this stuff Youkilis is missing gladiator as he should be the night before. The next day that it was because it was patriots day at 8 o'clock in the morning where activity with his locker B vaccines to him we have Dustin Pedroia is not how we do things a year maybe they do in Japan that way but not here. Like that doesn't happen with the patriots. And yes so but that's why I thought Hedo especially would really really do about it. Well a erected the access part of it I never take into account because with the patriots. You go down there ever electoral everyone sits in the in the same. Stare role. Little press conference area for bella check. And it won't shuffles in and some pages players aren't there that dating and sort high that he and into a good job hiding guys and rookies are gonna talk and then the guys that do talk. Killing guys is any of Martellus Bennett so you EU. Everyone's getting the same story essentially were his baseball and you've talked about this you'll wanna talk to guidance he can walk up nobody else there. All the guys side and you're gonna get what you wanna write about knowing you're not the most part not gonna get a patriots. PR candidates and their orders believe me the Red Sox would low low low low. For to be like the patriots. An end to a certain degree I think they've tried to be they have it was always like that I always the public rarely can tell us liked it. Aaron McKie you know like that they were the headlines and they were the major topic on Sports Radio for a wells also changed by ahead of the patriot he's and he's also changed it's also look at some of the things have come up. In the last couple years it would. But he dark about where the Q2 1003 the era of the chasing Steinbrenner no I mean. Probable symbols are to get busted forensic Graham in the in the news in the bathroom stall back that there's a lot more to real Lynn. And if news business tool Mark Jackson asked this to the season's too long. If you just can't do it the Red Sox have tried to do this if the rookie development program they tell on this has value after dark and believe me. In a lot of cases veered toward a good job give these guys are boring. When they come out of most of them they are born in the arch framed well but ultimately. When you start getting the money you start get a little bit of freedom you start a little more access to around the guys a little bit more. You say it's up the teams are alike too much well because especially run the competitive nature of the two because. If there are so many outlets trying to get whatever they think everything that story as well as stories relevant or not. Or you're trying to fill in Opel is trying to write a sidebar. And so you are constantly. You know that I act I I for a long comment a boy I want you beat writer grown up this being great but. It chasing that it's it's that it's the mouse in the wheel for six months a year. Well especially in that sport and it's not only is startling that used to be you have to have a story every day in net news. Still the case. But now off not only you have to have a story every day. What you have to have almost a salacious story every day you have to have something. That it's it's not just hey you know he's really throwing a split split finger fastball 90% more this year which. I do we are so you could probably get away with that let's yours isn't and now you need eight you said of salacious story I would. Changes say don't yet have a collectible story yes equitable life at somebody's going to have a solid Evan relic sends out whatever. Stop he's right that day if it's it's gotta be because they can't say tickets via the record. I skinny yet he'd be hit the not is. It has to be something that is worth it because it in an editor's not going to. Care about the content but it better be something worthy of people lined click on a daily and we see it all the time where we see it all the time where as somebody. Organization wants to. You know. So I'll writers that I got a really good story well. We got this video of so and so it's going to be clicked on a lot more spend your time I knew what organization. That. Told the were told their writers to go win. And basically don't worry about Terry Francona. At all. When asked about whatever and Kim Kardashian always sort of fall back asked about how they feel about Kim Kardashian. I mean there's roast recovering. The he'd. And that's so it but that's an extreme case but it's sort of along those lines and even when you get these stories. That week that you just report you have to change it a little bit so you get the clicked right yeah it's all about the fire the editor. I don't know I just I I feel like in the last eighteen months especially. You notice that it has. The headlines are being pushed it yet as so be it they almost don't care about the contact it's the headline. That I get back clicked and I go back to an advertiser NCC how many. Page views this story guy trots all papers anymore. The undated the paper industry essentially is dads on the physical paper. Opera better for now it is probably country and if you have a terrible what's like The Herald does I don't care what relic writes I don't care what passed up. Click on a website because the the format sucks well you try to get everything on that once they kick they think sorry Ed Jeff Allen company that. Take the sites well. Lots and so it went so when your site is no fault of them but when you're sites socks because of that whatever of the two men he had to whatever. That makes it even more important that you have to have whatever it's being tweeted out I have to really really be something. And a half's we talk about headlines is yes or no the headline now is more important than the story yet up for me. It's gotta be this as a reader. I'm saying you know it's by five enough people robbed about what the headlines. To be fair if you view. And then a hand and Jerry are all tweeting about the I'm gonna go back and read XP you guys people are Specter talking about for an editor. I got believe is going to click who cares the story I don't care what you wrote I think clay where you Brad they cannot collect the award to where you read Jerry writes I'll talk to them or use a writer you want to be. Red and now you can. Fair or not it's not how it papers to sell its how many clicks and a column you you should web sites that's all the time you could tell me right now. What's being read right now a UP appear when you like that I'm sure our red on WLI dot com or other people that dogs you write a story and your like. I think that's gonna get red and does get right so what you do what you should do is like Buck Showalter. Telling them not to give up on a pitcher until he changes his arm slot you change the headline. And and I've seen him many times you change headline all of a sudden people saying hey that's a pretty good story well it's it's funny because and I've zero details how this works but it's clear there are places in town like NASA dot com. They just write stories that are going to be searched community is whether it's a web search tool whether it's the did did the trick of the trade now. But the headlines are all like this big bland basic thing you know always gonna get search and comes up as the first thing. When you go to Google and that's now I don't I don't want is to. Deep dive in this search engine and we already have no weak but. Our law Roddy rot audience and those new citizens lose the TV perfect example this and I brought that somewhere in educating young minds over at northeastern a couple of weeks ago. And which is the Huffington Post the Huffington Post had a headline. That said something the effect how Bernie Sanders can still become president. You click on it and the story was. Basically British theaters can't still become a that. About Joseph okay. Oh it's an average exactly. That's the big market geez it's on your TV era TV coming up. A Christmas a Christmas so I hope that will kill your child like that's the it's it's the old SNL skit will tomorrow smoke kill you find out after the break coming up something in your kitchen that might actually make you shorter but that net LA and that what. That's it that's the new way of land on the new way it's TV wade doing yet and and obviously now with it click to eat is the the term for rob.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 17 December 2016 Lower CEO pay equates to higher shareholder rewards by james saft Comparative returns: Excluding the top 17 outliers, like Apple, an investor who put money between 2006 and 2015 in the lowest quintile by CEO pay would have beaten those who held those firms in the top quintile by 39 in total return terms. – Reuters Comment INVESTORS would be better off sticking with firms which pay their chief executives less, according to a new study. Excluding the top 17 outliers, like Apple, an investor who put money between 2006 and 2015 in the lowest quintile by CEO pay would have beaten those who held those firms in the top quintile by 39% in total return terms, according to data from index and analysis firm MSCI. This puts into sharper relief one of the chief mysteries of shareholder capitalism: why long-term investors like pension funds fail to hold the companies they own accountable for the massive expansion of executive pay. “Even after adjusting for company size and sector, companies with lower total summary CEO pay levels more consistently displayed higher long-term investment returns,” Ric Marshall and Linda-Eling Lee of MSCI wrote in the October report. “Long-term institutional investors typically bear the cost of this misalignment, yet they have routinely approved CEO pay packages. Closer scrutiny of the relationship between CEO pay and performance over longer time periods could lead to different conclusions.” Looking at 429 large-capitalisation US companies which cumulatively paid out almost US$46bil to CEOs over the period, the study found that 10-year returns to the lowest quintile of CEO pay were US$367 for every US$100 invested, against just US$264 for those in the highest fifth. Executives at the largest capitalisation firms in the US made an average of US$15.5mil in compensation in 2015, according to data from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), 276 times the pay of the average employee. Average CEO pay has increased more than ninefold since 1978, outpacing the stock market’s advance by 73%. And while CEO pay fell by 3.2% last year, according to the EPI, that was driven not by lower awards but a stock-market-driven decline in the value of options granted. It is this levering of pay to the stock market which has been in part behind the huge expansion in executive pay over the past generation, a trend which itself is the poison fruit of a bad idea: the efficient market hypothesis. Efficient markets? In assuming that the market is the best judge of value, pay consultants linked compensation to shares, but did it by granting options. While the value of options is tied to the stock market, it is for executives a one-way bet: if shares go up the CEO wins, if they fall she does not lose. This has also gone hand-in-hand with both shorter tenures among CEOs and arguably a more short-term focus, points argued by James Montier of GMO in 2014. This in turn has very likely been a factor in the dearth of capital investment by firms. Why make an investment with an excellent 10-year payoff if you will only be in office for six years? Why indeed if your stock option horizon is only five years? A comprehensive 2009 study by Michael Cooper of the University of Utah, Huseyin Gulen of Purdue and Raghavendra Rau of Cambridge University found CEO pay is actually negatively related to future shareholder gains for periods of up to five years. Companies whose CEO pay is in the top 10% actually underperform peers by about 13% over five years, according to the study. Outside of executives, boards and the pay consultants who advise them, very few people seem happy with this state of affairs. A recent survey of UK pension funds found that 87% believe executives at UK-listed companies are paid too much. And this is in the UK, where CEO pay is about half what it is in the US. In the studies on executive pay there are, broadly, two theories on why higher-paying companies underperform. The first is that investors see high pay as a signal of high performance and drive up the price of equity to a level where subsequent returns are disappointing. This seems, at last to me, highly unlikely. The second is that higher pay is a sign of agency problems, the abusive use of company treasure for personal gain by insiders. This is where I’d put my money. With many studies expecting lower-than-usual overall returns over the coming decade, perhaps only 5 or 6 percent a year for a typical balanced portfolio, investors have good reason to push hard on pay. Perhaps they should start by voting with their feet, going long less generous companies and short the ones which hand out big pay packets. – Reuters Tags / Keywords: James Saft Related Stories More women on boards = higher dividend Call it what you like, ECB is tapering and with good reason Huge increase in economic policy possibility When politics blinded hedge fund managers The too high price of self-determination for Britain You May Be Interested Five new innovations for a better nights sleep MyEG secures another big job The powerful RM100mil men of the ministries Quality homes below RM400k Special dividend in the offing for AirAsia investors?

Since its launch in 2013, the 'Maxforce' has looked at the tax status of hundreds of companies across Europe, including a deal Starbucks had in the Netherlands, Fiat Chrysler's agreement with Luxembourg, and - its largest case - Apple in Ireland. Lienemeyer's team of 15 international civil servants pursued a three-year investigation stretching from the corridors of the European Commission, to the Department of Finance here and on to Apple's leafy headquarters in Cupertino, California. It started when Max Lienemeyer began assembling the 'Maxforce' in late spring of 2013 with a mandate to scrutinise tax policies across Europe in search of any favouritism. Direct subsidies or tax breaks to court a specific company are illegal in the EU to prevent governments aiding national champions. His first hire - the person who would oversee the Apple probe - was Helena Malikova, a Slovak who had worked at Credit Suisse in Zurich. He quickly added Kamila Kaukiel, a Polish financial analyst who had been at KPMG, and Saskia Hendriks, a former tax policy adviser to the Dutch government. The team got a head start from a US Senate probe of the tax strategies of American multinationals. The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said Apple shifted tens of billions of dollars in profit into stateless affiliates based in Ireland, where it secured a tax rate of less than 2pc. At 9:30 am on May 21, 2013, US senators gathered in Room 106 of the Dirksen Office Building, in Washington DC. Included in the evidence that day was a 2004 letter from Tom Connor, an official at Ireland's tax authority, to Ernst & Young, Apple's tax adviser. Connor's question: A unit of the tech company hadn't filed a tax return; Was it still in business? E&Y responded two days later that the division was a non-resident holding company with no real sales. "There is nothing to return from the corporation tax standpoint," E&Y wrote. The Senate exhibits didn't include Connor's response if there ever was one. Apple ceo Tim Cook complained about the fairness of the case. Photo: AP At the hearing, Arizona Republican John McCain castigated Apple as "one of the biggest tax avoiders in America." Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan peered over the glasses perched on the tip of his nose and said Apple used "offshore tax strategies whose purpose is tax avoidance, pure and simple". Crucially, though, Levin told the crowded room that under U.S. law, there was little the panel could do to force Apple to pay more tax. Apple ceo Tim Cook passionately defended its actions, telling the Senators: "We don't depend on tax gimmicks." The Senate revelations raised eyebrows at the 'Maxforce' office in Madou Tower, a 1960s high-rise in the rundown Saint-Josse neighborhood of Brussels. Three weeks after the Senate hearing, Lienemeyer's team asked Ireland for details of Apple's tax situation. Irish tax authorities dispatched a representative carrying a briefcase filled with a bundle of bound pages. The Irish could have simply sent the material via e-mail, but they were cautious about sharing taxpayer's information with the EU and have a ground rule to avoid leaks: never send such documents electronically. While the Irish Government remained bullish in its public statements, saying Apple hadn't received any favors, behind the scenes tensions were rising. Through the summer of 2013, the Department of Finance assured ministers that the EU investigation would amount to nothing, according to people familiar with the discussions. But those assertions seemed less confident than earlier communications. There was a sense that Apple had worked out its Irish tax position in a vastly different era, and no one remembered many details of the negotiations decades earlier. In 1980, the then four-year-old technology company created several Irish affiliates, each with a different function such as manufacturing or sales, according to the Senate report. Under Irish laws dating to the 1950s, as an export company Apple paid no taxes on overseas sales of products made in Ireland. To comply with European rules, that tax policy ended in 1990. After that, Apple and Ireland agreed that the profit attributed to a key Ireland-based unit, the division discussed in Tom Connor's letter, be capped using a complex formula that in 1990 would have resulted in a taxable profit of $30m to $40m. An Apple tax adviser "confessed there was no scientific basis" for those figures, but that the amounts would be "of such magnitude that he hoped it would be seen as a bona-fide proposal", according to notes from a 1990 meeting with the Irish tax authority cited by the EU. The equation didn't change even as Apple began assembling the bulk of its products in Asia. Ireland and Apple started to make changes a few months after the 'Maxforce' began looking into their tax relationship. In October 2013, Finance Minister Noonan announced he would close the loophole that let stateless holding companies operate out of Ireland - and the EU says Apple changed the structure of its Irish units in 2015. As the 'Maxforce' stepped up its probe in June 2014, Taoiseach Enda Kenny was wooing potential investors in California. At a San Francisco event to promote Irish entrepreneurs, Governor Jerry Brown quipped that he had thought Apple "was a California company", but according to tax returns, "they're really an Irish company". News clips show Irish officials looking on stony-faced at his joke. With Lienemeyer's team digging further into the issue, Apple's concern deepened. In January 2016, the company's Tim Cook met Margrethe Vestager, the EU Competition Commissioner and Lienemeyer's ultimate boss, on the 10th-floor of the Berlaymont building, headquarters of the European Commission in Brussels. Vestager, a daughter of two Lutheran pastors, has a reputation for being even-handed but tough, cutting unemployment benefits while advocating strict new rules for banks when she served as Denmark's finance minister. While she has acknowledged that her EU team had little experience with tax rulings - in a November interview with France's 'Society' magazine, she said, "We learned on the job" - Vestager says enforcement of EU rules on taxation is a matter of "fairness." In the meeting with Cook she quizzed him on the tax Apple paid in various jurisdictions worldwide. She told the Apple executives that "someone has to tax you", according to a person present at the meeting. In a January 25 follow-up letter obtained by Bloomberg, Cook thanked Vestager for a "candid and constructive exchange of views", and reasserted that Apple's earnings are "subject to deferred taxation in the US until those profits are repatriated". Subsequent correspondence became more heated. On March 14, Cook wrote to Vestager that he had "concerns about the fairness of these proceedings". The Commission had failed to explain fully the basis on which Apple was being investigated, and the body's approach was characterised by "inconsistency and ambiguity", he said. Apple contended that the EU had backtracked on a 2014 decision recognising that its two Irish subsidiaries were not technically resident in Ireland, and therefore only liable for taxes on profits derived from Irish sources. Now, Cook said, it seemed the Commission was intent on "imposing a massive, retroactive tax on Apple by attributing to the Irish branches all of Apple's global profits outside the Americas". "There is no inconsistency," an EU spokesman said in a December 15 statement. Only a fraction of the profits of the subsidiaries were taxed in Ireland, the statement said. "As a result, the tax rulings enabled Apple to pay substantially less tax than other companies, which is illegal under EU state aid rules." Cook's entreaties did little to sway Vestager, and in August she phoned Noonan to tell him the results of the 'Maxforce' investigation: The Commission was going to rule against Ireland. Late in the afternoon of August 29, Irish officials began hinting to reporters that Apple's tax bill amounted to billions and "could be anything". At noon the following day, Vestager told a packed press conference in Brussels that the Commission had decided Apple owed Ireland €13bn. The 'Maxforce' had concluded that Ireland allowed Apple to create stateless entities that effectively let it decide how much -- or how little -- tax it pays. The EU investigators say the company channeled profits from dozens of countries through two Ireland- based units. In a system at least tacitly endorsed by Irish authorities, earnings were split, with the vast majority attributed to a "head office" with no employees and no specific home base - and therefore liable to no tax on any profits from sales outside Ireland. The US, meanwhile, didn't tax the units because they're incorporated in Ireland. The €13bn Apple bill would be equivalent to 26pc of the entire national budget for 2015. But Ireland didn't want the windfall, saying the ruling was flawed because the country hadn't given Apple any special treatment. The decision sparked a political crisis as left-leaning members of Enda Kenny's coalition saw a potential bonanza for taxpayers that the world's richest company could well afford. Even as Noonan toured television studios vowing to appeal the decision, some Independent TDs demanded that he take the money. Facing a potential revolt, Kenny and Noonan eventually bowed to demands for a review of the corporate tax system here. But they said they would fight the Apple case, and on September 7, the Dail overwhelmingly backed the motion for an appeal. Officials from Lienemeyer's team and other EU offices say they have gathered tax information on about 300 companies, looking for what they deem to be favourable treatment by governments across Europe. While they don't expect all of those to yield payoffs as hefty as that from their investigation of Ireland and Apple, they say a worrying number require maximum force from the 'Maxforce'. "We focus on outliers where you're looking at something that is off the radar screen," Lienemeyer's boss, 50-year-old Dutchman Gert-Jan Koopman, who is in charge of state-aid enforcement, said at a Brussels conference in November. "If you're paying a fair amount of tax then there is absolutely nothing to worry about." Though the EU says its goal is "to ensure equal treatment of companies" across Europe, Apple maintains that the Commission selectively targeted the company. With the ruling, the EU is "retroactively changing the rules and choosing to disregard decades of Irish law",and its investigators don't understand the differences between European and US tax systems, Apple said. Apple says its Irish units paid the parent company a licensing fee to use the intellectual property in its products. The Irish companies didn't own the IP, so they don't owe tax on it in Ireland, but will face a US tax bill when they repatriate the profits. "This case has never been about how much tax Apple pays, it's about where our tax is paid," the company said. "We pay tax on everything we earn." Ireland has appealed the Commission's ruling at the EU General Court in Luxembourg, arguing it has given Apple no special treatment. "Look at the small print" on an iPhone, Michael Noonan said after the EU released its ruling in August. "It says designed in California, manufactured in China. That means any profits that accrued didn't accrue in Ireland, so I can't see why the tax liability is in Ireland." In the coming weeks, the EU is expected to publish details of the 'Maxforce' investigation. At the same time, Apple will lodge its appeal in the EU court. Though Apple will have to pay its tax bill within weeks, the money will be held in escrow, and the issue will probably take years to resolve. A 'Maxforce' representative declined to make Lienemeyer available for an interview. The Revenue Commissioners here say they can't comment on specific companies.

Business Home LBoard MH370: No suspicions of crew, passengers, says French probe FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Apple can sell iPhone 7s in Indonesia after R&D investment commitment AFP | December 17, 2016 Indonesia, a promising smartphone market where Apple has trailed some rivals, has stipulated that starting from January 2017, all 4G handsets sold there must have a local content of at least 30 percent. JAKARTA: Apple Inc has committed to invest around $44 million in a research and development center in Indonesia over the next three years, a senior government official said, enabling it to start selling its latest iPhone 7 in the Southeast Asian nation. That rule can be met in terms of hardware, software or an investment commitment. Apple received a “local content certification” in November, I Gusti Putu Suryawirawan, director-general for metal, machines, transport equipments and electronics at the industry ministry, said in a text message. “Apple has committed around $44 million to invest in R&D over three years,” Suryawirawan said. “Therefore, they can distribute devices priced 6 million rupiah ($448) and above. That means all iPhones can be distributed.” An Apple spokeswoman declined to confirm the investment figure, but pointed to an announcement last year that the US tech company had committed to build an iOS App Development Center in Indonesia. Apple has an uphill battle in the country of 250 million people, which has a young, internet-savvy demographic that is among the world’s biggest users of social media. In the second quarter of this year, South Korea’s Samsung led with a 26 percent share of Indonesia’s smartphone market by sales volume, trailed by China’s OPPO with 19 percent, according to research firm IDC. Both Samsung and OPPO have factories in Indonesia. OPPO’s army of sales representatives, advertising blitz and middle-end pricing have propelled it to no. 2 in Indonesia within just three years.

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Dec 16, 2016 at 7:41PM Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has long been known as an early adopter willing to give new products a shot early in their lifecycles. Unsurprisingly, he has been a vocal owner of a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model S -- perhaps the geekiest car on the planet. And in September, Wozniak said on Facebook he would be switching to General Motors' (NYSE:GM) new all-electric Chevrolet Bolt when it came out. Chevrolet Bolt. Image source: General Motors. General Motors was certainly happy about Woz's decision. In a November press conference at the LA Auto Show about the Bolt, the company highlighted Wozniak's decision to switch to a Bolt, showing a slide saying, "Apple co-founder ditching Tesla." Woz's decision to buy the Bolt signaled just how compelling the Bolt was, even to early adopters. But now that the Bolt is here, Wozniak has changed his mind, instead buying an additional Model S.  What happened? Woz is concerned about the feasibility of the vehicle on road trips, he said on Facebook this week. While Wozniak's story represents the opinion of only one person, it highlights a major problem with the new Bolt: Its maximum charging rate is too slow. Woz bolts on the Bolt... for now "I'm concerned about how it would work on our favored road trips," Wozniak said about the Bolt on Facebook. "So far, Tesla's the only game in town for that." Wozniak was likely referring to how much longer it will take to charge a Bolt. The 50-kilowatt charge the Bolt can handle is well below the 120 kW of power that a Model S can handle. To be fair, Wozniak is still considering the Bolt, he said on Facebook. "It had a lot of things nicer about it than the Tesla," he noted. But General Motors might have to improve the Bolt's charging speed first. Tesla Superchargers span major highways in the U.S. Western Europe, and China. Image source: The Motley Fool. The Bolt's website details the Bolt's charge rate: "Bolt EV offers DC Fast Charging capability, which provides up to 90 miles of range in about 30 minutes of charge time." Going further, General Motors boldly asserts that, "By the time you finish a cup of coffee, you'll be powered up and so will your Bolt EV." But this description doesn't truly capture what the charging experience will be like for Bolt owners. With over 200 miles of range, Bolt owners will likely charge at home for their daily driving. So the most likely situation in which Bolt owners would need to stop to charge would be when they are traveling long distances. And on road trips, Bolt owners will likely want to charge more than 90 miles, so they should probably plan for a long dinner instead of a coffee -- a full charge will take about two hours. Will this impact demand? It's possible Wozniak would have never considered the Bolt in the first place if he had been aware of how slowly the Bolt would charge. As Electrek points out, GM hadn't actually confirmed the Bolt's maximum charging rate at the time. Given that the Bolt uses a 60 kilowatt-hour battery -- a battery capacity Tesla has used in its vehicles before -- buyers would assume the Bolt could handle a charging rate as powerful as a Model S can. But according to General Motors' website, the Bolt charge is much slower than a Tesla vehicle. For comparison, a Model S's 120 kW charge can deliver about 170 miles of range in around 30 minutes. Chevrolet Bolt. Image source: General Motors. Sure, the Bolt's $37,500 price tag is much lower than the Model S's $68,000 starting price, helping justify its much slower charging rate. But there's no reason Tesla's $35,000 Model 3, which the electric-car maker plans to begin delivering by the end of next year, won't be able to match the Model S's charging rate. As Bolt customers recognize this flaw with General Motors' newest technology, Woz might not be the only Chevrolet customer bolting. Daniel Sparks owns shares of AAPL, FB, and Tesla Motors.

By Parker Wilhelm Mobile phones   A flexible iPhone could be on the way Shares It's still hard to tell exactly what Apple has up its sleeve for the next iPhone, but it appears the company stay flexible for its next series of handsets - literally. LG Displays has allegedly struck a deal with Apple to produce out-foldable OLED panels for the Cupertino-based tech giant, according to reports from etnews.  This, combined with rumors of Apple considering OLED screens on some models of its supposed iPhone 8 - as well as potentially playing with idea of a curved screen - paint an interesting picture of what form the company's flagship phones could look like in the coming years. LG patented a prototype for a foldable, translucent tablet display earlier this year, while competitor Samsung has made considerable strides in the field with a foldable phone that could potentially release next year.  It was unclear this particular patent of LG's is what caught Apple's eye, though the report mentions that the purchased prototype's technical performance was "significantly high." No more bent 'sets Apple isn't the only company interested in folding displays. The same report also mentions the likes of Microsoft and Google getting in on LG's screens, which are expected to begin mass production in 2018. Following the iPhone 6 Plus' 'scandal' with being susceptible to unwanted bending, Apple has reportedly been interested in making a flexible handset for a while now.  As is always the case, these reports don't translate to a direct confirmation - especially with a company that keeps its cards as close to its chest as Apple - it's looking more and more likely that the iPhone of the future will look completely different.

Now, a new report from Korea indicates that Apple, Google and Microsoft are all looking to partner up with LG Display for OLED panels that aren’t just curved, but can be folded. Don't Miss: Amazon is letting people gift 3 months of Prime! Samsung Display is expected to be the leading supplier of OLED screens for the curved iPhone next year. But LG Display will compete with Samsung for Apple orders in 2018 when it’s expected to start mass-producing foldable OLED screens that could equip smartphones and tablets with curved displays, or devices that can be folded. According to Korean site ETNews, it’s confirmed that LG Display will mass-produce foldable displays for Apple, but also for other major industry players including Google and Microsoft. That’s certainly an interesting detail considering we haven’t seen any rumor to suggest Google’s future Pixel phones or Microsoft’s Surface-branded devices could feature foldable screens. It’s no secret that Google is going after iPhone customers with its Pixel design. Given that the iPhone 8 and Galaxy S8 are both expected to feature curved OLED displays, it’s likely that Google will also be interested in following suit, and improving the image quality at the same time. Microsoft, on the other hand, may use foldable displays for that mythical Surface phone we keep hearing about. Or the company could create foldable Surface tablets that could be utilized either as tablets or smartphones. It’s unclear at this time when Google and Microsoft might release devices with curved or foldable screens. If they’re waiting for LG’s new OLED display factories to come online, then it’s not going to be until sometime after next year. Samsung is the only company that can currently meet some of the curved OLED demand out there, but not all of it. That’s probably the reason why not all iPhone 8 models will get OLED screens next year. Apple is expected to eat plenty of Samsung’s OLED capacity in 2017, leaving little for its competitors. But rumors say that two out of its three handsets coming in 2017 will still use LCD screens, like every other iPhone released to date.

By Ben Moss • Posted Dec. 16, 2016 • Reading time: 2 minutes 76 128 14 “Wow!” is the usual response on trying VR for the first time. Even after spending hours in a headset, the experience is still extraordinary. From a designer’s point of view, VR introduces a range of new challenges, but it also frees us from some of the problems we’ve wrestled with for years; any notion of a viewport is entirely moot. 15 years ago, Adobe (née Macromedia) Flash was similarly revolutionary. Flash was browser-agnostic, and (virtually) identical across all platforms. It raised expectations of the web from simple text, to experiences. In a time before the web standards movement was mainstream, when every browser implemented not only its own interpretation, but its own syntax for CSS, Flash was liberating. Flash’s greatest strength…was also its downfall There are numerous parallels between Flash technology and VR, the most apparent is the initial emphasis on gaming, and upon simple linear presentations. Flash eventually developed to produce rich, interactive, data-based experiences; it’s reasonable to think that VR will develop in a similar way. Ultimately, Flash’s greatest strength—its encapsulated nature—was also its downfall. Without a way to reinterpret data that was so closely integrated with its presentation, accessibility was complex, and limiting. The oft-stated belief (commonly repeated now in reference to VR) was that Flash was inherently a visual medium, and as such couldn’t be accessible. The most cost-effective solution was to develop a non-Flash version in parallel with the “main” Flash site. Accessible VR is perhaps even harder to achieve. However, imagine a VR setup in which touch is enabled—perhaps with gloves containing points that vibrate to simulate physical contact. A person—visually impaired or otherwise—could experience work by Richard Sera, or the death mask of Tutankhamun, or Hampton Court maze, with just their hands. VR has the potential to be far more accessible than the current web, because we experience VR in a manner very similar to the way in which we experience the real world; with accessible VR, vision is a progressive enhancement. with accessible VR, vision is a progressive enhancement The beginning of the end for Flash was Apple’s decision to block the Flash Player on iOS. Security and performance were cited as reasons, but the truth is probably that enabling SWFs on the iPhone would enable a rival app store revenue stream, that Apple couldn’t take a bite of. (The current iPhone has NFC blocked except for Apple Pay; security is blamed, but the monopoly on payments can’t hurt.) It’s interesting that Oculus, in the vanguard of VR technology, won’t produce a Mac version, stating Apple’s machines simply aren’t powerful enough. And so, VR may face a similar format dispute to Flash, albeit with roles reversed. Despite being principally a one-organization format, there were applications that output SWF files other than Adobe’s product range. There were rival products, Microsoft’s Silverlight for example. And there was an entire industry based around Flash templates, frameworks, and components. VR is more diverse than a single format, but only just. While there are numerous technology companies working towards VR solutions, formats seem likely to merge. One of the most affordable headsets, the Samsung Gear, is already powered by Oculus. Templates, frameworks, and components appear to be on the way; only this week the React VR Pre-Release was made public. Flash did some great things: the fluid approach to responsive design, fine typography on the web, experience-centred design, were all pioneered by Flash designers. VR has the potential to be a similar catalyst for radical change. But to be viable in the long term, VR needs to do what Flash could not: it needs to embrace inclusive design, and if possible, accessibility; it needs to resist the pull towards a single format; and above all, it needs a set of VR standards—comparable to web standards—that designers and developers are prepared to defend.

Elyse Betters17 December 2016Apps Apple/Pocket-lint Apple's new Support app is now available in the US It mimics Apple's online support website Provides an easy way for you to get support while on the go You can find answers in articles or talk to an Apple expert You can even use it to schedule a Genius Bar appointment Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Sometimes you just need a little help - or, should we say, support.  We've all been there: you're playing on your iPhone or Mac or iPad or iWatch, and then something happens that you can't explain. Maybe your device has been bricked, rendered unusable, or maybe it just won't connect to the internet or install an update. There are a number of different issues that can happen when it comes to technology and gadgets, including a number of different ways to troubleshoot those issues. Luckily, if you find yourself facing a problem with one of Apple's pricey products, you can always go to Apple for help. But how do you do that? Easy. Download the new Apple Support app. On 13 December, Apple launched a specialised app designed to mimic its dedicated support site. It provides users with a list of their registered devices and access to documentation for those devices. It also lets them schedule repairs. Here's everything you need to know about the Apple Support app, including how it works and where it's available. What is the Apple Support app? One month after going live in the Netherlands, Apple's specialised Apple Support has launched in the US App Store, giving Apple users an easy way to get support for their devices while on the go. Screenshots of the app actually first leaked out way back in 2015, but now, it's official. So, if you happen to notice a problem with your Apple device, all you have to do is download the app to get started with troubleshooting. How does the Apple Support app work? Apple has described its new Apple Support app as "your personalised guide to the best options from Apple". You can find answers with articles tailored to your products and questions. You can call, chat, or email with an "expert" right away. You can schedule a callback when it’s convenient for you. You can even get a repair at an Apple Store or a nearby Apple Authorized Service Provider. Getting started with Apple Support If you have a functioning iPhone or iPad, download Apple's Support app from the App Store. Once downloaded, log in with your Apple ID. From there, Apple Support will surface a list of all the devices associated with/registered to your Apple ID. The product details screen also shows hardware info, like a serial number or IMEI, as well as informs users of their AppleCare coverage status.  Browse troubleshooting topics Tapping on a device will pull up a product pane, with options to view general support documents for topics like startup and power, internet and connectivity, installation and updates, Mail, hardware issues, Apple ID and password, printing and scanning, and other topics. Apart from browsing troubleshooting topics to find an answer to your problem, you can also search for a specific issue from the support portal screen. Choose your support option Much like Apple's online support site, the standalone app will guide you through a series of documents that help you to self-diagnose and solve a variety of problems. For instance, if you tap on your iPhone 7 Plus, then select the topic "Battery, Power & Charging" topic, you'll get a list of potential or commonly occurring issues. In this example, Apple provides a support document with links to web article, which details best ways to maximise battery life. To streamline your troubleshooting process, the app automatically creates a support case for you. Contact Apple directly You will find options for contacting an Apple Support specialist, along with estimated chat and phone wait times, under topics that lack sufficient support documentation. You'll be able to call Apple directly, schedule a call for later, or chat via text. However, some queries may require a Genius Bar appointment, so Apple provides a scheduling tool for that. And finally, you'll see recommended articles at the bottom of the screen.   Does the Apple Support app cost money? No. The Apple Support app is free to download and use. Which devices can run the Apple Support app? The Apple Support app requires iOS 9.0 or later and is compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. It's available in the these languages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, Traditional Chinese, and Turkish.  Is the Apple Support app available in the UK? No. Apple only recently launched the app in the Netherlands and the US. We assume it'll eventually be available in other countries.

By Danny Zepeda | December 16, 2016 Part of: Apple Share Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo There are a lot of thoughts about the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar out there. Some of it is good; most of it is not so good. In our initial review, we broke down some of the good and bad parts of the computer. Spoiler, it’s not the best for productivity right now. Last week, Jon decided to vent some of the issues he’s been experiencing with Apple’s latest laptop, mainly terrible battery life. Apple promised ten hours worth of usage, but he’s been getting under five. Now, Jon has had the computer for a month and he’s back to retell everything that is good and bad with the computer after the initial jolt of getting a first-generation device wears off. Sometimes it takes more than a couple of weeks to really see how a computer will operate for the long run, especially after updates are rolled out. So, how does the Jon feel about the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar one month later? Did he find new ways to use the Touch Bar? Are the limited ports really that bad? Did battery life get any better? Did the latest macOS update relieve any of the performance issues? Jon answers all of those questions in the video above.

We look at recent announcements that could change how you enjoy your favorite movies and shows. Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Dec 16, 2016 at 7:32PM In late November, two major announcements from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and AT&T (NYSE:T) gave TV viewers even more reasons to be couch potatoes. First, AT&T unveiled its long-awaited over-the-top steaming service -- DirecTV Now. With a low $35 per month promotional rate for a package boasting over 100 popular channels, this is an attractive offering for many subscribers. Not to be outdone, Netflix rolled out offline viewing, a feature that has been in high demand among customers, especially since a major competitor made it available in 2015. On this episode of Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, we discuss the new services, the waves they might make in the industry, and how important they will end up being to shareholders of both companies. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Dec. 13, 2016. Vincent Shen: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. I'm your host, Vincent Shen, and it is Friday, December 2nd. With me in studio today is Fool.com contributor Dan Kline. We're taking advantage of your visit, Dan, to Fool headquarters this week, so we're pre-recording this episode, which you will hear on Tuesday, December 13th. Dan, it's always great to have you on the show. How are you? Dan Kline: I'm doing great. You treated me to lunch today, which is, if anyone thinks we're a little less energetic than usual ... Shen: We had a very heavy meal of Bonchon wings. My first time I had them was in New York, but they have since made their way, have several locations around Alexandria, Virginia here, also in D.C. great wings. Kline: I will say, we're not getting paid for this, and they didn't send us free wings. If you don't have one where you live, get on a plane today. Shen: (laughs) Our main topic for the show today is the new over the top streaming service from AT&T called DirecTV Now. That launched at the end of November. We're going to break down the offering itself, but then we're going to take a broader look at some of the competing services, and the likelihood that they end up driving any kind of meaningful top and bottom line gains at their respective parent companies.  But before we do that, I want to touch on another related story. That is the announcement from Netflix and their decision to finally allow offline viewing to their subscribers. The company broke this news on the same day as the DirecTV Now launch, probably stealing a little bit of their thunder. But if you are a Netflix user or follow the company in general, you probably know that management has been fighting this move for a long time. Amazon first upped the ante in September of 2015, they introduced the offline viewing to Prime video users. I think Sean and I talked about that on the show last year around that time. At the time, chief product officer at Netflix, Neil Hunt, he tried to ward off critics by arguing that adding options and complexity to the service would result in confusion or inaction from users. So, instead of just letting viewers download the content while they were traveling or somewhere without a good internet connection, the company tried to find other alternatives, like special servers that they could put on an airplane or train, for example, that could carry the entire Netflix library. Or, they tried to figure out better video technology that would reduce the file size and the data needs of videos. But basically, lo and behold, the simplest option prevails, right? Kline: Yeah. I mean, that's a tad inefficient. (laughs)  Shen: Exactly. Kline: I don't think we need to bring all of Netflix with us everytime we fly. That seems a little bit reaching. And the reality is, his point about complexity is correct. Good luck on Amazon figuring out how to download things. It's not super simple. The Amazon interface is light years behind the Netflix interface. That's true whether you're renting something on Amazon, or you're actually watching it through Prime -- figuring out how it is, where it goes -- Shen: I will absolutely agree with you. Recently, I tried to watch something on my mobile phone for the first time through the Amazon Prime video library, and it required two additional app downloads. It was very surprising for a company that, in the past, has generally been so good at making shopping or using their services as easy as possible. Kline: I think the Amazon video experience is generally lousy. I'm a subscriber and a Prime number, I'm a Netflix member. And I think what Netflix has done is removed the last barrier to any person who had resistance to a $9.99 price tag, because the people who don't get Netflix are the people who are still spending money renting movies, or going to Redbox. Look, I'm a parent, and before I would take my 12 year-old son on a plane ride, I would pay for a season of The Simpsons, or a couple of movies he wants to watch, and I would rent them or buy them so he could watch them offline. We're a Netflix subscriber. I am never again going to have to do that. So, if I ever have to make the decision of, "Is Netflix worth my $9.99, or should I drop it for a month or two because I'm not watching anything?" it's a no-brainer, because we were spending money elsewhere that now just goes into the Netflix bundle. I don't see why anyone wouldn't get Netflix now. Shen: Yeah. In the beginning, I didn't think this was that significant or that big of a game-changer. But something to keep in mind is, they're rolling this feature out worldwide. The fact that, I think Netflix is now approaching about 90 million subscribers worldwide, and a growing portion of that 90 million is international, and you have some markets where maybe the internet is costlier and not as reliable -- this is maybe going to convince some fence-sitters that "Hey, if I can find a good connection or a cheaper connection, download it, and watch it at my leisure offline, that makes it that much more compelling." Kline: And the reality is, the internet is not that reliable. If you remember, last week, we were going to tape one of these shows, and I was remote in an office with a high-speed, wired internet connection, and we could not get Skype to connect in order to give us a good signal. Shen: Sure, fair enough. Kline: How many times have you been watching Netflix in your living room, where randomly it stops, and you have to restart -- Shen: Or let it buffer, yeah. Kline: Yeah. So, even at home sometimes, we have a family home in the woods in New Hampshire, and the internet connection is satellite internet, it's awful. I would much rather wait an hour to download a movie and then watch it that night than have to deal with the buffering and the stops and the audio not being right, or whatever is going on. This is just a smart move. And I understand, the reason they resisted it was pirating. I can now download a series of House of Cards and hand you my laptop and you can watch it. But guess what? I could give you my Netflix password, too. Shen: Yeah. So, big takeaway, maybe it helps some of those fence-sitters that I mentioned, in areas where the internet connection isn't as reliable. But all in all, I think it's just the stickiness of that Netflix product that they're offering. And ultimately, I think if they're able to keep those subscribers loyal, we saw some churn when they increased their rates earlier this year, but make it as compelling as possible, with their content, but also with the usability of that content, maybe in the future, if there's another price increase, people are more willing to stomach that. Kline: This is a valuable give-back. You have to listen to your customers, and people clearly wanted this, for all the reasons we've listed. So, when they go to $12.99 or $11.99 in a year or two, at least they can say, "Hey, we gave you what you asked for." Shen: Yep. A few details I do want to add, in terms of, anybody who didn't know about this or wants to look into it is, you need the newest version of the Netflix app to do so. And the library isn't comprehensive. It's growing, they'll be adding more content to it, in terms of what you can download and view offline. It includes most of their original series. Kline: It's a question of rights. You're going to see this, when we talk about the OTT services, some of these rights scenarios weren't ever considered when they made these deals. So, as these movie deals come up, and TV deals, they're going to start asking for the right to let people download it offline. It's not a technology issue. Shen: Yep. And one big example of content that is currently not included in this feature is Disney content. They signed that really big, expensive deal that gave them some of that exclusivity. Kline: And Disney might be a holdout, because they're one of the last few places that actually still sells DVDs. So, if you're Disney, you may not want Netflix to be allowed to have your content offline, because it might cost you a $19.99 sale. It's the one thing, as a parent, you can justify, because a little kid is going to watch Cars 300 times in a row, and you're getting your money's worth. So, not everything is coming to this service. But as an adult, as a father, it's still a very valuable offering. Shen: So, out with one streaming service, in comes another. DirecTV Now is currently available for free trial. Why don't you give me some basics, Dan? How much is it, and what are customers getting? Kline: DirecTV Now is your latest alternative to cable. It's live streaming cable channels. And the promo offer is a $35 a month package, which, in theory, AT&T is taking a bath on, though, let's assume they've negotiated some good deals there, for at least a short time. You get about 100 cable channels, including, in some markets, local channels, but that's very limited, like, if you live in New York, you might get NBC, but you can only watch certain programs on demand. But in general, you're getting the top cable companies like TBS, TNT. It's very similar to Dish Sling, or Sony PlayStation Vue, where you don't have cable, you want to watch some live TV, you want some sports, and you're going to pay and you're going to get a streaming-only cable service. Shen: Yep. I should add, there's four tiers to the service -- Kline: Which are made a little bit irrelevant by the promo offer right now. Shen: Yeah. They have cute names. The first tier is $35 a month, it's called Live a Little. The next one's $50, Just Right. And then the promo one is Go Big which is usually $60, but the current promotional rate is $35. Kline: And they say they're going to honor that forever. Now, forever, for AT&T, is not trustworthy. Just like they're going to grandfather your unlimited plan forever, and then slowly make it terrible for you. But, in the short term, it's probably the cheapest per-channel deal. Dish Sling is at about 22 channels for $20, it varies a little bit how many channels. Shen: And you can stack on additional, right? Kline: You can add stuff. So, it's probably $35 for 100 channels. And 20 of those channels aren't stupid ones you don't watch. Most of them are good channels. Shen: The full network list isn't available, at least that I could find, but a pretty good sampling of them are here. And as you mentioned, it includes most of the big networks. And like you mentioned, if you can get it, it includes three of the big -- Kline: No CBS. Shen: No CBS. And then, the biggest package is Gotta Have It $70 a month. I'm trying to think if there was any other ... so, there's the promotional offer that's $35 ... Kline: And there's a promo where you can get HBO and one of the other pay services for $5. Shen: And some perks that come with the service are, the fact that you can cancel it at any time, there's no annual contract, no fees that way, and there's no waiting for a cable guy to come install it, no box, it will stream directly to your smart TV, your phone, your tablet, your PC, any devices you have like Apple TV, the Amazon Fire TV Stick. There's also a bunch of on-demand titles, too, right? Kline: And they'll give you those devices. If you commit to three months, they'll give you an Apple TV. I will point out that Apple TV is $149, and 35 times three, I can't do that math live on their air ... Shen: But it's less than $149. Kline: It's $105. So, if you were thinking about an Apple TV, getting this for three months just to play with it while you're traveling is worth it, just to try it. But the reality is, they have built a me-too service. This is somewhere in-between what Dish and Sony are doing. Sony has a pretty traditional cable offering, in terms of its pricing and its package, whereas Dish is going for more Millennials -- "this is the best of the best, this is what you're going to watch." AT&T is somewhere in the middle. At that $70 price, it's not that cheap; at the $35 price, it's a good deal. The problem is, consumers have not shown that they actually want these services. I know you have the numbers, but the cable universe is about 94 million homes, even with the slow decline in cord cutting. Why don't you jump in with how many people are getting these? Shen: You mentioned Sling and Playstation Vue as the main, what people would see as the competitors of this service. I want to mention, as a first foray into this world from AT&T and DirecTV, it's pretty competitive. I think it's actually, for what this world is, a pretty strong showing. Kline: At the promo price, it's by far the best offering, because not only do you get $35 for 100 channels, you also can stream two streams, whereas the Dish offer is only one. Sony's is multiple, but it's much more money.  Shen: I think the bottom line, at least for customers, is that this is an attractive package. I think some people have been looking for that live TV competitor to your standard cable package. For some people, it will very much be cheaper if you can get in at that promotional rate, it becomes very compelling. After that rate expires, or once that promotion ends, I think it loses some of its luster, for sure.  In terms of the impact for the company, so if you're an AT&T investor, and you're looking at this like, "Is this a game changer for us?" I think, you have to keep in mind the scale of the business and what kind of impact this can have. I was really surprised. Even with Sony's Playstation Vue, the service has been out for how long, Dan, do you know? Kline: Just a few months, not that long. Six months or so. Shen: I think it has, just recently, in the past few months or so, crossed 100,000 subscribers. Kline: And Sling is coming up on two years, I would say. Shen: Yes, Sling came out in early 2015, so coming up on two years. That is also now approaching about one million subscribers. So, even the best case scenario, let's say that DirecTV Now can pick up one million subscribers to match Sling in the first six months, and every single one of those people adopts it at the $70 "go big" package. Kline: And none of them drop DirecTV's regular package to get it. Shen: Exactly. You're looking at $70 million incrementally, whereas in terms of these segments within AT&T, its cable TV business is a $20 billion business. So, it's important to think about where this really falls into things, and what you described as a me-too offering, that ultimately rings true. Kline: We've talked about this: I'm super negative on this product. And I like Sling, I used Sling for a long time when I traveled, I played with it. But the reality is, they're going after you. They're going after younger potential cord cutters, or cord nevers, and saying, "Well, we're not going to get you for $110 a month for cable, maybe we'll get you for $20 or $30 or $40." And the problem is, the person who doesn't have cable is watching something else. He has Netflix, he's watching YouTube, he's watching Twitch video games. It's not someone who desperately misses cable.  Shen: I will say, right now my internet package gets paired with a pretty basic TV bundle. This is the kind of thing that would make me rethink that. If I can get in at $35, get way more value out of that, it does become attractive. AT&T specifically says, there are 20 million people not subscribed to any sort of paid TV service that they think this will appeal to. I think that's very optimistic. Kline: I was going to say, that includes the Amish, that includes the elderly. Every cable company is doing this. Comcast is working on a service. Everyone is going to have one. And maybe you will see the end of the cable box, and this type of delivery will just become the norm, so the 94 million will morph over into slightly less expensive packages with a little bit more choice. But, this idea that there's this huge untapped audience of people who, they won't pay $70 for cable, but they will pay $35. And the second they drop their cable subscription, their internet bill is going to go up $5 to $15, and then Comcast is going to put a data cap on them. And if they start watching a bunch of movies, and downloading 4K video, then they're going to pay overage charges. So, the reality is, these are products built for a theoretical future that nobody has proven is actually coming. Shen: Alright, so, that is our pessimist view. I'm going to put on my optimist cap right now, because I do think there are a few things that we can keep in mind in terms of how this becomes attractive. For example, AT&T having this diversified suite of different businesses, including its wireless business, some people argue that this can be a loss leader because, guess what, AT&T have made it so that anything you watch, if you're signed up for DirecTV now, does not count against your data cap for your wireless service. Kline: And AT&T's ability to bundle, because they're not going to invest more money in physical cable lines. They own DirecTV, which is a satellite product, and the biggest decliner in the cable business has been their wired cable business, because if you own DirecTV, which you can market nationwide, why would you spend money marketing locally? So, they can go to their phone customer and say, "Here's a promo, add DirecTV Now for $20 for the next three months, I'll give you a thousand channels," or whatever it is. They'll have a little bit of success with that, but there's a ways to go on the product. I think that's important to point out. I tested Dish, I did a story for fool.com on cutting the cord, and I lived with Sling and with Sony, and to say it's an unpleasant experience when it's your prime means of watching TV is putting it mildly. People, when they watch cable, flip around. They don't sit down like they do with Netflix and binge-watch. They don't always watch whole programs. Even if you're watching your favorite football team, during the commercials you might flip to a home improvement show, or whatever it is. Doing that on these services is painful. It's a little better on Sling than it is on Sony. From the demos I've seen of DirecTV Now, there's a lot lacking. You also can only pause for five to 10 seconds on most channels.  Shen: Yes, that's something to keep in mind. DirecTV Now, at the moment, at launch, it does not have a DVR capability built in, but that's supposed to be coming next year, as is supports for some additional ... Kline: And, to be fair, the reality is, nobody really does. Sony has some limited DVR capability, better than others, but their price is higher. Sling is just this week testing some DVR. But the reality is, most of their deals with the cable companies preclude DVRs, pausing. There's some on-demand content. But generally, it's the type of on-demand content you could get with a Hulu subscription. Shen: Looks like we're going back to our pessimist angle. Kline: (laughs) But hey, good job, AT&T. Shen: I do want to add some additional details on numbers I was able to find. I think it's kind of interesting, in terms of the profitability, what the contribution might be in terms of their margins. You mentioned the $35 promotional deal for the 100 channels is quite compelling. The fact is, it's not coming cheap. One analyst I have, they believe the gross margins for the various packages will range anywhere from 2% to 15%. This is, for AT&T overall, their operating margin is about 17%, so not even close. The fact of the matter is, SNL Kagan, they estimate that that $35 monthly bill, even for the lowest tier, which I think is where a lot of people will end up signing on for those core 60 or so channels, that barely covers the cost of the programming, based on their estimates. Then you factor in things like the back-end support, customer service, the infrastructure, and you're potentially looking at what is very much a loss leader. Kline: I think there's one thing you can factor in there, I think we're about to see a bit of a come-to-Jesus. The cable companies have had all the leverage. ESPN has been able to say, "You can't get rid of ESPN. We want 10% more. We want to go from $5.80 to $6.25 to $6.45 per subscriber." Now, we're starting to see the cable companies say, "Wait a minute. We're going to offer a package without ESPN." Someone could go to one of these services and maybe not get certain higher-priced channels. There are going to be reductions in some of those costs. You are not going to, as a low-watch channel -- maybe VH1 Classic gets $0.02 per cable subscriber, and 80,000 people are watching it at the absolute best part of the day, they're either not going to exist because no one's going to pay them anything, or they're going to get lower fees. Even the big-ticket companies, ESPN ratings are down. So, you're going to see a trickle-down across the board. ESPN is either going to stay the same or take cuts, and they're going to spend less money on programming. So, you're going to see some of these college billion-dollar deals get lessened, and start to go down. Shen: I will add that, big picture, there's two other things that I want to wrap up with. The first is, even if, I think DirecTV Now, with this service, they wanted to raise prices and boost margins, let's say it really does take off, and they're able to build up five to 10 million subscribers, and it starts to make a bigger impact on their financials, it's only going to get more competitive in this space. Hulu is coming out with a competing service. Amazon, you know, is coming out with one. Kline: Apple is talking about one, Comcast is talking about one. Shen: Amazon will put that out at or below cost, too, just to take market share. Kline: And the problem is, when you're selling a service based on price, you lose a lot of pricing flexibility. So they are not going to be able to slowly raise this so it costs what cable does, unless cable goes away, which, as we talked about earlier, the physical cable box might. But for that to happen, these services have to feel like the experience of watching TV. Shen: That is a possibility, though, in terms of, looking out three to 10 years, as, they understand, or they see this as becoming the future without the cable box, no more waiting for the cable guy, replacing their model, and this is their test. Kline: Some of this I blame on your generation, who is willing to watch television on an iPad when you have a 60-inch flatscreen sitting in front of you. (laughs) I've never understood this! Shen: The second thing I did want to discuss was with the coming acquisition, still uncertain, of Time Warner, which will give AT&T an incredible library of content. Think about what Time Warner runs -- HBO, Warner Brothers, they have some great networks like AMC. Obviously, there's going to be some rules and regulations about making sure that there's somewhat fair competitive practices. But ultimately, Time Warner gives them that leverage to offer exclusive content to DirecTV Now subscribers. And that has worked for companies like Netflix. Kline: And even, forget the ability to say, "Hey, you're going to get HBO shows two days early," or some of the things that maybe will fall under regulation, though debatable, given the incoming administration and their stand on -- Shen: Call that uncertain, yeah. Kline: Yeah. Tom Wheeler, the FCC chair, has been pushing a lot of this, and he is probably not in political favor going forward. But, forgetting that. The buying power of this combined company -- one of the first deals they announced was a Taylor Swift Channel. Now, I know you're a big Swiftie. I am not so much. I am much more a Gwen Stefani camp -- no, I'm teasing, completely. But that said, Taylor Swift has a decided audience. And they could throw the money at her. So, her back catalog of performances, videos, exclusive interviews, whatever the heck it is, Taylor cooking Thanksgiving dinner, I have no idea, can be a channel. And that itself may not be a draw, but you start to pile two or three of those things together, and they have the ability, just like HBO has a deal with Bill Simmons and Jon Stewart, some of those deals are very amorphous as to what the content is going to be. They could say, "Hey, look, Bill Simmons' podcast is going to be on video on a channel," the way they do with The Dan Patrick Show on Audience, which is the AT&T video channel. So, their ability to just buy up the marketplace in terms of content -- and I'm sure they offer Audience to other cable companies and none of them take it -- eventually, they might be able to tip the balance in favor of them. But it's still not going to make you buy an inferior, unpleasant service. Shen: Yep. So, it seems, overall, you are not all that bullish on what this offer provides them. Kline: Not for today. Shen: My view is, it's an interesting step. I would watch it rather tentatively. But ultimately, this could be what the company sees as a step into what the future of distribution is going to look like. Kline: I think every cable and wireless player believes in this a lot more than I do, to be positive. (laughs)  Shen: Thanks a lot, Dan. Kline: Thank you.

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Dec 16, 2016 at 7:41PM Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has long been known as an early adopter willing to give new products a shot early in their lifecycles. Unsurprisingly, he has been a vocal owner of a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model S -- perhaps the geekiest car on the planet. And in September, Wozniak said on Facebook he would be switching to General Motors' (NYSE:GM) new all-electric Chevrolet Bolt when it came out. Chevrolet Bolt. Image source: General Motors. General Motors was certainly happy about Woz's decision. In a November press conference at the LA Auto Show about the Bolt, the company highlighted Wozniak's decision to switch to a Bolt, showing a slide saying, "Apple co-founder ditching Tesla." Woz's decision to buy the Bolt signaled just how compelling the Bolt was, even to early adopters. But now that the Bolt is here, Wozniak has changed his mind, instead buying an additional Model S.  What happened? Woz is concerned about the feasibility of the vehicle on road trips, he said on Facebook this week. While Wozniak's story represents the opinion of only one person, it highlights a major problem with the new Bolt: Its maximum charging rate is too slow. Woz bolts on the Bolt... for now "I'm concerned about how it would work on our favored road trips," Wozniak said about the Bolt on Facebook. "So far, Tesla's the only game in town for that." Wozniak was likely referring to how much longer it will take to charge a Bolt. The 50-kilowatt charge the Bolt can handle is well below the 120 kW of power that a Model S can handle. To be fair, Wozniak is still considering the Bolt, he said on Facebook. "It had a lot of things nicer about it than the Tesla," he noted. But General Motors might have to improve the Bolt's charging speed first. Tesla Superchargers span major highways in the U.S. Western Europe, and China. Image source: The Motley Fool. The Bolt's website details the Bolt's charge rate: "Bolt EV offers DC Fast Charging capability, which provides up to 90 miles of range in about 30 minutes of charge time." Going further, General Motors boldly asserts that, "By the time you finish a cup of coffee, you'll be powered up and so will your Bolt EV." But this description doesn't truly capture what the charging experience will be like for Bolt owners. With over 200 miles of range, Bolt owners will likely charge at home for their daily driving. So the most likely situation in which Bolt owners would need to stop to charge would be when they are traveling long distances. And on road trips, Bolt owners will likely want to charge more than 90 miles, so they should probably plan for a long dinner instead of a coffee -- a full charge will take about two hours. Will this impact demand? It's possible Wozniak would have never considered the Bolt in the first place if he had been aware of how slowly the Bolt would charge. As Electrek points out, GM hadn't actually confirmed the Bolt's maximum charging rate at the time. Given that the Bolt uses a 60 kilowatt-hour battery -- a battery capacity Tesla has used in its vehicles before -- buyers would assume the Bolt could handle a charging rate as powerful as a Model S can. But according to General Motors' website, the Bolt charge is much slower than a Tesla vehicle. For comparison, a Model S's 120 kW charge can deliver about 170 miles of range in around 30 minutes. Chevrolet Bolt. Image source: General Motors. Sure, the Bolt's $37,500 price tag is much lower than the Model S's $68,000 starting price, helping justify its much slower charging rate. But there's no reason Tesla's $35,000 Model 3, which the electric-car maker plans to begin delivering by the end of next year, won't be able to match the Model S's charging rate. As Bolt customers recognize this flaw with General Motors' newest technology, Woz might not be the only Chevrolet customer bolting. Daniel Sparks owns shares of AAPL, FB, and Tesla Motors.

ENTERTAINMENT HERO COMPLEX 'Super Mario Run' brings vaunted franchise to mobile phones Shigeru Miyamoto Evan Agostini / Invision / Associated Press Shigeru Miyamoto, the video game mastermind behind "Super Mario Bros." and the new "Super Mario Run," available now for Apple's mobile devices. Shigeru Miyamoto, the video game mastermind behind "Super Mario Bros." and the new "Super Mario Run," available now for Apple's mobile devices. (Evan Agostini / Invision / Associated Press) Todd Martens This week sees the return of two vaunted pop-culture landmarks that reigned during the 1980s. “Super Mario Run,” the latest spin-off of the “Super Mario Bros.” series now available on Apple’s mobile devices, is poised to be one of the biggest games of 2016.  It’s landing at a time when “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” is set to own the holiday box office. Like all things “Star Wars,” Mario  also endures.  Generations, now three of them, come and go, and yet Mario continues running, jumping and consuming mushrooms of questionable origin. Times change, but there is Mario, a proudly plump plumber helplessly watching his princess get kidnapped by a dinosaur-like turtle, only to then bounce through dozens of obstacle courses to get her back.  “The entertainment value that Mario-themed games have given people over the past three decades is hard to underestimate,” said Lewis Ward, a video game industry analyst at research firm IDC. Scenes from "Super Mario Run," the first Mario-themed mobile game from Nintendo. Nintendo of America Scenes from "Super Mario Run," the first Mario-themed mobile game from Nintendo. Scenes from "Super Mario Run," the first Mario-themed mobile game from Nintendo. (Nintendo of America) We're starting to see more and more that the first gaming device that kids touch is their parents' iPhone. — Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto And while today we may prefer our princesses to kick butt rather than require rescuing, Nintendo’s hero gets away with being a little old fashioned. Credit the design of master developer Shigeru Miyamoto, a man whose body of work also includes “Donkey Kong” and “The Legend of Zelda.” Miyamoto and Mario have some new tricks up their suspenders this week with Thursday’s “Super Mario Run” debut on Apple’s mobile devices. (Nintendo has not said when the Android release will follow, but observers in the industry note most Apple exclusivity deals run 90 days.) With “Super Mario Run,” Nintendo is bringing its timeless brand to a device that lives outside of its own ecosystem, and it just may be Mario’s most simplified, accessible adventure yet. Some are predicting the game will  accrue more than 50 million downloads, and initial reports pegged its first-day downloads at just under 3 million.  “We view video games and interactive games as being incredibly fun,” said Miyamoto via a translator. “Certainly when people have an opportunity to experience them, we’ve seen over the years that they agree with us. I think where we’ve had challenges lately is more and more people are having fewer opportunities to come into contact with our games.”  Thus “Super Mario Run” is what many consider a long overdue acknowledgment from the Japanese tech giant that, while Mario is still by and large the same jolly guy in a red hat and blue suspenders, the way we game is changing. Mobile has put games in our pocket, and in the case of “Pokemon Go,” another Nintendo-affiliated property, mobile has brought game characters into our world. We view video games and interactive games as being incredibly fun. — Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of "Super Mario Run." While Sony’s PlayStation 4 and Microsoft’s Xbox One have their dedicated supporters, long gone are the days when every kid on the block had a Nintendo Entertainment System. Nintendo learned this lesson with its Wii U, which had the dubious distinction as Nintendo’s worst-selling console at 13.6 million units sold worldwide.  “For many years the first gaming device that a kid would touch was a Nintendo system,” said Miyamoto. “Now we’re starting to see more and more that the first gaming device that kids touch is their parents’ iPhone. Obviously, with kids playing games on iPhones now, we wanted to make sure they had an opportunity to come into contact with our games and the Mario character.”  Miyamoto’s treasures emphasize simplicity and fluidity. Rare, for instance, is the Miyamoto game that needs to be taught — their worlds unfold intuitively. In the case of Mario? Press a button, and jump. Watch out for that Goomba.  Mario remains an unlikely but lovable hero. Mustached, portly and happy in the face of adversity, the “Super Mario Bros.” games represent the industry at its most colorful, weird and bright. In a business saturated with violence and gunplay, Mario is a goofy everyman — an underdog who never stops running and hopping to achieve his goals, and sometimes even turning into a raccoon or a cat.  “Super Mario Run” switches the formula — albeit slightly — while getting back to basics. In the game, Mario usually runs automatically. If past “Super Mario Bros” games allowed the characters to scroll through a world and explore it horizontally and vertically, “Super Mario Run” is more of a high-energy rush to the right. The top 10 video games of 2016 » Designed to be played with one hand, there’s only one control for users to master: simply tap the screen, and Mario jumps. When it comes to small jumps, Mario can handle those automatically, but bigger hurdles require more precise timing. The goal was to welcome novice players, said Miyamoto, “without feeling the control frustrations of past Mario games.” “In previous Mario games when Mario ran into an enemy, Mario would lose,” he added. “But this time, because Mario is running automatically to the right, we had to come up with some solutions for that. We added in this layer of auto-actions Mario does. He’ll run to a small gap and sort of automatically hurdle over it or run to the enemy and vault over the top of the enemy.” Like all Mario games, it’s deceptively simple and decidedly trippy. It’s 24 levels are shorter than the console counterparts, but it’s not uncommon to take a big leap and suddenly discover a whole new part of the world. How to get up there? Keep playing, and find ways to parry off walls and somersault backward.  Some of the more vertically inclined levels are the strongest, especially those set in haunted houses with doors that lead Mario in circles and ghosts that hover on and off the screen. Sometimes Mario is dodging saws, other times anthropomorphic rockets, and expect to literally run into Mario’s longtime foil, Bowser, quite a few times.  If the players’ goal is to collect coins, avoid falls and find the princess, Nintendo has a grander plan in mind. Next March, the company will release the Nintendo Switch, its next-generation console that works with a home television or as mobile gaming unit.  The company in early January will showcase it for the media and public at an event in New York. Miyamoto is counting on “Super Mario Run” to have a positive effect on the Switch, noting that “Pokemon Go” led to a bump in sales for its “Pokemon” games on the Nintendo 3DS. “We’ve seen this with Pokemon Go,” he said. “Even though it’s not a traditional Pokemon game, people are playing ‘Pokemon Go,’ they’re learning the names of the Pokemon, they’re encountering Pokemon for the first time, and as a result of that there’s many more people interested in the 3DS games.  … Similarly, by releasing ‘Super Mario Run’ on iPhones, our hope is that people will then be interested in our next system, Nintendo Switch.”     “Super Mario Run” Developer: Nintendo Platforms: Apple’s iOS devices; Android release to follow in 2017 Price: Free to download, but $9.99 for the full game.  Caption Casey Affleck finds the words in 'Manchester by the Sea' Casey Affleck talks about the way Kenneth Lonergan uses everyday language to convey deep emotion in "Manchester by the Sea."

Set to Expand in Indonesia iPhone 7 is about to go on sale in Indonesia. Image source: Apple. It may not be the most exciting smartphone market in the world, but every little bit helps when you’re trying to squeeze out growth in any way, shape, or form. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is now set to expand into Indonesia, after committing to a $44 million investment to open a new research and development (R&D) center in the region over the next few years, according to Reuters . Starting next year, Indonesia will implement a rule that requires all 4G smartphones to include at least 30% of local content, but that requirement can be satisfied in a few ways. It can be hardware, software, or investments. With Apple’s supply chain deeply entrenched in other regions, the Mac maker went with the latter route, and recently earned a “local content certification,” according to the report. The local sourcing requirement is similar to a law in India, except that India’s requirement pertains primarily to hardware components. Apple is unable to meet the requirement as is, despite its best efforts to be exempt under an exception for “state of the art” products. Apple still has a lot of work to do in order to crack India , which promises to be a massive smartphone market in the years ahead. Last month, Indonesian government officials announced that Apple would be opening an R&D center in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta in 2017. That’s just the latest in a string of R&D centers that the company is setting up across Asia. This is Samsung turf Again, this isn’t a particularly big market at the moment. There were roughly 55 million smartphone users in Indonesia in 2015, and quarterly unit sales are typically in the single-digit millions, according to eMarketer. However, eMarketer expects the smartphone user base to jump to approximately 92 million by 2019, so there’s definitely some growth potential for the Indonesian smartphone market, which is already the third-largest in the Asia-Pacific region behind China and India. The Indonesian smartphone market is still immature in many ways. Network infrastructure remains an ongoing development, and wider network access will help boost adoption. Smartphone penetration is estimated at around 47%, according to GSMA Intelligence. In Mary Meeker’s 2016 Internet Trends report, Indonesia falls into a group of countries that have medium to high barriers to broader internet adoption due to challenges around incentives and infrastructure, combined with mixed demographic trends. Affordability has been a key driver of smartphone adoption, which is obviously a hurdle for Apple given its premium positioning. The average retail price of a smartphone in Indonesia in 2014 was just $212, per Meeker’s estimates. GDP per capita in 2015 was only about $3,300. IDC released market share estimates for Indonesia just this morning, pegging Samsung as the market leader with 32% market share. China-based OPPO came in No. 2 with 17% share, followed by ASUS with 8%. The market researcher notes that most of the growth is coming from the $250-to-$300 price segment of the market, although entry-level handsets in the $100-to-$200 range are still the core part of the market. Note that Apple doesn’t directly participate in either of those market segments. There is some definite opportunity here as the market develops, and a wide range of companies are evaluating ways to comply with the local content regulation, which will likely spur continued growth. The risk is that Apple still ends up missing out by pricing itself out. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Except for Microsoft, which came up with some surprisingly good products, most other leading tech companies out there did face one set of problems or another, or came up with products that didn’t really meet expectations. These include companies like Apple and Samsung. Apple, for example, was in the news for battery issues with several of its new iPhone 6S stocks which prompted the company to issue a minor product recall. The new MacBooks, while still selling in great numbers, skipped some really crucial features (bye bye SD card slot)! Let us now address the elephant in the room — the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7, when first introduced, was touted to be the Korean electronic giant’s latest and greatest smartphone. However, within weeks of its release, Samsung was staring at perhaps one of the most difficult crises since its inception. Across the world, there were multiple reports of the Galaxy Note 7 units catching fire and exploding. While the initial reports were thought to be false flags, the number of explosions continued to proliferate across the world at an alarming rate. It became pretty clear that there was definitely something seriously wrong with the phone. When Samsung realized that things were going out of hand, they issued a worldwide product recall for some units of the Galaxy Note 7 that they thought had faulty batteries inside. Several buyers traded in their old, explosion-prone Galaxy Note 7 with a new one that Samsung said did not have the issue. Samsung initially blamed a manufacturing defect with the batteries and a design flaw that caused the battery to heat up and explode. Samsung’s eventual plan was to simply replace handsets that came with faulty batteries with new ones. [Image by Lee Jin-man/AP Images] Just days after the recall was underway, more troubling news came looking for Samsung. There were several reports which indicated that new, supposedly non-faulty, replaced Galaxy Note 7 models too had a similar problem. Once again, there were several reports of explosions and smokes, and after a quick analysis, Samsung did the unthinkable. They decided to stop the production of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and completely withdrew the product. At the time, Samsung had promised that they would do an internal inquiry and figure out the exact cause of the explosions. Now if we are to believe a report by The Investor, Samsung has reportedly managed to find out the reason behind the explosions. However, the company doesn’t seem to be ready yet to release these details to the general public. We are hopeful that Samsung would be able to convincingly explain people what happened with their flagship phone and quell any rumors associated with the incident. With less than a fortnight left for 2016 to end, there is chance that Samsung will come up with explanation for the Galaxy Note 7 battery issues in the next few days. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 explosions blamed on "aggressive" design – CBS News https://t.co/4Hq411f5ke | #galaxyNote7 #Note7 — Galaxy_Sleeves (@Galaxy_Sleeves) December 6, 2016 Meanwhile, debate continues to rage among tech enthusiasts whether this was the last we saw of Samsung’s Note series. While one camp believes that the Galaxy Note brand will be discontinued, thanks to the huge amount of negative publicity it received, there were others who seem to think that the Galaxy Note series would continue to live on for the foreseeable future — thanks to the immense brand value it still holds. What do you think will happen in 2017? Will Samsung make a grand comeback with the new Samsung Galaxy Note 8 or will they build a completely new series of large-screened smartphones that unfortunately wouldn’t be called a Galaxy Note? Do let us know in the comments section.

But it hasn’t taken long for them to notice the game is a considerable data hog. A report from Apple Insider shows the game consumes an upwards of 60 megabytes per hour. The report was conducted through a series of tests of Super Mario Run on the night of the game’s launch. The account from Apple Insider took into consideration the demand for downloads and found most users reporting their data on social media to fall within the 40 to 60 megabytes per hour range. Server issues caused by the game’s immediate popularity led to some players reporting nearly 150 megabytes of data required by the time they completed the in-game tutorial, though the figures are likely outliers from what is consumed by standard play. Related Stories 'Super Mario Run' Soars to Top of Apple Charts as Nintendo Shares Drop How To Unlock 'Super Mario Run' Playable Characters By comparison, the wildly popular Pokémon Go mobile game released earlier this year consumed closer to 30 megabytes of data per hour at its peak usage—though other reports indicate it uses as little as three megabytes per hour. According to a source from Apple quoted by Apple Insider, much of the data-sucking comes from the game’s servers. The source described the game as “chatty” and said it does a fair amount of back-and-forth communication behind the scenes. Because of the demand on the server, some of that interaction fails and sent and received data packets simply time out. However when that happens it still counts as data usage, leaving players left fitting the bill as they eat into their data caps. The source at Apple recommended playing the game primarily on Wi-Fi, especially when initially downloading the levels. Users on unlimited data plans obviously will have no bones about playing while on the go—save for perhaps with the battery drain the game causes.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Oracle's CEO Safra Catz Joins President-Elect Trump's Transition Team | Main | Fantastic New Apple TV Flyover Screen Saver Videos Debuted Last Night » December 16, 2016 Flash in the Pan LeEco, who Likened Apple to Hitler, Lost Millions on Smartphones and is Dire Cost Cutting Mode   In March 2015 an insane Chinese Android OEM by the name of LeEco likened Apple to Hitler in a smartphone ad using images that you can see in our story's cover graphic. Their reckless, irresponsible ego maniac CEO struck out at Apple by saying that "Apple's approach to the smartphone industry is stifling innovation and harming the interests of users." Considering that iPhone 6 mania had had swept the globe and crushed Samsung and every smartphone OEM in China, the backlash against Apple was the reaction of a nationalist gone crazy.   Even though the backlash against LeEco instantly forced LeEco's CEO Jia Yueting to apologize, he was back a month later on CNBC saying in an interview that Apple is outdated.   Flash forward to now and outdated Apple just came off of six straight quarters of taking a whopping 91% of smartphone industry profits with the highest Android OEM Huawei taking a measly 2%. Where was LeEco and their great innovative Android smartphone? Ha! – who knows because they don't register anywhere on the planet that matters. But we'll touch on that a little later in the report. Yet one thing is for sure, big mouth Yueting's company is in deep financial trouble.   The Wall Street Journal reported a week ago that "The listed unit of LeEco Holdings called 'Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp.,' founded by Chinese billionaire Jia Yueting, said it is planning changes to its business following a slide in share price that forced the fast-growing tech company to halt trade on the stock market.   "To protect the interests of the company and of many investors, the company needs to halt trade and investigate these matters," Leshi said in their financial filing."   Mr. Jia wrote in the letter to employees that said: 'As we sped ahead blindfolded, and expanded our business by burning cash, we got overstretched in our global strategy.'   Leshi, which is LeEco's only profitable business unit, said in the filing that it will resume trade after investigating the stock-price decline and making some strategic decisions."   In a newly published report today from Beijing, Jia Yuemin, vice president of the group's holding company Le Holdings, and an older brother of the company's founder and CEO Jia Yueting, revealed the company's restructuring blueprint.   Yuemin noted that "LeEco has entered its second phase of growth from the previous expansion phase.' Instead of aggressive expansion, further noted that the company's goal in the second phase is to rein the business in and be more profit-oriented.   "We were hoping to tap into broader markets, but considering the current situation, it is better off focusing on structural adjustment," he said. Delaying an earlier plan, "LeEco will not tap into a new sector for the next five to 10 years -- at least not for five years." That sounds like the bankers put the big squeeze and handcuff's on their run amuck CEO.   LeEco will now focus on cost-cutting. "We will lay off about 10% of our workers," said Jia. Currently there are 13,000 to 14,000 across the world working for LeEco.   Their VP then drifting into a delusional side step saying that they will surpass Samsung electronics in TVs within a couple of years. While I'm not a fan of Samsung, their takeover of Visio isn't likely to beat Samsung, especially in profits or on the high end of TVs.   Now, back to LeEco's oh-so-great smartphone that was to overtake the iPhone in China. Today's Beijing report notes that buoyed by the success of their YouTube like video service, the company quickly expanded into smartphones. However, this business has been disappointing. Filings by the holding company in May revealed its net loss last year widened to 174.49 million yuan ($25.3 million), from 17.53 million yuan from a year ago.   Jia blamed the company's smartphone losing venture to a cash crunch. "The pace of expansion was too fast, so our supply chain capability couldn't catch up with the speed." To cut costs, the company will sell its smartphones via its 10,000 TV sales outlets in China.   Apple crushed LeEco and every Android smartphone maker on the planet when it came to profits this year. LeEco's brash and insulting CEO couldn't persuade the smart Chinese youth to leave Apple's hot iPhone for a losing brand. And the so-called 'outdated Apple' is still one of the most valuable technology companies on the planet run by executives who understand how to make killer profits year in and year out and still hold sway to have loyal customers stand around the block to get their hands on the next new iPhone. That's sure better than having bankers lining up at the company's door wanting to be paid, wouldn't you say?    LeEco: What a loser.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft said to be one of LG’s first customers for their new Foldable Screens 6 by Surur  @mspoweruser Dec 16, 2016 at 22:00 GMT3 weeks ago Thee Economic Times of Korea reports that LG has secured customers for its new foldable displays for smartphones and tablets, with the list including Apple, Google and Microsoft. The displays are said to be deliverable for 2018 and that, unlike Apple and Google, Microsoft is expected to use the displays in its Surface tablets and not phones. The ET notes LG is partnering with larger brands rather than using the displays it ins own products (as Samsung is expected to do) as their phone business is not as successful as the other Korean electronics giant. They also note that Korea is ahead of China in their development of flexible displays as their yields are much better and their products of higher quality. “Although level of their technologies is very low, Chinese manufacturers can be the first ones to mass-produce flexible panels by considering the fact that they can sell them at a cheap price to Chinese markets.” said a representative for an industry. “However we need to see if they can actually mass-produce products that will have hard time competing against other global products.” “South Korean panel manufacturers have set goal of performance of their foldable panels significantly high.” said a different representative of an industry. “Because they achieved most of results that correspond to their goals, it will not be too long before they start mass-producing their products after going through little bit of supplementation.” A dual-screen tablet, as demonstrated in the LG prototype from CES 2013 above, of course makes us think of Microsoft’s doomed Courier tablet, which made effective use of the dual screen user interface and even the fold in the screen. Microsoft has been hard at work over the last few years making all their concepts reality, and hopefully this will be another idea whose time has finally come again.

Don’t, however, get your hopes up because this will likely mirror the Apple Pencil launch where “available in store” really means “good luck with that.” AirPods coming to Apple Stores, but don’t expect to find any AirPods are Apple’s wireless earbuds first showed off at the iPhone 7 launch event in September. They use Apple’s W1 chip to make pairing with your iPhone simple, and once paired they automatically work with every device linked to your iCloud account. Apple planned on shipping AirPods in October, but missed that target. When Apple finally started taking orders on Tuesday, December 13th, they went from a December 21 delivery date to a four week shipping backorder in about an hour. That has since stretched out to six weeks. Considering how quickly AirPods sold out it doesn’t seem likely there will be much inventory available for stores. That’s exactly the problem Apple had with Apple Pencil when it first shipped: Online orders were backlogged for weeks, and the handful that occasionally trickled into stores were snapped up as soon as they came in. That lack of inventory is frustrating for how have been waiting since September to put AirPods in their ears, and considering how limited inventory seems to be, most won’t get a chance to get a pair for several more weeks. If you’re planning on trying to buy a pair in person next week, try showing up when your local Apple Store opens and ask an employee to personally check to see if any are in stock. From our experiences with Apple Pencil, sometimes Apple’s retail stores have product that’s arrived but isn’t showing up in their in-store inventory system yet.

It doesn’t make sense for Apple to delay ‘release’ until they have made 15 million of something new, as that something new MAY (slight chance) fail due to low demand (I know, not likely, but may happen). So, they release as they are ramping up manufacturing, which creates a ‘stir’ which actually helps boost demand. Not a bad thing in my opinion.

And I’ve written my fair share about that as well. But I’ve never seen as complete a diagnosis as this tour de force essay. It examines the deepest motivations of Apple, it’s clash with the entertainment industry, its successes and failures, and how that has, in turn, affected software design and customer expectations. The new TV app for Apple TV shows what you’re currently watching, upcoming episodes, and suggestions. Here’s this week’s focus article at The Verge. “Apple’s new TV app shows how painfully behind it is.” That title is deceptively simple for an article that goes into so much detail and casts so much light on the challenges Apple faces. Here’s a particularly good paragraph which ends with a particularly insightful, stinging quote. Worse yet for Apple, it does not operate a streaming video service of its own and makes a set-top box that does nothing its competitors don’t already do, besides the robust games section of the App Store. It’s not for lack of trying. Apple has notoriously spent years trying to gain relevance in digital media, investing resources and countless failed software and hardware attempts to wrestle control away from content providers so it could offer its own solution. The TV app is just the latest potentially doomed attempt. That’s largely because it takes stellar ideas about how we should consume entertainment and smashes them against the immovable object that is the current video landscape. [Emphasis mine.] That TV App The recently released Apple TV app is the platform for this analysis. The article doesn’t even get into the headaches some customers have had, with the migration from the Videos app to the TV app, especially when they used a beta of iOS 10.2. The point made is one that’s a consensus in the community of observers. Without support for Netflix and Amazon Video, Apple’s TV app is confusing and disappointing. But Apple would rather, it seems, go out on a limb and ship the app, hoping they can work a deal with Netflix and Amazon later. Meanwhile, the customers and observers remain puzzled. What this splendid article doesn’t cover in any detail is the fallout when it comes to hardware design. What I mean is that when Apple works so hard to insinuate itself into and seize control of a segment of the industry, all product design must pass through the lens of Apple’s overall agenda. That wasn’t always so. That means that instead of “Fitting in and standing out,” Apple creates hardware and—more specifically—software that seeks to promote its own business goals. That’s in contrast to, say Roku, that simply builds delightful hardware that fits into the customer’s existing home entertainment system and adds identifiable value rather than frustration because of incomplete services. But not all is lost for Apple. Author Nick Statt continues. There is hope for Apple yet. The company is arguably the only player in a position to offer a democratic, holistic viewing experience that ties everything to a single source. Amazon, the company perhaps closest to that goal, makes both hardware and software. That means it tends to promote its own products over competitors’. Cable companies, too, are self-interested and prone to resisting change that could hurt their businesses. That means the products those companies produce, whether on-demand apps or live TV, are often ugly, hard to use, and rarely if ever play nice with others. My own perspective over the years has been that Apple should make the coolest hardware money can buy and focus on fitting in with the TV hardware industry, solving real connectivity, video and and audio issues. Once customers and videophiles declare that Apple is the only company we need in addition to a 4K/UHD/HDR TV, they they’ll have a lot more leverage. But that means a fanatic attention to the broad scope of home theater hardware and connectivity issues, so often tackled by other companies without Apple’s resources or UI/UX expertise. So far, Apple doesn’t want to go that route. The 4th generation Apple TV. Will it blend?   Some have said that Apple is playing the long game. That may be true. But if the price to pay is an on-going frustration with Apple’s mostly failed attempts to seize control, as it did with music, then one has to ask why Apple keeps beating its head against that immovable object. As Ken Segall has said, “it’s the [Apple] products that do the talking.” So far, Apple TV has been somewhat muted. Next page: The news debris for the week of December 12th.

Comcast and many other high speed ISPs are imposing data caps that will handicap the streaming of 4K video. Here in the Chicago area the Comcast data cap is now enforced as 1TB. Streaming 1080 P Netflix, Hulu and MLB TV during the summer months put my data usage at 600GB for one or two months each and I’m not a heavy streamer. I also have the Channels APP and watch local TV via my own digital HD Silicon Dust Hone Run Tuner and antenna. Just imagine if all three services were 4K plus using something like Sling TV or the Direct TV APP what my monthly Comcast bill would be? I would easily surpass the 1TB Comcast Data Cap The concern over Apple TV and 4K is more of a marketing concern vs. one of practicality as of late 2016. Comcast is now offering Xfinity Stream which there is NO Apple TV APP for. There is a IOS APP for Xfinity Stream so in order to get it to your TV via Apple TV you need to use Apple Airplay. Again Comcast offers no Apple TV APP. Xfinity Stream TV offers local TV Channels and basic cable in 1080P HD plus HBO for $18.00 a month with the Xfinity Stream Video not counting against the Comcast 1TB monthly data cap. So much for Net Neutrality during the current construct of the FCC. Just wait until next year! Monthly internet only fee is $79.00 a month for 70MB down, 10MB Up. If the 1TB data cap is blown after a few complimentary months. its $10 for each additional 50GB of data. Just trying to bring the 4K discussion back down to earth! December 16, 2016 at 7:24 EST PM John Q December 17, 2016 The music industry was reeling from Napster, and the rampant piracy of its product. It needed the iPod/iTunes and Apple to rescue its business by convincing people to pay for music again. Eventually, the industry came to regret to power Apple had amassed over music distribution via the iTunes Music Store. Jobs and the company could strong arm the music companies and artists into selling singles cheap, instead of expensive albums that only had a few good songs. But, it now appears that the music industry has at least pulled itself out of the ditch, by taking advantage of shifting consumption habits toward streaming. Listeners, it turns out, are willing to rent and not own music if they have access to large variety of it. Ironically, Apple didn’t see that coming, and was a late and reluctant player in the game. The company has been able to establish a decent position with Apple Music, given its established user base, but is not the top dog, nor the only dog in town. I suppose you could call it another misstep. The TV industry has never had the issues that the music industry had. It didn’t, and doesn’t need Apple as a savior, and is perfectly happy maintaining the status quo, with distribution through the cable systems that serve 80% of American households with TVs, with either programming and/or internet service. Vertical integration (NBC/Comcast) also has its advantages. Eddie Cue was a hard negotiator when Apple had the power, and Steve Jobs could come in and close the deal if needed. The TV guys can tell Cue to pound sand, and Jobs isn’t around to help any more. Jobs had respect in Hollywood, and they knew him through Pixar. Tim Cook isn’t able to persuade anyone with his non-existent RDF, or browbeat them if needed. Regardless, it’s sad when Apple’s new TV app can’t do what a third party app like WatchAid already does.

Eric Abent - Dec 16, 2016 8 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit With the Galaxy Note 7 soon to be well and truly dead, it’s time to turn our attention toward the Galaxy S8, Samsung’s next flagship device. We’re not likely to find out any official details until sometime in February at the earliest, but as always, the rumor mill has been churning and pumping out plenty of snippets in the meantime. What can we expect from the Galaxy S8? Here’s what the rumors thus far claim. Samsung Galaxy S8 specs On the inside, the Galaxy S8 is said to have a Snapdragon 835 processor running the show – or an octa-core Samsung Exynos X processor in some models. That could be working in tandem with as much as 6GB of RAM, with a 3,000mAh battery powering it all. Samsung may ultimately opt to go with a larger battery, depending on what kind of display we see on the phone (but more on that later). Expect to see fingerprint scanners and iris scanners make a return as well. Speaking of the Galaxy S8’s fingerprint scanner, two of the most recent reports are conflicting. One says that the incoming flagship could use an optical fingerprint scanner, while another claims that the fingerprint scanner will be moved around to the backside of the device. Depending on what Samsung chooses to do with the display, both seem to be reasonable reports. We’ve also heard that the Galaxy S8 might grow in size over the Galaxy S7 to make up for the fact that Samsung’s phablet offering for 2016 turned out to be a bust. Two models of the Galaxy S8 will be offered: one with a 5.7-inch display and another with a 6.2-inch display. With the standard Galaxy S7 sporting a 5.1-inch display and S7 Edge coming in at 5.5-inches, such an increase would be noticeable, and perhaps a turn off for those who lament this slow trend toward larger smartphones. However, talk of the display leads into our next section covering Galaxy S8 rumors, so let’s get into it. Samsung Galaxy S8 display Depending on which site is propagating the rumor, what you hear about the display will vary. Some say it will be a 4K AMOLED display, while more recently, we’ve been hearing that it will have a 2K display. Either way, the resolution we get with the Galaxy S8 will be suitable for both regular use and GearVR use. The resolution isn’t quite as important as claims of a borderless display. This has been one of the most persistent rumors since talk of the Galaxy S8 began, so it seems like Samsung will likely go this route. Why borderless? The iPhone 8 – which should get a reveal later in 2017 – is also rumored to go with a borderless display. Samsung may be looking to beat Apple to market with a borderless phone all its own in an attempt to snag some folks who felt underwhelmed by the iPhone 7 and don’t mind switching to Android. Even if Samsung isn’t looking to one-up Apple, rumors of a borderless display aren’t unfounded. As time goes on, bezels continue to shrink, as evidenced in a number of phones Samsung has already released. In the Galaxy S6 Edge and S7 Edge, for instance, the screen wraps around the left and right edges of the device. It stands to reason that Samsung is working toward a borderless display, but whether or not it will have one ready in time for the Galaxy S8 remains to be seen. Aside from the rumors of a bezel-free display, it seems safe to expect the screen on the Galaxy S8 to be similar to that of the Galaxy Note 7. This means that we can likely expect similar brightness options and color gamuts, along with features like the always-on display that featured in both the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy Note 7. Whatever Samsung does, expect the display to be top notch. The company is known for making excellent displays, and in a year where Samsung needs to both regain consumer confidence and possibly combat a no-holds-barred iPhone launch from Apple, it isn’t going to skimp in this area. Samsung Galaxy S8 camera Rumors claim that the Galaxy S8 could come with a dual rear-facing camera, challenging not only devices like the iPhone 7 Plus (and presumably the iPhone 8 Plus), but also LG’s V20 on the Android side of things. Hearing this makes a lot of sense, because with not only Apple but now other Android manufacturers going the dual camera route, Samsung will want to keep up with its competitors. Jumping over to the front of the device, we might be able to expect a front-facing camera with autofocus. That would be an interesting addition – front-facing cameras on smartphones don’t usually come equipped with autofocus in an effort to save space. The Galaxy S7 was a fair amount larger than its predecessors in terms of depth, so perhaps thinness isn’t something Samsung cares about so much in the Galaxy S8. Opting for a thicker phone could open the door to something like an autofocus front-facing camera. Samsung Galaxy S8 headphone jack As painful as it may be for some of you to imagine, we’ve heard rumors that claim Samsung may lift one of the most controversial things about the iPhone 7. A few reports have claimed that Samsung will remove the headphone jack in the Galaxy S8, pushing its users into an increasingly wireless future. It may not be a bad idea to start considering a Bluetooth headset if you haven’t already. If we somehow found ourselves in a timeline where Apple hadn’t dropped the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, that doesn’t necessarily mean it would remain on the Galaxy S8. There is already a precedent for removing the headphone jack in Android phones, so with manufacturers on both sides leaving the tried-and-true jack in the dust, Samsung may be tempted to do the same. If Samsung is looking to gain back the consumers it lost after the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, keeping the headphone jack may be a good start. Keep that in mind as more rumors hit in the coming weeks and months – Samsung is going to be very hesitant to do anything that might not sit well with consumers, because at the moment, the company and its phones don’t look very good. In other words, if there’s a case to be made for keeping the headphone jack, the Galaxy Note 7 and all of the headache it caused might be it. This is a particularly interesting rumor that could ultimately go either way, and as a result, I don’t think I’m willing to call it one way or another. Wrap-Up So there you have it: all of the stuff we’ve heard about the Galaxy S8 thus far. Obviously, don’t treat anything here as if it’s gospel, but expect at least some of it to come true when we learn about Samsung’s next flagship in early 2017. With Samsung looking to put the Galaxy Note 7 behind it as quickly as possible, we could be looking at an official reveal as early as February, so the Galaxy S8 might be just around the corner.

"The Maxforce" is the European Union team that ordered Ireland to collect billions of euros in back taxes from Apple, rattled the Irish government, and spurred changes to international tax law. You'd think it might have earned the name by applying maximum force while investigating alleged financial shenanigans. It didn't. It's just led by a guy named Max. A European Commission official gave the nickname to the Task Force on Tax Planning Practices in honor of its chief, Max Lienemeyer, a lanky, laid-back German attorney who rose to prominence vetting plans to shore up struggling banks during Europe's debt crisis. Since its launch in 2013, the Maxforce has looked at the tax status of hundreds of companies across Europe, including a deal Starbucks had in the Netherlands, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles's agreement with Luxembourg, and -- its largest case -- Apple in Ireland. Lienemeyer's team of 15 international civil servants pursued a three-year investigation stretching from the corridors of the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, to Ireland's Finance Ministry and on to Apple's leafy headquarters in Cupertino, California. Much of it outlined for the first time here, this story chronicles a growing clash between Europe and the U.S. and a shift in the EU's approach to the tax affairs of multinationals. The Maxforce concluded that Ireland allowed Apple to create stateless entities that effectively let it decide how much -- or how little -- tax it pays. The investigators say the company channelled profits from dozens of countries through two Ireland-based units. In a system at least tacitly endorsed by Irish authorities, earnings were split, with the vast majority attributed to a "head office" with no employees and no specific home base -- and therefore liable to no tax on any profits from sales outside Ireland. The US, meanwhile, didn't tax the units because they're incorporated in Ireland. In August the EU said Ireland had broken European law by giving Apple a sweetheart deal. It ordered the country to bill the iPhone maker a record 13 billion euros ($13.9 billion) in back taxes, plus interest, from 2003 to 2014. One example the Commission cites: In 2011, a unit called Apple Sales International recorded profits of about 16 billion euros from sales outside the U.S. But only 50 million euros were considered taxable in Ireland, leaving 15.95 billion euros of profit untaxed, the Commission says.

With the ruling, the EU is "retroactively changing the rules and choosing to disregard decades of Irish law," and its investigators don't understand the differences between European and US tax systems, Apple said in a Dec. 8 statement. Michael Noonan, Ireland's finance minister. Photo / Aidan Crawley Apple, which has some 6,000 workers in Ireland, says its Irish units paid the parent company a licensing fee to use the intellectual property in its products. The Irish companies didn't own the IP, so they don't owe tax on it in Ireland, Apple says, but the units will face a U.S. tax bill when they repatriate the profits. "This case has never been about how much tax Apple pays, it's about where our tax is paid," the company said. "We pay tax on everything we earn." Ireland on Nov. 9 appealed the Commission's ruling at the EU General Court in Luxembourg, arguing it has given Apple no special treatment. Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan has said he "profoundly disagrees" with the ruling and that Ireland strictly adheres to tax regulations. The government says Ireland has no right to tax non-resident companies for profits that come from activities outside the country. "Look at the small print" on an iPhone, Noonan said after the EU released its ruling in August. "It says designed in California, manufactured in China. That means any profits that accrued didn't accrue in Ireland, so I can't see why the tax liability is in Ireland." In the coming weeks, the EU is expected to publish details of the Maxforce investigation. At about the same time, Apple will likely lodge its own appeal in the EU court. Though Apple will have to pay its tax bill within weeks, the money will be held in escrow, and the issue will probably take years to be resolved. This case has never been about how much tax Apple pays, it's about where our tax is paid. Apple This story is based on interviews with dozens of officials from the EU, Ireland, and Apple, though most didn't want to speak on the record discussing sensitive tax matters. A Maxforce representative declined to make Lienemeyer available for an interview. Ireland's Office of Revenue Commissioners (the equivalent of the American Internal Revenue Service) says it can't comment on specific companies. Lienemeyer began assembling the Maxforce in late spring of 2013 with a mandate of scrutinising tax policies across Europe in search of any favouritism. Direct subsidies or tax breaks to court a specific company are illegal in the EU to prevent governments aiding national champions. His first hire -- the person who would oversee the Apple probe -- was Helena Malikova, a Slovak who had worked at Credit Suisse Group in Zurich. He quickly added Kamila Kaukiel, a Polish financial analyst who had been at KPMG, and Saskia Hendriks, a former tax policy adviser to the Dutch government. As the four initial members began their investigations, they got a head start from a US Senate probe of the tax strategies of American multinationals. The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said Apple shifted tens of billions of dollars in profit into stateless affiliates based in Ireland, where it secured a tax rate of less than 2 per cent. At 9:30 a.m. on May 21, 2013, senators gathered in Room 106 of the Dirksen Office Building. Included in the evidence presented that day was a 2004 letter from Tom Connor, an official at Ireland's tax authority, to Ernst & Young, Apple's tax adviser. Connor's question: A unit of the tech company hadn't filed a tax return; Was it still in business? E&Y responded two days later that the division was a non-resident holding company with no real sales. "There is nothing to return from the corporation tax standpoint," E&Y wrote. The Senate exhibits didn't include Connor's response if there ever was one. At the hearing, Arizona Republican John McCain castigated Apple as "one of the biggest tax avoiders in America." Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan peered over the glasses perched on the tip of his nose and said Apple uses "offshore tax strategies whose purpose is tax avoidance, pure and simple." Crucially, though, Levin told the crowded room that under US law, there was little the panel could do to force Apple to pay more tax. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook passionately defended the company's actions, telling the senators "We don't depend on tax gimmicks." The Senate revelations raised eyebrows at the Maxforce's office in Madou Tower, a 1960s high-rise in the rundown Saint-Josse neighborhood of Brussels. Three weeks after the Senate hearing, Lienemeyer's team asked Ireland for details of Apple's tax situation. The Irish tax authorities soon dispatched a representative carrying a briefcase filled with a bundle of bound pages. The Irish could have simply sent the material via e-mail, but they were cautious about sharing taxpayer's information with the EU and have a ground rule to avoid leaks: never send such documents electronically. While the Irish government remained bullish in its public statements, saying Apple hadn't received any favors, behind the scenes tensions were rising. Through the summer of 2013, the Finance Ministry assured government ministers that the EU investigation would amount to nothing, according to people familiar with the discussions. But those assertions seemed less confident than earlier communications. There was a sense that Apple had worked out its Irish tax position in a vastly different era, and no one remembered many details of the negotiations decades earlier In 1980, the four-year-old company -- the Apple III desktop had just been released -- created several Irish affiliates, each with a different function such as manufacturing or sales, according to the Senate report. Under Irish laws dating to the 1950s designed to shore up the moribund post-war economy, as a so-called export company Apple paid no taxes on overseas sales of products made in Ireland. To comply with European rules, Ireland finally ended its zero-tax policy in 1990. After that, Apple and Ireland agreed that the profit attributed to a key Ireland-based unit, the division discussed in Tom Connor's letter, be capped using a complex formula that in 1990 would have resulted in a taxable profit of $30 million to $40 million. An Apple tax adviser "confessed there was no scientific basis" for those figures, but that the amounts would be "of such magnitude that he hoped it would be seen as a bona-fide proposal," according to notes from a 1990 meeting with the Irish tax authority cited by the EU. The equation didn't change even as Apple began assembling the bulk of its products in Asia. There is nothing to return from the corporation tax standpoint. E&Y Ireland and Apple started to make changes a few months after the Maxforce began looking into their tax relationship. In October 2013, Finance Minister Noonan announced he would close the loophole that let stateless holding companies operate out of Ireland. The EU says Apple changed the structure of its Irish units in 2015. As the Maxforce stepped up its probe in June 2014, Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny was wooing potential investors in California. At a San Francisco event to promote Irish entrepreneurs, Governor Jerry Brown quipped that he had thought Apple "was a California company," but according to tax returns, "they're really an Irish company." News clips show Irish officials looking on stony-faced as the governor makes his jest. With Lienemeyer's team digging further into the issue, Apple's concern deepened. In January 2016, CEO Cook met with Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition chief -- and Lienemeyer's ultimate boss -- on the 10th-floor of the Berlaymont building, the institutional headquarters of the European Commission in Brussels. Vestager, a daughter of two Lutheran pastors, has a reputation for being even-handed but tough, cutting unemployment benefits while advocating strict new rules for banks when she served as Denmark's finance minister. While she has acknowledged that her team had little experience with tax rulings -- in a November interview with France's Society magazine, she said, "We learned on the job" -- Vestager says enforcement of EU rules on taxation is a matter of "fairness." Margrethe Vestager, competition commissioner of European Commission. Photo / Jasper Juinen In the meeting with Cook she quizzed him on the tax Apple paid in various jurisdictions worldwide. She told the Apple executives that "someone has to tax you," according to a person present at the meeting. In a Jan. 25 follow-up letter obtained by Bloomberg, Cook thanked Vestager for a "candid and constructive exchange of views," and reasserted that Apple's earnings are "subject to deferred taxation in the U.S. until those profits are repatriated." Subsequent correspondence became more heated. On March 14, Cook wrote to Vestager that he had "concerns about the fairness of these proceedings." The Commission had failed to explain fully the basis on which Apple was being investigated, and the body's approach was characterised by "inconsistency and ambiguity," Cook said. Apple contended that the EU had backtracked on a 2014 decision recognising that its two Irish subsidiaries were not technically resident in Ireland, and therefore only liable for taxes on profits derived from Irish sources. Now, Cook said, it seemed the Commission was intent on "imposing a massive, retroactive tax on Apple by attributing to the Irish branches all of Apple's global profits outside the Americas." "There is no inconsistency," an EU spokesman said in a Dec. 15 statement. Only a fraction of the profits of the subsidiaries were taxed in Ireland, the statement said. If you're paying a fair amount of tax then there is absolutely nothing to worry about. 50-year-old Dutchman Gert-Jan Koopman "As a result, the tax rulings enabled Apple to pay substantially less tax than other companies, which is illegal under EU state aid rules." Cook's entreaties did little to sway Vestager, and in August she phoned Noonan to tell him the results of the Maxforce investigation: The Commission was going to rule against Ireland. Late in the afternoon of Aug. 29, Irish officials began hinting to reporters that Apple's tax bill amounted to billions and "could be anything." At noon the following day, Vestager told a packed press conference in Brussels that the Commission had decided Apple owed Ireland 13 billion euros. Though that would be equivalent to 26 percent of the 2015 national budget, Ireland didn't want the windfall, saying the ruling was flawed because the country hadn't given Apple any special treatment. The decision sparked a political crisis as left-leaning members of Enda Kenny's fragile minority administration saw a potential bonanza for taxpayers that the world's richest company could well afford. Even as Noonan toured television studios vowing to appeal the decision, independent lawmakers demanded that Ireland take the money. Facing a potential revolt that could bring down the government, Kenny and Noonan eventually bowed to demands for a review of the country's corporate tax system. But they said they would fight the case, and on Sept. 7, Irish lawmakers overwhelmingly backed the motion for an appeal. Officials from Lienemeyer's team and other EU offices say they have gathered tax information on about 300 companies, looking for what they deem to be favourable treatment by governments across Europe. While they don't expect all of those to yield payoffs as hefty as that from their investigation of Ireland and Apple, they say a worrying number require the kind of maximum force that the Maxforce can apply. "We focus on outliers where you're looking at something that is off the radar screen," Lienemeyer's boss, 50-year-old Dutchman Gert-Jan Koopman, who is in charge of state-aid enforcement at the EU, said at a Brussels conference in November. "If you're paying a fair amount of tax then there is absolutely nothing to worry about."

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Dec 16, 2016 at 4:15PM Image source: Getty Images. The dawn of the artificial intelligence age has finally arrived. Though some regard this transformative technology in terms of job-taking robots or the Terminator, the reality is likely to be much more benign. In fact, creating more powerful computers than ever before is far more likely to unlock a new wave of economic growth, which is great news for tech investors today. There are plenty of publicly traded companies helping pioneer artificial intelligence. Let's look at three that are at the forefront of bringing artificial intelligence into our everyday lives: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Facebook The world's largest social network has been pushing the envelope in AI development in ways both theoretical and functional. In fact, Facebook has two separate AI departments -- one for academic research, and the other for infusing its products with AI to help grow profits. On the research side, there's Facebook AI Research, or FAIR, the academic wing of Facebook's AI efforts. Hiring heavily from academia, FAIR helps produce major breakthroughs in the field, though it's not yet clear how much of an impact Facebook's big-ticket research will have on its near- to medium-term future. In a more day-to-day sense, Facebook has been leveraging AI for some time to help fuel its growth. Facebook's AI helps parse our connections, the text we write in each post, and more to optimize the advertisements it serves us. The company has also created an interesting business using AIs chatbots and other apps -- over 33,000  at last count -- within its multiple sprawling messaging platforms. As with the remaining names on this list, Facebook's efforts in AI are still in their early phases, but the company has grand plans  for the technology in its future. Microsoft In most respects, Microsoft's AI efforts have yet to result in significant product innovations. Microsoft uses deep learning, neural nets, and the like to help feed and analyze data, and the results are manifesting themselves  in some of its products. For instance, Microsoft's Cortana uses AI to continually refine and improve its responses to user queries, and AI allows Skype to translate video conversations across seven popular languages. However, these efforts remain more incremental than transformational at this point. Microsoft remains active on the research front, including its work in neural networks, and is racking up some impressive results in the process. For example, Microsoft researchers recently won an internationally recognized computer image recognition competition by creating a neural network far larger than any other that academics had previously built, solving some thorny engineering problems along the way. Major breakthroughs will probably remain in the lab for the coming years, but the company is indeed vying for a prominent place in our AI-powered futures. Apple Secretive Apple doesn't get a lot of credit for its AI work, but now it's using PR to tout its own ambitions. Unlike Facebook and Microsoft, Apple has pursued a more product-centric strategy with its AI efforts. In fact, Apple uses AI to prevent fraud in the Apple Store, optimize iPhone battery life between charges, and figure out whether an Apple Watch user is exercising or doing something else, among other things. Since Apple lives and dies by the strength of its next product, its choice to notch AI wins in a host of understated ways makes perfect sense. Rather than focus as intently on creating the next transformative breakthrough in AI -- Apple's been less than forthcoming about its own research efforts -- Apple can use its army of iDevice owners to find useful ways to keep tweaking its devices for the better, while maintaining its strict user privacy standards. It only gets better from here When making virtual assistants "less dumb" is touted as a major innovation, it's easy to take a cynical view of AI as tech's latest passing fad. And it's true that the products in consumers' hands probably don't fit with how the public tends to think of AI. However, as with all major technologies, the incremental changes should add up to something significant over a long enough span. Given the resources and talent the tech companies have dedicated to this sector, it seems only a matter of time before AI earns a more prominent place in our daily lives.

Your Headphones May Be Spying On You by Marshall Honorof Nov 23, 2016, 8:56 AM AirPods Alternatives Picture 1 of 12 Apple's AirPods are wireless, provide one-touch access to Siri and automatically turn off when you take them out of your ear. And thanks to a special W1 wireless chip, they last 5 hours unplugged. Apple, of course, believes customers will flock to its $159 buds. Bus the AirPods aren't the only great wireless earphones for your iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus or other phone. Here are the most compelling alternatives from companies big and small. Bragi - The Headphone Picture 2 of 12 Like Apple's AirPods, the Bragi - The Headphone earbuds are diminutive and plug directly into your ears and come in three sizes -- small, medium, or large -- so they fit well. The earbuds communicate with your iPhone with help from Bluetooth 4 and come with a built-in microphone so you can make calls. Bragi earbuds can last up to six hours on a single charge during normal use and take less than 2 hours to fully recharge. The wireless earbuds cost $149 and are available now on pre-order. Samsung Gear IconX Picture 3 of 12 The Gear IconX are a good choice for athletes, featuring splash- and sweat-resistance. The Gear IconX includes a built-in fitness tracker and heart rate monitor and shares data to apps running on your smartphone. There's even a built-in 4GB music player that lets you transfer audio to them and listen to tracks whenever you want. Jabra Elite Sport Picture 4 of 12 As the name suggests, the Jabra Elite Sport is designed for athletes. The earbuds connect to devices via Bluetooth and can beam audio to your ears for up to 9 hours on a single charge. They're waterproof, which makes them good to use on a rainy day, and can work whether you're wearing one or both. The Jabra Elite Sport also features a digital microphone for placing calls. Doppler Labs Here One Earbuds Picture 5 of 12 The Here One earbuds will be available in March for $300, and they're unlike anything else we've seen yet. The Here One are wireless earbuds that also communicate with a connected app running on your iPhone. From within the app, you can adjust volume, filter out ambient sounds, and amplify speech. It even comes with a remix feature that lets you change audio on the fly. And, of course, the earbuds let you make calls with help from a built-in microphone. Sol Republic Amps Air Wireless Picture 6 of 12 If you're looking for fairly affordable Bluetooth earbuds, consider the Sol Republic Amps Air Wireless. The Sol Republic earbuds are sweat-resistant so you can use them while working out. They come with a charging case that can boost their battery life with help from USB, and you'll get up to 15 full charges before you need to recharge the case. However, the buds themselves last only up to 3 hours on a charge. Skybuds Picture 7 of 12 The Skybuds are among the more expensive AirPods alternatives, but they offer some unique features. They also come with passive noise cancellation and have three different tip sizes -- small, medium, and large -- to give you the best fit. They connect to your device via Bluetooth and near-field magnetic induction. You'll get 4 hours of listening time before you need to recharge the earbuds. The Skybuds also feature a digital microphone for calls. Motorola VerveOnes+ Picture 8 of 12 Motorola's VerveOnes+ are sweatproof and waterproof and deliver HD sound to both earpieces. Better yet, they can offer up to 12 hours of playtime. The VerveOnes+ feature dual mics and support both Siri and Google Now, so you can issue voice commands. They come with six ear gels so you can get the perfect fit. Onkyo W800BT Picture 9 of 12 Onkyo has one of the slickest wireless earbuds with its W800BTB. It comes with a built-in microphone for calls and its design helps it block out some ambient sound. However, you'll only get about 3 hours on a charge; the carrying case, which doubles as a charger, can power the earbuds five times before it needs to be recharged. Kanoa Wireless Earbuds Picture 10 of 12 Kanoa's Wireless Earbuds are a solid solution for athletes. The earbuds are splash resistant, dust resistant, and water resistant, making them fine companions for outdoor use. In addition, they offer up to 4 hours of battery life and two microphones for better calling. And you can click a button and activate several other features, including Augmented Audio and Intelligence Assistant, allowing you to get better sound. The Kanoa are available now on pre-order now and ship in the spring. Erato Apollo 7 Picture 11 of 12 Erato's Apollo 7 wireless earbuds weigh just 0.14 ounces, making them among the lightest earphones available. The earbuds work over Bluetooth 4.1 and are waterproof. They also work with Apple's Siri and Google Now and have a multi-function button that will let you power them on, take a call, skip tracks, and more. There's an omnidirectional microphone on board, too. Users report about 3 hours of battery life before they need to be recharged.

Share story By KIT EATON The New York Times   More than 4 million software programs are available in Apple and Google app stores, including games, productivity tools and weather apps. This year, only a few stood out. Some of these apps were exceptional; others were useful or funny or just well designed. Here are my picks for outstanding apps of 2016: • Nuzzel: Though Nuzzel was released in 2015, it gained more popularity this year as people realized how clever it was. The app is a news aggregator with a trick: It curates news items users may be interested in because their friends or followers on Facebook and Twitter have already read and shared them. I find Nuzzel’s home page is always worth scanning. More Tech Reviews Sci-fi fans can use these apps to tap into The Force Snapchat’s whimsically goofy Spectacles are worth the strange looks Wacky gifts for the tech-savvy person who has everything Digital delights you can put a bow on Use the web as a guide to finding true deals for Black Friday Highlight of Google’s Daydream VR is its hand controller The concern with a news app that relies on social curation is that it can create an echo chamber — users read only the news they prefer. But another option is to read news shared by friends of friends, which is a wider social network that will deliver more diverse news articles. While people should not rely on Nuzzel exclusively for news, this free iOS and Android app is worth checking out. • NPR One: This year, NPR added new features to its NPR One app, turning it from a popular radio-listening app into something broader. By connecting to audio content from other suppliers, including podcasts and locally sourced news programs, NPR One is now a one-stop shop for all sorts of fascinating audio. The app even recommends related stories after users listen to a radio segment, which can offer more about a particular topic or give a more-nuanced view about something in the news. “NPR One” has a clean and simple interface, and is free on iOS and Android. • Castro: The “Castro” app provides an elegant way to listen to podcasts and discover new ones. Designed like a news feed, the app shows popular charts so users can see what other people are listening to. On iOS 10, the app even integrates with Apple’s newly enhanced iMessage chat app so users can easily share podcasts directly inside iMessage. Elegant and powerful, Castro costs $4 for iOS devices. • Untappd: This beer-tracking app got a big upgrade in 2016, adding the ability to scan a bar code on a beer bottle so users can add its details to a log. It also lets people hail an Uber from inside the app so they can get to a particular bar or pub responsibly and safely. The Untappd app has always been great for craft-beer fans, letting aficionados keep track of beers. The app can recommend beers based on someone’s previous choices and includes a social angle to see where friends are and what they’re drinking. It’s free on iOS and Android, though the new Uber features haven’t arrived for Android users yet. • Pix: Microsoft’s Pix brings artificial intelligence to the smartphone camera. The app is essentially a smart camera assistant. It can adjust camera parameters while shooting a quick burst of photos, and then choose the best result to keep. In addition, there’s automatic image stabilization when using Pix to shoot video. Video can also be saved at a different speed than it was recorded. The free app is easy to use and is iOS-only. • Cheeky Fingers: This is my favorite kind of app — it does a single job very well, with excellent design and a sense of humor. The app is an assistant for those learning to play the piano. It’s a chord dictionary that contains everything a beginner needs to know about playing chords, using cute graphics that show fingers over a keyboard. It costs $3 on iOS and Android. • Super Stickman Golf 3: This is a cartoonlike golfing game for thwacking a ball around unlikely terrain, trying to avoid getting stuck to gooey walls, falling into sand traps and so on. It’s simple but fun and free on iOS and Android. • Pinout: This is a pinball game for iOS and Android devices that brings neon lights to the classic game, turning each table into something that looks like it’s out of the movie “Tron.” • Microsoft’s Solitaire: Who can resist this PC gaming classic? Now all sorts of variations can be played on iOS and Android. This app will eat away spare minutes, and it’s free.

Bottom Line The Apple Watch is the best smartwatch yet, but it's more of a luxury item than a replacement for your Timex. By Alex Colon Editors' Note: The Apple Watch Series 1 is physically identical to the original Apple Watch but has a lower price, an updated S1P dual-core processor, and ships with watchOS 3. Our review of the original Apple Watch, from April 2015, is below. //Compare Similar Products Compare Pebble Steel Smartwatch   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Motorola Moto 360   %displayPrice%%seller% see it LG G Watch R   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Sony SmartWatch 3   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Pebble Smartwatch   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Do you really need a smartwatch? Up until seven months ago, that's a question I was fully expecting Apple to answer. After all, the company is best at coming into a fairly nascent category and showing users exactly why they need to have something. Just take a look at the iPhone. Sure, smartphones were creating some buzz back in 2007, and plenty of people were already hooked on BlackBerry, but the iPhone is arguably the first smartphone that I, like many people, saw as a must-have device. I didn't get that feeling when the Apple Watch was announced last September. And I still don't have it after wearing one for the last five days. Don't get me wrong: Right now, the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch there is, hands-down. And it's easily Apple's most ambitious new product since the iPhone. It's almost certain to improve with time, as Apple has already managed to attract an impressive lineup of third-party app developers. Even in its current state, the Apple Watch does more than any other smartwatch on the market. It can deliver all of the notifications from your iPhone to your wrist, so you'll never miss anything important. With your phone connected, you can make calls through the watch itself, and Apple has added some new methods of communication, including the ability to send taps, sketches, and even your heartbeat. The Apple Watch can tell you when to turn right when you're walking down the street, or hail a cab with the tap of a button. If you grew up on a steady diet of Dick Tracy and Inspector Gadget like I did, you're definitely going to like it. But the Apple Watch isn't perfect. For starters, it's expensive; the 42mm stainless steel model with Milanese Loop I tested costs $699. You also have to charge it every night, which is a bummer. And without your iPhone nearby, there really isn't a ton the watch can do. So while the Apple Watch is the most advanced, polished, and intriguing smartwatch to hit the market, it's not exactly a must-have. Models, Pricing, and Compatibility Getting an Apple Watch isn't as simple as showing up at an Apple store and walking out with a watch. For starters, you can't actually buy a watch at every Apple store. Instead, you can check out the various models available, and schedule an appointment to try them on. And there are plenty of models to choose from. The least expensive model, the Apple Watch Sport, starts at $349 for a 38mm version, and goes up to $399 for a 42mm version. It comes in either a silver or space gray anodized aluminum case, along with interchangeable rubber sport bands in various colors. The next step up is just called Apple Watch, and starts at $549 for a 38mm version with a sport band, and goes all the way up to $1,099 for a 42mm model with a stainless steel link bracelet. This model has a stainless steel case and a sapphire crystal display. On the super-high-end of the spectrum is the Apple Watch Edition, which starts at $10,000 for a 38mm gold model, and rises as high as a $17,000 for a 38mm watch with a 'Modern Buckle.' This model comes with a custom leather box with a built-in inductive charger. View All 16 Photos in Gallery I've seen all of the models in person, and for the price, I'd say that the standard Apple Watch is the sweet spot. I'm not in love with the sport band, and I'm also not willing to spend as much on a new watch as I could for a new car. But buying this model means you're dropping at least $549, and even then you're stuck with a sport band. The 42mm model with Milanese Loop I reviewed costs $699, or the equivalent of seven watches from Pebble. That's enough Pebbles for an entire family—a large family. Even the fancier $200 Pebble Steel seems like a bargain in comparison. With this sort of pricing, it's clear that Apple itself considers the watch a luxury item, and I wonder how this investment will stand the test of time like, say, a Rolex. After all, there will presumably be a new Apple Watch model available in a year or two. What will that mean for anyone stuck with an outdated $17,000 Apple Watch Edition? Sure, you might be able to reuse the band, but the face alone essentially costs $10,000. I should also mention that you can't use an Apple Watch unless you also own an iPhone. Because the watch hooks into your smartphone (via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) for pretty much everything, you'll need to make sure your phone is within close reach at all times. The watch is compatible with the iPhone 5 or later, so you can use it with the 5, the iPhone 5c, the iPhone 5s, the iPhone 6, and the iPhone 6 Plus. It doesn't work with the iPad. Design Pricing aside, the Apple Watch is certainly one of the better-looking smartwatches on the market. As someone that's worn a traditional Timex watch daily for the last 10-or-so years, I was hoping for a round display. But as we've learned from Android Wear watches like the Moto 360, a round form factor doesn't necessarily lend itself well to modern smartwatch functionality. As mentioned earlier, I reviewed the 42mm Apple Watch model. The face measures 1.65 by 1.41 by 0.41 inches and weighs 1.76 ounces. The Milanese Loop band weighs an additional 1.44 ounces. It didn't feel heavy on my wrist, which can be credited in part to the terrific design of the Milanese Loop. Not only does it have one of the more handsome, classic designs of the available options, it features a magnetic closure that makes it incredible easy to get a secure fit. Though, the watch looks a little chunkier on my wrist than I expected. No matter which model you choose, there are two physical buttons on the Apple Watch, which can be found on the right side. The top button is called the Digital Crown, which is your primary control for navigating around the watch interface. Press it once to see the watch face, or twice to see your Home screen, which is where all of the apps are. Rolling your finger over the Crown also controls a number of functions, including zoom, scroll, and data input, depending on what you're looking at. Although the Digital Crown is versatile and responsive, I found it a little difficult to master with my fingers, which are admittedly about as large and as dexterous as Vienna sausages. Without even thinking about it, I shied away from using the Crown, and defaulted to manipulating things directly on the touch screen whenever possible. There's another, smaller button below the Digital Crown, simply called the Side Button. When the screen is on, pressing this button once will pull up your favorite contacts. Pressing it twice will activate Apple Pay. You can also navigate your way around the watch using what Apple calls Force Touch, which basically means you can just press down hard on the display. The watch uses electrodes to distinguish between a quick tap and a longer press, so pressing firmly on the screen often brings up an additional set of controls depending on what app you're in. If you're just on the watch face, for instance, pressing down will allow you to cycle through the various faces available. When sending an emoji, Force Touch can turn the wide range of default happy yellow faces into angry red ones. And speaking of the display, it's terrific. The 42mm model features 390-by-312-pixel resolution, which works out to just over 300 pixels per inch. It's sharp and bright, and I had no trouble seeing it outdoors. I left it at the default mid-brightness setting for most of my testing, so I could get an accurate representation of battery life—more on that in a bit. All models of the Apple Watch are splash- and water-resistant, but not fully waterproof. That means you can get the watch wet without worry, though it shouldn't be submerged for an extended period of time. I wore it to the gym for a pretty intense spin class, and later to a bar where someone (not me, I swear) spilled a beer on it, and it kept right on ticking, so to speak. Specs, Sensors, and Battery Life The Apple Watch is powered by Apple's custom-designed S1 system on a chip (SoC). It's difficult to benchmark this in any appreciable manner, but suffice to say that it feels fast and capable for most tasks. I noticed some slight lag in opening apps, but that appears to be more about the phone-to-watch connection. I also experienced the occasional stutter in some local apps, but nothing noticeable enough to cause concern. Of course, it isn't enough to just slap a chip in a watch and call it a day, and to that end Apple has added a number of sensors that provide you with many of the features you'd expect to find in a fitness tracker. The back of the watch face, for instance, is home to a heart rate sensor. It uses a combination of infrared and visible-light LEDs along with photodiodes to detect your heart rate. It does this automatically during workouts, and when you tap on the Heart Rate Glance app. It was accurate in my testing, delivering results comparable with the Basis Peak. That's important, because not every fitness tracker has the ability to measure heart rate. The watch is also equipped with GPS and an accelerometer. Well, it doesn't have built-in GPS, exactly. Instead, it uses the GPS in your iPhone to measure the distance you travel throughout the day or during your workouts, to deliver more accurate information than just steps. The accelerometer, meanwhile, measures your total body movements, counts steps, and helps calculate the amount of calories you burn over the course of the day. I'll touch on fitness more later, but in general, the Apple Watch is a viable alternative to many fitness trackers on the market, which helps make the high price just a little bit easier to swallow. What makes it a little bit more difficult, however, is battery life. Apple rates battery life at up to 18 hours. That means you'll need to charge it every night, just like your iPhone. Of course, battery life heavily depends on what you do with the watch. As just a timepiece, it can last up to 48 hours. For working out or audio playback, however, battery life falls to 6.5 hours. And if you're going to field phone calls, you've only got 3 hours to do so. I didn't have trouble making it from morning to night on a single charge, but there's no way you can get through the next day without a charge overnight. The battery life problem isn't just limited to the Apple Watch. Most Android Wear devices can't make it through more than one day, either. One of the only smartwatches with acceptable battery life right now is the Pebble, which can last up to a week on a single charge. But the Pebble uses a black-and-white E Ink screen, and isn't nearly as interactive as the Apple Watch. Apple attempts to smooth over the battery issue by including a magnetic inductive charging cable. All you have to rest the back of the watch on top of the cable to start charging, which is a lot easier than the cumbersome cradles used by many Android Wear watches. Setup and Range We have a handy primer on how to get the Apple Watch up and running, but setup, in general, is fairly simple. First you need to make sure your iPhone is running the latest available version of iOS. Starting with iOS 8.2, Apple added a non-removable Apple Watch app to the operating system. It defaults to placement on your home screen, along with the rest of Apple's apps, but you might need to poke around in your folders in case you hid it a few weeks back. First, make sure Bluetooth is activated on your phone. The watch is automatically set to pairing mode when you turn it on, and all you have to do is follow the directions on the app, place the watch face within view of your phone's camera, and you're paired. You'll then be walked through some settings screens, and before you know it, you'll be staring at the clock face of your watch, wondering what to do next. I'm a little surprised that there isn't much in the way of an on-board tutorial on the watch itself, since there are so many ways to interact with it. You can find these in the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, under the Explore section at the bottom of the screen. As mentioned above, the Apple Watch connects to your phone via Bluetooth 4.0, which generally gives you a connection range of up to 100 feet. The watch also supports 802.11b/g Wi-Fi, to extend the connection farther when your phone is connected to Wi-Fi. Without a connected phone in range, the Apple Watch can still tell time, track workouts, and play back locally stored content. But you'll miss out on messages, notifications, and apps that require a connection to the Internet. Interface You'll spend most of your time with the Apple Watch on one of two screens: the watch face and the home screen. The watch face is self-explanatory, and out of the box, Apple provides 10 handsome choices from which to choose (OK, maybe not the Mickey Mouse one). They're surprisingly customizable, allowing you to change things like the type of information displayed (activity, battery life, date, weather, world clock, and more), as well as superficial details like color. The home screen is where you'll find all of your apps. They're laid out in a cluster across a black background, as if they are floating in space. You can drag your finger around the screen to see all of the apps in the corners, and you can zoom in using the Digital Crown. I was able to see all of the apps just fine, but the icons are extremely tiny. I found it helpful to zoom in as closely as I could using the Digital Crown (zoom too far and you'll open up whatever app is in the center of the screen), then navigated around using my index finger. Luckily, touch response is very accurate, and I was almost always able to open the app I wanted (rather than the one right next to it) by simply tapping on it. Overall, the interface here is a vast improvement over Android Wear. I've been testing Android Wear devices for about a year now, and I'm still not sure what's going to happen when I tap on the screen. The Apple Watch, on the other hand, is far more intuitive. Once you remember what the side buttons are used for, and the various swipes and taps, they become second nature. That said, it took a few days to get there. Because different actions have different effects on different screens, I occasionally forgot about using some of them entirely. If you ever get totally confused, you can always just trigger Siri. Simply hold down the Digital Crown, and you'll get a screen on the watch that asks, "What can I help you with?" I haven't used Siri on my iPhone in a while, and I was impressed by just how capable the voice assistant has become. I was able to open apps, search maps, and schedule appointments on my calendar, all without Siri ever missing a beat. Notifications Perhaps the most useful feature of the Apple Watch is its ability to deliver notifications from your iPhone straight to your wrist. When I'm at home, for instance, I don't have my phone on me at all times. But my apartment is small enough that, no matter where my phone is, the watch remains connected at all times. This means I could see text messages while washing the dishes, Facebook group messages while folding laundry, and I got a call from my mom while vacuuming. Sure, none of these were instances where something couldn't wait a few minutes until I saw a notification on my phone (sorry, mom), but I can see this coming in handy for business users that want to always be connected. Looking at your phone during a meeting can be rude, but glancing at your watch is definitely more discreet. You'll know you've received a notification in one of two ways. The first is through audible alerts, which I immediately turned off. The second is through what Apple calls the Taptic Engine, which is really just another term for haptic feedback. In other words, the watch gently vibrates whenever you receive an alert or a notification (and also when you press down on the display). It feels a bit too gentle at first, but once I got used to it, I found it to be just the right amount of force. I like that you don't receive notifications on the watch when you're using your phone, which would be redundant. I never missed a notification while wearing the Apple Watch. Messaging and Phone Calls The Apple Watch is much better for receiving messages than it is for sending them. I enjoyed feeling a buzz from the watch, then scrolling through an incoming text. Writing back, however, usually didn't happen until I was able to pull my phone out. The Apple Watch has a number of canned responses you can reply with ("OK," "Thank you," "Text you in a bit," and so on). You can also add customized responses of your own, but while testing, I didn't have a single experience where a pre-written message would fit. You can't type messages out on the watch. You can dictate a message by voice, which worked very well, but I never found this to be a practical solution. So instead, I would read a message on the watch, then pull out my phone to reply. It's fine if you're waiting for an incoming message, but it never really saved me from reaching into my pocket. If you're messaging another Apple Watch user, you get a few additional communication options you can access right from the watch. You can send your heartbeat, which is rather unique. The watch reads it through your wrist, and delivers it to someone else in the form of haptic feedback. Or you can send a sketch by dragging your finger across the display. Or, like a Facebook Poke brought to life, you can simply tap a few times on the face of the watch and send that. Each of these options are fun, but ultimately, gimmicky. I was surprised by how much I liked using the Apple Watch for phone calls. I often use speaker phone at home, just so that I can carry on a conversation and still be able move around my apartment. But that can be limiting, especially if you want to move from one room to another. Taking calls through the watch, however, was completely seamless, and I was able to come and go as I pleased without losing connection. Better yet, I could hold my wrist wherever I wanted, and the call was still perfectly audible on both sides. I took a phone call while I was making dinner, and not once did I need to juggle phone placements in my tiny kitchen. Also, if you live somewhere with poor reception, it means you can leave the phone in an area where you get a good signal, then make a call elsewhere through the watch. Apple Watch App Ironically, the one place you'll be spending a lot of time while using the Apple Watch is your iPhone. That's because you'll be using the Apple Watch app, which gives you a much greater degree of control over the watch functions and settings than you can get on the watch itself. There are four different menus in the app, which can be accessed by tapping on one of the icons located at the bottom of the screen: My Watch, Explore, Featured, and Search. Explore is a series of videos about using the watch, which is a helpful place to start for beginners. It shows you everything from customizing your watch face to using Siri. Featured is basically the Apple Watch app store. It's simple and fun to browse through, especially in the beginning, when you're trying to figure out exactly what the watch can do. Search is just a blank screen where you can type in the name of an app you're looking for, or a keyword if it's just a type of app in general. I'll discuss apps in more detail in the next section. My Watch is basically the control center for what you see on your wrist. You can easily modify the app layout you see on the home screen, thanks to a mirrored version of the screen that appears on your phone. You can also control Glances, which are the screens you see when you swipe your finger up on the watch face. The default glances include a calendar, music, weather, stocks, battery, heart rate, and a few others, but you can pick and choose which ones you want to keep, as well as add any additional screens from third-party apps. The watch is extremely customizable, which is somewhat surprising for Apple, which tends to control the user experience more closely than other manufacturers. You can also adjust things like screen brightness, text size, sounds, and haptic feedback. And if you want to store music locally on the watch, you can use the app to sync a playlist from your phone's music app. You can decide the maximum amount of songs you want to sync, or the maximum amount of storage, which maxes out at either 250 songs or 2.0GB (the watch comes with 6.2GB of available storage out of the box). Since you can use the watch as a remote to control the music on your phone, syncing audio files is primarily for when your phone won't be nearby, like if you leave it at home when you go for a run, or in the locker room at the gym. It works the same way for photos. Third-Party Apps Just like the iPhone and the iPad, the Apple Watch has the best third-party apps available, without question. The watch hasn't even been available for a full week at the time of this writing, and already the app selection eclipses both Android Wear and Pebble, which have collectively had years with which to attract developers. When setting up my watch, I chose for it to install all of the compatible apps on my iPhone. This provided me with sixteen apps right off the bat, including Philips Hue, Instagram, The New York Times, Seamless, Twitter, and Uber. That's impressive. Of course, some of these apps are more useful than others. The New York Times app gives you a brief rundown of five to six top headlines, which I liked to cycle through on my morning commute. Uber lets you hail a car with just one tap on the display, and the Philips Hue app lets you control connected lighting throughout your home, which I found handy. But Seamless just lets you place reorders of recent food deliveries, which is only helpful if you always order the same thing. And weight loss app Lose It! lets you see how many calories you have left for the day, but doesn't let you log anything new. For that you'll need to pull out your phone. I also ran into problems with the Twitter app, which occasionally wouldn't load any tweets during testing. Still, many of these apps will gain functionality and grow more refined over time. And the sheer breadth of quality content currently available is unmatched by any other smartwatch ecosystem. Aside from the names I mentioned, other heavy hitters include Evernote, MLB At Bat, Pandora, TripAdvisor, and Yelp. If you're looking for third-party apps, the Apple Watch is the smartwatch to get. Apple's own apps are also worth mentioning. Passbook let you keep boarding passes, loyalty cards, and tickets on the watch. Apple Pay lets you use the watch to make in-store purchases without needing to reach for your phone or wallet. And Maps can give you turn-by-turn navigation, complete with a tap on the wrist when it's time to turn. I had no trouble using any of these features, and Apple Pay in particular seems like something that could become useful on a daily basis (provided your local coffee shop accepts it). Fitness Tracking In addition to the titles mentioned above, two other apps you're likely to put to good use are Activity and Work Out. Activity is an attractive app that uses three different circles to show your daily activity progress. The app tracks three categories: Move, Exercise, and Stand. It's a good way to get a glance at your overall activity at any point in the day, and I liked keeping a small Activity icon the watch face itself, so I only needed to open the app when I wanted a deeper dig. When you use Activity, it automatically downloads a companion app to your phone, which can be used for an even more detailed breakdown of your progress. Each category shows your level of activity on an hourly basis, and provides information like the amount of calories you burned and your total active time for the day. You can set goals for yourself and unlock achievements, which I found encouraging when I took the watch for a trip to the gym. And if you haven't moved in a while, the watch sends a notification reminding you to stand up once an hour (which you can turn off if it becomes annoying). The Work Out app allows you to record and analyze a number of different activities, including indoor and outdoor walk, run, or cycle, as well as elliptical trainer, rower, and stair stepper workouts. You can then set a target for the time, distance, or amount of calories you want to burn, and the watch will vibrate to let you know when your goal has been reached. You can also just start working out without a goal, and the watch will record your progress in each of those categories. The built-in heart rate monitor kicks in automatically during workouts, which provides another layer of detail through which you can assess your progress. The Apple Watch isn't exactly a competitor with dedicated fitness trackers like the Fitbit Surge or the Basis Peak. Both of those devices will still provide you with more detailed information about your daily fitness regimen. But the Apple Watch certainly provides enough to make most casual users happy, myself included. Conclusions I definitely enjoyed my time with the Apple Watch, but I still don't think it's a replacement for my trusty old Timex. After all, the $699 model of the watch I reviewed is the same version I would want to buy, and I just can't see myself spending that much for what is essentially a very cool iPhone accessory. The Apple Watch occupies the high end of the smartwatch space, along with some Android Wear devices like the $299 LG G Watch R. We don't have an Editors' Choice in this price range yet, as we're still waiting for a device that can justify its high price tag with truly essential features and functionality. On the lower end of the spectrum, we've given Editors' Choice awards to the Pebble and the Pebble Steel. Neither of these watches are must-have devices, but they also aren't priced like it. Still, the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch available, and that certainly counts for something. The amount of third-party content already available is impressive, and in a year from now, when more app developers figure out what to do with it, the experience will only be better. So while I'm not sure quite how well the watch will hold up as a high-end fashion investment, from a technology standpoint, it's a pretty safe bet. While I was expecting Apple to deliver the world's first must-have smartwatch, the truth is, you don't need the Apple Watch. Yes, you'll still probably want to have it, and you'll likely be happy if you buy it. For a first-generation device from one of the largest companies in the world, that's a good start.

Apple has added about twenty new clips of famous landmarks and places, including Dubai skyscrapers, Greenland snowscapes and the Liwa desert. All the new videos linked below … In addition to the 34 clips that have been in the rotation since the launch of tvOS, Apple has added a myriad of new cities and countries — with breathtaking videography of Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Greenland, Dubai, and three new videos of Chinese landmarks. Los Angeles is included in four clips; three day videos (1, 2, 3) and one at night (1). For Dubai, there are four new day videos (1, 2, 3, 4) and two night videos (1, 2). Greenland’s snowy vistas are featured in two day clips (1, 2) and one night scene (1). Hong Kong has three new day clips (1, 2, 3) and one night clip (1).

Three new scenes from China have also been added. With the exception of Liwa and China, all of the new locations include both day and night scenery. tvOS downloads new screensaver footage on a cyclical basis according to whichever schedule you have set, so users may not see the new screensavers for a while, depending on their download schedule; users can view all of the screensavers at iDownloadBlog, which discovered the new entries and has published a list of links to stream the footage directly from Apple’s servers. Comments All very pretty and scenic. Would've been bold to have included some that documented the effects of climate change, especially the China ones, or drought stricken acreage in southern and northern California. Given what's going on with the White House in January, it could have been an opportunity for a sort of subtle bipartisan documentary without commentary.

Set to Expand in Indonesia Will the iPhone maker still end up missing out? Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Dec 16, 2016 at 2:38PM iPhone 7 is about to go on sale in Indonesia. Image source: Apple. It may not be the most exciting smartphone market in the world, but every little bit helps when you're trying to squeeze out growth in any way, shape, or form. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is now set to expand into Indonesia, after committing to a $44 million investment to open a new research and development (R&D) center in the region over the next few years, according to Reuters. Starting next year, Indonesia will implement a rule that requires all 4G smartphones to include at least 30% of local content, but that requirement can be satisfied in a few ways. It can be hardware, software, or investments. With Apple's supply chain deeply entrenched in other regions, the Mac maker went with the latter route, and recently earned a "local content certification," according to the report. The local sourcing requirement is similar to a law in India, except that India's requirement pertains primarily to hardware components. Apple is unable to meet the requirement as is, despite its best efforts to be exempt under an exception for "state of the art" products. Apple still has a lot of work to do in order to crack India, which promises to be a massive smartphone market in the years ahead. Last month, Indonesian government officials announced that Apple would be opening an R&D center in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta in 2017. That's just the latest in a string of R&D centers that the company is setting up across Asia. This is Samsung turf Again, this isn't a particularly big market at the moment. There were roughly 55 million smartphone users in Indonesia in 2015, and quarterly unit sales are typically in the single-digit millions, according to eMarketer. However, eMarketer expects the smartphone user base to jump to approximately 92 million by 2019, so there's definitely some growth potential for the Indonesian smartphone market, which is already the third-largest in the Asia-Pacific region behind China and India. The Indonesian smartphone market is still immature in many ways. Network infrastructure remains an ongoing development, and wider network access will help boost adoption. Smartphone penetration is estimated at around 47%, according to GSMA Intelligence. In Mary Meeker's 2016 Internet Trends report, Indonesia falls into a group of countries that have medium to high barriers to broader internet adoption due to challenges around incentives and infrastructure, combined with mixed demographic trends. Affordability has been a key driver of smartphone adoption, which is obviously a hurdle for Apple given its premium positioning. The average retail price of a smartphone in Indonesia in 2014 was just $212, per Meeker's estimates. GDP per capita in 2015 was only about $3,300. IDC released market share estimates for Indonesia just this morning, pegging Samsung as the market leader with 32% market share. China-based OPPO came in No. 2 with 17% share, followed by ASUS with 8%. The market researcher notes that most of the growth is coming from the $250-to-$300 price segment of the market, although entry-level handsets in the $100-to-$200 range are still the core part of the market. Note that Apple doesn't directly participate in either of those market segments. There is some definite opportunity here as the market develops, and a wide range of companies are evaluating ways to comply with the local content regulation, which will likely spur continued growth. The risk is that Apple still ends up missing out by pricing itself out. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Many of us like to give new products a chance, but the majority of consumers tend to stick to brands already well known. Apple TV was a streaming media player before the term was commonly used, and the 1st generation model produced from 2007 to 2010 actually came with a 40GB or 160GB hard drive to store content. Later models focused only on streaming though, and so moved the trend in media boxes to require an internet connection to temporarily cache video and audio streams rather than storing permanently. Personally, I like to avoid using the term set-top boxes to describe these smaller boxes. In a traditional meaning, a set-top box has a connection to a television service or over-the-air signal. A streaming media player, on the other hand, doesn’t require you have TV service. And although your channel choices expand with a pay TV subscription, you only need internet service to watch a lot of the content on a streaming media player. But those are just the boxes. We’d be missing something if we didn’t mention streaming sticks in this article. There are only two models in the US market that’ll we’ll consider: the Roku Streaming Stick and Google’s Chromecast. The lightweight, dongle-sized devices are extremely practical to install — just plug them into your HDMI input for video/audio and USB port for power and you’ve got no long cables to deal with. Most of these streaming media players are moderately priced below $100, and all give you the most popular streaming video and audio services such as Netflix, Hulu Plus and Pandora. Without further introduction, here are ten streaming media players to consider. 1. Amazon Fire TV Just released in April, Amazon’s Fire TV is ahead of all competitors in terms of processing power, memory, storage, and the ability to expand gaming with the Amazon Fire Game Controller. Fire TV houses a Qualcomm Krait 300 quad-core processor running at 1.7 GHz and a Qualcomm Adreno 320 GPU for graphics processing. The device comes with 2GB RAM and 8GB Flash storage. Second screen capabilities are available to Kindle Fire owners, and a remote control includes a microphone for voice search. The device supports 1080p video and Certified Dolby Digital Plus with 7.1 channel audio. Where the Fire TV falls short upon release are content channels, which aren’t as many as Roku and Apple TV offer, most notably the lack of HBO Go. The Fire TV costs $99, and $39 more for the game controller. 2. Roku 3 Roku has several current models including the Roku 1 and Roku 2, but their flagship Roku 3 is what we’ll focus on here. The Roku 3 is best comparable to Apple TV with regard to storage and memory. But Roku has many more channels to choose from, boasting over 1,000 different choices. The remote control for the Roku 3 has integrated motion technology for gaming (unlike the lower-tier models), and features a headphone jack for late night viewing when you don’t want to disturb anyone. The Roku 3 supports up to 1080p video and Dolby Digital 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound pass through HDMI. $99 bucks get you a Roku 3 with remote control. 3. Apple TV You might call Apple TV a great uncle to other streaming media players out there. But the device is hardly irrelevant among its newer competitors. In fact, Apple recently announced the company has sold 20 million Apple TV boxes through this year’s second quarter. Although Apple seems a bit more selective of the channels it allows on Apple TV (as opposed to Roku), there are plenty of big time networks including HBO Go, Disney Channel, Watch ABC, and A&E. (Take note Apple, that we’re anxiously awaiting Showtime Anytime.) Apple TV has a single-core A5 chip processor, 512MB RAM memory, and 8GB storage. Maximum video resolution supported is 1920 x 1080p (H.264) with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound for audio. And, the streaming media box comes with a nicely designed remote control. Like the Fire TV and Roku 3, the Apple TV will cost you $99. 4. Chromecast Google’s Chromecast is a simple-to-use dongle that plugs into your TV’s HDMI port for video/audio and USB or wall outlet for power. The device requires you use a mobile device (both Android and iOS supported) or Chrome on a Mac or PC as the remote control. Supported apps include Netflix, HBO Go, Hulu Plus, and MLB.TV Premium among the 17 channels listed on the product’s web page. Although, a recent announcement with PlayOn will provide Chromecast users with over 100 more channels from the premium service that costs $29.99 per year. The device supports up to 1080p video and digital audio surround sound pass through. Chromecast is the cheapest streaming device among the bunch, selling for a meager $35. 5. Roku Streaming Stick The Roku Streaming Stick (model #3500) is a direct competitor to Chromecast that hit the market about 6 months after Google’s product (although Roku released earlier 3400 and 3420 MHL models in 2012). Easy to install and discreet, the Roku 3500 is an HDMI dongle that draws power from either a USB connection or wall adapter. The stick gives you all the channels Roku has available, supports 1080p video, lets you cast videos from Netflix and YouTube apps to your TV via mobile phone and tablet, and use your Android or iOS mobile device as a remote control with supporting apps. The Roku Streaming Stick also comes with a standard remote with RF technology (so you don’t have to point directly at the device). Priced a bit higher than Chromecast at $49.99, the Streaming Stick will give you hundreds more channels than Chromecast and comes with the remote control.

Reply Jeff on Would liked to have at least a passing mention of any ability to play local media files Reply Prabhakar Vangala on Try NVidia Shield. It does it all including playing local media (attached directly or on the local network). You will have to use an app like Kodi to best utilize the Shield’s capabilities for playing local media. I think it’s the next best thing to a dedicated HTPC. Reply Randy Bobandy on How are there no options for streaming media players that have 3.5mm or rca audio out ports and an ethernet connection? Anyone with a simple 2.1 speaker system without an optical port is simply screwed. Reply Christen Costa on Hey Randy, the solution is to run the audio to your TV and then out of your TV into your stereo. The thought here is that anyone using one of these players will have to have a compatible television. Reply FORREST OLNEY on NVIDIA SHIELD HAS IT ALL AND MUCH MORE. Reply Prabhakar Vangala on I agree. It’s easily the best of all that I have used – Roku 3, WD TV Live, Amazon Firestick, XBox One, PS3 etc. Some apps that buffer on other media players run smoothly on the Shield. It also streams local network media flawlessly via Kodi. Shield really shines where many other media players have difficulty accessing (or playing smoothly) the huge collection of local media on my network. Reply gavincredible on Thanks for the article.

CBS News Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Apple has named CBS News’ Apple TV app for tvOS one of the App Store’s best apps of 2016 — the only news channel to make the list for the U.S. Each year, the App Store releases its list of the most innovative apps and games apps for all platforms, from the iPhone to the Apple Watch to Apple TV. “Our Apple TV app represents the future of how viewers will consume and interact with video,” Christy Tanner, senior vice president and general manager of CBS News Digital, said back when the app was introduced in July. “We are taking advantage of the platform’s cutting-edge, interactive technology to offer a customizable experience.” The CBS News app features an interface that spotlights CBSN’s original streaming news coverage and curated video playlists. Beyond that, Apple TV (4th generation) is interactive in that users can tell Siri, “Watch CBS News” to launch the app and start CBSN’s live stream. Through the app, you can get breaking news quickly and without interruption.  CBS News Election Night coverage was available via CBS News’ Apple TV app and other streaming devices.

Michele Crowe, CBS Beyond the live stream, users can also browse through related videos, bookmark videos to watch later, and subscribe to topics of interest. “The CBS News app on Apple TV delivers the full breadth of our original reporting and live, anchored streaming coverage combined with a layer of editorial curation, giving news consumers unprecedented flexibility and access to the stories they care about,” Nancy Lane, senior executive producer of CBS News Digital, said earlier this year. In addition to Apple TV, CBSN is available on connected TV devices including Roku, Fire TV, Android TV, Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation; CBS News mobile apps for iOS and Android; and on CBSNews.com. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Set to Expand in Indonesia Will the iPhone maker still end up missing out? Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Dec 16, 2016 at 2:38PM iPhone 7 is about to go on sale in Indonesia. Image source: Apple. It may not be the most exciting smartphone market in the world, but every little bit helps when you're trying to squeeze out growth in any way, shape, or form. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is now set to expand into Indonesia, after committing to a $44 million investment to open a new research and development (R&D) center in the region over the next few years, according to Reuters. Starting next year, Indonesia will implement a rule that requires all 4G smartphones to include at least 30% of local content, but that requirement can be satisfied in a few ways. It can be hardware, software, or investments. With Apple's supply chain deeply entrenched in other regions, the Mac maker went with the latter route, and recently earned a "local content certification," according to the report. The local sourcing requirement is similar to a law in India, except that India's requirement pertains primarily to hardware components. Apple is unable to meet the requirement as is, despite its best efforts to be exempt under an exception for "state of the art" products. Apple still has a lot of work to do in order to crack India, which promises to be a massive smartphone market in the years ahead. Last month, Indonesian government officials announced that Apple would be opening an R&D center in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta in 2017. That's just the latest in a string of R&D centers that the company is setting up across Asia. This is Samsung turf Again, this isn't a particularly big market at the moment. There were roughly 55 million smartphone users in Indonesia in 2015, and quarterly unit sales are typically in the single-digit millions, according to eMarketer. However, eMarketer expects the smartphone user base to jump to approximately 92 million by 2019, so there's definitely some growth potential for the Indonesian smartphone market, which is already the third-largest in the Asia-Pacific region behind China and India. The Indonesian smartphone market is still immature in many ways. Network infrastructure remains an ongoing development, and wider network access will help boost adoption. Smartphone penetration is estimated at around 47%, according to GSMA Intelligence. In Mary Meeker's 2016 Internet Trends report, Indonesia falls into a group of countries that have medium to high barriers to broader internet adoption due to challenges around incentives and infrastructure, combined with mixed demographic trends. Affordability has been a key driver of smartphone adoption, which is obviously a hurdle for Apple given its premium positioning. The average retail price of a smartphone in Indonesia in 2014 was just $212, per Meeker's estimates. GDP per capita in 2015 was only about $3,300. IDC released market share estimates for Indonesia just this morning, pegging Samsung as the market leader with 32% market share. China-based OPPO came in No. 2 with 17% share, followed by ASUS with 8%. The market researcher notes that most of the growth is coming from the $250-to-$300 price segment of the market, although entry-level handsets in the $100-to-$200 range are still the core part of the market. Note that Apple doesn't directly participate in either of those market segments. There is some definite opportunity here as the market develops, and a wide range of companies are evaluating ways to comply with the local content regulation, which will likely spur continued growth. The risk is that Apple still ends up missing out by pricing itself out. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

The Aerial screen saver option on the Apple TV features an aerial view of different locations around the world, which Apple has added to over time to keep content fresh. The Aerial screen saver picks a random video option from a data source maintained by Apple, and that data source was recently updated with 21 new screen savers. iDownloadBlog has parsed the data and shared direct links to each of the new screen savers that can be watched on iOS devices and Macs. Screen savers are time-based and show off various cities and locations in slow motion, with the lighting changing based on the time of day. New screen savers of video captured in China, Dubai, Greenland, Hong Kong, Liwa, and Los Angeles have been added. China: - Day 4 - Day 5 - Day 6 Dubai: - Day 1 - Day 2 - Day 3 - Day 4 - Night 1 - Night 2 Greenland: - Day 1 - Day 2 - Night 1 Hong Kong: - Day 1 - Day 2 - Day 3 - Night 1 Liwa (United Arab Emirates): - Day 1 Los Angeles (United States): - Day 1 - Day 2 - Day 3 - Night 1 These screen savers aren't likely to be immediately available to all users, as the Apple TV downloads new aerial content on a regular basis depending on your Apple TV settings. New screen savers can be set to download on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis in the Settings app on the Apple TV.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « The Patent Case of the Decade Could End Most Patent Troll Litigation in Eastern Texas Courts against Apple & others | Main | Oracle's CEO Safra Catz Joins President-Elect Trump's Transition Team » December 16, 2016 Korean Report Wildly Speculates that LG is Working with Apple, Google & Microsoft to Deliver Foldable Devices by 2018   In July Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Supplier LG Racing to Develop Foldable Displays for Future Smartphones and Tablets." The report noted that LG had begun work on commercializing foldable displays for smartphones that could fold out and have a display as large as a tablet. LG was working on both fold-in and fold-out designs. A fold-out prototype design from Lenovo is noted below. China's Oppo is also experimenting with foldable smartphones and Samsung is actually to launch a design or two in 2017 in a limited run to test out its popularity in the market. LG was working with Canadian company Ignis Innovation who at the time said that foldable smartphone were still a few years away. Evidently a few years away is likely to translate to 2018, if a new Korean tech report is correct. The new report wildly speculates that LG is currently working with Apple, Google and Microsoft on 'folded-out' smartphones.   The Korean report blindly mentions LG working with an "outside business" which we have identified as Ignis Innovation.   While Apple has many patents regarding foldable devices, the Korean report makes quite the speculative leap that Apple will introduce iPhones with flexible/foldable OLEDs starting from 2017 that are to compete with foldable smartphone and tablets from Samsung.   At the end of the day the report from Korea's ETNews is really more of a propaganda piece promoting the superiority of Korean display makers over their Chinese competitors. We noted in a report this week that a sea of new OLED display makers will be in production over the next 18-24 months which will put pricing pressure on both LG and Samsung.   The Korean report notes that "Industries predict that South Korean companies will be the ones to compete for top positions again within markets for foldable panels. Although Chinese manufacturers such as Lenovo and Oppo introduced prototypes of foldable panels, level of perfection of their technologies is very low. Their major technologies such as parts of a panel that are able to be bent and films that replace cover glasses are not near being commercialized." So wildly claiming that Apple, Google and Microsoft are choosing Korean display over any Chinese supplier is more of propaganda piece.   While it may be true that Apple, Google and Microsoft are eyeing the foldable phone and/or tablet market, I don't believe that all three US tech companies are on the verge of commercializing one anytime soon. Yet with Samsung and LG being leaders in display technology you can never say never.   The one report that still holds water is that Samsung is likely to be first with a working model of a foldable device in 2017. Their success or failure in delivering such a device next year will set the tone for the industry to hold back or move full steam ahead.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The tech crowds will see the neck-to-neck competition as Microsoft and Apple will show off the new features that the flagships will rock. iPad Pro 2 Specs, Features, Release Date There is not much room for improvements in the original iPad series, thus, Apple is expected to bring many upgrades to the iPad Pro 2. Starting from smoother navigation system and more-integrated Apple Pencil - the upcoming tablet iteration could be using the A10 X chip to boost the performance, according to Bloomberg. 3D Touch and TrueTone display have been the talks lately and it is highly anticipated that the Cupertino giant will equip the iPad Pro 2 lineups with the two technologies. And also, the iOS 11 as operating system. The iPad Pro 2 will come in three variants, according to analyst Ming Chi Kuo. One of them would be a 10.5-inch tablet aimed at education sectors. Kuo claims that the smallest variant will still sport A9 X because Apple plans to sell the device at a relatively low price. The speculations point at June release date at WWDC 2017 according to T3. Apparently, the rumored OLED panels will not appear until 2018. Surface Pro 5 Specs, Features, Release Date While there will surely be a change on the dimension and hardware specs, a recent report suggests that Surface Pro 5 may not be using Kaby Lake processor. Earlier this week, Microsoft demoed Windows 10 running on ARM-based computer, PCAdvisor has learned. The news has garnered attention and speculations of what could be powering the Surface Pro 5 device. The Pro variant has always been a versatile, hybrid device. The tablet will likely receive nice upgrades under the hood, such as, 16 GB of RAM and internal storage up to 256 GB. Rumors suggest that there will be two variants of Surface Pro hybrid device, 2K and 4K displays. And not to forget, a brand new rechargeable Surface Pen. Check out the iPad Pro 2 and Surface Pro 5 rumored specs in the video below The Surface Pro 4 hit the shelves for the first time in October 2015. Hence, it's safe to assume that Microsoft could be following the same pattern, launching the Surface Pro 5 in October 2017.     Tags iPad Pro 2, ipad pro 2 specs, ipad pro 2 release date, Surface Pro 5, Surface Pro 5 Release Date, surface pro 5 rumor, iPad Pro 2 vs Surface Pro 5 © 2016 University Herald, All rights reserved.

LG to Supply Apple, Google And Microsoft With Bendable Displays By Denisse Moreno On 12/16/16 AT 3:06 PM Close LG’s display department will begin mass-producing foldable displays for smartphones in 2018, and will supply them to Apple, Google and Microsoft, South Korean site ETNews reported Friday. It is predicted that LG’s and Samsung’s display divisions will compete against one another in order to “grab upper hands in markets for foldable displays,” according to ETNews. Apple, Google and Microsoft were listed as first buyers of LG foldable displays. The company has previously developed prototypes for foldable smartphones. Apple seems to have an interest in foldable phones. In November, Apple was granted a patent for a flexible phone. The patent, filed in July 2014, shows the company has been looking into a hinged iPhone model, but hints that it might be other “electronic devices” as well. The patent for “flexible display devices” reveals a touchscreen phone with a flexible, metal-backed OLED display that can be folded in half. 2017 iPhone 8 Rumors Red iPhone Apple will update its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices in 2017 to "iPhone 7s" and "iPhone 7s Plus," and will include a red iPhone, according to Japanese blog Mac Otakara. The new phones will have the same aluminum design as Apple’s most recent iPhones, but will have internal changes, including the addition of a faster A11 chip, the blog said. 3 Models Related Stories Apple Patent Hints At Foldable iPhones That Grip to Clothing Samsung Working On Foldable Smartphone Galaxy X?

He says the company will roll out a 4.7-inch model with a single-lens camera and LCD display, a 5.5-inch model with a dual-lens camera and LCD display, as well as an all-new OLED model with a dual-lens camera. Bezel-Less Design Barclays analysts have said Apple will release a 5-inch LCD iPhone and 5.8-inch OLED iPhone. The devices were rumored to be curved with a bezel-less design. Meanwhile, Apple is preparing for its biggest iPhone sales on record next year, which will mark the 10th anniversary of the smartphones.

Core Wireless was awarded $7.3 million in damages after Apple was found to have violated two patents owned by the company. Apple was found to have infringed upon Core Wireless' patents in iPhones and iPads, taking advantage of technology that "provide innovations that improve battery life and signal quality in mobile phones". The company is expected to appeal against the ruling, but this is not the only case it has lost. Core Wireless is a subsidiary of Conversant Intellectual Property Management, and Conversant CEO Inc, and John Lindgren said: "We are very pleased with the verdict. We appreciate the efforts of the court and the jury. This confirms the strength of the Core Wireless portfolio, especially following our success against LG earlier this year in two cases in the Eastern District of Texas". In addition to the $7.3 million damages, Core is also seeking interest on the award dating back to 2011. Earlier this week, Apple lost another case too. A San Diego Superior Court jury ruled against the company in a California Labor Code violation case. Apple was accused of failing to provide legally required meal and rest breaks for a period of four years. Apple was ordered to pay $2 million, and is again expected to appeal.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley man leads authorities on pursuit, rams vehicle into deputy's vehicle Friday Dec 16, 2016 at 11:42 AM Jose Quintero Staff Writer @dd_jquintero APPLE VALLEY — A 59-year-old man was behind bars on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer after leading authorities on a short pursuit in Apple Valley Thursday night. San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department deputies arrested Michael Lane Shaw after he allegedly rammed his vehicle into a deputy’s vehicle during the pursuit. Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station Sgt. Griffith said the pursuit began after Shaw “burned out” in a black Ford Mustang in the area of Pawhuska and Serrano roads at approximately 8:50 p.m. Griffith said the deputy started following the Mustang and attempted a traffic stop. But the Mustang continued through the neighborhood and wound up going down a dead-end street. “The driver turned his vehicle around and then rammed his car into the deputy’s car,” he said. “The deputy was able to escape without injury and the pursuit continued.” The pursuit eventually came to an end within minutes after deputies were able to corner Shaw’s vehicle in the area of Carlisle and Atoka roads. According to scanner traffic, Shaw was taken to a local hospital for treatment. Booking logs show he was finally arrested at 11:24 p.m. Court records show Shaw is scheduled to be arraigned in court Friday for a misdemeanor driving without a license charge, after he failed to appear before a judge back in November. Shaw was being held at High Desert Detention Center in Adelanto in lieu of $50,000 bail, booking records show.

Although several rumors have pointed to Apple producing at least one OLED iPhone model next year, Apple is reported to be testing multiple prototypes, and current plans suggest a curved, rather than a foldable display. Current speculation on an OLED iPhone model suggests that Samsung would be the current supplier, so any deal with LG for foldable displays may simply be part of a longer-term strategy for Apple.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

It might seem a bit odd to add a stylus to the iPhone 8 (or iPhone 7s, as it much more likely will be called), but the Apple Pencil has never seemed all that conventional a match with other Apple products. But with a possible iPhone Pro in the mix, it doesn’t seem all that out of order. The Apple Pencil is very similar in size to an actual pencil, and needs to be kept in a case if its user wants to avoid device loss. The Apple Pencil comes with a port-to-port converter to charge the device. This tiny device is about the size of a quarter folded into the shape of a burrito. It’s very, very easy to misplace. SEE THIS: Apple’s road to iPhone Pro Apple has a similar device out right now – one that’s relatively easy to lose and doesn’t, at first, seem all that consistent with past Apple products. The Lightning port headphone dongle – controversial as it was unforeseen. That product is a bit easier to keep track of, however, as it can just stay attached to one’s headphone cord, no problem. Several patents were published this week with new Apple Pencil information. These patents can be found at the United States Patent and Trademark Office under publication numbers 20160364025, 20160364026, and 20160364027. Each of these has mention of more than one device being able to be used in concert with Apple’s stylus. This week an Apple patent appeared with new uses for the Apple Pencil – or a new Apple Pencil coming in the future. This patent shows the Apple Pencil being used to control iMovie and working with an iPhone as well as an iPad. While it’s unclear when these connections will be made, there’s little reason why Apple wouldn’t go ahead with further Apple Pencil integration. If what we’ve written on the possibilities of an iPhone Pro come to fruition, an Apple Pencil is certainly in the mix. The Pencil is what makes the iPad Pro an Pro device. Rumors of an OLED display blasting our eyes out with brighter colors and sharper images than on any previous device – that has us pumped up. Or at least it’ll probably be meant to.

But instead of Macs and iPads, there are drones. Unboxed and on display. Touching allowed — even for the $4,599 DJI Matrice 600. “I’m more hands on so it’s nice to come into the store and gets your hands on it and kind of see what’s actually going on and try different things,” said Jorge Herrera, who drove from Westminster to check out Thursday’s grand opening of Colorado’s first DJI store, where drones cost between several hundred and several thousand dollars. U.S. FAA drone rules for hobbyists No pilot requirements Must register drone weighing more than 0.55 pounds Must be 5 miles from an airport, or notify air-traffic control tower Yield to manned aircraft Drones must be within user’s sight Follow community guidelines Source: FAA But this isn’t just a store that sells drones. It’s an official DJI store, a brand that dominates the unmanned aircraft hobby and higher-end consumer space. The Shenzhen, China-based company, the market leader for consumer drones, chose the Park Meadows Mall neighborhood in Lone Tree as one of 10 it is currently opening in the U.S., and the first authorized store in Colorado. It’s hoping to mimic the success of Apple stores instead of the fumbles of other brands — remember Niketown, Sony Style and Virgin Megastore? “We’re trying to get our product into as many hands as possible and this is a great way to do it,” said Adam Lisberg, DJI’s North American spokesman. “We love that our products are available at Best Buy and the Apple store because those are national and international chains that can reach a lot of people. At the same time, there is value for us to set up and show what our drones and cameras can do in an environment that is strictly focused on DJI.” The new store is operated by the owners of Multicopter Warehouse in Castle Rock. But it’s not a franchise. It’s an authorized DJI store. Only four DJI stores are owned and operated by the Chinese company and those are all in Asia. Kerry Garrison, chief operating officer of Multicopter, said that Multicopter has sold a variety of drones for three years. But after many brands proved less reliable, the store found itself selling mostly DJI products. “It made sense that when they asked us to do a branded store, we felt the time was right to play off their brand in the marketplace,” Garrison said. Controlling the entire brand experience is a business strategy. But companies go about it in different ways. “Apple made no bones about the fact that their store was at least half there to serve owners – thus the genius bar and a lot of non-selling space devoted to education, training, and support,” said Nikki Baird, managing partner for RSR Research, which tracks retail trends. Others like NikeTown tried different things, like installing a basketball court and running track so customers could see how shoes felt in action before purchasing a pair. “But for companies like Sony, who try to create a buyer experience for something that is not really designed for a short try-out, it’s much more challenging. It’s difficult to appreciate a surround sound system in a 5-minute demo. You want to sit down and watch a movie, and get a feel for how you’d implement that in your own home,” Baird said. “And a lot of those experiences that get futuristic get gimmicky (and old) too fast – faster than the brand is willing to update and maintain them.” Hyoung Chang, The Denver PostDJI, one of the biggest brands for drones, is opening its first store in Colorado.DJI does sell its drones at Best Buy and Apple stores, but the China-based company wanted to get its brand out there and have more control over its products and relationship with customers.

Meanwhile, Niketown, which closed its Denver location in 2011, revived the immersive concept last month and opened a new Niketown flagship store in New York City. As a niche market, drones are still finding their way into mainstream. And sales are growing rapidly, according to the Consumer Technology Association. Drones sales are expected to double this year to an estimated $800 million, compared to last year’s $443 million, according to CTA data. DJI’s new store in Lone Tree is definitely a product showcase, much like the other recently opened DJI stores in New York and Bellevue, Wash., Lisberg said. There’s a giant cage near the back that lets staff fly and demonstrate the drones. Many on staff have their drone license and are involved with the local community. All the drones on display are meant to be picked up and touched. Want to try one? Just ask. “We want to make money. We’re not a company known for entering marketing and taking on projects that won’t make money,” Lisberg said. “But at the same time, there’s no physical showcase in the U.S. to show off DJI. From our perspective, if they’re selling our competitors, we don’t necessarily want to give a showcase to our competitors as well.”   Tags:  drones Tech Plus: Videos Tech+ DPTV Videos Tamara Chuang ​Tamara Chuang covers personal technology and local tech news for The Denver Post.

According to the report from etnews, LG Display is partnering with Apple, Google, and Microsoft on what it describes as ‘out-foldable’ OLED displays. LG Display secured global manufacturers as its partners. Apple, Google, and Microsoft were listed as first buyers of LG Display’s foldable displays. It is heard that LG Electronics joined a group of buyers of foldable displays late… LG Display already developed a prototype of out-foldable panel and it is heard that technical level of this prototype is significantly high. Although it is working with outside businesses, it is heard that it developed major parts of this prototype. Back in October, a report from BusinessKorea noted that Samsung and LG were collectively investing a combined record amount of around $11.6B into the development of flexible displays for 2016 as the two companies competed to secure orders from Apple and other device makers.  While LG and other possible suppliers including Foxconn-owned Sharp and Applied Materials could provide Apple with OLED displays for future iPhones, as of October it was estimated Samsung was producing around 95% of small-to-medium OLED displays in the market. It’s unclear if LG Display will be the only company providing Google and Apple with OLED panels or if the partnership is specifically for upcoming 2017 smartphone models. LG has previously shown off flexible and foldable display prototypes, including a larger flexible, rollable, and transparent OLED panel that it originally planned for 2017 production. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

The European Commission, in two rulings in 2009 and 2011, said the scheme, which applied to Spanish companies holding a stake of at least 5 percent in a foreign company for at least a year, broke EU state aid rules, and ordered Spain to recover the money. Banco Santander, Autogrill Espana, which is now known as World Duty Free Group, and Santusa Holding challenged the decisions at the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest, which ruled in the companies' favour. The EU competition enforcer then appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), arguing the lower court was wrong to demand that it specify the type of companies that benefited unfairly from the tax breaks. The court's verdict in the Spanish case on Wednesday could give insight into the ECJ's stance on high-profile rulings by the European Commission against tax breaks for multinationals such as Starbucks and Apple, which have already been appealed to the General Court by the Dutch and Irish governments. The Commission ordered Apple in August to pay Ireland a record 13 billion euros ($13.6 billion) in unpaid taxes, ruling the firm had received illegal state aid. The Commission has also ruled that Starbucks, Fiat Chrysler and 35 other companies benefited from illegal sweetheart deals with several EU countries. The Spanish corporate tax scheme allowed companies that were tax resident in Spain to write down goodwill resulting from the acquisition of stakes in companies that were tax resident abroad. While the Spanish case is different in substance and facts from those involving Starbucks and Apple - as the latter two involve individual rulings on specific companies rather than a scheme - the verdict could show whether the ECJ is taking a conservative approach to state aid which could constrain the Commission's investigations. A Commission official made light of the implications of the court's ruling. "If it is the general mood that we have over-reached, then that is bad but you cannot really deduce it from the question at hand in this particular case because it is such a specific question," the Commission official said. "We would not see it as good news, that is obvious, but I think it is difficult to infer too much from it." A Commission spokeswoman added: "We cannot comment on judgments that have not yet been issued." The cases are C-20/15 P Commission v World Duty Free Group, C-21/15 P Commission v Banco Santander and Santusa.

Posted 17 Dec 2016 02:10 Updated 17 Dec 2016 02:40 Starbucks cafe logo is pictured in Paris, France, August 4, 2016. REUTERS/Jacky Naegelen Enlarge Caption  Email More A A BRUSSELS: Europe's top court will decide next week on Spanish tax breaks for foreign takeovers in a ruling that may give clues as to how judges will deal with more complex tax cases involving Starbucks and Apple . The European Commission, in two rulings in 2009 and 2011, said the scheme, which applied to Spanish companies holding a stake of at least 5 percent in a foreign company for at least a year, broke EU state aid rules, and ordered Spain to recover the money. Banco Santander , Autogrill Espana, which is now known as World Duty Free Group, and Santusa Holding challenged the decisions at the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest, which ruled in the companies' favor. The EU competition enforcer then appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), arguing the lower court was wrong to demand that it specify the type of companies that benefited unfairly from the tax breaks. The court's verdict in the Spanish case on Wednesday could give insight into the ECJ's stance on high-profile rulings by the European Commission against tax breaks for multinationals such as Starbucks and Apple, which have already been appealed to the General Court by the Dutch and Irish governments. The Commission ordered Apple in August to pay Ireland a record 13 billion euros (US$13.6 billion) in unpaid taxes, ruling the firm had received illegal state aid. The Commission has also ruled that Starbucks, Fiat Chrysler and 35 other companies benefited from illegal sweetheart deals with several EU countries. The Spanish corporate tax scheme allowed companies that were tax resident in Spain to write down goodwill resulting from the acquisition of stakes in companies that were tax resident abroad. While the Spanish case is different in substance and facts from those involving Starbucks and Apple - as the latter two involve individual rulings on specific companies rather than a scheme - the verdict could show whether the ECJ is taking a conservative approach to state aid which could constrain the Commission's investigations. A Commission official made light of the implications of the court's ruling. "If it is the general mood that we have over-reached, then that is bad but you cannot really deduce it from the question at hand in this particular case because it is such a specific question," the Commission official said. "We would not see it as good news, that is obvious, but I think it is difficult to infer too much from it." A Commission spokeswoman added: "We cannot comment on judgments that have not yet been issued." The cases are C-20/15 P Commission v World Duty Free Group, C-21/15 P Commission v Banco Santander and Santusa.

Alexander Hitzinger is the latest auto specialist to be recruited by technology giant Apple as it explores building its own car. Earlier this month, Apple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on developers of self-driving cars. Scroll down for video  Apple poached the technical director of Porsche's race car programme earlier this year, a company source said on Friday. Pictured, Porcshe's Mission e electric car. A WINNING HIRE  Hitzinger helped Porsche, owned by Volkswagen, return to endurance racing and to develop the 919 hybrid sports car from scratch, much in the same way Apple is now looking into building its own vehicle. Porsche's new race car won Le Mans and the endurance racing world championship in both 2015 and 2016 using largely unproven technology, which beat far more established rivals. Hitzinger helped hire and build a development team and organisational structure at Porsche, expanding from ten staff to over 150 employees. Hitzinger could not be reached for comment.  The move was first reported by Germany's Manager Magazin. Officially, Porsche only confirmed Hitzinger had left the luxury carmaker in the spring.  Apple was not immediately available for comment. Hitzinger helped Porsche, owned by Volkswagen, return to endurance racing and to develop the 919 hybrid sports car from scratch, much in the same way Apple is now looking into building its own vehicle.

Hitzinger's LinkedIn profile states he left Porsche in March and joined a 'Technology Company' located in the San Francisco Bay Area as an engineering executive in April. Hitzinger is quoted by Manager Magazin as saying he wanted to do something 'which has a significant and direct impact on society', but did not confirm he now worked at Apple. Apple was recently been awarded a patent that suggests it's much rumoured 'Project Titan' car project is getting closer to being revealed. The document describes technology for a collision avoidance system that is designed for robots, or self-driving cars. It is the first public patent granted for the project - although the firm last week revealed its 'interest' in the area in a government filing.    Apple's latest patent describes technology for a collision avoidance system that is designed for robots, or self-driving cars. It describes a technique capable of avoiding collisions and navigating through unfamiliar areas by calculating distances and shapes APPLE'S LATEST PATENT  The patent, filed on June 7, 2015, is entitled 'Collision Avoidance Of Arbitrary Polygonal Obstacles'.  A new patent describes technology that could be the key to self-driving cars – a system that can operate in both 2D and 3D area, which computer visions systems have had difficulty doing. It describes a technique capable of avoiding collisions and navigating through unfamiliar areas by calculating distances and shapes.  Potential collisions are determined by comparing the edge distance against a known bounding radius.  If the technology detects that the edges of the object are not in its path, the vehicle will keep driving in the same motion. But if it a potential collision is predicted, 'the system selects the edge vector closest to the vehicle's current position and calculates the force needed to avoid the obstacle And it uses what it has learned from previous encounters for new ones. It highlights a system capable of avoiding collisions and navigating through unfamiliar areas by calculating distances and objects with in its radius. The patent, filed on June 7, 2015, is entitled 'Collision Avoidance Of Arbitrary Polygonal Obstacles' and was first spotted by Apple Insider, which notes that it 'offers proof that the company is investigating the application of machine learning and computer vision to autonomous 'agents' (vehicles)'. Details about Apple's secretive 'Project Titan' have been floating around since last year and although the Cupertino company has tried to deny its plan for a self-driving car, its actions speak otherwise. Earlier this month the firm wrote an extensive five-page letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration declaring its interest in the space. 'The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,' Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, wrote. Apple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying 'established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.  Now, more evidence has surfaced about the long awaited vehicle. The new patent describes technology that could be the key to self-driving cars – a system that can operate in both 2D and 3D area, which computer visions systems have had difficulty doing.

It also highlights that the technology would access an environment stored in its memory, identify where the agent sits in this space and then calculate the distance between it and other objects in the environment.

In an interview last year, Apple board member Mickey Drexler said that before his death in 2011 Steve Jobs had considered building a car. He told Paul Goldberger: 'Steve Jobs was gonna design an iCar.  'I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.'  This method gathers information about oncoming obstacles and the distance it has between objects. If the technology detects that the edges of the object are not in its path, the vehicle will keep driving in the same motion. But if it a potential collision is predicted, 'the system selects the edge vector closest to the vehicle's current position and calculates the force needed to avoid the obstacle,' reports Mikey Campbell with Apple Insider. And when the first object in the vehicle's path is avoided, the technology hones in on the next one right away using the data it learned from previous one. Apple has never publicly announced its automotive plans and if September The New York Times reported that 'Apple is 'rethinking' its automotive strategy. If the technology detects that the edges of the object are not in its path, the vehicle will keep driving in the same path. But if it a collision is predicted, 'the system selects the edge vector closest to the vehicle's current position and calculates the force needed to avoid the obstacle The source spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the project. He said that project Titan — the code name for Apple's self-driving car project — is undergoing a 'reboot'. This means closing parts of the program that are working on a vehicle to instead focus on software for an autonomous vehicle, which could be the answer for the 2015 patent.   Read more: Apple files patent for autonomous vehicle collision avoidance system Share or comment on this article e-mail 17 shares Most watched News videos Dan Bilzerian show off glitzy lifestyle as 'King of Instagram' Blind man attaches GoPro to guide dog to record his commute Heartbreaking moment horse cries at owner's funeral Cyclist forced off the road by dangerous braking driver 'I thought he was going to hit me': Ann Widdecombe on Philpott Great White shark breaches the water in pursuit of a tasty treat Stepdaughter surprises stepmom with adoption papers at Christmas "UFO" has been filmed demonstrating highly unusual behaviour Meryl Streep arrives at Debbie Reynolds' and Carrie Fisher's memorial Dangling kid rescued from a ski lift at Whistler Mountain Police Video Shows Rescue Of Kidnapped Man Road rage argument turns into full on fist fight in Ireland Pictured: The Fort Lauderdale 'air rage' gunman who 'argued...
