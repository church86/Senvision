(NASDAQ: AAPL ) buying Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ). The odds, according to InvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli, are less than 5%, perhaps non-existent. No, there’s another number that you might want to focus on when considering an investment in Tesla stock. Source: Shutterstock Tim Cook recently announced that Apple was establishing a billion-dollar fund to create advanced manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Part goodwill gesture, part public relations effort, part good business, Cook recognizes that Apple’s success is intertwined with a healthy American economy. On May 12, Apple made its first investment from the fund, awarding Corning Incorporated (NYSE: GLW ) $200 million to put toward research and development and capital equipment needs for its glass business. Apple, not coincidentally, uses Corning as a supplier of glass screens for its iPhones. „Corning is a great example of a supplier that has continued to innovate and they are one of Apple’s long-standing suppliers,” Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams said in a statement. „This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone, and today every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America.” While this move might seem self-serving to some, it shows just how important technology and innovation is to economic development in this country or any other … and that leads to an important factor when it comes to Tesla stock. Leveraging Innovation Apple claims that it’s indirectly responsible for creating 2 million jobs in the U.S., including 80,000 Apple employees in all 50 states. Since 2008, U.S. app developers have made $16 billion from the App Store. Over the past 19 years, Apple has directly created 75,000 jobs in the U.S. – a compound annual growth rate of 15.7%. It’s impossible to overstate the importance of Apple to the U.S. economy; the same applies to TSLA. More than four years ago, I wrote an article entitled Why America Needs More Teslas , in which I laid out why the risks associated with owning Tesla stock were worth it. It’s up 1,000% since then. Why such dramatic gains? Innovation, of course. The kind that Apple’s investing $1 billion to help nurture. Tesla’s Value to the Economy Well, first consider the direct contribution Tesla’s made regarding job creation. In the past four years, Tesla and SolarCity created 24,551 jobs, perhaps as many as 90% of those in the U.S. – a compound annual growth rate of 53%. So, if Apple created jobs in the U.S. at a rate of 16% per year, and Tesla/SolarCity did so at 53% annually, one might argue that Tesla’s contribution to American job creation is almost four times as great on an, ahem, apples-to-apples basis. I get that Tesla didn’t spend anywhere near the $50 billion that Apple spent in fiscal 2016 with its 9,000 U.S. suppliers and manufacturers, but again, it’s all relative. In fiscal 2016, Apple had $215.6 billion in revenue. That means it spent 23.2% of its revenue with U.S. suppliers. At the same rate, Tesla would have spent $1.6 billion on U.S. suppliers. According to an annual study by the Kogod School of Business at American University, the Tesla Model S is 75% American made . The rate’s not higher because the battery is made in Japan. However, it’s estimated that the new Model 3 will be 95% American made because the battery will be made in Nevada. Tesla had $7 billion in revenue in fiscal 2016; it spent $7.7 billion producing that revenue for an operating loss of $667.3 billion. If you use the 75% number from above, it’s conceivable that Tesla spent as much as $5.8 billion, or 82.9% of its 2016 revenue on U.S. suppliers. Bottom Line on Tesla Stock I’m not saying you should buy TSLA because of the company’s contribution to the job market or the U.S. economy – significant given its size – but if you already own it, you ought to be proud of the work it’s doing to push the innovation envelope. Ultimately, it might go bust, but what it’s doing in the automotive and energy industries will pay dividends for the country for years to come. That’s something tangible a lot of stocks can’t claim. As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Photo / AP Having kept an almost identical design of its flagship smartphones since 2014, Apple is set to provide a fresh overhaul for the forthcoming iPhone 8. The tech giant is tipped to use its annual September event to announce the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, which will offer moderate updates from the predecessors - the main change will be swapping the aluminium case for glass to allow for wireless charging. But they'll also use the event to launch the radically redesigned iPhone 8, a device expected to set tongues wagging. The bold new design will include a stainless steel frame between two glass panels, which slightly curve to give the appearance of iPhone made of one continuous sheet of glass. The very first actual images of the iPhone 8 (prototype) via @BGR pic.twitter.com/LIIpS3ChPX— Safwan Ahmedmia (@SuperSaf) May 17, 2017 Apple's iPhone 8 is expected to have an advanced edge-to-edge 5.8-inch OLED display that will rival the impressive 83 per cent screen-to-body ratio seen on Samsung's Galaxy S8 and S8+. Using finalised schematics leaked from the manufacturer of Apple's next-generation smartphones, pictures show what the iPhone 8 is going to look like when its unveiled later this year. To achieve the 83 per cent screen-to-body ratio, Apple has removed the physical home button from the front of the display. As the leaked design doesn't include a fingerprint scanner on the rear of the device, it is believed the touch TouchID sensor will be embedded in the display. The design also shows a new dual-lens camera system that will feature the same optical zoom capability as the iPhone 7 Plus' camera, LED flash a microphone. Surprisingly, the camera module on the iPhone 8 is oriented vertically, which is likely to do with the internal hardware engineering needed to fit the dual camera, front camera and new 3D infra-red sensors on the smaller device. However, it could be designed to specifically enable the new augmented reality features Apple is expected to reveal at the event. While being unveiled this coming September, the release of the iPhone 8 might not come until early 2018 if recent rumours of manufacturing difficulties hold merit. - news.com.au By Matthew Dunn Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

You may even now be seeing some favorite old app threatened with extinction. And you may be wondering why the developer doesn’t just update it for 64-bit and keep it alive. If the App Store no longer lists this app, there’s your answer: the developer is no longer paying Apple the annual $99 membership fee and thus isn’t actively maintaining the app. But even for an active Apple Developer Program member, updating an old app to 64-bit isn’t so simple. True, it’s usually trivial to turn on 64-bitness and recompile the app. But when an app project is opened and compiled with the latest version of Xcode, it is linked against Apple’s most recent system software development kit (SDK). That changes everything. The most recent system is iOS 10, and the app may not be ready for iOS 10. Reviving TidBITS News -- Let’s take as an example the TidBITS News 2.0 app that I’ve just updated for iOS 10. It was last compiled against the iOS 6 SDK. So how did it manage to keep running in iOS 7, 8, 9, and 10? Basically, the device’s system has been giving TidBITS News a lot of help, essentially by pretending to be iOS 6. A screenshot of the old TidBITS News app next to the new one is a dead giveaway: On the left, you see TidBITS News running under iOS 10; but it doesn’t look like an iOS 10 app. There’s a separate black status bar (and there’s a black linen-weave background, visible behind the date display, that Apple abandoned years ago). This is iOS 10 emulating iOS 6. Compare that to the new TidBITS app on the right. iOS 10 apps have a transparent status bar; the navigation bar, with its gradient background color, stretches up behind it. (I’ll talk about other interface changes later.) And the app’s look is the least of our worries. To compile and run as an iOS 10-native app, TidBITS News must speak iOS 10. Technically, it must adopt the iOS 10 application programming interface (API) — the way an app talks to the runtime. A lot has changed under the hood, since iOS 6, in how you do that. That’s why, following the publication of my developer book “Programming iOS 6,” I’ve had to write four subsequent editions (entitled “Programming iOS 7” and so on). To revive TidBITS News, therefore, I effectively had to rewrite the code from scratch as if I were creating the same app today, doing things the iOS 10 way. Luckily, TidBITS News is a fairly small, simple app; it has only three “scenes” — the master view (the list of article headlines and blurbs), the detail view (one complete article), and the player view (for listening to a recorded version of an article). But imagining a much more elaborate app, you can appreciate why a developer might not be willing to recast an old 32-bit app as 64-bit — it could be more work than it’s worth. (And the fact that Apple forces all updates to be given away for free means that it will generate absolutely no income from existing users. Is it any wonder apps are abandoned?) The rest of this article describes how the iOS 10 TidBITS News app differs from the iOS 6 version. If such technicalities don’t interest you, just download the new TidBITS News and check it out! Even if you’re not a developer, however, you might find the details to be an interesting illustration of how much iOS has changed in just four years. Language -- The iOS 6 programming language was Objective-C. With iOS 8, Apple introduced Swift, and I chose to rewrite the new TidBITS News in Swift because that has made the app’s code much easier for me to read and maintain. I’m sorry, diehard Objective-C fans, but I just find Swift a lot more elegant and legible. On the downside, switching to Swift makes the app a larger download, because a Swift app must include the entire Swift language — Swift isn’t yet built into your device’s system the way Objective-C is. Split View -- On an iPhone, the TidBITS News app is a navigation interface: you see just the master view, and when you tap a headline/blurb listing, it is replaced by the detail view. On an iPad, TidBITS News appears as a split view, with both those “scenes” together, the master view on the left and the detail view on the right. In iOS 6, the split view was an iPad-only widget. That meant that TidBITS News was effectively two apps in one, with two completely different interfaces and two distinct sets of code for dealing with them. Nowadays, the split view is native to both the iPad and the iPhone. To cope with the iPhone’s smaller size, the split view automatically collapses so that it looks and behaves like the old navigation interface. This change made the rewrite simpler, although managing a split view so that it looks and works correctly under all circumstances turns out to be rather tricky. Player -- The iOS 6 TidBITS News app plays an online recorded article using a widget called MPMovieController. Apple abandoned that widget some time back, replacing it with AVPlayerViewController. This change has given me more control over how the player view appears. There used to be an ugly QuickTime logo that I couldn’t get rid of; that logo is now gone. On an iPhone, the player view covers the screen; on an iPad, it is inset somewhat, with the rest of the interface visible darkly behind it. This is much less obnoxious on the large screen, I think. (You, the user, can make the player itself fullscreen, but my advice is: don’t. If I could have found a way to prevent you from doing this, I would have.) iPad Split Screen -- Return with me now to those halcyon days in 2010 when I first wrote TidBITS News. In those primitive times, developers worshipped a magic number: 320. The iPhone was 320 pixels wide, and that was an immutable fact — so much so that I had actually hard-coded it into the app. The iPad, too, came in only one size, and the split view master display was also 320 pixels wide. In effect, the iPad’s master display was an iPhone inside the iPad. Over the years, as Apple has introduced more hardware, iPhone screens have become wider and iPads have become bigger. As if this weren’t bad enough, iOS 9 introduced split screen mode, which lets users of modern iPads slide another app’s interface in from the right side. You can even resize the split to make two apps share the screen simultaneously. I found coping with this to be the hardest part of the rewrite — so hard, in fact, that for a time I contemplated opting out of this feature entirely. (There is a switch for turning it off in the app bundle’s system settings.) The difficulty is two-fold. First, depending on the device and the size of the split, the app effectively changes from an iPad app to an iPhone app, and then back again when the user removes the split, in real time. Second, the range of possible sizes, and in particular the range of possible aspect ratios, that the app can adopt is bewildering, ranging from exceedingly tall and thin to virtually square. This turn means that a split view’s master view can have even more possible widths. A modern app’s interface must, therefore, be planned so as to cope with these changes. I think I’ve managed to do that, but honestly, I’m not entirely certain. I wish Apple had never introduced this feature. Decisions, Decisions -- Other design changes were more or less elective surgery: I changed the fonts of the headline/blurb display in the master view because I wanted to adopt Dynamic Type — the font size depends on your setting in Settings > Display & Brightness > Text Size. I removed the label at the top of the master view telling when you last updated from the RSS feed, freeing more screen real estate. That information is now visible when you slide the master table down to reveal the refresh control. The detail view now shows the article’s title statically at the top so you know what article you’re reading even as you scroll through its body. (The title is offset downward for a complicated reason: it’s a tappable link, but Apple extends the tappable area of the navigation bar buttons downward, so that in trying to tap the title, when it was flush up against the navigation bar, I found myself accidentally tapping a button instead.) The iOS 6 detail view displays an article’s content in a UIWebView. The modern-day analog is WKWebView; UIWebView still exists, but it’s no longer under active development by Apple, so I’ve chosen to adopt WKWebView. I don’t think you’ll be able to tell the difference. When you tapped a link in the detail view, you used to be rocketed into Safari. That was a pity, because it took you out of the TidBITS News app, perhaps accidentally. iOS 9 introduced the SFSafariViewController, which effectively allows a Safari process to be embedded inside another app; I’ve now adopted that feature. (If, however, you preview a link on a device with 3D Touch, you can still end up in Safari; I hope to change that in a future update.) One major feature of the iOS 6 version is actually missing in the iOS 10 version: state saving and restoration. This won’t matter to you until you run TidBITS News, background it to use another app, and come back later to find that iOS has killed TidBITS News in the background. In an ideal world, you wouldn’t even notice this had happened because you would be able to pick up right where you’d left off. In the new version, however, if iOS decides to reclaim the memory TidBITS News was using, you won’t return to the story you were previously reading. Instead, the app starts from scratch, goes out on the Internet to get a new copy of the feed, and starts over at whatever is now the first article. Fortunately, TidBITS News is relatively tiny, so it’s less likely to be expunged from memory than most apps. I hope, in some future update, to add state restoration back in. Give It a Try! -- I’m fond of the TidBITS News app. It’s how I read TidBITS! Just as important, I use it as a teaching tool, because it illustrates a number of fundamental aspects of standard iOS app architecture. So I wanted to keep it going, and I’ve used the threat of extinction under the new 64-bit regime as an excuse to do so. If the old TidBITS News app was too crusty for you, I hope you’ll give the new version a try. It’s free, and will remain so as long as I maintain it.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Wondering why developers of old 32-bit iOS apps aren’t just recompiling their code to be 64-bit happy?

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Sebastian Hagedorn  2017-05-18 10:10 I'm curious why you didn't update the app periodically? I understand that it takes time and effort, but all things considered, I would guess that it's easier to modernize an app in small increments for every new iOS release than to have to bridge as huge a gap as going from version 6 to version 10. Reply Matt Neuburg   2017-05-18 10:55 Well, in the immortal words of Marlon Brando, "What's my motivation?" There's no money in it, the app does nothing essential (you can read TidBITS in other ways), I'm busy with other things, and the app kept on working. And let's not read history backwards: we had no way of knowing that there would _be_ a "huge gap", and by the time the gap _was_ huge, it was, uh, huge. Reply Lewis Butler   2017-05-22 01:06 If you're ever looking for a project to take on to improve the app, have it show comments as well as the articles. I'm glad you updated it, if for no other reason that you got to write this up for TidBITS.

The brand of headphones hasn't been revealed, but since Apple has released a statement on the matter it seems more than likely that they're Apple-manufactured. Flight Safety Warning Issued After Headphone Batteries Catch Fire Battery-operated headphones worn by a passenger on a recent Bejing to Melbourne flight "likely caught on fire" according to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, prompting a warning to be issued regarding the safety of batteries on board aircraft. Read more An Apple spokesperson says that, after an investigation, it found that the cause of the fire was 'third party batteries'. Big surprise. The woman in question, who wishes to remain anonymous, had sought compensation to replace her headphones and damaged clothing (but not her injuries). Following the statement she said that the AAA batteries inside the headphones were purchased in Australia, and that "nowhere on the headphones, or their packaging, does it specify which brand of batteries should be used." She also expressed her disappointment in Apple's decision. I'm pretty sure Apple doesn't make AAA batteries, so how someone can use anything but 'third-party' batteries is beyond me. Telling people not to use cheap knock-off phone chargers is one thing, but telling them they're using the wrong batteries is plain ridiculous. Are we going to start seeing batteries with an 'Apple Approved' logo that cost twice as much as your average expensive battery?

Post-Pornhub, there's simply less demand -- for paid content, for new content. But if history has proven anything, it's that pornography finds a way. We spoke to some of Australia's premier porn performers and producers. They're struggling, they're doing it tough, but they're using technology (and their innate sense of hustle) in a last gasp fight for survival.

One of only eight working models in the world, the machine fetched 110,000 euros (US $125,000), well below the expected 180,000-300,000 euros — suggesting that a spike in prices after Jobs’ 2011 death is definitely over. “From our point of view we are back at normal levels. Five years after the death of (Apple co-founder) Steve Jobs the ‘hype’ has settled back,” Uwe Breker, who oversaw the auction in Cologne, told AFP. Breker’s auction house, which specialises in the sale of technical antiques, had also been involved in a 2013 sale of another Apple-I — which fetched 516,000 euros. The model auctioned off Saturday and whose original owner was a Californian engineer, still had its receipt, its operating manual and other documents. “(The Apple-I) was one of the first opportunities for someone to possess a real computer. I’d been working with computers for a while but they were huge,” original owner John J. Dryden, who bought the Apple in 1976, said Friday. He admitted that parting with the machine was a wrench but said the time had come as he had not used it in a long time. The computer was one of around 200 Apple 1 units marketed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, who developed and built it. The buyer of this Apple-I at the auction was a German engineer who collects old computers. For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now Tags: Apple No Comments.

Peter ElstromPavel Alpeyev Masayoshi Son has said, without irony, that he has a 300-year plan for SoftBank and aims to build the world’s most valuable company. Photo: Reuters Tokyo: When Masayoshi Son was a boy growing up on Japan’s southern island of Kyushu, he kept a notebook to scribble down new inventions he hoped to create one day. Today, the SoftBank founder has almost $100 billion to invest on making the next big thing a reality. Son’s SoftBank Group Corp. closed the first round of a planned $100 billion investment fund, with money raised from Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, as well as Apple Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. The Vision Fund gives the 59-year-old access to a pool of capital unparalleled in the worlds of private equity or venture capital—the equivalent of four Silver Lakes or 15 Sequoia Capitals. Son isn’t one for understatement. He has said, without irony, that he has a 300-year plan for SoftBank and aims to build the world’s most valuable company. With the Vision Fund, Son vows to become the biggest investor in tech over the next decade, as he bets on the future of artificial intelligence, connected devices, satellites and the integration of computers and humans. Indeed in April, he led the $5.5 billion investment in China’s Didi Chuxing, the largest venture funding on record. “We saw a big bang in PCs, we saw a big bang in the internet,” Son said in February on a call with shareholders. “I believe the next big bang is going to be even bigger. To be ready for that, we need to set the foundation and that foundation is SoftBank Vision Fund.” Son has some enthusiastic supporters, with very deep pockets. Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman agreed to make his country the cornerstone investor with a $45 billion check after a meeting with Son. Besides Apple and Qualcomm, Foxconn Technology Group and Sharp Corp. are also putting in capital. SoftBank said Saturday the fund has $93 billion in committed capital and aims to reach $100 billion with a final close within six months. Son’s mega-fund will unleash an unprecedented amount of money into sectors already seen as overcapitalized. Private equity returns have plummeted in recent years because there’s too much money chasing too few deals. Venture capital faces similar issues. “A $100 billion fund is mind boggling,” says Steven Kaplan, a professor at University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business who co-founded its entrepreneurship program. “There’s too much capital now so bringing in more capital doesn’t make any sense.” Kaplan struggled to think of a precedent for what Son is attempting. He said the closest parallel may be the late 1990s when money poured into US internet companies, fueling sky-high valuations—right until the market crashed. Private equity firms are sitting on record piles of cash. The amount of unspent money hit $820 billion at the end of 2016, up from $755 billion a year earlier, according to the research firm Preqin. The venture total hit $142 billion, compared with $127 billion at the end of 2015. “There is already a tremendous amount of dry powder out there,” says Felice Egidio, the firm’s head of venture capital products. “Investment opportunities are getting harder and harder to come by.” In other words, Son may be more than the most powerful investor in tech—he may be the most dangerous too. A flood of capital into artificial intelligence or driver-less cars, can inflate valuations and spawn too many competitors, leaving everyone struggling to make money. Son has spent his life defying expectations. He left Japan at 16 to study in the US and ended up at the University of California at Berkeley. While in school, he invented an electronic translator that he sold to Sharp, making his first $1 million. “It’s like he’s from the future,” said Hong Lu, who began working with Son in California 40 years ago and went on to co-found UTStarcom Holdings Corp. Son founded his own company in 1981 and began to distribute software for companies like Microsoft Corp. He then built it through a series of high-stakes bets. In a deal that would supply him with cash for other investments, he acquired Vodafone Group Plc’s struggling Japan business and turned it into a profit machine. His fearlessness almost cost him his company. During the internet bubble, he invested in about 800 companies, vowing to create a “netbatsu,” the digital age equivalent of Japan’s zaibatsu industrial conglomerates bound by cross-share ownership. SoftBank shares surged and Son’s net worth hit $68 billion in 2000, almost surpassing Microsoft’s Bill Gates as the world’s richest man. Then the bubble burst and hundreds of his investments went under. His stock fell 99 percent. But among the wreckage, Son had some winners. He was an early backer of Yahoo! Inc. and he bet on China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, which turned into one of the best venture bets of all time. He parlayed an initial $20 million investment into a stake that is now valued at more than $90 billion, or 4,500 times his original investment. If Son was spooked by the crash, he never let it show. He continued to cut big deals, including the $22 billion acquisition of US wireless carrier Sprint Corp. Last year, he made the biggest deal of his career, buying chipmaker ARM Holdings for $32 billion. After the announcement, his stock got hammered as stunned investors fled. “It would be unfair to Masa Son if we said we were not warned that some ‘crazy ideas’ were on anvil,” Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies Group, wrote at the time. “To us, the ARM acquisition announced yesterday appears largely inconsistent with SoftBank’s investment strategy ... It does not inspire much confidence.” Son responded with an impassioned pitch. He argued this is a rare moment in history when technology’s rapid evolution provides opportunities that may never appear again. “People think this was a stupid move, they’ve voted with their money,” Son said at the time. “It’s easy to look at where your pieces are now and place the next one nearby. This one is 10, 20, 50 moves ahead.” That set the stage for the Vision Fund. Son saw once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, while SoftBank’s investors fretted the risks. The question was where he could find a new set of backers willing to finance his vision of the future. Then the Saudi deputy crown prince came to Tokyo last September just as he was looking for ways to diversify his country’s economy beyond oil. The prince needed to invest billions of petro-dollars in new industries—he even called his effort ‘Vision 2030.’ SoftBank’s Vision Fund was announced publicly in October and Son’s deal-making synapses have been firing even before the fund closed. Son agreed to invest $1 billion in OneWeb Ltd, a start-up that aims to beam internet connectivity to every corner of the globe. He is also putting $300 million into WeWork Cos., a New York-based startup that rents out offices to small businesses and freelancers. Son is raising the Vision Fund because he sees deals he thinks are even more promising than Alibaba. In his February call, he cited the leaders of the sharing economy, including Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc. SoftBank is behind major funding for rivals to Uber. Didi, the biggest ride-hailing service in China, last month announced its record $5.5 billion fundraising, led by the Japanese company. Southeast Asian operator Grab plans to raise more than $1.5 billion in a round backed by the Japanese company, people familiar with the matter have said. “Uber is redefining the transportation industry now; Airbnb is doing it to the hotel industry. You can expect that to happen in every single industry,” he said in February. He has given a few details of how he plans to use the capital. It is likely to be a mixture of many investments on the scale of OneWeb with a handful of very large deals. “This won’t be a typical fund,” he said in February. “Most of our investments will range between 20 and 40 percent, making us the largest shareholder and board member, in a position to discuss strategy with the founders.” Son will have unusual influence over investments. He will be the only so-called key man in the fund, according to a person familiar with the matter. There are typically several people with such a designation in investment funds, which gives limited partners the option to withdraw from the fund if one of those key men leave. Dealmakers are cautious. Ted Gooden, managing director at Berkshire Capital Corp., predicts returns are likely to decline given the excess of capital. “There is so much money in the system, it changes the industry,” he said. Not everyone outside of Son’s orbit is a sceptic though. David Brophy, a finance professor at the University of Michigan, said the sheer size of SoftBank’s fund will give Son advantages that no other investor has. He can jump into deals that are more capital intensive than anyone else can handle and he can keep funding them longer. “You can walk in with muscle that no one else has,” said Brophy, who is also director of the university’s Office for the Study of Private Equity Finance. “I wouldn’t focus too much on what we see in the rear view mirror. It’s more important to look ahead.” Bloomberg Peter ElstromPavel Alpeyev Topics: Masayoshi Son SoftBank SoftBank Vision Fund tech fund Qualcomm More From Livemint READ MORE Soulflower eyes opportunities in natural cosmetics, perfumes Time to ditch the polar bears?

The tenth anniversary iPhone is proving to be one exciting product with which fanatics are religiously keeping an eye on. The previous week has given Apple fans some glimpse on the technology behind the iPhone 8. While we now prepare ourselves for the next slew of leaks coming this week, here are some of the stuff that you might have missed last week. WWDC 2017 and iOS 11 Almost every eyes are on Apple right now as it inches closer to the release of the iPhone 8. This coming June, the tech giant is expected to introduce the next version of its mobile operating system; the iOS 11. The introduction is rumoured to be held during the scheduled Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, CA. which will run from the 5th to 9th of June. According to sources, this new version of iOS is set to introduce a plethora of new features for both the iPad and iPhone. Right now, users have been enjoying the latest version, iOS 10.3.2, which builds up on the switch to 64-bit system for Apple’s mobile devices. iOS 10.3 is said to be the stepping stone for Apple mobile device users into a fully-fledged 64-bit system. It should be noted that some iOS devices will not be able to upgrade to iOS 11 due to massive changes in the filing system; Apple introduced the new APFS starting with iOS 10.3. New Apple patents Last week, Patently Apple has reported that Apple was once again granted a number of patent approvals by the US Patent Office. Some of these patents pertain to technologies that might be included in the iPhone 8. The first patent discusses how Apple plans on achieving a slimmer bezel for its next flagship phone. In the said patent, Apple detailed the use of flexible display panel that will be house in a curved glass assembly that will merge the touch sensor and the display together. Apple patent for TouchID technology (via patentlyapple.com) Another patent, however, discusses details about the TouchID sensor for the iPhone 8. From the official document, it seems like Apple just added some details on the previous patent application for the same technology. From this version, users will be able to input biometric data without terminating a currently running program. Furthermore, biometric inputs, just like the previous patent, can be done anywhere on the screen. This new patent somewhat alludes to the idea of an in-display fingerprint scanner, something that has been rumored about the upcoming phone. New images Of course, a leak is not complete without an accompanying image. A few weeks ago, there were images leaked of the supposed 3D drawings for the moulds that will be used on the iPhone 8. Now, another set of images surfaced the Internet, this time showing not only the iPhone 8 but the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus as well. Alleged moulds for the iPhone 8 (via weibo.com) The said images came from popular Chinese micro-blogging website Weibo. While the images do not reveal much about the iPhone 8, it is quite interesting to see the size comparisons between the three iPhones releasing this year. On the other hand, it is quite clear from one go the images that the iPhone 8 is only slightly bigger than the iPhone 7s. It should be noted though that the former will have a reported 5.8-inch display. The reason for a nearly negligible size increase is the fact that the iPhone 8 will have minimal bezels that will maximize the surface area of the device.

It is usually the venue for announcing software-related stuff, but this year may be different. Rumors and speculations on the internet indicate that new MacBooks and even a new iPad may be revealed during the conference. Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the subject, reports that three new MacBooks are being planned to be announced during the Worldwide Developers Conference 2017. Fans can then expect to see a refresh to the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro, along with an upgraded Air. This move may have been decided to compete with Microsoft, which just released its new Surface laptop earlier this month. The Surface Book 2 is also believed to be coming soon, which is probably why Apple is updating its lineup to keep its sales high. According to the report, the 12-inch MacBook will have a faster Intel chip, while the MacBook Pro will also receive a faster Kaby Lake processor. There was no mention of a refresh in design and other specs. The smaller one is expected to be revamped inside and out, though, while the Pro will not be much different than the current model. [Image by Apple] Surprisingly, Apple is also considering upgrading the MacBook Air, which did not get a significant update last year. Rumors have already started predicting its impending doom, but now it seems like the entry-level laptop will still be hanging around. Apparently, the sales of the company’s cheapest laptop are still doing great. So, to keep customers buying the Retina-deprived notebook, it will likely be receiving a new processor. The decision may also be partly because of the Surface Laptop, which competes directly with the Air. Seeing that it is newer with better specs and a pretty face, Microsoft’s laptop may prove to be a huge challenge to Apple’s entry-level laptop. [Image by Apple] A light refresh may be enough to Apple’s herd of loyalists, but some actually want significant changes. Nonetheless, the Cupertino-based company may still be planning to introduce a new model with revamped designs and maybe an upgraded display, but that cannot be confirmed. These are rumors and speculations for now, so better take these with a pinch of salt. 10.5-inch iPad Pro The software event may be bombarded with new hardware announcements, as the new iPad Pro variant is also rumored to be announced in WWDC. According to TechTimes, production may have already begun in time for an announcement in June, as predicted by popular KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The analyst is known for his spot-on predictions, so his word holds a lot of weight. This is further corroborated by the leaked Urban Armor Gear inventory listing, which includes a Metropolis Folio Case for a 10.5-inch iPad Pro that is due in June, 2017. Urban Armor Gear prepping case for 10.5-inch iPad Pro, with June availability https://t.co/ivd6EQOrY4 pic.twitter.com/hdygYN549z — 9to5Mac  (@9to5mac) May 10, 2017 As for its specs, the Inquisitr reports that the new iPad Pro variant will have Pro specs with a 10.5-inch screen crammed into the 9.7-inch iPad’s chassis. Its home button may be removed to accommodate the big display in a small space, or it will stay to house the fingerprint sensor. The True Tone display from the 9.7-inch iPad Pro will also be carried over to its bigger sibling, as well as advanced support for the Apple Pencil. Aside from these obvious details, not much is really known about the 10.5-inch variant. Until now, there are skeptics of the existence of the tablet as it does not seem logical to release another iPad Pro when there are already three variants (including the rumored iPad Mini Pro) on the market. WWDC 2017 kicks off on June 5, so stay tuned for more updates.

Linux, Android, and Blackberry's QNX race for control of car infotainment systems. Ron Amadeo (US) - May 21, 2017 8:15 am UTC reader comments 193 Share this story If I asked you "how many computing devices do you own?" your mind will probably first jump to your PCs and laptops at home, and then to your smartphones and tablets. The more tech savvy might include smartwatches, TVs, and video game systems. But there's one computing device that not many people think about as a computing device: the car infotainment system. Like everything else, infotainment systems are computers with processors, operating systems, and applications, but you won't find much material out there that treats them as such. Microsoft, Apple, Google, Samsung, and others hold big press conferences about their new hardware and software, touting ever-larger spec sheets, new features, and universally known sub-brands like iPhone, Surface, and Galaxy. But you'll almost never see car companies announce how much RAM is in their new car infotainment systems, though; most won't speak a word about specs or even say what software they're running. Sure, the main purpose of a car is to drive it, so horsepower, safety, and comfort are top-of-mind. But after the steering wheel, pedals, and (for some drivers) the turn signal, the infotainment system is one of the most-used interfaces of a car. If it sucks, you're probably going to be unhappy. So today we're going to treat car computers like every other kind of computer and see how car companies are adapting to the age of the smartphone. Consumers are demanding ever-more-complicated tech packages in their cars, and some members of the 100-year-old car industry are adapting to it better than others. The state of the car computer. Welcome to the infotainment Wild West In the early days of the PC, there were lots of operating systems—DOS, Mac OS, OS/2, Windows, BeOS, AmigaOS, and others. Eventually, the platform matured, and things settled out to (mostly) a duopoly of OSes—Microsoft's Windows and Apple's macOS. In the early days of smartphones, there were lots of operating systems—Palm OS, Windows Mobile, Symbian, BlackBerry OS, Brew, and others. Eventually, the platform matured, and things settled out to (mostly) a duopoly of OSes—Google's Android and Apple's iOS. It is with this in mind that we look at the current state of the car computer, where we definitely seem to be in the "early" days. Today, there is no shortage of car OSes, all of which are heavily customised by and exclusive to each car manufacturer. For general underlying operating systems, we've got Blackberry's QNX, Microsoft's Windows Embedded Automotive, plenty of custom Linux-based OSes, and plenty of custom Android Open Source Project (AOSP)-based OSes, which itself is Linux-based. Car companies usually build custom interfaces on top of these OSes and brand them as productions of the car company, with names like "Ford Sync" and "Audi MMI." Of the "big three" consumer operating system companies—Microsoft, Google, and Apple—only Microsoft currently competes in the automotive OS market. Apple and Google both have "projected" car interfaces—CarPlay and Android Auto, respectively. But these are merely run from a smartphone and are sent to the car display. They are not real operating systems and essentially run as apps on top of one of the previously named car OSes. There's also the similar "MirrorLink" system, which—with a compatible car and phone—will send your entire phone display to the car screen. Microsoft has had a car platform seemingly forever, starting with the (aftermarket) Windows CE 2.0-based "Auto PC" in 1998. Microsoft's car platform (which, in typical Microsoft fashion, has changed names about five times over the years) had a serious foothold in the market with Ford Sync. But after Ford switched to Blackberry's QNX, many wondered if Microsoft has a future in the infotainment market. The company recently signed a deal with Renault-Nissan, but it's too early for any real products yet. Further ReadingGoogle shows off its car infotainment operating system, built into Android NSeveral cars today run Google's operating system, Android, but everything you see out there is an AOSP (Android Open Source Project) derivative created without Google's involvement. While the Google-less Android distributions proliferate, Google is working on copying its smartphone strategy over to the automotive market. Google's "Open Handset Alliance" is a group of smartphone OEMs that have committed themselves to using Google-blessed Android distributions. The car-focused version of this group, the "Open Automotive Alliance" already counts 50 car brands (heavily inflated from badge engineering) as members. These members sign contracts promising to follow Google's Android compatibility requirements, and we've already seen car-specific language (see: "Android Automotive") start to pop up in Google's compatibility docs. At trade shows, Google has shown off two separate Android car OS concepts: one with a Google-designed interface, which would be similar to a "Pure Google" Pixel phone, and one that has been skinned with a custom interface from Fiat-Chrysler, which is similar to what Android smartphone partners like Samsung and LG do. The whole concept is an exact copy of Google's smartphone strategy. But how many car manufacturers will look at the smartphone market and be willing to actually ship a Google car OS? Further ReadingOne week with Apple’s CarPlayAs for Apple—if the company follows its usual strategy of vertical hardware and software integration, it would only produce a car OS if it also produced a car. As farfetched as that may seem, rumors claim Apple has had an autonomous electric car project in the works since 2014 called "Project Titan." According to The New York Times, the 1,000-person-strong Project Titan team has undergone a "reboot" recently, which involved some layoffs. Apparently the group is pivoting away from designing a car and more toward "building out the underlying technology for an autonomous vehicle." So CarPlay seems like it will be the company's in-car solution for the foreseeable future. Enlarge / This "Auto Manufacturer market share" chart also works as a rough "Car operating system market share" chart. It's actually worse than this, since some car manufacturers have multiple OSes. Good luck, developers. Good Car Bad Car / Ron Amadeo With the big consumer software vendors on the sidelines, we have a situation that looks a lot like the pre-iOS/pre-Android days. Every automaker is building a car OS that is incompatible with every other car OS, so "Car OS app stores" are not really a thing. The market is a nightmare for app developers, and, at best in a car, you'll get a single-digit lineup of packed-in apps—and that's it. For a look at what wide car support in 2017 looks like, check out Pandora's insane "How to listen to Pandora in the car" support page, which lists all of its disparate pack-in clients. Between car manufacturers and aftermarket stereos, Pandora lists 33 different brands that have the Pandora app. Some of those car brands are owned by a single company and share an infotainment platform, and Pandora can probably share some code across certain versions. But the company is still looking at something like 20 clients that are all somehow different. A big reason any OS market usually coalesces from many operating systems to a small handful of options is because of app developers. Before the Android/iOS duopoly in smartphones, Google CEO Larry Page once complained his company had "a closet full of over 100 phones" just to maintain the Google mobile apps, and the company was "building our software pretty much one device at a time." With the car infotainment market in pretty much the same state today, Pandora must need a garage full of cars to maintain its car app. For most third-party developers, duplicating Pandora's herculean car app development efforts is financially impossible. So apps just don't get made. The other problem with car computers is age. Designing a car computer is much more complex than building a desktop, laptop, or smartphone. The biggest problem—one that you'll need to consider over and over again when you see the choices that car manufacturers make—is that designing and releasing a car takes about three to five years. This means that every computing component is going to be a bit old, and no one has figured out how to put cutting-edge computing parts into a car. Meanwhile, the need to comply with safety regulations from government groups all around the world is a lengthy process that contributes to the pokey rollout of technology. Keep in mind that, while history shows the original iPhone kicking off the modern touchscreen smartphone revolution 10 years ago, it was initially met with lots of skepticism. So in addition to the three- to five-year turnaround time, you also have to factor in when each individual car manufacturer realised iPhone-style smartphones were the future. As a result, most car companies are only on their second-generation interface. With the basics set up, let's take a look at some of the individual car infotainment systems that are out there.

In some countries, such as Ireland and the Netherlands, the free trial is for one month. According to Apple's website, however, the trial now costs 99 cents in Australia, 0,99 € in Spain, and Fr. 0.99 in Switzerland. Based on our spot check, the trial remains free in all other countries where Apple Music is available. The reason why Apple has started charging a nominal fee for the trial in Australia, Spain, and Switzerland is unclear. The trial was still free in those countries as of May 14, according to archived versions of Apple's website. Apple Music rival Spotify's three-month trial also costs 99 cents in Australia, 0,99 € in Spain, and Fr. 0.99 in Switzerland. Keep in mind that Spotify's trial also costs 99 cents in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere. (Thanks, Alex!)

Free music services are not fair for music artists Nice work Tim. Every penny counts ;) So no more free trial when you buy your $1k iPhone 8 and try to test the service? Sounds about Apple. That's not the point, and you know it. And yeah, that $0.99 added to all the other "Apple Taxes" actually does start breaking the bank at some point. My word, such douchebaggery Apple - Never stop PAYING! If only people were as interested in thinking as in spouting off. [Edit: Deductive reasoning dictates that] Apple's complying with the law in those countries, people. And artists get paid even during free or cheap trials. Stop tripping over yourselves trying to shoehorn every news bite into your anti-Apple world views. I promise it doesn't make anyone look clever.

Long speculated but never confirmed, the upcoming tablet has dominated the rumor mill for a quite some time now. According to recent reports from a leading industry analyst, however, the flagship slate would see a release very soon, possibly within the next few weeks. Apart from this, reports have also emerged from the production line of the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, stating that the output of the tablets would be increased to 600,000 available units by July, suggesting that a June reveal might indeed be imminent. Noted Apple analyst from KGI Securities Ming-Chi Kuo has stated that there is a 70 percent chance of the Cupertino-based tech giant revealing the 10.5-inch iPad Pro this coming June at WWDC, according to a MacRumors report. Considering that the event has seen notable hardware launches in the past, there is a good chance that the flagship tablet might indeed make an appearance at the Apple-hosted conference. According to a recent report from DigiTimes, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro began mass production around March-April, with supply chains manufacturing around 500,000 units of the flagship tablet to date. The production yield for the highly anticipated device is expected to be significantly increased, however, with reports stating that the volume of the flagship’s shipment is expected to increase to around 600,000 units in July. By the end of the year, Apple expects to see shipments of up to five million 10.5-inch iPad Pro units. 10.5" iPad Pro & 12.9" iPad Pro 2 #iPadPro2 #AppleLeaker pic.twitter.com/ocvuiLSofH — AppleLeaker (@AppleLeaker) May 19, 2017 Considering these reports, it definitely seems that the spike in the production yield of the 10.5-inch iPad Pro is caused by the impending debut of the highly anticipated slate. After all, the upcoming flagship tablet has long been rumored to be set for a reveal, though it has proven elusive every time rumors point to a specific release. Rumors about the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 are many, with numerous speculations stating that the device would be the most radical tablets that have ever been created by the Cupertino-based tech giant. According to the most persistent rumors about the device, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro would be able to squeeze in a larger display in a frame that has a similar footprint as the 9.7-inch iPad. This means that just like the iPhone 8, there is a good chance that the 10.5-inch iPad Pro might also feature an edge-to-edge display. The quality of the 10.5-inch iPad Pro’s screen, however, is still up for question, with some rumors stating that the upcoming flagship slate would feature an OLED display and others pointing to a more traditional IPS Retina panel. Regardless of what display the device comes equipped with, however, there is little doubt that the upcoming device would debut with one of the best screens available in the market. ????NEW Video: Apple iPad Pro 2 Rumors! (Price, Release Date, Specs and Features!): https://t.co/VzLm4E3cDp #ipadpro2 #ipad RT=SHOUTOUT!???????? pic.twitter.com/ycqQzK9OHI — Benjamin (@BTechTalk) May 17, 2017 Other rumors about the 10.5-inch iPad Pro state that the device would be equipped with several features that are set to make a debut with the iPhone 8. Among these is a fingerprint scanner that is built-in to the tablet’s display, as well as possible wireless charging capabilities. The absence of a headphone jack has also been rumored for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro. Specs-wise, the iPad Pro 2 is expected to be equipped with Apple’s rumored A10X chip paired with 4GB of RAM. Considering that the 10.5-inch iPad Pro would be running iOS, the powerful processor and the ample amount of memory would most definitely give users a premium tablet experience comparable to a full-fledged laptop computer. With the specs and features of the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, Tim Cook’s vision of having tablets replace full-fledged computers with powerful slates would definitely be one step closer to reality.

The design has been created using leaked schematics of the device. The company has kept the design almost the same since 2014. It’s time for an overhaul. The Apple iPhone 7s and 7s Plus will also be released in September though they will be minor upgrades from the predecessors. The aluminium casing will be swapped for glass to allow wireless charging. The iPhone 8 will be a complete shift in terms of design. It will have a stainless steel frame between two glass panels. It curves slightly to give the design an appearance of one continuous sheet of glass. It will have an edge-to-edge 5.8-inch OLED Display. It will rival Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus’ 83 percent screen-to-body ratio. The leaked design of the Apple iPhone 8 does not show a fingerprint scanner at the back. The TouchID sensor will be embedded in the display. The leak also shows a dual-camera architecture that will have the same optical zoom capability of the iPhone 7 Plus camera, a microphone and LED flash. As per News.com.au, the camera module is vertically oriented. This should be in order to fit the front camera, dual camera and new 3D infra-red sensors on the smaller device. During the event, Apple is also expected to unveil its new augmented reality (AR) features. The iPhone 8 could be specifically designed to enable these AR features. Recently, there have been many rumours about the iPhone 8 running into manufacturing problems. If this turns out to be true, the smartphone may not be hitting the shelves until early 2018 even though the phone is unveiled in September. According to Forbes, the upcoming smartphone will be shockingly expensive and no other iPhone has ever been so expensive. It could have a starting price of US$1,000 (AU$1,344 approx). The primary reason behind this is that Apple’s long time component supplier TPK Holdings has announced a 2-2.5x price increase for integrating 3D Touch into the iPhone 8 display and the Cupertino tech giant has reported accepted. The OLED Display itself will add about US$35 (AU$47.04 approx) to the overall manufacturing cost. The 3D Sensing technology will add about $20. Considering the fact that the 256GB iPhone 7 Plus already sells at US$969 (AU$1,300), the $1,000 tag seems reasonable. Apple has never been shy about raising prices. It increased the MacBook Pro prices dramatically with the most recent generation. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on the Apple iPhone 8.

Instead the best that Apple Music can do is offer users a free 3 month trial, after which users will have to start paying a monthly subscription fee if they wish to keep using the service. However interestingly enough, it seems that the free 3 month trial is no longer being offered in some parts of the world. This includes Australia, Spain, and Switzerland, and according to each country’s Apple website, it has been noted that Apple will be charging these users for the free trial instead, although we suppose it isn’t really free anymore. Users in those countries who have yet to sign up for Apple Music or take advantage of the service’s free trial will now have to pay a small fee of $0.99 in their local currency. Basically this gives users 3 months of access to Apple Music, but after which they’ll have to fork out the full subscription fee to keep using the service. We’re not sure what prompted Apple to make the change, but given that Apple has agreed to pay artists for songs streamed during the free trial period, presumably this small fee will help to offset some of those costs. So far only three of those countries are affected by this and we’re not sure if there are plans to eventually apply this to other parts of the world. Filed in Apple >Audio.

Now obviously Apple no longer sells these old computers, thus eluding the grasps of collectors. However it seems that over in Germany, one collector appears to have managed to get their hands on a working Apple-1 computer via an auction where it was sold for $101,325. Obviously that is a lot of money, but it seems to be considerably lower than what many were expecting it to fetch. It was initially estimated to sell anywhere between $190,000 to $320,000, and even after fees were added to the final price, it still falls short of the minimum mark. We suppose this is great for the collector but maybe not so much for the seller, especially when you consider the fact that it is in full working condition and is said to be one of the only eight working Apple-1 computers left in existence. By comparison, back in 2014 we reported that a working Apple-1 computer actually sold for over $900,000, so it seems that for some reason this particular auction did not quite achieve those prices. This particular model was sold complete with the original documentation, such as it manual, and also a collection of notes of telephone calls made between Apple’s co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak back in 1997.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Apple Ends 2011 MacBook Pro Graphics Repair Program By Tyler Lee on 05/21/2017 17:43 PDT If you bought a 2011 MacBook Pro and you were experiencing video issues, know that Apple had a repair program running that would address the issue for you. However that program has since come to an end for the 2011 models, according to Apple. This applies to both the 15-inch and 17-inch MacBook Pro models. However the good news is that the Retina mid-2012 and early-2013 15-inch MacBook Pros are still eligible for the repair program, so if you are using those models then you should still be covered for now. There was no explanation given for the removal of the 2011 models, but given that it has been 6 years since the laptops were released, we guess it would be a bit unreasonable to expect Apple to keep them covered forever. For those unfamiliar with this repair program, basically there were a small set of MacBook Pro models that were experiencing video glitches due to faulty GPUs inside their laptops. However it seems that it might have affected more users than expected as a class-action lawsuit was filed against Apple several years ago, with an online petition managing to rack up over 40,000 signatures. Like we said, customers with the mid-2012 and early-2013 models are still covered for now and if you are experiencing glitches, then you’ll want to get in touch with Apple ASAP and schedule an appointment.

By Chris Duckett | May 22, 2017 -- 00:35 GMT (17:35 PDT) | Topic: Mobility An Australian woman whose face, hands, and hair were burned when her headphones exploded on a plane won't be compensated by manufacturer Apple because third-party batteries were at fault. The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, was napping on a flight from Beijing to Melbourne in February when she was awoken by the sound of an explosion and a burning sensation on her face. "Our investigation indicated the issue was caused by a third-party battery," an Apple representative said in a statement issued by the woman's lawyers on Friday. Latest Australian news Labor: ACMA must be resourced for spectrum reform Centrelink urged once again to halt robo-debt program Australian agencies need new privacy code to maintain public trust: Pilgrim ETU wants rural NBN tax to be paid by government instead of consumers Telstra and Optus quarterly complaints shoot up The woman, who had sought to be reimbursed for her headphones and several items of ruined clothing, said she bought the headphones duty free in 2014, and the AAA batteries in Australia. She said she was extremely disappointed with Apple's decision. "The headphones don't work without batteries, yet nowhere on the headphones -- or their packaging -- did it specify which brand of batteries should be used," the woman in a statement. "As I went to turn around, I felt burning on my face," she said. "I just grabbed my face, which caused the headphones to go around my neck. "I continued to feel burning so I grabbed them off and threw them on the floor. They were sparking and had small amounts of fire." AAP contacted Apple for comment, but did not hear back by the time of publication. Following the mid-air incident, the national aviation safety regulator issued a warning to passengers about battery-powered devices. "Batteries should be kept in an approved stowage, unless in use," the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) warned in March. The ATSB detailed at the time that the headphones caught fire about two hours into the flight. Flight attendants placed the burning headphones into a bucket of water; however, the battery and cover were melted onto the cabin's floor. The ATSB said passengers were left with the aroma of burnt plastic, burnt hair, and melted plastic for the rest of the trip to Melbourne. The ATSB also said in March that it found the batteries were at fault. Last year, Apple took the self-described courageous decision to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, forcing users to use battery-powered bluetooth headphones rather than wired headphones. HTC has since followed suit and remove the jack from its U Ultra handset. A series of explosions eventually led to Samsung's ill-fated Note 7 being banned from flights due to its propensity to turn into a ball of flame and smouldering plastic. A four-month internal investigation by Samsung pinned defects in the batteries used in the device for the explosions, with the company introducing an eight-step battery safety check to attempt to prevent further incidents.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple announces environmental progress in China Lens Technology has committed to power all of its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by the end of 2018, as part of Apple’s industry-leading supply chain clean energy program announced last year. Lens is the first supplier to make a clean energy commitment for all of its Apple production, and will meet its goal through an unprecedented power purchase agreement with local wind projects. Apple is working with suppliers to help transform the environmental landscape in China, and is proud to announce all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The UL standard certifies all of their manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or, when necessary, converted into energy. Since the program began in January 2015, the sites have diverted more than 140,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. “We want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we’re working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. “We congratulate Lens for their bold step, and hope by sharing the lessons we’ve learned in our transition to renewable energy, our suppliers will continue to access clean power projects, moving China closer to its green manufacturing goals.” “Our power purchase agreement is the first of its kind in southern China and we hope it will serve as an example for other companies looking to transition to cleaner, more economical sources of power,” said Lens CEO Zhou Qunfei. “We’re pleased to be the first supplier to commit to covering all of our Apple production with renewable energy, and proud to source from local Hunan wind farms to power our facilities in Changsha.” Lens’ manufacturing with Apple currently includes two facilities in Changsha, Hunan province. Wind energy will cover 100 percent of the energy consumed producing Apple products at Lens facilities by 2018, avoiding nearly 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, equivalent to the energy use in 380,000 Chinese homes.

DailyTimes | Apple's Italian job for finding top talent Toggle navigation    Home Pakistan World Business Sport Life & Style Opinion Blogs Today's Paper E-PAPER Archives Apple's Italian job for finding top talent By:   Sean Coughlan 22-May-17 Top News Govt in line of fire over ‘cyber crime’ witch hunts 22-May-17 489 ISLAMABAD: Several political p ... PM in Riyadh to attend US-Arab-Islamic Summit   22-May-17 259 RIYADH: Prime Minister Nawaz S ... Computer giant Apple is expanding its supply line of talented young people with digital skills, by doubling the intake of its European academy. Last year, the technology company opened an academy in Naples, in Italy, where students spend a year training to be developers, coders, app creators and start-up entrepreneurs. Places are awarded through open competition - with tests being held next month in Munich, Paris, London, Madrid, Rome and Naples - with no tuition fees, open to applicants from anywhere in the world and with courses taught in English. There will be 400 students recruited for the autumn, expected to be in the 18 to 30 age range, for courses run in partnership with a Naples university, the University of Federico II. The decision for a computer company to move so directly into education is about self-interest as much as philanthropy. There has been a long-running digital skills gap - and Apple are taking steps to grow their own talent. Cyber-attacks: Computer apps, in the space of less than decade, have become a major source of revenue and jobs. Apple says there are now two million apps available on its online store - and that in Europe alone, the app economy sustains 1.2 million jobs. But there have been repeated warnings of a mismatch between the digital skills needed for such new jobs and the qualifications of those looking for work. It means that unskilled workers are without employment and employers are left without the skilled workers that they need. In the UK, the British Chambers of Commerce recently complained that three out of four businesses were suffering from a "shortage of digital skills". The global "ransomware" computer hack last week once again raised concerns about the acute shortage of cyber-security skills in many countries. There have been plenty of warnings about this - and IBM's general manager for security, Marc van Zadelhoff, has called for a different approach to recruitment. Filling the skills gap: IBM has an international network of university partnerships for cyber-security projects. But writing in the Harvard Business Review, Mr Van Zadelhoff said filling the skills gap would also mean re-training people without any experience in tech-related areas. "Why are we limiting security positions to people with four-year degrees in computer science, when we desperately need varied skills across so many different industries? "Businesses should open themselves up to applicants whose non-traditional backgrounds mean they could bring new ideas to the position and the challenge of improving cyber-security," wrote Mr Van Zadelhoff. There is also a bigger political dimension to the skills needed for a modern economy - highlighted by the annual Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Skills Outlook, published this month. The economic think tank's report for 2017 focuses on the polarising impact of globalisation - which has increasingly become a target for protesters on the right and left. The OECD analysis argues that whether a country is a winner or loser from globalisation will depend on the level of skills in the workforce. If countries have well-qualified, skilled populations, they will be the beneficiaries of globalisation, taking advantage of better jobs, improved productivity, widening markets and digital industries. It identifies South Korea and Poland as examples of countries moving up this value chain - and Estonia, Japan and New Zealand as countries successfully taking advantage of expanding technology sectors. Jobs disappearing: Among major economies, Germany is seen as being more successful in developing skills than the United States. But the big concern is that across OECD countries there are 200 million people with poor skills in basic literacy and numeracy, deeply vulnerable to the forces of globalisation. These are people who have the reading skills of 10-year-olds - whose job chances are acutely at risk from outsourcing overseas or being replaced by technology. The OECD report identifies Greece as a country that has failed to respond to this challenge. But it also warns that the UK, Australia, Ireland and the United States "need to watch out" because the skills in the workforce are no longer "well aligned" with the needs of new technology-driven industries. While projects such as Apple's academy are picking the fruit from the top of the tree, the OECD is warning about the dangers of ignoring the reality of life in the low-hanging branches. Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's education director, says there is an urgent social and political need to equip people with training, if globalisation is going to avoid social division. "Don't expect workers to accept losing their jobs through outsourcing or automation, if they don't feel prepared to get or create new ones," says Mr Schleicher.  Sunday Magazine Sunday magazine Aaj kal Business Plus TGIF Zaiqa TV Company Financials Investor Information Contact us Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions © 2017 DailyTimes - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Powered By opustech.co

Considering that Apple has already retired the 11-inch MacBook Air, the succeeding rumors stating that the 13-inch MacBook Air would be following suit definitely appears to be well-rounded. If recent reports are any indication, however, it seems that Apple might be thinking twice about retiring the MacBook Air series altogether. According to a recent Bloomberg report, Apple is allegedly double-thinking its previous strategy with the MacBook Air, especially since the aging laptop has enjoyed consistently good sales despite its outdated specs and low-resolution screen. With revenue from the MacBook Air being surprisingly strong, the Cupertino-based tech giant seems to have changed its mind about the future of the laptop. Thus, there is a chance that the 13-inch MacBook Air would be given a much-needed upgrade this year, most likely during Apple’s WWDC 2017 this coming June. While the reports of the MacBook Air being given an upgrade this year could not be verified, the timing of the rumors definitely makes perfect sense. After all, Microsoft has just revealed the Surface Laptop, an ultraportable device that is practically designed to take down the current MacBook line. Apple might appear to be betting the future of its ultraportable series with the 12-inch MacBook, but the Surface Laptop, with its legacy ports, balanced hardware and optimized Windows 10 software, seems to have managed to do what the iPhone-maker could not — balance power and portability with very few compromises.

One of the ways it could do this, of course, is to not abandon a device that has been well-loved by consumers and avid Apple fans alike for years, the MacBook Air. The laptop, after all, remains a very reliable device that could quite literally outlast all of the MacBooks in Apple’s current lineup. The possible update to the MacBook Air asks a very real question, however. If Apple is indeed exploring the idea of updating the Air this 2017, what upgrades would the aging laptop be given? Since the machine is an entry-level device, there is a relatively slim chance that the 2017 MacBook Air would have a revamped frame or an improved display. What is likely, however, are updates to its internals. MacBook Airs have always been the slightly underpowered versions of the MacBook Pro line. Unlike the 12-inch MacBook, which uses an Intel Core-M processor, the MacBook Air utilizes Intel Core-i chips. Thus, with Apple’s laptop lineup widely rumored to receive updated Kaby Lake processors, there is a very real chance that the MacBook Air 2017 would be fitted with a 7th-generation Intel Core i5 chip. A memory boost to 16GB RAM is also likely to be rolled out to the device, according to a MacWorld report. 今日から家でMacBookを使いたいと思います。 ビルゲイツ信者には不慣れだぜwwwでも良い感じ^_^ #macbookair #ビルゲイツ #信者 #スティーブジョブズ #慣れない #東京 #新宿 #渋谷 #六本木 #西麻布 #microsoft A post shared by Syugram (@sh0304) on May 21, 2017 at 7:25am PDT Upgraded processors and more RAM might not be the only upgrades that the 2017 MacBook Air might receive, as the laptop could also be fitted with new and improved batteries, better cooling modules and a more durable chassis. Among these rumored features, the 2017 Air’s improved batteries would most likely be the laptop’s killer feature, seeing as the outgoing, aging model already manages up to 14 hours of battery life due to its low-resolution screen. If Apple opts to keep the old MacBook Air display while improving the battery, the Cupertino-based tech giant would have an entry-level laptop that could practically outlast every single competitor by hours. Since Apple is not giving any official details about the MacBook Air 2017, these speculations need to be taken with a huge grain of salt. If these rumors prove true, however, there is little doubt that Apple would be able to compete very well in the sub-$1000 laptop market. These speculations would likely be proven true or untrue sometime this June when Apple holds its WWDC 2017.

She now spends much of her time in Asia and is currently researching a book about textile artisans. She also writes regularly about legal, political economy, and regulatory topics for various consulting clients and publications, as well as scribbles occasional travel pieces for The National. Motherboard ran an interesting piece this week, Apple Is Lobbying Against Your Right to Repair iPhones, New York State Records Confirm,  reporting on the money Apple, Verizon, and other tech trade associations are spending to thwart right to repair legislation pending in nearly a dozen states, including New York. I first wrote about some these initiatives in January of this year, in this post, Waste Not, Want Not: Right to Repair Laws on Agenda in Some States, which discusses New York efforts as well as other initiatives to reject the throwaway culture, not only for electronics but also for other items. Motherboard has been following this topic closely. From the latest account: The bill, called the “Fair Repair Act,” would require electronics companies to sell replacement parts and tools to the general public, would prohibit “software locks” that restrict repairs, and in many cases would require companies to make repair guides available to the public. Apple and other tech giants have been suspected of opposing the legislation in many of the 11 states where similar bills have been introduced, but New York’s robust lobbying disclosure laws have made information about which companies are hiring lobbyists and what bills they’re spending money on public record. Apple’s not the only company seeking to kill the New York legislation, and a motley crew of others seek the same general objective, as Motherboard reports: According to New York State’s Joint Commission on Public Ethics, Apple, Verizon, Toyota, the printer company Lexmark, heavy machinery company Caterpillar, phone insurance company Asurion, and medical device company Medtronic have spent money lobbying against the Fair Repair Act this year. The Consumer Technology Association, which represents thousands of electronics manufacturers, is also lobbying against the bill. BoingBoing last week in Apple, CTA and Big Car are working in secret to kill New York’s Right to Repair legislation spelled out details of the nub of company objections: The companies are especially opposed to rules that ban using [Digital Rights Management] to prevent the use of third-party parts and spares — it’s become common practice to embed just enough software handshaking in replacement parts to invoke section 1201 of the [Digital Millennium Copyright Act], which makes it a felony to bypass “effective means of access control” for copyrighted works. A manufacturer who designs their device to use (copyrighted) software to validate spare parts — something John Deere has become notorious for — can then invoke the DMCA to make it a felony, punishable by a five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine, to make compatible components. The BoingBoing article highlights a further irony: Every company lobbying against competitors making compatible products has benefited greatly from their own competitive compatibility products: for example, Apple ran a high-profile, extremely successful marketing campaign (the Switch campaign) that advised potential customers on how to use Apple products to access files created with Microsoft products. Classic Collective Action Problem What popped out from the Motherboard account was the discrepancy between the resources being spent by Apple and other anti-right-to-repair forces, compared to those in favor of a right to repair. Again, from Motherboard: The records show that companies and organizations lobbying against right to repair legislation spent $366,634 to retain lobbyists in the state between January and April of this year. Thus far, the Digital Right to Repair Coalition—which is generally made up of independent repair shops with several employees—is the only organization publicly lobbying for the legislation. It has spent $5,042 on the effort, according to the records. Now, just to be clear– and to reinforce a point made in the Motherboard article– thwarting right to repair laws is only one of many issues that Apple et al’s lobbyists are no doubt acting on, so to make a straight up comparison of total resources spent by concerned companies no doubt overstates the magnitude of the discrepancy with respect to this single issue. Still, this seems to provide an example of the classic collective action problem, as adumbrated in economist Mancur Olson’s 1965 classic, The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups, about the big gap between what small groups can and are willing to spend to achieve a policy objective that benefits them significantly and what larger groups– up to the size of the total electorate– can and will spend in money and time that harms them overall, but in a more diffuse way. Put another way, small concentrated groups with a common objective find it easier to organise to secure large benefits. Although the larger public may very well benefit from a completely different policy, large groups find it difficult to organize effectively to fund and pursue their policy goals. Olson’s work is by no means the first or only on the topic, and the basic idea has been extended in many other works on how money shapes political outcomes, perhaps most significantly in Thomas Ferguson’s Golden Rule: The Investment Theory of Party Competition and the Logic of MoneyDriven Political Systems. (I want to note in passing that Ferguson, Paul Jorgenson, and Jie Chen earlier this month published an important paper on how political money shapes Congressional votes, Fifty Shades of Green: High Finance, Political Money, and the U.S. Congress, which I intend to discuss at length if a future post). Apple Loses its Innovation Mojo It’s been quite some time– about a decade– since Apple launched the iPhone, its last major product innovation. Since then, the company has instead crapified some of its previous innovations– for instance scuppering the MagSafe that prevents clumsy MacBook users such as myself from damaging our laptops when we inevitably trip over the power cord (and which had once caused me to have to pay out heavily for a new motherboard for a Sony Vaio, which wasn’t so protected). Others have written on this site and elsewhere about other changes Apple has made to Macs that reduced their attractiveness to more savvy computer users. So, given its recent record and with its foreknowledge of exactly what types of products are on the drawing board and in its pipeline, I suppose Apple thinks it makes sense  to double down on strategies such as tied repairs to try and squeeze out revenue from its customers. Apple India Update As for another potential source of revenues, in December of 2016, I posted another piece, Apple Chases Indian Smartphone Market By Asking Modi Government for Manufacturing Deal, discussing the financial incentives the company was seeking to penetrate the world’s second largest smartphone market: India. Although by volume, India is the second largest such market, as I discussed in that post, smartphones only account for about 30% of the total India mobile ‘phone market. As this WSJ account noted this week, Apple Assembles First iPhones in India, the Indian market looms particularly large, as Apple has seen the slowing of its Chinese sales– which previously were a big component of the company’s overall growth. This week we saw rah-rah reports– such as this one in TechCrunch, Apple starts assembling iPhones in India in play for the world’s fastest growing smartphone market, as well as the WSJ count mentioned above– heralding Apple’s foray into smartphone production in India. Local accounts, such as this one in Livemint, Apple starts selling ‘Made in India’ iPhones on trial basis, have been much more skeptical about what the company has actually achieved to date– especially in light of the fanfare with which Tim Cook in December announced its demands.  Over to Livemint: Earlier, Karnataka IT minister Priyank Kharge said that the making of iPhones in India would help Apple lower prices and gain a foothold in the Indian market. He had also expressed hope that it would bring in much needed taxes to the state as well. Apple wants to bring its component manufacturers to India to make parts and export finished phones and is seeking tax concessions on import of key components. Yet notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has failed to cave on key points, according to LiveMint– contrary to what many had expected would be its response when Apple requested financial incentives to expand its Indian market presence.  As I noted in my piece cited above, Apple currently has less than a 5% Indian market share. Now, I’m just speculating wildly here– so please indulge me– but it seems that the relevant decision makers may have decided that Apple needs more sales in India more than India needs more iPhones, especially if to secure more of those would require significant state support or concessions: However, the central government has rejected most of the demands of the US company. Kharge also had said if the centre was keen on taking on China, it should not give special treatment to Apple alone, but to other players like Samsung and Lenovo also if they are desirous of opening manufacturing units in India. Kharge had said the government should also give companies, including Apple, certain timelines, subsidies and incentives to create a level-playing field. And, if my speculation above regarding actions taken– or equally likely, inaction allowed, that being a time-honored bureaucratic response to an uncomfortable request– is indeed correct, all I can say is: Jai Hind! 001611 This entry was posted in Environment, Global warming, Globalization, Guest Post, India, Legal, Politics, Regulations and regulators, Social policy, Social values, The destruction of the middle class on May 21, 2017 by Jerri-Lynn Scofield.

And Apple products tend to cater to that demand. The thinner and lighter that you design electronics, the more difficult it is to repair it. You can’t have both. (eg, your phone gets held together by glue and not screws, integrated motherboards, etc). If you really care about repairability, cheap ifixit dot com first. they publish a repairability score for popular phone models. and for computers stay away from Apple (if you can) and look at the corporate-orientated Windows models (not the models that you see at your local Mega-Lo Mart consumer chains). Reply ↓ flora May 21, 2017 at 11:59 am Don’t lose sight of the forest for the trees. Reply ↓ Pat May 21, 2017 at 1:04 pm 1. Considering the number of people running around with extra chargers and even chunky extra battery cases for their iPhones, I’m pretty damn sure that most of the Apple users would happily put up with a slightly thicker iPhone with a user replaceable battery. IOW they end up giving that thinness and aesthetics to make it work anyway. 2. The same thing with the tablets and laptops. 3. Also if smart phone users could replace their screens for a reasonable amount of money without voiding the rest of their warranty, or even without that, a whole lot of people would. I know of few people who really want to walk around using a phone with a screen of glass shards held together by what is essentially a thin piece of tape. Apple blocking this is largely about keeping a very lucrative business going, and even more about keeping their aura of exclusivity. This is both shortsighted and destructive because phones and computers are the least of the issues in regard to right to repair – see also automobiles, farm machinery and yes your refrigerators and washers and… This is going to happen whether Apple likes it or not, largely because manufacturers have gotten stupid about the you don’t own it attitude – consumers are only starting to rebel. That is going to grow as it becomes very apparent that manufacturers are NOT selling products but leasing for purchase prices, aka stealing . And standing in the way of repair is a loser in the long run because dropping the fraudulent business model and its front will be less destructive to them then people figuring out the scam. Reply ↓ Temporarily Sane May 21, 2017 at 5:24 pm as Apple users tend to be the ones with the most vocal priority on aesthetics Do you have any reliable stats to back up this claim? Didn’t think so. Why bring it up at all…it has nothing to do with any of the points raised in the article and it really says more about you than anything else. Reply ↓ redleg May 21, 2017 at 8:17 pm Apple is like a religion. Reply ↓ John Wright May 21, 2017 at 11:42 am I work in the electronics industry. Repairing a modern densely populated printed circuit assembly is tricky and requires costly equipment as I detailed in a long winded earlier posting to the previous discussion. http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/01/waste-not-want-not-right-repair-laws-on-agenda-states.html#comment-2755952 On the right to repair, some of these companies might be opposed to this legislation for other than pure service profit reasons. One reason is they might fear having to do triage after a poor quality third party repair or have their brand tarnished in the marketplace by apparent poor reliability after a third party repair.. Another possible reason for their opposition to the legislation is that the legislation might require companies to release what they currently classify as proprietary information they want to keep from competitors . The Massachusetts S96 bill (line 14) mentions “schematic diagrams” as part of the documentation provided to the “authorized repair provider”. see https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/S96.pdf In my experience, many complex schematic diagrams are treated as company confidential design information for internal use only. Hence, I would expect tech companies to resist attempts requiring them to release this information to outside parties. Reply ↓ david lamy May 21, 2017 at 12:26 pm It would be easier to concede to this line of reasoning if at the point of purchase it was made clear that my purchase was for a license to use the product. Therefore it was obviously evident that the hardware remained the property of the manufacturer. I do not believe that to be the case for any of my computer purchases. I own the hardware. I should have a list of its constituent parts and a diagram for their connections. Yes, the production processes may be trade secrets but disassembly manuals be available at a reasonable purchase price. Reply ↓ John Wright May 21, 2017 at 1:33 pm The Massachusetts bill was covering more than disassembly as it apparently requires board schematics to be released to the outside repair facilities. I don’t see any problem with a customer “owning” the product and attempting to fix it with minimal assistance from the original manufacturer. You are free to attempt to repair a board without disassembly instructions and a schematic, as I did a couple of weeks ago on a vintage 1985 Sony digital readout for a machine tool. I disassembled it with a screwdriver and repaired the PCA’s (at least it is working so far). But 1985 vintage through hole technology and tin-lead solder is a lot easier to work with than a very dense surface mount PCA assembled with lead-free solder. Quite possibly new consumer goods are not designed to be taken apart, or require a costly special fixture/tool to disassemble or specialized test equipment to test the repair.. I maintain the companies do have reasons other than profits to keep repairs at their authorized facilities. Reply ↓ Tinky May 21, 2017 at 3:42 pm You make a fair point, but it doesn’t explain why Apple has gone from producing products that allowed simple and very useful modular customization, to those that don’t allow any. They are undoubtedly taking advantage of their 800 pound gorilla status, and many long-standing and loyal customers suffer as a result. Reply ↓ kees_popinga May 21, 2017 at 3:59 pm I had a Mac SE I bought in the 80s that I wanted to throw out but I planned to keep the hard drive. To open the case you had to remove pentalobular screws that were deeply recessed in the handle, requiring longer-than-standard adapters for a screwdriver. I ended up paying a junk hauler to open the case with a sledgehammer. My point being, Apple has always made it hard for consumers to mess with their splendid gear. Reply ↓ justanotherprogressive May 21, 2017 at 12:59 pm Errr….I need to replace the battery in my MacBook. How hard can that be? I’ve done it with other laptops. But I have to pay a “Genius” $150 just because it is an Apple? Reply ↓ Pat May 21, 2017 at 1:12 pm Well yeah, when it is designed to make you do that by unnecessarily hiding the battery. And just for the record the poor Genius is lucky to making a little above minimum wage, so it is really having to pay Apple a well over $100 surcharge to have a flunky “Genius” replace it (cost of battery with Genius hourly wage). Reply ↓ katiebird May 21, 2017 at 1:50 pm I’ve replaced mine twice (the first one was recalled for fire issues) it was easy as pie — I got the battery online then followed these instructions from iFixIt. They’ve got instructions for every model of Macbook. Then I bought more memory and upgraded that myself. Next step is to get an SSD…. Reply ↓ Yves Smith May 21, 2017 at 3:51 pm Oh come on. I have friends who run IT firms. One ran an ISP. It is not hard to do any of: 1. Install memory (even I have done this) 2. Replace a hard disk 3. If the computer is designed so as not to prohibit it, replace a battery 4. Replace a fan I suspect readers can add to this list. I suspect this list accounts for >60% of repairs, perhaps even higher. Reply ↓ John Wright May 21, 2017 at 6:43 pm Yves, But the right of repair legislation in Massachusetts is asking for schematics, which I understood to be board schematics, perhaps to allow troubleshooting/repair of printed circuit assemblies. Schematics should not be needed for any of your listed repairs. All of your repairs listed are probably already being done by independent repair shops, so this legislation may be, per your words, unnecessary for “>60% of repairs, perhaps even higher”. As mentioned above, if the legislation requires manufacturers to release schematics and possible test/qualification information for complex PCA’s, this could explain some of the manufacturer pushback. While Apple may appear greedy in this action, that may not be a completely fair assessment of their behavior. I have no connection with Apple and do not use their products.. Reply ↓ flora May 21, 2017 at 7:06 pm schematics are for the benefit 3rd party parts manufacturers and independent repair shops. Reply ↓ Mike Mc May 21, 2017 at 7:49 pm Have used, sold, serviced and now repaired Macs since 1987. The crapification of Apple goes in cycles; the latest MacBook Pros from late 2016 are not designed to be serviced or repaired by anyone other than certified Apple technicians like myself… and it’s a pain in the neck of us, even with several hundred dollars worth of Apple tools needed to service these models. I think it’s a mistake, but it is their company and millions of customers the world over have voted with their dollars in favor of this approach. I live in a farm state, and John Deere is doing similar things with farming equipment that sells for six figures. There’s a movement against that I suspect will only grow. The sooner some significant economic disruption occurs, the faster this will happen. The inability of so many people today to do anything mechanical or technical for themselves is the real problem. Millennials get pranged for this all the time but let me tell you, every class suffers from this. I would love to see technology to be more user-friendly inside and out – not just some twee new app or interface, but easily repaired and recycled. Mr. Market will never provide this; the government will have to mandate this, but without government mandates – laws and regulations – rivers would still be catching fire and smog would still be part of urban landscapes. Reply ↓ charles 2 May 21, 2017 at 10:24 pm But it is hard to do it right ! IT devices, hardware of software, are made of many interacting parts that work only if the operationnal requirement of any specific part is fulfilled by all the others. The dirty secret of IT, and indeed of practically all complex engineered systems, is that these requirements are practically never documented exhaustively, even inside the company who is manufacturing them. It is even more true with the current practices of “agile” design and job volatility for system designers. You may think that a memory bar is just of memory bar, a hard disk is just a hard disk or a dvd storage device is just a dvd storage device : It is definitely not the case : I know first hand instances of unwanted behaviour, such as inability to apply OS patches (not a good thing with Windows nowadays !), linked to self-sourced upgrade/repair components as mundane as in the list above. That is not to say that I am against “Right to repair” laws, far from it. I am all for the disclosure of complete specification of parts, but one should not fool oneself with the belief that there is a shortcut to assimilating that knowledge. Someone has to do it before the repair and that someone should be paid. One should be careful that “right to repair” doesn’t become “right to have your device bricked by an incompetent and irresponsible technician that you refused to pay adequately”. As they say, when you pay peanuts, you get monkeys… Reply ↓ Abate Magic Thinking but NOT Money May 21, 2017 at 11:20 pm Get Over it The current de-facto halfway house between owning and renting might be unsustainable. It seems that if the developers and sellers of (next to magic) technology want to keep their product’s secrets and servicing totally in-house, their best option is rental, and only rental. Wasn’t it Hughes who made this his business model? I have had a fetish for certain bits of technology, but much of what I have owned, Is so much landfill unfortunately, so at the right price renting would make sense. Where government should step is in re-cycling ,and insisting on increases in efficiency. Of course, those renting-out technology should be impelled to cater for the whole market, not just take the cream off the top as it is now. Come on you disruptors – but no hidden agenda please.

When Apple was but a wee lad, it provided the source code, printed, in the user manual, for the Apple ][. Reply ↓ UserFriendly May 21, 2017 at 1:44 pm Medtronic? Yes I want to repair my own Pace Maker… WTF? Surely there would be an exception for medical implants to prevent hacking of them. Reply ↓ digi_owl May 21, 2017 at 1:48 pm I will claim that iphone crapified the smartphone market. Not sure if ever Apple has been a big “innovator” ever since the original Woz computer. Instead they have been riding the Jobs reality distortion field and and a few captive markets like desktop publishing. Reply ↓ jonhoops May 21, 2017 at 2:44 pm Dude… did you ever try use a smartphone before the iPhone? You are seriously just talking out of your ass. The iPhone made using the internet on mobile easy. Not to mention how easy it made texting compared to the stupid thumb method. It also gave us an easy to use camera and music experience, plus easy GPS mapping all which was nonexistent or crap on the incumbent “smartphones”. There is a reason Apple is now worth nearly a Trillion Market Cap and has 250 billion in the bank. iPhone was a great product, and still is. Apple is clearly coasting now and I’m not happy about that, but your own reality distortion field is off the charts. Desktop Publishing? That was 34 years ago. Reply ↓ a different chris May 21, 2017 at 3:36 pm I’m with you up to here: > There is a reason Apple is now worth nearly a Trillion Market Cap and has 250 billion Yeah but the reason is people are insane, it isn’t that their tech kung-fu is so far ahead of anybody else’s. Or even ahead at all methinks. And my family all has iPhones. Reply ↓ Ook May 21, 2017 at 11:38 pm I used (Japanese) smartphones before the iPhone. Functionality was not really the issue. The innovation of the iPhone was really that it opened up the field of app development by standard means, versus what had previously required an embedded software approach. It was a big deal 10 years ago. Reply ↓ oh May 21, 2017 at 7:51 pm There are a lot of Apple fan boys around. The one redeeming feature of Apple is that they don’t (yet) sell your personal data. Reply ↓ Kramer May 21, 2017 at 3:00 pm I bet ALEC is on the case working on some manufacturer’s rights legislation to protect free enterprise from this BIG GOVERNMENT intrusion. We need some organization like a ALEC to represent humans, a smart ALEC. Is there an organization already working to craft model legislation for all fifty states for the benefit of all Americans.

Reply ↓ paul May 21, 2017 at 3:29 pm I’m not sure you should add the ‘nobel winning’ economist description to mancur olson, though, to my relief, he has no connection with the chocolate nobel. That would drag him down to the level of krugman Reply ↓ Jerri-Lynn Scofield Post authorMay 21, 2017 at 4:55 pm You’re right– I’ve corrected my error. Thanks! Reply ↓ charles 2 May 21, 2017 at 10:50 pm It’s been quite some time– about a decade– since Apple launched the iPhone, its last major product innovation. That is a bit unfair. With Airpods , which are to standard bluetooth ear pieces what the iPhone was to the Blackberry when it appeared, Apple really cracked the problem of how wireless headphones should be used. Combine it with a next generation watch with LTE capability and improved power capabilities and you will realise that it may not be a minor innovation.

Apple Anna Scantlin Contributing Editor | May 21, 2017 0 shares 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0               The iPad Mini, released in 2012, was a breath of fresh air from its large and clunky older brothers, the iPad and iPad 2. At the time, a smaller and lighter tablet made sense. The original iPad Mini even managed to keep up with the specs of the larger iPad 2, and even had some upgrades like a better front-facing camera and Lightning connector. The iPad Mini is currently in its 4th generation, but recent rumors suggest that the 4th may be the last. After just 4 years of existence, is it time to retire the iPad Mini? If true, it wouldn’t be unprecedented. Apple wouldn’t phase out something that was well worth the company’s time and effort, and demand for the iPad Mini likely dwindled after the 9.7-inch iPad went from heavy and clunky to thin and light with the introduction to the lighter iPad Air and iPad Pro models. Other rumors suggest that even the 9.7-inch iPad will phase out soon as well, but only in regards to the screen size; Apple’s World Wide Developer Conference (referred to as WWDC) will allegedly introduced new 10.5-inch iPad, which would fit in the same body as the current 9.7-inch iPads by shrinking bezels. At the same time, I would be surprised if the iPad Mini was phasing out. Apple also introduced the 12.9-inch iPad Pro back in 2015, so I would think that keeping three different sizes would mean Apple would have the perfect (or close to) solution for everybody. After all, the iPhone has essentially the same set up between the iPhone Plus, iPhone, and iPhone SE. However, another aspect to consider about this potential move is that, simply put, most people don’t upgrade their tablets as often as they do their smartphones. Even if the iPad Mini was a favorite product, if enough people don’t upgrade often enough – if they don’t have a reason to upgrade often enough, I should say – then it just becomes another valid reason why the iPad Mini may very well get the axe. While I haven’t owned nor any interest in an iPad Mini in a few years, one thing that I know would spark my interest would be an iPad Mini with Apple Pencil support. I used to own a Galaxy Note 8.0 tablet, and I absolutely loved its size and ability to work with the docked S Pen. I’ve tested the Apple Pencil on both iPad Pro models and found it precise, comfortable, and enjoyable, but wished the tablets themselves had the compact form factor of my old Galaxy Note 8.0. As it stands right now, the iPad Mini 4 doesn’t offer much over the new entry level 2017 iPad. Offered at $399 for the 128GB model (the only model available) it’s only $30 less than the 128GB 9.7-inch 2017 model, and $70 more than the entry-level 9.7-inch 32GB model. The main differentiator is the screen size, but for some people that’s the most important factor regardless of price. From my perspective, the jump from 7.9 to 9.7-inch display (or whatever screen may end up in the current 9.7-inch body) isn’t so big it’s uncomfortable. I’m sure there are a few people out there that will be upset if the rumor ends up being true, but even so, the nice thing about iPads is that they can last for a very long time without suffering much in the way of performance. I still have an original iPad Air that works perfectly well for what I use it for, and it will be 4 years old later this year. Alternatively, even if Apple is no longer interested in small tablets, Amazon appears to be going full-force on its affordable 8-inch tablet line. The only caveat, of course, is that it doesn’t run on iOS and Fire OS is only based on Android, but has its limitations. Still, if screen size is the most important feature, then it’s good to know that there are options out there. Readers, what are your thoughts? Do you think the evolution of iPads have negated the need for iPad Minis, or should Apple keep them around?  Apple iPad Mini 4 Apple Apple iPad mini 4 Apple iPad Mini Apple iPad Air Apple iPad Pro Products mentioned Apple iPad mini 4 Apple iPad Mini Apple iPad Air Apple iPad Pro Next ArticleAre you satisfied with your phone?

Jennifer Bailey, the head of Apple’s payments business, said over half of contactless payment terminals in the UK are now able to take Apple Pay transactions of any value. Most card readers had previously been restricted to £30, the default upper limit for contactless card transactions. The upgrades, which Ms Bailey said applied to hundreds of thousands of terminals, means shoppers in many places can make payments of any value without taking their wallet with them. When Apple Pay was launched in the UK in 2015, only a handful of retailers accepted “limitless” transactions. Higher-value payments are seen as a key advantage for Apple over contactless cards as it seeks to grow its payments business. Some reports have suggested mobile payments getting off to a slow start, with consumers sometimes unaware of the technology or struggling to see the benefits over card payments. 300pc the increase in UK apple pay transactions Contactless card payments are limited to £30 to prevent fraud, since they do not require shoppers to enter a PIN. Apple Pay transactions, which are made by holding an iPhone or Apple Watch against a card reader, are approved using the iPhone fingerprint scanner or watch’s biometric sensors. The extra security allows Apple Pay to make payments of any value, but retailers have had to embark on a programme of terminal upgrades to support them. “We think the majority of the contactless terminals [in the UK] are now limitless,” Ms Bailey said. Retailers now accepting the higher-value payments include supermarkets such as Waitrose and Sainsbury's and restaurants including Pizza Express and Nando's. Supermarkets including Waitrose now take higher-value transactions Credit: PA The company says Apple Pay transactions in the UK have grown by 300pc in the last year, with 23 banks now supporting the service. “Our momentum has been fantastic. We’re really excited about the progress,” Ms Bailey said. Apple, which charges a transaction fee for payments made with the service, sees Apple Pay as one of the ways it can grow its services business, as other areas such as the iPhone and iPad slow. The service, which debuted in the US in 2014, has expanded to 16 countries after launching in Italy last week. It competes against rival offerings from Google, which brought Android Pay to the UK last year, and Samsung, which unveiled its Samsung Pay service last week. Ms Bailey hinted that Apple was working on new technology that would replace other parts of the wallet apart from credit cards. “If you think about all the things in your wallet, we're thinking about all those things, we're probably actively working on most of them,” she said. “We’re starting with payments. Some are longer term, we see this as a long term journey rather than something we can solve in the next 12 months.” Share this article Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest View comments If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Please review our commenting policy Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest Related Topics Credit cards Apple Watch Apple Show more Technology latest 21 May 2017, 5:34pm Comment: Facebook's biggest battle yet will be with governments James Titcomb Premium 21 May 2017, 6:00am How emojis can save your relationship - and help men understand what women mean 20 May 2017, 6:45pm Fancy buying shares in a masterpiece?

For your average student at the prestigious New York University, Dejian Zeng had a really unconventional Summer internship job. The 23-year-old student went undercover in a Chinese factory which was contracted to assemble Apple iPhones. Working six days a week on the assembly line he spent the better part of six weeks repeatedly putting screws in the back of Apple's popular smartphones, over and over again. Most of us would recoil at the idea but he embarked on the surreptitious mission because he wanted to see "how the workers feel and what their lives were like," he told news.com.au. "They're not happy about it but they're not very angry," he said. They mostly come from rural areas and because they feel like they are lacking in education, they don't have many options. "They're kind of expecting it to be very tiring, very boring and that they're going to have to work long hours," he said. During the week Zeng would spend 12 hours inside the factory (but only get paid for 10.5 hours) and screw approximately 1800 screws into 1800 iPhones. He and the rest of the workers would also work an eight hour day on Saturday. Sunday was their only rest day. For this monotonous and laborious work he was paid 3100 yuan a month after meals and board were taken out, or by today's exchange rate, just A$606 ($651). For the 60 hours weeks he worked, on the occasion there was no forced overtime, that works out to be about A$2.50 ($2.69) an hour. Zeng worked putting screws in the back of iPhone 6s and iPhone 7s and said the various jobs on the assembly line seemed to be handed out at random with the less taxing jobs usually given to female workers.

Related Content Brownlee won't be describing UN's Israel resolution as 'premature' again says PM Your Views: Readers' letters Bosses can have right to know about criminal charges, despite name suppression says Supreme Court The investigation was a result of a partnership between NYU and a Chinese NGO called China Labor Watch which periodically sends undercover workers into factories to investigate working conditions. When Zeng interned with the NGO last year, he soon found himself happily being sent to factory near Shanghai owned by Taiwanese contract manufacturing giant Pegatron which was contracted to assemble the Apple devices. The "Interview" Getting a job inside the factory was incredibly easy. Zeng said he simply "rocked up" outside the building with a crowd of other job hopefuls during an intake with their luggage in hand. The most strenuous part on the interview process was reciting the English alphabet, he said. "There was a quick interview process that you show your hands and recite English alphabet. It's just so easy." A vast majority of the workers lived in eight-bed dormitories at the site of the factory for 160 yuan a month, deducted from their salary. The facilities included a gym and a counselling and therapy office for workers. Employees were not allowed to take any electronics inside the factory production area but Zeng took a number of photos of the living quarters and surrounding areas which he shared with news.com.au. Workers in their uniform, which includes slippers for the factory floor, waiting to begin work. The factory was chosen because according to China Labor Watch at the time it had increased the base wage of workers to comply with new minimum wage laws but at the same time cut stipends and the few benefits afforded to workers, leaving them worse off. As a result Zeng expected workers to strike soon after he arrived but it never materialised. Yelling is just so normal During their days on the assembly line workers would chat to those around them and sometimes sing songs - but that was often punctuated by managers yelling at workers to increase their pace. "They (managers) had a very bad attitude to workers" and would consistently yell at those not doing their job fast enough, Zeng said. "Yelling is just so normal, you can hear them every day." "Every second counts," was the manager manifesto on the factory floor. He recalled one incident in which a manager stopped an entire assembly line from working and gathered them together to yell at one worker who was new and wasn't keeping up the pace. "One day all of a sudden the manager just totally exploded," Zeng said. "We were all shocked. That's just one incident I remember so clearly." Human rights activists and labour rights activists have made a concerted push to highlight any violations and improve the conditions of factory workers in developing economies who underpin the digital revolution in the West. Dejian Zeng graduated this week with a Masters in Public Administration. Another Taiwanese manufacturer of iPhones, the more notorious Foxconn, is also characteristically media shy but the company's factories have seen their fair share of scrutiny in recent years following a string of worker suicides in 2010, 2011 and 2013. As well as a deadly fire at a plant that manufactured iPads in 2011. The Pegatron factory where Zeng went undercover was also profiled by the BBC in 2014 and Bloomberg in 2016, both of which reported cases of forced excessive overtime and difficult working conditions. Apple says it always has staff on the ground monitoring their assembly factories and Zeng did recall seeing them "two or three times" in their highly visible green tracksuits. But when managers knew they were coming they would be on their best behaviour, he said, and instruct the employees to clean up and work quietly. "And then they (the Apple employees) would just walk by. That would be it." Apple technicians were also occasionally required to monitor that products were being assembled properly. Don't take your products for granted Dejian Zeng graduated this week with a Masters in Public Administration from NYU and plans to work for a human rights based organisation with a focus on China. As for his stint undercover, and the report that ensued, he says it was all about making customers of Apple products aware of what they're buying and how it got to them. "When you use your iPhones and Macbooks, don't take it for granted. And realise that there's thousands of people working day and night, like 24 hours, in the factory to produce the product that you are using," he said. Investigations like these by the Chinese NGO are also aimed at the company themselves which are selling the end product in hopes they will be pressured into improving conditions for overseas factory workers. "We want Apple to see it. A lot of the time the target is Apple," Zeng said. "We think there is some work to be done." - news.com.au By Nick Whigham Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Later this year, Apple is probably going to follow tradition and release an iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, with the usual incremental upgrades we’ve come to expect. But there’s also a rumour that there’ll be a third special edition model – dubbed the iPhone 8 – that will be launched in celebration of the iPhone’s 10th anniversary. The latest in a long series of leaks suggesting that will be the case comes from tipster blog Slashleaks, which has published a new report containing an image posted to Chinese social media site Weibo. The image shows a side-by-side comparison of what appear to be iPhone moulds. They’re the cut-outs that suppliers use to build handset chassis. Importantly, the image depicts three different models in descending size order, each captioned with ‘7S Plus’, ‘8’, and ‘7S’ respectively. That follows the rumours that the iPhone 8 will fall somewhere between the two other phones in terms of size. Unfortunately, it’s not possible to verify the legitimacy of these moulds. Although Weibo can often turn out quality leaks, it’s also a hotbed of fakery – it’s basically China’s Twitter, after all. However, it’s looking increasingly likely that there will be a special edition iPhone 8, so we wouldn’t discount the image entirely. Apple is tipped to be plotting major hardware upgrades for the model. For instance, we’re expecting to see an all-screen front, similar to the Samsung Galaxy S8 or LG G6. It’s also rumoured that there’ll be vertically arranged dual camera on the back – that’s even depicted in the leak. The other big rumour is that Apple will fit the iPhone 8 with an OLED screen, which would be a first for the iPhone. Samsung has been using OLED panels on the flagship Galaxy series for years, so there’s plenty of pressure on Apple to make the switch. After all, OLED panels are far more power efficient – and offer improvements to colour gamut and dynamic range – over conventional LCD displays.

Today, the SoftBank founder has almost $100 billion to invest on making the next big thing a reality. Son’s SoftBank Group Corp. closed the first round of a planned $100 billion investment fund, with money raised from Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, as well as Apple Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. The Vision Fund gives the 59-year-old access to a pool of capital unparalleled in the worlds of private equity or venture capital -- the equivalent of four Silver Lakes or 15 Sequoia Capitals. Masayoshi Son and Yasir Alrumayyan, managing director of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, right. Photographer: Bandar Algaloud/ Saudi Royal Council/ Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Son isn’t one for understatement. He has said, without irony, that he has a 300-year plan for SoftBank and aims to build the world’s most valuable company. With the Vision Fund, Son vows to become the biggest investor in tech over the next decade, as he bets on the future of artificial intelligence, connected devices, satellites and the integration of computers and humans. Indeed in April, he led the $5.5 billion investment in China’s Didi Chuxing, the largest venture funding on record. “We saw a big bang in PCs, we saw a big bang in the internet,” Son said in February on a call with shareholders. “I believe the next big bang is going to be even bigger. To be ready for that, we need to set the foundation and that foundation is SoftBank Vision Fund.” Son has some enthusiastic supporters, with very deep pockets. Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman agreed to make his country the cornerstone investor with a $45 billion check after a meeting with Son. Besides Apple and Qualcomm, Foxconn Technology Group and Sharp Corp. are also putting in capital. SoftBank said Saturday the fund has $93 billion in committed capital and aims to reach $100 billion with a final close within six months. Forget Retirement. SoftBank CEO Aims to Be Biggest Tech Investor Son’s mega-fund will unleash an unprecedented amount of money into sectors already seen as overcapitalized. Private equity returns have plummeted in recent years because there’s too much money chasing too few deals. Venture capital faces similar issues. “A $100 billion fund is mind boggling,” says Steven Kaplan, a professor at University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business who co-founded its entrepreneurship program. “There’s too much capital now so bringing in more capital doesn’t make any sense.” Billionaire Masayoshi Son at a news conference in February. Photographer: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg Kaplan struggled to think of a precedent for what Son is attempting. He said the closest parallel may be the late 1990s when money poured into U.S. internet companies, fueling sky-high valuations -- right until the market crashed. Private equity firms are sitting on record piles of cash. The amount of unspent money hit $820 billion at the end of 2016, up from $755 billion a year earlier, according to the research firm Preqin. The venture total hit $142 billion, compared with $127 billion at the end of 2015. “There is already a tremendous amount of dry powder out there,” says Felice Egidio, the firm’s head of venture capital products. “Investment opportunities are getting harder and harder to come by.” In other words, Son may be more than the most powerful investor in tech -- he may be the most dangerous too. A flood of capital into artificial intelligence or driver-less cars, can inflate valuations and spawn too many competitors, leaving everyone struggling to make money. SoftBank’s Cyber Keiretsu Son has spent his life defying expectations. He left Japan at 16 to study in the U.S. and ended up at the University of California at Berkeley. While in school, he invented an electronic translator that he sold to Sharp, making his first $1 million. “It’s like he’s from the future,” said Hong Lu, who began working with Son in California 40 years ago and went on to co-found UTStarcom Holdings Corp. Son founded his own company in 1981 and began to distribute software for companies like Microsoft Corp. He then built it through a series of high-stakes bets. In a deal that would supply him with cash for other investments, he acquired Vodafone Group Plc’s struggling Japan business and turned it into a profit machine. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up His fearlessness almost cost him his company. During the internet bubble, he invested in about 800 companies, vowing to create a "netbatsu," the digital age equivalent of Japan’s zaibatsu industrial conglomerates bound by cross-share ownership. SoftBank shares surged and Son’s net worth hit $68 billion in 2000, almost surpassing Microsoft’s Bill Gates as the world’s richest man. Then the bubble burst and hundreds of his investments went under. His stock fell 99 percent. But among the wreckage, Son had some winners. He was an early backer of Yahoo! Inc. and he bet on China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which turned into one of the best venture bets of all time. He parlayed an initial $20 million investment into a stake that is now valued at more than $90 billion, or 4,500 times his original investment. If Son was spooked by the crash, he never let it show. He continued to cut big deals, including the $22 billion acquisition of U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp. Last year, he made the biggest deal of his career, buying chipmaker ARM Holdings for $32 billion. After the announcement, his stock got hammered as stunned investors fled. “It would be unfair to Masa Son if we said we were not warned that some ‘crazy ideas’ were on anvil,” Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies Group, wrote at the time. “To us, the ARM acquisition announced yesterday appears largely inconsistent with SoftBank’s investment strategy ... It does not inspire much confidence.” Son responded with an impassioned pitch. He argued this is a rare moment in history when technology’s rapid evolution provides opportunities that may never appear again. “People think this was a stupid move, they’ve voted with their money,” Son said at the time. “It’s easy to look at where your pieces are now and place the next one nearby. This one is 10, 20, 50 moves ahead.” SoftBank Closes Funding For Record $93 Billion Investment Fund That set the stage for the Vision Fund. Son saw once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, while SoftBank’s investors fretted the risks. The question was where he could find a new set of backers willing to finance his vision of the future. Masayoshi Son. Photographer: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg Then the Saudi deputy crown prince came to Tokyo last September just as he was looking for ways to diversify his country’s economy beyond oil. The prince needed to invest billions of petro-dollars in new industries -- he even called his effort ‘Vision 2030.’ SoftBank’s Vision Fund was announced publicly in October and Son’s deal-making synapses have been firing even before the fund closed. Son agreed to invest $1 billion in OneWeb Ltd., a startup that aims to beam internet connectivity to every corner of the globe. He is also putting $300 million into WeWork Cos., a New York-based startup that rents out offices to small businesses and freelancers. Son is raising the Vision Fund because he sees deals he thinks are even more promising than Alibaba. In his February call, he cited the leaders of the sharing economy, including Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc. SoftBank is behind major funding for rivals to Uber. Didi, the biggest ride-hailing service in China, last month announced its record $5.5 billion fundraising, led by the Japanese company. Southeast Asian operator Grab plans to raise more than $1.5 billion in a round backed by the Japanese company, people familiar with the matter have said. “Uber is redefining the transportation industry now; Airbnb is doing it to the hotel industry. You can expect that to happen in every single industry,” he said in February. He has given a few details of how he plans to use the capital. It is likely to be a mixture of many investments on the scale of OneWeb with a handful of very large deals. “This won’t be a typical fund,” he said in February. “Most of our investments will range between 20 and 40 percent, making us the largest shareholder and board member, in a position to discuss strategy with the founders.” Uber’s Kalanick Should Fear This 59-Year-Old Billionaire: Gadfly The Vision Fund will be based in West London’s Mayfair and advised by SoftBank subsidiaries collectively called SB Investment Advisers. Rajeev Misra, SoftBank’s head of strategic finance, will be chief executive officer of SB Investment Advisers and a member of the fund’s investment committee. Son will have unusual influence. He will be the only so-called key man in the fund, according to a person familiar with the matter. There are typically several people with such a designation in investment funds, which gives limited partners the option to withdraw from the fund if one of those key men leave. Dealmakers are cautious. Ted Gooden, managing director at Berkshire Capital Corp., predicts returns are likely to decline given the excess of capital. “There is so much money in the system, it changes the industry,” he said. Not everyone outside of Son’s orbit is a skeptic though.  David Brophy, a finance professor at the University of Michigan, said the sheer size of SoftBank’s fund will give Son advantages that no other investor has. He can jump into deals that are more capital intensive than anyone else can handle and he can keep funding them longer. “You can walk in with muscle that no one else has,” said Brophy, who is also director of the university’s Office for the Study of Private Equity Finance. “I wouldn’t focus too much on what we see in the rear view mirror. It’s more important to look ahead.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) buying Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). The odds, according to InvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli, are less than 5%, perhaps non-existent. No, there’s another number that you might want to focus on when considering an investment in Tesla stock. Source: Shutterstock Tim Cook recently announced that Apple was establishing a billion-dollar fund to create advanced manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Part goodwill gesture, part public relations effort, part good business, Cook recognizes that Apple’s success is intertwined with a healthy American economy. On May 12, Apple made its first investment from the fund, awarding Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) $200 million to put toward research and development and capital equipment needs for its glass business. Apple, not coincidentally, uses Corning as a supplier of glass screens for its iPhones. “Corning is a great example of a supplier that has continued to innovate and they are one of Apple’s long-standing suppliers,” Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams said in a statement. “This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone, and today every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America.” While this move might seem self-serving to some, it shows just how important technology and innovation is to economic development in this country or any other … and that leads to an important factor when it comes to Tesla stock. Leveraging Innovation Apple claims that it’s indirectly responsible for creating 2 million jobs in the U.S., including 80,000 Apple employees in all 50 states. Since 2008, U.S. app developers have made $16 billion from the App Store. Over the past 19 years, Apple has directly created 75,000 jobs in the U.S. — a compound annual growth rate of 15.7%. It’s impossible to overstate the importance of Apple to the U.S. economy; the same applies to TSLA. More than four years ago, I wrote an article entitled Why America Needs More Teslas, in which I laid out why the risks associated with owning Tesla stock were worth it. It’s up 1,000% since then. Why such dramatic gains? Innovation, of course. The kind that Apple’s investing $1 billion to help nurture. Tesla’s Value to the Economy Well, first consider the direct contribution Tesla’s made regarding job creation. In the past four years, Tesla and SolarCity created 24,551 jobs, perhaps as many as 90% of those in the U.S. — a compound annual growth rate of 53%. So, if Apple created jobs in the U.S. at a rate of 16% per year, and Tesla/SolarCity did so at 53% annually, one might argue that Tesla’s contribution to American job creation is almost four times as great on an, ahem, apples-to-apples basis. I get that Tesla didn’t spend anywhere near the $50 billion that Apple spent in fiscal 2016 with its 9,000 U.S. suppliers and manufacturers, but again, it’s all relative.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     See How IOS 10.3.1 And IOS 10.3.2 Rate In An Exclusive Battery Life Test Posted: May 21 2017, 11:09am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple     iOS 10 is taking way too long to diminish, somehow, Apple seems like they think they are still unfinished with one of the most loved versions of the operating system. iOS 10.3.3 was quickly released after 10.3.2 to give developers the breathing space and reap advantages of the added and stabilized functionality. Don't Miss: Today's Best Deals on Amazon.com So, as you could imagine, the usual drill is that a bunch of YouTube channels answer to every question that could ever come out of the top of their head or your head. The battery life difference between the two iOS versions is another one of those questions, and it has been answered by iAppleBytes channel on YouTube. Version upgrades are quite confusing, a bundle of bugs is bearable by the new users, we are alright with memory management, we won’t mind if our favorite application takes a second longer than the previous version. One thing that will scare iOS users to upgrade to new versions is the battery life. Battery life is one of the most common headache in humankind today, and we would happily stick to an older version of iOS rather than upgrading to a new one and sacrificing a few ounces of battery life in the process. Again, as is usual with all of our other test videos, we will not be spoiling the fun for you, nor will we reveal the result here. Although I must say, watch this video, there are a few surprises.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Mon, May 22, 2017 - Page 14　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Rare Apple 1 fetches less than expected AFP, BERLIN An Apple 1 produced in 1976 is displayed at an auction house in Cologne, Germany, on May 12. Photo: AFP A rare working Apple 1, the first computer produced by Steve Jobs’ world-beater-to-be company four decades ago, sold for less than expected at an auction in Germany on Saturday. One of only eight working models in the world, the machine fetched 110,000 euros (US$125,000), well below the expected 180,000 euros to 300,000 euros — suggesting that a spike in prices after Jobs’ 2011 death is definitely over. “From our point of view we are back at normal levels. Five years after the death of [Apple Inc cofounder] Steve Jobs, the ‘hype’ has settled back,” said Uwe Breker, who oversaw the auction in Cologne, Germany. Breker’s auction house, which specializes in the sale of technical antiques, had also been involved in a 2013 sale of another Apple 1 — which fetched 516,000 euros. The model auctioned off on Saturday, and whose original owner was a Californian engineer, still had its receipt, its operating manual and other documents. “[The Apple 1] was one of the first opportunities for someone to possess a real computer. I’d been working with computers for a while, but they were huge,” original owner John Dryden, who bought the Apple in 1976, said on Friday. He admitted that parting with the machine was a wrench, but said the time had come as he had not used it in a long time. The computer was one of about 200 Apple 1 units marketed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, who developed and built it. Saturday’s buyer was a German engineer who collects old computers.

There is no denying that the 2016 MacBook Pro series is a beautiful line of hardware. The laptops themselves are sleek and attractive, and their build quality is just stunning. While the machines were a treat to the eyes, however, they were not so stunning regarding the hardware they offered and the price they commanded. Now, with rumors stating that Apple is gearing up for a June release of a revamped line of MacBooks, it appears that those thinking of purchasing a MacBook Pro would be better off waiting for the 2017 devices to be rolled out. The 2016 MacBook Pros are not weak devices by any means. Equipped with Intel’s 6th-generation Skylake processors, the MBP 2016 series performed adequately for most users. Unfortunately, the devices were quite horrible regarding upgradability, as everything, including the RAM chips of the laptops, were impossible to upgrade. Thus, despite the 2016 MacBook Pro series’ tricks such as the Touch Bar, the machines have not really become as revolutionary as they could have been. This is where the 2017 MacBook Pro comes in. Predictions about the 2017 laptops have long dominated the rumor mill, with speculations pointing to a possible processor and memory upgrade for the upcoming professional-grade machines. According to persistent rumors about the device, the MacBook Pro 2017 would finally be equipped with the best processors available in the market right now, Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake chips, according to a TechRadar report. Apart from this, the memory of the machines is also rumored to be set for an upgrade, with the entry-level variants being fitted with 16GB of RAM across the board and the top-tier models being equipped with a hefty 32GB of RAM. @jordanhudgens – The office this morning is pretty nifty – #angular #angular2 #nodejs #angularjs #code #coder #coding #dev #developer #development #firebase #html #html5 #css #css3 #javascript #js #macbook #macbookpro #nodejs #java #php #software #tech #technology #ruby #webdesign #webdeveloper #sublimetext A post shared by WorldCode Community (@worldcode) on May 21, 2017 at 5:40am PDT These are all speculations, of course, but considering Apple’s upgrade cycles and conventions, these rumors do make sense. For one, there is little doubt that Apple would release a follow-up to last year’s devices, considering how polarizing the machines proved to be. The fact that the 2016 MBP series launched with outdated Intel chips practically made them halfway obsolete as they hit the market. Couple that with upgrade restrictions and a notable reliance on dongles, and the 2016 MacBook Pro series became known as devices that are flawed and full of compromises. These flaws, of course, could be addressed by Apple this year. With the upcoming release of the MacBook Pro 2017, Apple would have the chance to ensure that its professional-grade laptops could really be worthy of its moniker. If Apple could balance out and refine the MacBook Pro series this year, the Cupertino-based tech giant would definitely have a much more competitive machine on its hands. The 2017 MacBook Pro would definitely not be a radical upgrade over the 2016 iteration of the powerful laptop. If Apple’s reputation and conventional refresh cycles are any indication, there is a good chance that the Cupertino-based tech giant would equip the 2017 MacBook Pro with upgrades under the hood, similar to what it did for the 12-inch MacBook when it was upgraded last year. ✔️ Photo: @satechi A post shared by Apples Fresh (@applesfresh) on May 21, 2017 at 6:35am PDT While the upgrades to the 2017 MacBook Pro would most probably not be visible on the surface, the updates that Apple would equip the device with would definitely make it a worthy purchase. If any, the incremental updates to the device, even if it only came in the form of a Kaby Lake and 16GB RAM upgrade, would go a long way in establishing the current generation of MacBooks as serious productivity machines. This, of course, also means that consumers who are looking to purchase a new Apple laptop would wise to wait for the release of the revamped machines before buying one, even if the 2016 devices are already getting price cuts in numerous online stores. The 2017 MacBook Pro series is speculated to be released this coming June during Apple’s WWDC. Pricing for the updated devices has neither been leaked nor officially revealed, though speculations are high that the upcoming machines would be priced similarly to their predecessors.

Blankenship has been an executive at Apple and Tesla. Photo provided Business May 21, 2017 11:35 AM Alltech Ideas Conference centers on disrupting business for the good By Cheryl Truman ctruman@herald-leader.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The Alltech Ideas Conference doesn’t want its participants to play by the rules. The conference, in its 33rd year, begins its formal run Monday in Lexington and continues through May 24. Many conference events will take place at Rupp Arena and Heritage Hall. A concert and “Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale Trail” will take place in downtown Lexington Tuesday night. The theme of the conference is “disrupt the disruptors.” About 4,000 people are expected to attend. Disruption doesn’t mean chaos, but neither is it meant to be comforting to businesses that think they can thrive by continuing to do the same thing the same way, said Pearse Lyons, founder and president of Alltech, an animal health company headquartered in Nicholasville. George Blankenship, a former executive at Tesla, Apple and GAP, said that when he joined Apple in 2000, the brand was near the bottom of its fortunes because Apple “didn’t control how its products were presented to the customers.” Blankenship is one of the keynote speakers at the conference. Apple decided to get its message out where customers went when they were thinking of buying new things, leading to the launch of the Apple Store, Blankenship said. The first two opened in Tyson’s Corner Va., and Glendale, Calif., in May 2001, and sold a combined total of $599,000 of merchandise over their first weekend. In 2007 the iPhone was introduced; in 2008, the App Store followed, allowing customers to tailor their iPhone for whatever use they liked, from maps to weather to summoner of rides and food. The iPhone “totally disrupted the way people engage with technology” — making the phone more than simply a person-to-person communications device and more of a lifeline with which the customer can constantly engage. Tesla has similarly changed the fundamentals of how customers look at cars. Even if the customer is not now in the market for a car, Blankenship said, the company finds that it pays to educate the consumer. Tesla provides consumers with constant reminders that the fundamental model of car buying — going to a dealership and coming out with a gas-powered auto — can be fundamentally different. Alltech has been a disruptor in the field of animal nutrition as well as brewing, said Lyons, adding there’s a difference between unproductive noise and true disruption that makes positive changes to the business template. Part of Alltech’s ability to disrupt how business operates stems from its being a privately held company, Lyons said. “We’re private, and when we make money we plow the money back in,” he said. “We don’t do the next quarter. ... We simply do what we do, and that enables us to be disruptive.” “Somebody who’s disruptive doesn’t see the negatives,” Lyons said. “That’s what people want to buy into, the things of the future.” Cheryl Truman: 859-231-3202, @CherylTruman Alltech founder Pearse Lyons during the 2015 Alltech conference.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple wins a Design Patent for an Apple TV Retail Store Display Structure in Hong Kong | Main May 21, 2017 U.S. President Signs Deal with Saudi Arabia's Sovereign Wealth Fund for $93 Billion Boosting U.S. Tech Sector   On Friday Patently Apple posted a report titled "SoftBank's Chief Masayoshi Son follows President Trump to Saudi Arabia to Officially Launch $100 Billion Fund." The trip indeed delivered what was expected. The world's largest private equity fund, backed by Japan's Softbank Group and Saudi Arabia's main sovereign wealth fund, said on Saturday it had raised over $93 billion to invest in technology sectors such as artificial intelligence and robotics. In addition to Softbank and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), the new fund's investors include Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment, which has committed $15 billion, Apple Inc, Qualcomm, Taiwan's Foxconn Technology and Japan's Sharp Corp.   Reuters reports that "The next stage of the Information Revolution is under way, and building the businesses that will make this possible will require unprecedented large-scale, long-term investment," the Softbank Vision Fund said in a statement.   Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, chairman of Softbank, a telecommunications and tech investment group, revealed plans for the fund last October and since then it has obtained commitments from some of the world's most deep-pocketed investors.   The new fund made its announcement during the visit of President Donald Trump to Riyadh and the signing of tens of billions of dollars worth of business deals between U.S. and Saudi companies. Son was also in Riyadh on Saturday.   The new fund said it would seek to buy minority and majority interests in both private and public companies, from emerging businesses to established, multi-billion-dollar firms. It expects to obtain preferred access to long-term investment opportunities worth $100 million or more."   The deal began with SoftBank's Masayoshi Son, Japan's richest man visiting then President-elect Trump in December 2016. The Softbank and Foxconn contribution to the deal would be close to $50 billion as noted in the graphic above of a presentation sheet used in Son's pitch.   Last month Patently Apple posted a reprot titled "Foxconn to make 'Capital Intensive' Investment in the U.S. that will be revealed at a Special Event this Summer." Foxconn's Chairman Terry Gou stated at the time that "We are planning a number of investments in America. This project will include both capital-intensive and skilled labor-intensive and high-tech investment." In respect to timing, Gou added that "I think we will share with you in the summer, maybe a few weeks."   The high paying jobs that the Fund will support cover various industries such as mobile computing, communications infrastructure, computational biology, consumer internet businesses and financial technology.   Bloomberg adds in their report that Masayoshi Son said in a statement today that "SoftBank has long made bold investments in transformative technologies and supported disruptive entrepreneurs. The SoftBank Vision Fund is consistent with this strategy and will help build and grow businesses creating the foundational platforms of the next stage of the Information Revolution.'   Yasir Alrumayyan, managing director of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, said the fund will help his country’s strategy of developing 'a diversified, knowledge-based economy.' Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak, chief executive officer of Mubadala, said the SoftBank fund 'perfectly complements' the company’s strategy to become an investor in high-growth technology companies."   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Well, it's also tackled the humble pizza box. As Quartz puts it, "Like all things Apple, there are no sharp corners on this box," meaning the box is no square. The other main innovation in Apple's take on pizza travel technology is holes in the top of the box, presumably so that steam will escape and not make your pizza soggy. It's actually a patent that Apple applied for seven years ago, with the head of Apple's food service team listed as one inventor, though it's only now making stomachs growl thanks to a Wired article on Apple's new mothership campus that mentioned the box. (Apple actually currently offers the box, which is personal pie-sized, at its existing campuses, notes the Verge.) Per the patent, the box is preformed, "such that no assembly of the container is required"; features a "nested configuration" that "allows for multiple containers to be stored in a nested stack, thereby minimizing storage space"; and, per Newsweek, features "concentric ridges" for structural support. And remember those eight holes in the lid? They are known as a "plurality of apertures that allow for the outflow of air from within the container." If the design doesn't grab you, perhaps the box's greenness will: It "can be fabricated from various types of re-used material along the lines of molded fiber." Or, you know, it's a round box with holes in which you can carry your pizza to your desk. (Apple's new headquarters is insanely detail oriented.)   My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   15% Hilarious 24% Intriguing 4% Depressing 32% Brilliant 7% Scary 19% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 19 comments You Might Like Sponsored by ZergNet Next on Newser: SNL: Trump Sings 'Hallelujah' Comments Read comment policy Showing 3 of 19 comments TrumpClinton Stinks May 21, 2017 10:37 PM CDT It will go great with the new vacuum cleaner that apple is working on, it is called the iSuck. O_K May 21, 2017 10:09 PM CDT The story neglected to mention the locking tab. Isn't that a novel and totally original invention worthy of patent protection to prevent anyone else from using Apple's idea? Just like using concentric rings for support or evenly spaced holes for ventilation? How many completely new, totally original and so ground-breakingly non-obvious ideas does Apple need to produce to get the kind of patent protection they deserve on, well, everything? (Yes, that's satirical. And I'd love to see it on SNL.) Tengu ?? Slayer of Vanity May 21, 2017 3:38 PM CDT It's not nearly as cool as the Japanese edible noodle bowls that are giant shrimp crackers!

For example, Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sell consumer-electronics devices that measure and report health information, such as activity levels and heart rate, so that people can track the progress they're making toward their health goals, such as weight loss. Soon, data that these wearable devices collect could become even more useful as more sophisticated sensors are incorporated into them. Advantages of real-time tracking In the past, doctors and patients have relied upon point-in-time measurement to inform healthcare decisions. For instance, diabetics would evaluate their blood-sugar levels with finger sticks at different times of day. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Point-in-time measurement, however, provides limited insight into patient health, and as a result, healthcare is moving increasingly toward monitoring conditions, including blood sugar, in real time. Already, companies such as Dexcom market small sensors that patients can wear to continuously track their blood glucose levels. These sensors collect data and report it to patients through external devices, or via apps on consumer electronic devices. At Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), one of the country's largest medical-device companies, these sensors are even attached to an insulin pump patients wear that can automatically administer insulin as it's needed. Soon, the information that doctors and patients can collect from wearable technology may become even more useful.  Last year, Fitbit CEO James Park promised to bump up spending to develop medical applications for his wearables, proclaiming that his company's devices could one day "save your life." In December, Fitbit announced that it's working with Medtronic to merge activity data its devices collect with blood glucose data Medtronic's blood glucose monitors collect in one app. The iPro2 myLog mobile app eliminates the need for patients with type 2 diabetes to manually track activity data, and it offers better insight into how exercise affects their glucose levels. It also provides an algorithm-based, one-page report that can help doctors quickly identify and address key problem areas with patients. Fitbit's not alone in thinking that the marriage of wearables with healthcare is inevitable. Recently, Apple CEO Tim Cook made news when he told students in Scotland that he's been wearing a custom Apple Watch that's helping him track the impact of exercise and diet on his blood glucose levels. Unlike existing sensors that require insertion under the skin, Apple's technology collects blood-sugar data by using non-invasive optical sensors that measure blood sugar using light. There's no time table for commercializing Apple's new blood glucose monitor, but rumors are its been working on the technology for years, and it's evaluating regulatory options to determine how to launch the product with the Food and Drug Administration's blessing. In the future, optical sensors included in the Apple Watch might help patients with other conditions, too. Apple's founder, Steve Jobs, believed they can be used to track important vitals, including oxygen levels. Across the medical-device industry, researchers are considering how wearables may help monitor kidney function in chronic kidney disease and seizures in epilepsy patients. Wearables, such as Medtronic's bandage-sized Seeq, are being used to monitor and report cardiac activity heart disease patients, too.  IMAGE SOURCE: MEDTRONIC. Health sensors are also being incorporated into clothing. Recently, Medtronic won FDA approval for a vest that patients can wear that maps their cardiovascular systems, providing greater insight into the cause of arrhythmia than cardiac mapping via catheterization. Companies like Athos market compression shirts, pants, and shorts that include sensors to track muscle activity to improve athletic performance. And companies are finding innovative ways to use Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Glass in healthcare to boost productivity. For example, doctors who wear Google Glass can sign up with Augmedix to have their scribes update patient electronic health records in real time, freeing them up to see more patients per day. Doctors can also use Google Glass to view patient records, without turning away to use a computer. Overcoming challenges Wearable technologies are helping patients live healthier lives, and it appears that they're going to play an increasingly larger healthcare role in the future. Gaining widespread adoption of these products will require companies to overcome concerns regarding accuracy, privacy, and patient adherence. If Fitbit, Apple, and others can address those concerns, the market opportunity for them in healthcare could be huge.   Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS firmware never ends, what with the Cupertino-based outfit on one side, always plugging security holes. And on the other hand, people who are determined to allow iPhone, and iPad owners the freedom to chose via jailbreaking looking to exploit them. As such, there’s a race on to create a jailbreak for iOS 10.3.1 — one that’s stable and Apple won’t be able to prevent. Source: Shutterstock Toward that end, one researcher now claims, that one may be available in August, here’s what you need to know. As for when this takes place, it’s in August this year, so, there will be a reasonable wait to see if anything materializes. Right now, there’s no more detail on this, however, if you want to free your handset or tablet of Apple’s shackles, there are some things you can do to prepare. Screenshot source: @problem_ios /Twitter.com Getting Ready Back in January, the famous hacker/security researcher Luca Todesco talked about how it was important to save SHSH2 blobs. That is if you’re looking to take advantage of any future iOS 10 jailbreaks. Not sure what blobs are, here’s everything you need to know — including how to save them, which should be done ASAP. Our advice on this matter is, don’t skip to the guide. Read the article; it will give you some background on why saving SHSH2 blobs is important. Downgrade iOS The next step you can take may be relevant to you, although it’s possibly not. And that is, make sure you don’t upgrade to iOS 10.3.2 if you do it’s possible Apple may stop signing iOS 10.3.1. Which means you will be locked out of any future jailbreak, and possibly have to wait a very long time for another solution. 7 Cash-Rich, Debt-Free Stocks to Buy to Clobber the Market Now, if you’ve already crossed over onto iOS 10.3.2, you should downgrade now. Here’s a guide which should be able to point you in the right direction. If you need any help, please use the article’s comment section, and we will get back to you asap. Device Compatibility Unfortunately, he who caused this jailbreak storm has yet to reveal what iPhone’s, or iPad’s may be compatible. On, Twitter, he was asked to confirm whether the iPhone 7 would be among them. However, for whatever reason, he has failed to respond to that question. Although, what he did reveal was that iOS 10.2 is acceptable to this supposed exploit. So, that’s it, you, and we will now have to wait, possibly until August, fingers crossed something does materialize. If it does, we will, of course, bring you the details as soon as we have them. Followed by a possible jailbreak tutorial. In the meantime, follow the advice we gave above and avoid iOS 10.3.2.

This week, however, Apple has seemingly stopped offering the three-month free trial in Australia, Spain, and Switzerland… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover As noted on each country’s Apple Music webpage, Apple is now charging a small fee for 3 months of Apple Music, apparently not offering any sort of free trial. In Australia, three-months of Apple Music now runs $0.99. In Spain, you’re looking at 0,99 €, while Switzerland comes in at Fr. 0.99. In all other countries, at least at this point, it seems as if Apple Music still offers a free three-month trial to users. Apple has not yet commented on the changes in Switzerland, Spain, and Australia, but it’s likely a competition move. In the same three counties, Spotify likewise charges the same small fee for three-months of its music streaming service, rather than offering a free trial. At launch, Apple Music’s three-month free trial was somewhat of a point of contention with artists when it was revealed that Apple wouldn’t be paying royalties during the three-months of free usage. After backlash from many artists, such as Taylor Swift, Apple reversed course and decided that it would pay artists during the trial period. It’s unclear at this point if Apple plans to introduce a similar pricing change in other countries, dropping the free trial in favor of three months for $0.99. It’s certainly something to keep an eye as we head into WWDC next week, but for now, it seems that the free trial will remain in other counties.

Very afraid Commentary: Google is crushing Siri and dominating the smart home, but Apple has a chance to strike back in June. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Mobile by Jessica Dolcourt May 21, 2017 5:00 AM PDT @jdolcourt Google revealed a cascade of exciting innovations to its Google universe this week at the annual I/O developer conference. Apple should be quaking in its boots. The search and software giant is making tremendous strides in AI through Assistant; image search and detection through Google Lens; web search through Instant Apps; and search through Jobs on Google. In other words, Google's ecosystem is positioned to run circles around Apple's, whose tightly integrated software and hardware have failed to innovate at Google's pace when it comes to Siri, VR, the smart home and car dashboards. (More on these below.) Enlarge Image OK, Apple, ecosystem's in your court. CNET While Google's approach, which draws on deep databases of information, wants to own the platforms that other companies build upon, Apple prefers to control a complete, reliable package -- and that historically means it takes longer to get everything "right". In a few weeks at Apple's developer conference on June 5, it'll have the chance to swing back at Google (and a rejuvenated Microsoft) with its own advancements in iOS for the iPhone, Macbook, Siri AI, watch and maybe even the smart home. But Google has thrown down the gauntlet for Apple in a big way this week. Here's why Apple should be worried -- and why the company needs to bring its A game to WWDC in June. As of today, Google beats Apple in... Virtual assistant: Google's voice search tool has long outpaced Apple's Siri. It's more accurate and gives better responses more often than not. The next-gen Google Assistant will soon let you type queries and identify objects with Google Lens (below). You might soon order lunch after having a conversation with Assistant. It's coming to the iPhone, too. Home: Google Home just got a raft of exciting features that leapfrogs it ahead of even Amazon's Echo family. To wit: it'll now personalize responses based on who's talking to it, and has introduced hands-free calling. Apple has its HomeKit integration, but we're still waiting for a living room hub like Google Home to tie it all together. (Rumors are, it will come.) Google Assistant is your new bartender At Google I/O, CNET's Andrew Gebhart shows us how Google Assistant is being integrated into everyday devices like cocktail mixers. by Andrew Gebhart 1:35 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Images: There are a few debatably cool updates to Google Photos, but the most exciting change by far revolves around Google Lens, which basically identifies objects and places seen through the camera. Google Lens will integrate first with Google Photos and Google Assistant. VR and AR: Apple is rumored to put alternate reality into the next iPhone camera, but Google already has a dedicated VR headset, VR-ready phones and two AR phones. More from Google I/O 2017 Android O, Google Lens and VR: Everything important from Google I/O Google Photo's AI is better at sharing your photos than you are 5 ways Google Home just got better See all Google I/O 2017 news Chrome: The browser syncs with mobile and is available on more devices (you can't get Apple's Safari browser on Android). Google announced that it's also bringing its Chrome browser to VR. Cars: Android is working on ways to make your car's infotainment system (the stuff behind your dash screen) run on Android from the get-go. This is different from Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, both of which change the contents of that screen when you bring your phone into the car. Google is trying to go even deeper. Search and database: Google's main strength is its search tools and enormous database of places and facts. At I/O, it announced that it'll simplify job listings, making them look like search results. Apple's chance to strike back Google might have a leg up in some areas, but Apple has room to rebound. For example, its messaging apps, from iMessage to Face Time, are stronger than Google's which remain a confusing melange of overlapping and redundant platforms. Apple is better at integrating its software ecosystem across tightly controlled devices, too. 9 Inside Google Tango's augmented reality dreams Also, those Apple devices update to the latest software version without missing a beat -- something that Google, which mostly lets a bunch of partners make devices -- just cannot do. (The newly-announced Project Treble will alleviate some of this, but phone makers that use their own software layers still won't be completely in sync.) To be sure, Apple has a chance to whip up excitement for its next OS, (likely called iOS 11) in a way that Google's new Android O -- while still a useful step forward -- has not. Apple will probably never be able to catch Google in search, but it does have the resources to catch up in some other ways that matter, like VR, AR and the smart home. The countdown is on.

Problem Solving | 03 Apr 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (4) PDF Problems Continue in 10.12.4, but Primarily Affect Developers by Adam C. Engst Numerous readers have asked me if last week’s macOS 10.12.4 update resolved more of the PDF problems we outlined in “Sierra PDF Problems Get Worse in 10.12.2” (2 January 2017). The previous 10.12.3 update addressed the most serious bug, which caused a PDF edited in Preview to lose its OCR text layer (see “Apple Releases macOS Sierra 10.12.3, iOS 10.2.1, tvOS 10.1.1, and watchOS 3.1.1,” 23 January 2017). Last week, I polled the developers who had commented on the topic for my first article. The consensus was that Apple’s rewritten-for-Sierra PDFKit framework continues to improve, while simultaneously introducing new bugs. Christian Grunenberg of DEVONtechnologies said, “Since January I have added several new workarounds and improved old workarounds. The 10.12.4 release makes only one workaround obsolete and introduces a new bug.” He followed that up a few days later by saying, “In the last 24 hours I received various bug reports related to 10.12.4. In one case a PDF document freezes both DEVONthink and Preview; in another case pages are rendered white (in DEVONthink but also sometimes in Preview and both DEVONthink’s and Preview’s sidebar aren’t rendered at all); and in the last case PDF documents are rendered fuzzy.” Michael Tsai of C-Command Software initially outlined four bugs that Apple fixed in 10.12.4 and four that remain open, and a day later said that one of his customers had reported another crash that’s new in 10.12.4. The story for users is somewhat better because developers are either working around the bugs they find or quietly removing functionality until PDFKit works correctly. Michael Tsai also said that there’s a middle ground of display and scrolling glitches that can’t be worked around or avoided. Nonetheless, users continue to have problems, particularly with large or encrypted PDFs in Preview and other apps that rely on PDFKit for their PDF-related functionality. Nothing seems to be as severe as the OCR text layer deletion bug that 10.12.3 fixed, but if you experience trouble with Preview, try a different app. For merely viewing a PDF, use the free Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. If you need to manipulate a PDF, turn to Smile’s $74.95 PDFpen, which doesn’t use PDFKit and is thus immune from these issues. Similarly unaffected is Adobe Acrobat DC, which requires a subscription that costs either $24.99 per month if billed monthly or $14.99 per month billed annually (that’s $179.88 per year). Acrobat DC is also included in the full $49.99 per month Creative Cloud subscription. To answer those who have asked if they can now upgrade to Sierra, I’d have to say that if you rely heavily on apps built on top of PDFKit for viewing and manipulating non-trivial PDFs, it’s probably worth continuing to hold off. If you mostly just read PDFs in Preview, you likely won’t hit any stumbling blocks unless you work with large or encrypted PDFs.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

On page 16 are the cards that I print out to provide proof of coverage and keep in the glove box.. These show up basically as a black page or a page that you are looking through a filter and does not print correctly. I tried Acrobat Reader DC and was able to print them. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-04-04 08:04 This is reminiscent of the networking issues that were introduced in OS X 10.10 Yosemite, which also involved new technology developed by Apple. Whether this is a pattern, and what the pattern reveals about Apple's development expertise is, I'm sure, a matter of opinion. I think it's safe to say, though, that neither of these developments is a positive for the company. In the case of Yosemite, Apple was eventually obliged to revert to the old networking technologies that had been working perfectly well in OS X for years, while Yosemite never did develop into a reliable version of OS X. Nor were the problems with the new networking tech ever resolved so that it might be reintroduced. It's anybody's guess whether Apple will scrap this new version of PDFKit. If you're waiting for them to fix the bugs therein, I don't recommend holding your breath. Their track record with this sort of thing is hardly encouraging. In the meantime, spending $75 for software to work around Apple's mistakes seems to me to be a less than optimal solution, however necessary in some cases. OS X 10.11 El Capitan is a stable and supported version of OS X. If you rely on PDFs in your workflow even occasionally Sierra seems like a risky gamble. Which raises serious questions about the pending changes to the Apple file system, which have the potential to bring about problems on an unprecedented scale. If they mess this up they will stop macOS development cold and turn the whole platform into a pathetic joke. There's nothing more fundamental and essential to any OS than the file system. The longer they wait to introduce APFS the better in my opinion. They cannot spend too much time proofing their work. Apple seems to have forgotten, if they ever knew, the carpenter's maxim, measure twice, cut once. These days they don't even seem to be measuring once. That's not to say the macOS file system isn't in need of an overhaul. The issue is whether Apple is competent to implement such an overhaul. This latest boondoggle with PDFKit isn't a good sign. My gloom and doom may seem excessive; no one would be more pleased than I if Apple stopped this self-destructive cycle of behavior and gave me reason to change my toon. I don't know about you, but I'm not encouraged by this latest failure in Apple's quality control procedures. Clearly they just won't learn from their mistakes. Which means they will continue to make more of them—and we will continue to pay the price for their neglect of the fundamentals of good business. Reply barefootguru   2017-04-04 17:08 'The longer they wait to introduce APFS': Apple's busy converting some billions of iPhones & iPads, Watches and TVs to APFS as they're upgraded to iOS 10.3, tvOS 10.2, and watchOS 3.2. Reply Andrew Hazlett  2017-05-21 10:01 I thought my pdfs were being glitchy because maybe there was something wrong with my graphics card. It's a relief and a frustration to realize it is Sierra. There are certain sets of users who *live* in pdfs, e.g., lawyers, academics, journalists, and more. I find it very depressing that Apple left these issues unattended or half-addressed. There are certain basics a user has got to be able to count on, but I guess wielders of pdfs make up a tiny micropercentage of Apple's customers at this point. Reply  Search   Cached.

Add this to the simple and useful smart plugs from iHome, and you can control the lights, thermostat and more in your smart home using Amazon Alexa, Google Home and Apple Homekit. iHome iSS50 5-in-1 SmartMonitor: Design The iHome iSS50 5-in-1 SmartMonitor plugs into an AC outlet and monitors five different environmental categories including motion, temperature, light, sound and humidity. The device itself comes with built-in 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi. There’s a dimmable LCD readout that shows the temperature, humidity and status icons for Wi-Fi, sound and motion sensing. On the back, there’s a dimmer control, the power input and a reset button. It plugs into the USB cable that comes with the iSS50 and then into the USB to AC adapter that also comes with the package. The iHome iSS50 5-in-1 SmartMonitor takes up little space. You aim it wherever you want the motion sensor to pick up movement. iHome iSS50 5-in-1 SmartMonitor: Usability iHome iSP8 SmartPlug and Remote Control Setting up the iHome iSS50 5-in-1 SmartMonitor is easy thanks to the iHome Control apps for iPhone or Android. The app tells the user how to first connect the sensor to their phone and then it configures the sensor to connect to your Wi-Fi network. From then on the user will control the iSS50 with the iHome Control app over the Wi-Fi network in the home. iHome iSP6 SmartPlug The iHome iSS50 5-in-1 SmartMonitor works best with iHome’s SmartPlugs. These plugs connect any AC powered device and control them using the iHome Control app. The app can connect them to things like an Amazon Echo, Google Home, Android phone and Apple Homekit. I tested it using an Echo and my iPhone and Apple Watch and it worked very well. Although, sometimes the Apple Watch took a long time to load the Homekit controls to turn on and off lights. iHome Control Android App showing sensors in iSS50 SmartMonitor The five sensors built into the iHome iSS50 5-in-1 SmartMonitor are a mixed bag. Some work great and others are difficult to control. Motion Sensor – this is extremely sensitive and there’s no way to adjust the level of sensitivity. I set it up in a room to turn on the lights when I walked into the room. Just walking by the room’s open door turned on the lights. I even aimed it away from the door hoping that would lower monitor’s sensitivity in the region outside the room’s door and that didn’t work. It’s hard to complain about something working too well, but the sensor is so sensitive it makes it inconvenient for how I wanted to use it. It’s used best to monitor motion for when you first open your home’s door so it can turn on the lights or control other smart home features. Temperature Sensor – the device reads the room’s temperature accurately. I don’t own a smart thermostat like Nest, so this was less useful. However, I set it to tell me if the temperature raised above 85-degrees degrees, which would show a problem with my air conditioning in the spring or summer. I’ll set it to let me know if it drops below 55-degrees in fall and winter. This could also show that there’s possibly a fire if the temperature gets too hot quickly. Light Sensor – the sensor tells you what the light level in a room is. This can tell you if the lights got left on and you can turn them off at night without getting out of bed. Sound Sensor – I turned off the motion sensing and turned on the sound sensor. This way I can use the control like the old clapper. When it hears loud noise, like a clap or shout, it turns on lights in the room where I placed the sensor. Humidity Sensor – our basement used to have terrible problems with flooding. If we had the iHome iSS50 5-in-1 SmartMonitor then, we could have received a notice that the humidity in the basement was rising and spring into action before the flooding got out of hand. It’s convenient to turn on lights with a voice command using your phone or an Echo. That happens thanks to the iHome iSP6 that iHome also gave us to test along with the iSS50. I plugged my lights into the plug and then plugged that into the power outlet. The iHome Control app sets up rules and rooms. I can turn on all the lights in my basement that are plugged into two iHome Smartplugs. I can also just turn on the lights over my desk or in the den area of the basement. iHome iSP6 SmartPlug iHome iSS50 5-in-1 SmartMonitor: Value A lot of smart plugs and sensors exist, but the iHome iSS50 5-in-1 SmartMonitor and the SmartPlugs work together well. They will also integrate with Homekit to control other smart home devices like a Nest thermostat. The iSS50 costs $79.99 from iHome. iHome sells three SmartPlugs. The iSP8 costs $49.99 and comes with a wireless remote control so you can control lights or other devices plugged into the plugs from across the room or from another room. The iSP6 is just the SmartPlug and costs $39.99. The iSP5 is the previous generation SmartPlug and costs $39.99. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

According to a new report from Recode, Apple is among a handful of companies who will meet with White House officials next week to discuss modernization, big data, and high-skilled immigration… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover The report explains that the meeting will include Apple, Google, Facebook, and other tech companies. It falls under the blanket under of the new American Technology Council, which is an effort initiated by President Trump to modernize government and citizen services and being led by Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner. The meeting will focus on things such as using machine learning to tackle waste and fraud, and analytics. The White House is also said to have interest in an “exchange” program that would allow engineers to spend brief periods of time at the White House for a specific task. Here is how the White House describes the American Technology Council: American people should be able to interact with the government the way that they do with the best private-sector companies — through intuitive digital experiences that effectively solve problems. The White House goes on to say that in their current state, many federal agencies offer a “very poor experience defined by outdated websites, unhelpful call centers, and thousands of pages of paper-based forms.” With the help of Silicon Valley companies like Apple, the Trump Administration hopes to make government services “more intuitive, user-friendly, and effective.” This meeting won’t be the first time Apple has made the trip to meet with Trump Administration officials. In December, Tim Cook traveled to Trump Tower to join a handful of tech executives in talking immigration, China, and job creation. Furthermore, Cook separately met with Trump son-in-law Jared Kusher and Ivanka Trump, a meeting for which Apple VP of environment, policy, and social initiatives Lisa Jackson was also in attendance. While Apple and Cook have vocally opposed President Trump’s immigration actions thus far, Cook believes that it’s better to be in the game than on the sidelines, thus his reasoning for attending these meetings. This is something he explained in an open-letter to Apple employees.

Now, Duncan Sinfield is back with his latest flyover video of Apple Park, taking us on a gorgeous sunset tour of the new spaceship building… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover While we saw some nighttime footage of Apple Park earlier this month, today’s video takes on a sunset-only tour of the campus. The video shows just how massive Apple’s new headquarters really are, as the building lights up the darker it gets outside. Furthermore, we can see work continue on Apple Park’s landscaping. While building itself is all-but-completed, the landscaping still largely resembles that of a construction site. Earlier this week, Wired got an exclusive look inside the spaceship ring of Apple Campus, going in depth on many of Apple’s goals with the campus, as well as the vision of Steve Jobs. The piece iterated the huge amounts of thoughts has gone into the smallest of details, much of it driven personally by Steve Jobs. Stefan Behling, one of Foster+Partner’s project leads says: They describe the level of attention devoted to every detail, the willingness to search the earth for the right materials, and the obstacles overcome to achieve perfection […] At one point, Behling recalls, Jobs discussed the walls he had in mind for the offices: “He knew exactly what timber he wanted, but not just ‘I like oak’ or ‘I like maple.’ He knew it had to be quarter-­cut. It had to be cut in the winter, ideally in January, to have the least amount of sap and sugar content. We were all sitting there, architects with gray hair, going, ‘Holy shit!’” Watch the full video of the sunset flyover below and let us know what you think of it down in the comments.

As planned, the auction took place yesterday and brought in $130,000, far less than initial expectations… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover At the time of the auction announcement, experts were anticipating the Apple-1 to go for around $320,000, meaning there was a big gap between expectations and what ended up being the case. The auction was won by a German engineer who collects old computers. German auctioneer Team Breker advertised that this Apple-1 was “the best preserved example of an Apple-1 computer to appear on the market.” The machine was said to be in full working order and include original operation documents, circuit diagrams, and purported notes of telephone calls between Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1977. The original owner of the Apple-1 explained that he bought the machine in 1976 and still had the receipts for it (via News24). “(The Apple 1) was one of the first opportunities for someone to possess a real computer. I’d been working with computers for a while but they were huge,” said original owner John J Dryden, who bought the Apple in 1976. While this Apple-1 missed its own expectations in terms of selling price, it also sold for far less than other Apple-1 models have. In 2014, a working Apple-1 was auctioned for  $365,000, while the year prior a model signed by Wozniak went for $671,000. Another unit was auctioned in 2015 and expected to sell for over half a million dollars. Most impressively, a special “Celebration” edition Apple-1 fetched $815,000 in auction, though falling short of lofty $1 million estimates. Some attribute the decline in Apple-1 to prices to them falling back to normal after a spike following the death of Steve Jobs. Nevertheless, there are believed to be only 8 working Apple-1 machines in the world today, making this an incredible piece of memorabilia.

Pictures’ Aquaman doesn’t arrive in theaters until December 2018, but shooting is currently underway on the feature — as evidenced by the latest photo from director James Wan. This week, Wan posted a photo of actress Amber Heard in costume as Mera, the queen of the undersea kingdom of Atlantis. The photo, which he revealed on Twitter, features Heard in the green-scaled, one-piece suit that the character’s comics counterpart often wears. “Lady MERA swept in from the sea,” wrote Wan in the photo’s caption. “First day with the exquisite Amber Heard.” With Furious 7 and The Conjuring director Wan behind the camera, Aquaman will bring Jason Momoa back as DC Comics’ famous water-borne superhero after the character’s brief debut in Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice. Both Momoa and Heard are expected to also appear in the upcoming Justice League team-up movie. Along with Momoa as the film’s titular hero and Heard as Mera, the cast of Aquaman also includes Academy Award winner Nicole Kidman (The Hours) as Aquaman’s mother, Temuera Morrison (Star Wars: Episode II — Attack of the Clones) as Aquaman’s father, Dolph Lundgren (The Expendables) as King Nereus, Patrick Wilson (The Conjuring) as Aquaman’s half-brother, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (The Get Down) as the villain Black Manta, and Willem Dafoe (Platoon) as Vulko. The movie is currently filming in the Gold Coast region of Queensland, Australia, and is expected to continue filming in Newfoundland, Sicily, and Tunisia, in addition to studio locations. Originally scheduled to premiere in October 2018, Aquaman was pushed back two months in one of many scheduling changes and shifts both behind the camera and in front of it for WB’s troubled superhero cinematic universe. Over the last year, the studio has had The Batman change directors and The Flash slide into limbo after losing two directors and undergoing multiple rewrites, among other issues. Aquaman is currently scheduled to hit theaters December 21, 2018.

By Sarmistha Acharya May 21, 2017 15:17 BST Rare Apple-1 computer fetches at less than expected at an auction in Germany Reuters/Stefan Wermuth A rare working Apple-1, the first ever computer produced by co-founder Steve Jobs, has been sold at an auction in Germany. The computer, which is one of the eight working models in the world, fetched €110,000 (£945,70). It had been expected to fetch €180,000 - €300,000. The computer was one of 200 Apple 1 units marketed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, who developed it. "From our point of view we are back at normal levels. Five years after the death of (Apple co-founder) Steve Jobs the 'hype' has settled back," Uwe Breker, a person who oversaw the auction told AFP. Breker's auction house had been involved in a 2013 sale of another Apple-1 computer that fetched €516,000. The owner of the computer model that was auctioned off Saturday (20 May) was a Californian engineer named John J Dryden. He says he still has its receipt, operating manual and other documents. "(The Apple 1) was one of the first opportunities for someone to possess a real computer. I'd been working with computers for a while but they were huge," Dryden, who bought the computer in 1976, told AFP. Last August another Apple-1 computer reached more than $500,000 in an online auction within three days of bidding. The model is thought to have been one of the 25 that Apple did not sell, as its original owner is known to be an early employee of the company. The computer was believed to be a prototype that uses higher-quality components compared with those sold to the public.

It was brutal, punishing work. Nick Whighamnews.com.au@NWWHIGHAM news.com.au May 22, 201711:48am Dejian Zeng spent six weeks working undercover at a factory assembling iPhones for about $2.50 an hour. FOR your average student at the prestigious New York University, Dejian Zeng had a really unconventional Summer internship job. The 23-year-old student went undercover in a Chinese factory which was contracted to assemble Apple iPhones. Working six days a week on the assembly line he spent the better part of six weeks repeatedly putting screws in the back of Apple’s popular smartphones, over and over again. Most of us would recoil at the idea but he embarked on the surreptitious mission because he wanted to see “how the workers feel and what their lives were like,” he told news.com.au. “They’re not happy about it but they’re not very angry,” he said. They mostly come from rural areas and because they feel like they are lacking in education, they don’t have many options. “They’re kind of expecting it to be very tiring, very boring and that they’re going to have to work long hours,” he said. During the week Zeng would spend 12 hours inside the factory (but only get paid for 10.5 hours) and screw approximately 1800 screws into 1800 iPhones. He and the rest of the workers would also work an eight hour day on Saturday. Sunday was their only rest day. For this monotonous and laborious work he was paid 3100 yuan a month after meals and board were taken out, or by today’s exchange rate, just $606. For the 60 hours weeks he worked, on the occasion there was no forced overtime, that works out to be about $2.50 an hour. Dejian Zeng spent six weeks working undercover at a factory which assembles iPhones in China.Source:Supplied Zeng worked putting screws in the back of iPhone 6s and iPhone 7s and said the various jobs on the assembly line seemed to be handed out at random with the less taxing jobs usually given to female workers. The investigation was a result of a partnership between NYU and a Chinese NGO called China Labor Watch which periodically sends undercover workers into factories to investigate working conditions. When Zeng interned with the NGO last year, he soon found himself happily being sent to factory near Shanghai owned by Taiwanese contract manufacturing giant Pegatron which was contracted to assemble the Apple devices. THE “INTERVIEW” Getting a job inside the factory was incredibly easy. Zeng said he simply “rocked up” outside the building with a crowd of other job hopefuls during an intake with their luggage in hand. The most strenuous part on the interview process was reciting the English alphabet, he said. “There was a quick interview process that you show your hands and recite English alphabet. It’s just so easy.” A vast majority of the workers lived in eight-bed dormitories at the site of the factory for 160 yuan a month, deducted from their salary. The facilities included a gym and a counselling and therapy office for workers. Employees were not allowed to take any electronics inside the factory production area but Zeng took a number of photos of the living quarters and surrounding areas which he shared with news.com.au. Job hopefuls would simply show up with their luggage looking for a job in the factory.Source:Supplied Most workers lived on site for 160 yuan per month.Source:Supplied The showers in the factory dorms.Source:Supplied The factory was chosen because according to China Labor Watch at the time it had increased the base wage of workers to comply with new minimum wage laws but at the same time cut stipends and the few benefits afforded to workers, leaving them worse off. As a result Zeng expected workers to strike soon after he arrived but it never materialised. YELLING IS JUST SO NORMAL During their days on the assembly line workers would chat to those around them and sometimes sing songs — but that was often punctuated by managers yelling at workers to increase their pace. “They (managers) had a very bad attitude to workers” and would consistently yell at those not doing their job fast enough, Zeng said. “Yelling is just so normal, you can hear them every day.” “Every second counts,” was the manager manifesto on the factory floor. He recalled one incident in which a manager stopped an entire assembly line from working and gathered them together to yell at one worker who was new and wasn’t keeping up the pace. “One day all of a sudden the manager just totally exploded,” Zeng said. “We were all shocked. That’s just one incident I remember so clearly.” Workers in their uniform, which includes slippers for the factory floor, waiting to begin work.Source:Supplied Workers have a card which they swipe for every meal.Source:Supplied The dining hall for workers.Source:Supplied Human rights activists and labour rights activists have made a concerted push to highlight any violations and improve the conditions of factory workers in developing economies who underpin the digital revolution in the West. Another Taiwanese manufacturer of iPhones, the more notorious Foxconn, is also characteristically media shy but the company’s factories have seen their fair share of scrutiny in recent years following a string of worker suicides in 2010, 2011 and 2013. As well as a deadly fire at a plant that manufactured iPads in 2011. The Pegatron factory where Zeng went undercover was also profiled by the BBC in 2014 and Bloomberg in 2016, both of which reported cases of forced excessive overtime and difficult working conditions. Apple says it always has staff on the ground monitoring their assembly factories and Zeng did recall seeing them “two or three times” in their highly visible green tracksuits. But when managers knew they were coming they would be on their best behaviour, he said, and instruct the employees to clean up and work quietly. “And then they (the Apple employees) would just walk by. That would be it.” Apple technicians were also occasionally required to monitor that products were being assembled properly. DON’T TAKE YOUR PRODUCTS FOR GRANTED Dejian Zeng graduated this week with a Masters in Public Administration from NYU and plans to work for a human rights based organisation with a focus on China. As for his stint undercover, and the report that ensued, he says it was all about making customers of Apple products aware of what they’re buying and how it got to them. “When you use your iPhones and Macbooks, don’t take it for granted. And realise that there’s thousands of people working day and night, like 24 hours, in the factory to produce the product that you are using,” he said. Investigations like these by the Chinese NGO are also aimed at the company themselves which are selling the end product in hopes they will be pressured into improving conditions for overseas factory workers. “We want Apple to see it. A lot of the time the target is Apple,” Zeng said. “We think there is some work to be done.” Dejian Zeng graduated this week with a Masters in Public Administration.Source:Supplied Apple Suppliers Expand Automation in China3:24 Apple's suppliers are depending more on robots to assemble gadgets.

Very afraid Commentary: Google is crushing Siri and dominating the smart home, but Apple has a chance to strike back in June. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Mobile by Jessica Dolcourt May 21, 2017 5:00 AM PDT @jdolcourt Google revealed a cascade of exciting innovations to its Google universe this week at the annual I/O developer conference. Apple should be quaking in its boots. The search and software giant is making tremendous strides in AI through Assistant; image search and detection through Google Lens; web search through Instant Apps; and search through Jobs on Google. In other words, Google's ecosystem is positioned to run circles around Apple's, whose tightly integrated software and hardware have failed to innovate at Google's pace when it comes to Siri, VR, the smart home and car dashboards. (More on these below.) Enlarge Image OK, Apple, ecosystem's in your court. CNET While Google's approach, which draws on deep databases of information, wants to own the platforms that other companies build upon, Apple prefers to control a complete, reliable package -- and that historically means it takes longer to get everything "right". In a few weeks at Apple's developer conference on June 5, it'll have the chance to swing back at Google (and a rejuvenated Microsoft) with its own advancements in iOS for the iPhone, Macbook, Siri AI, watch and maybe even the smart home. But Google has thrown down the gauntlet for Apple in a big way this week. Here's why Apple should be worried -- and why the company needs to bring its A game to WWDC in June. As of today, Google beats Apple in... Virtual assistant: Google's voice search tool has long outpaced Apple's Siri. It's more accurate and gives better responses more often than not. The next-gen Google Assistant will soon let you type queries and identify objects with Google Lens (below). You might soon order lunch after having a conversation with Assistant. It's coming to the iPhone, too. Home: Google Home just got a raft of exciting features that leapfrogs it ahead of even Amazon's Echo family. To wit: it'll now personalize responses based on who's talking to it, and has introduced hands-free calling. Apple has its HomeKit integration, but we're still waiting for a living room hub like Google Home to tie it all together. (Rumors are, it will come.) Google Assistant is your new bartender At Google I/O, CNET's Andrew Gebhart shows us how Google Assistant is being integrated into everyday devices like cocktail mixers. by Andrew Gebhart 1:35 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Images: There are a few debatably cool updates to Google Photos, but the most exciting change by far revolves around Google Lens, which basically identifies objects and places seen through the camera. Google Lens will integrate first with Google Photos and Google Assistant. VR and AR: Apple is rumored to put alternate reality into the next iPhone camera, but Google already has a dedicated VR headset, VR-ready phones and two AR phones. More from Google I/O 2017 Android O, Google Lens and VR: Everything important from Google I/O Google Photo's AI is better at sharing your photos than you are 5 ways Google Home just got better See all Google I/O 2017 news Chrome: The browser syncs with mobile and is available on more devices (you can't get Apple's Safari browser on Android). Google announced that it's also bringing its Chrome browser to VR. Cars: Android is working on ways to make your car's infotainment system (the stuff behind your dash screen) run on Android from the get-go. This is different from Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, both of which change the contents of that screen when you bring your phone into the car. Google is trying to go even deeper. Search and database: Google's main strength is its search tools and enormous database of places and facts. At I/O, it announced that it'll simplify job listings, making them look like search results. Apple's chance to strike back Google might have a leg up in some areas, but Apple has room to rebound. For example, its messaging apps, from iMessage to Face Time, are stronger than Google's which remain a confusing melange of overlapping and redundant platforms. Apple is better at integrating its software ecosystem across tightly controlled devices, too. 9 Inside Google Tango's augmented reality dreams Also, those Apple devices update to the latest software version without missing a beat -- something that Google, which mostly lets a bunch of partners make devices -- just cannot do. (The newly-announced Project Treble will alleviate some of this, but phone makers that use their own software layers still won't be completely in sync.) To be sure, Apple has a chance to whip up excitement for its next OS, (likely called iOS 11) in a way that Google's new Android O -- while still a useful step forward -- has not. Apple will probably never be able to catch Google in search, but it does have the resources to catch up in some other ways that matter, like VR, AR and the smart home. The countdown is on.

The highly sought-after vintage computer auctioned off in Cologne on Saturday was one of just 200 that the late Apple co-founder and Steve Wozniak designed and marketed in 1976. The owner John Dryden, a Californian software engineer, admitted that finally parting with the machine was difficult. "(The Apple 1) was one of the first opportunities for someone to possess a real computer," he said. "I'd been working with computers for a while but they were huge." The Apple-1 was sold with the original receipt for the motherboard and cassette recorder, an operating manual, and even notes of telephone conversations between Dryden and Wozniak from 1977. Apple never offered an external housing for the computer, while the power supply, keyboard, monitor, and cassette recorder had to be obtained separately by the owner. This machine was actually expected to fetch significantly more than it did this weekend, after an Apple-1 sold for a record $905,000 at a Bonhams auction in New York in October 2014. More recently, a unique "celebration" model went for $815,000 at a CharityBuzz auction in August of last year. Breker's auction house, which hosted the sale and specializes in technical antiques, put the lower price down to a settling of Apple "hype", now coming over five years after the death of Steve Jobs. The winning bidder was a German engineer who collects old computers. The 8K machine, which originally sold for $666 over 40 years ago, is one of just eight still in working order. There are thought to be only around 50 to 60 Apple-1 computers still in existence.

It's not a Pro product unless you can solder your own capacitors onto it. This wouldn't be happening if Woz was still here. Rating: 8 Votes CarlJ 11 hours ago at 12:58 pm It's not a Pro product unless you can solder your own capacitors onto it. This wouldn't be happening if Woz was still here.Pretty on point, actually. ;) Jobs ideal was a computing device as an appliance, with no way to open it or change it. But he was constantly pushing for making great devices, constantly dissatisfied with what could be cobbled together with existing parts (so we benefit from him pushing his designers and engineers to try all sort of new things and invent new technologies). Woz was a hacker* extraordinaire, who could make simple parts do amazing things (the Apple II Disk Controller was a revolutionarily simple design that had many advantages over existing more complicated/expensive designs), and he encouraged others to do the same. *: (from back when hacker meant "adept at delving into existing systems, understanding how they work, modifying them to do new interesting stuff, and using the knowledge gained to make entirely new things" - sigh, someone broke into a computer, someone else commented that "a hacker did it", and some reporter heard and either misunderstood or just intentionally misused the term because it sounded catchy, and now "hacker" means "computer criminal" to most people). Interesting though, there are purportedly less than 60 in existence.I thought I recalled the original production being in the neighborhood of 200, though I could be wrong. $666-the price point devised by a couple of high California kids lol.Devised by a couple of counter-culture revolutionaries, who found it entertaining and thought others of like mind would too. The competition at the time was CP/M running on S-100 bus 8080 systems (displaying on monochrome text-only terminals) that were really intended for business use. At the time, computers were basically only used by large companies - Steve & Steve had a dream of making computers that everyone could use (power to the people) - that was the revolution they were trying to foment. Indeed, Apple's follow-on machine, the Apple II, was on the market months before the (monochrome-only) TRS-80 and Commodore PET, years before the Atari 400/800, and many years before the first IBM PC. At the time it kind of was revolutionary. And, in some ways, the computer today that most closely matches Steve Jobs' ideal, what he thought computers should be, is the iPad.

Shares12 Sun, 21 May 2017-11:13am , Mumbai , AFP The iPad 2017 range currently consists of three types of device: the iPad mini, the iPad classic and the iPad Pro. Has the fashion for phablets killed off small tablets? Apple is preparing to drop the iPad mini from its range of tablets, according to a report from BGR citing a source close to Apple. The announcement could be made at Apple's WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference) which will be held on June 5-9 in the US city of San José. Launched in 2012, but with no updates since 2015, the iPad mini 7.9-inch tablet was used by Apple to compete with Google's Nexus 7 and Amazon's Kindle Fire in the small tablet market which was booming at that time. Five years later, the market has changed. The main reason for dropping the iPad mini is thought to be the significant drop in sales. Many users now prefer a smartphone with a big screen (an iPhone 6s Plus or an iPhone 7 Plus) rather than a small tablet. Also, buyers could be dissuaded by the fact that prices for the latest version of device start at $399 for the Wi-Fi version with 128GB of storage. That's only slightly cheaper than the new 9.7-inch iPad, for which prices start at $429 for the same configuration (and only $329 for the 32GB version). Even though tablet sales have been declining worldwide since 2015, Apple CEO Tim Cook is still very optimistic about the iPad, which he plans to keep positioned at the top end of the market as a PC alternative. It's rumored that a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro (putting it between the 9.7 and 12.9-inch models) could be unveiled at the WWDC. Apple's WWDC brings together developers and creatives from all over the world. Over a thousand Apple engineers will be at this year's event to meet and engage with developers.

Apple is reportedly gearing up to launch new laptops soon, so don't buy a new MacBook, MacBook Pro or MacBook Air right now.More Don't buy a new MacBook right now, no matter what model you're considering. A report this week suggested that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is gearing up to announce new MacBooks as soon as next month during its annual developer conference, known as WWDC. It makes perfect sense, too, since this is where Apple typically unveils new software that powers its computers. In this case, we're expecting an update to macOS. Bloomberg said this week that Apple is planning to introduce, at the very least, a refreshed MacBook Pro with Intel's latest seventh-generation processors. Apple, for whatever reason, wasn't able to get those chips in time for the initial launch of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, which only launched back in October. Apple is also planning to update its smaller and thinner MacBook laptops with the new processors, too, so you'll want to make sure you aren't buying that right now either. Additionally, Apple may — though Bloomberg was less confident on this — finally refresh the MacBook Air laptop, its thin-and-light machine that still offers some of the more traditional ports, like full-size USB and an SD card slot, which people still want. Intel's new processors are more powerful and are also more efficient, which means you should see longer battery life out of them. It's unclear if Apple plans to make any other changes to its laptops, but you'd be silly not to sit on the bench for a few weeks just to find out what's in store. Take this as a simple public service announcement. Sit tight on buying a new MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro right now. Apple should have fresh models on the market very soon. Oh, and for what it's worth, you also shouldn't buy a new iPad Pro yet.

In addition to SoftBank Group Corp (“SBG”) and the Public Investment Fund of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (“PIF”) as previously announced, investors in the Fund also include the Mubadala Investment Company of the United Arab Emirates (“Mubadala”), Apple Inc. (“Apple”), Foxconn Technology Group (“Foxconn”), Qualcomm Incorporated (“Qualcomm”) and Sharp Corporation ("Sharp").

View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170520005010/en/ SBG created the SoftBank Vision Fund as a result of its strongly held belief that the next stage of the Information Revolution is underway, and building the businesses that will make this possible will require unprecedented large scale long-term investment. Additionally, the Fund’s portfolio companies are expected to significantly benefit from SBG's global scale and operational expertise, as well as its ecosystem of group portfolio companies (including Sprint and Yahoo Japan); this will thereby help them to accelerate their own growth profile. The Fund will be SBG’s primary vehicle to realise its SoftBank 2.0 vision, with preferred access to investments of U.S. $100 million or more that meet the Fund's investment strategy. Masayoshi Son, Chairman & CEO of SoftBank Group Corp. said: “Technology has the potential to address the biggest challenges and risks facing humanity today. The businesses working to solve these problems will require patient long-term capital and visionary strategic investment partners with the resources to nurture their success. SoftBank has long made bold investments in transformative technologies and supported disruptive entrepreneurs. The SoftBank Vision Fund is consistent with this strategy and will help build and grow businesses creating the foundational platforms of the next stage of the Information Revolution.” H.E. Yasir Al Rumayyan, Managing Director of the Public Investment Fund of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, added: “Our investment in the SoftBank Vision Fund alongside other sovereign and corporate investors is an important part of our overall investment strategy. We are building a portfolio that is diversified across sectors, asset classes and geographies, and expect the Vision Fund to act as a platform to access a range of exciting, emerging opportunities in the technology sector. We expect that this will, in turn, help enable the Public Investment Fund’s role in supporting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 strategy to develop a diversified, knowledge-based economy.” Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak, Group CEO of Mubadala Investment Company, said: “Our participation in the SoftBank Vision Fund perfectly complements Mubadala’s strategy as a long-term global investor and partner to the technology sector’s high-growth companies. Technology and innovation are central to the UAE’s economic diversification strategy, and we believe the Vision Fund has the scale to deploy significant capital into these disruptive industries that are shaping the future.” Investment Strategy The Fund will target meaningful, long-term investments in companies and foundational platform businesses that seek to enable the next age of innovation. The Fund will seek to acquire minority and majority interests in both private and public companies, from emerging technology businesses to established, multi-billion dollar companies requiring substantial growth funding. The Fund is expected to be active across a wide range of technology sectors, including but not limited to: IoT, artificial intelligence, robotics, mobile applications and computing, communications infrastructure and telecoms, computational biology and other data-driven business models, cloud technologies and software, consumer internet businesses and financial technology. The Fund will have the right to acquire certain investments already acquired (or agreed to be acquired) by the SoftBank Group, including 24.99% of its holding in ARM, and investments in Guardant Health, Intelsat, NVIDIA, OneWeb and SoFi.

(Photo: Chris Tedesco, BMW) Story Highlights Apple CarPlay to work wirelessly in new cars in wifi hotspots BMW is first to offer feeature, other automakers expected to follow quickly CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Good news for Apple iPhone users: CarPlay, the system that reduces distraction using your smartphone in the car, now works wirelessly on some new cars and more are on the way. BMW’s new 5-series, and most of the automaker’s other 2017 models, now offer CarPlay’s benefits via their Wi-Fi hot spot. Until now, all vehicles that had CarPlay required the phone to be hardwired into the vehicles’ USB port. CarPlay allows  the driver to do web searches for directions, phone numbers, find gas stations, play music, send and receive text messages and use some apps hands-free. It also displays some of the phone’s features on the vehicle's dashboard. iPhone users have wanted the system to work wirelessly, but the phones’ Bluetooth connections didn’t have enough bandwidth for features such as real-time updating of navigation maps. See Apple CarPlay work in a Chevrolet Corvette Wi-Fi hotspots provide a sturdier connection that can transfer the phones’ more data-intensive features to the same screen the BMWs use for navigation and audio. Apple expects many more vehicles with CarPlay-friendly Wi-Fi systems to hit the road shortly. Transferring navigation information and music to the car via Wi-Fi uses less battery power than streaming music alone via Bluetooth, according to Apple. Apple won’t identify the next vehicles likely to offer the feature, but any Wi-Fi-equipped new model from an automaker with advanced infotainment is a likely candidate. That should include a number of vehicles from high-volume, affordable brands before the year is out. Contact Mark Phelan: mmphelan@freepress.com or 313-222-6731. Follow him on Twitter @mark_phelan.

Still, it’s not as if Apple has been able to prevent any iOS 11 rumors from leaking out. Over the past few months, for example, we’ve seen indications that iOS 11 will feature enhanced Siri functionality, support for multi-user video chatting in FaceTime, peer-to-peer payments via Apple Pay, a Dark Mode option, smarter battery management software, and improved call quality. We even saw one sketchy rumor claiming that iOS 11 will alert a user when someone else takes a screenshot of an iMessage conversation. Now that’s all well and good, and even if we assume that all of the above rumors pan out, it’s a safe bet that iOS 11 will introduce a plethora of additional features designed to improve system performance and, more than anything, enhance the overall user experience. With a scarcity of iOS 11 rumors at our disposal, the EverythingApplePro YouTube channel recently put out a video highlighting an all-encompassing iOS 11 feature wish list. What makes the video remarkably impressive and engaging is that the vast majority of the suggested iOS 11 features are actually clever, intuitive, and user-friendly. Don't Miss: Exclusive: The world’s first look at Apple’s final iPhone 8 design in real life The entire video is well worth watching in its entirety, but a few of the suggested features that struck a chord with me include: more control over what appears in the Control Center, a volume toggle that doesn’t obstruct the display when turning the sound up or down, a numbered-key row above the stock keyboard, the ability to pause and re-start a recording without creating a new video, and a more useful one-handed mode than what Reachability provides. All in all, the video below is without question one of the most thoughtfully crafted and extensive iOS wish lists we’ve ever seen. And far from focusing on fantastical features that are either impractical or impossible to pull off, the suggested iOS 11 features below are completely reasonable for Apple to incorporate. For as advanced as iOS has become, the following video demonstrates that iOS still a lot of room left for improvement.

By Cassie Murdoch2017-05-20 14:30:00 UTC After WIRED offered us all a peek into Apple’s new headquarters, one notable fact emerged: there’s no daycare center. Whooooopsie.  Except this was no mistake. It was a big fat message to anyone who might be contemplating trying to balance family life with their obsessive devotion to their job. And that message reads, in the sleekest font imaginable, “nope.” The 150-acre campus contains a huge fitness and wellness center and every other amenity you can possibly imagine. Basically everything you’d need to live your life at work. Unless, of course, your life includes children. Kids are many things, but mostly they are messy. That goes against Apple’s whole vision of how the world should be — and it’s a vision that most of Silicon Valley shares. I’m not talking about being physically messy, though sticky children don’t exactly coordinate with Apple’s pristine white glass aesthetic.  SEE ALSO: Women, You Don't Have to Be Loud to Be Good Leaders I’m talking about the fact that having kids messes with your life. They’re unpredictable, they get sick, they need attention — actual face time, not FaceTime. No one should stay at the office 24 hours a day, but most parents simply cannot.   Being expected to work all the time affects everyone, but the burden falls disproportionately on mothers. Women, as you may have heard, aren’t super well represented in Silicon Valley. So maybe it's not a surprise that no one in the heavily male upper echelon of Apple took into account that lining up childcare is a costly and complicated endeavor for most families. No one should stay at the office 24 hours a day, but most parents simply cannot.   On-site daycare, of course, is not a perfect solution. But having reliable child care at your office makes being a working parent a lot easier. And in fact companies who provide it, like Patagonia, see a huge return in the form of retaining great workers.  There are those who might argue that on-site child care isn’t practical for many employers. And that’s true. It requires space, though it’s hard to see how that’s a factor when this campus was custom built to serve the company’s exact needs. It’s also expensive, but come on, this is Apple we’re talking about. Cash is not a factor.  Apple clearly could have included a daycare center if they’d wanted to. Hell, they could have built an entire K-12 school too. And probably a rocket launching pad for that matter. But these just weren’t priorities. And that says a lot. (Well, not the rocket launcher, but the other stuff.) That’s maybe fine at this exact second, considering that daycare likely isn’t the most relevant benefit to large swathes of their workforce. After all, tech bros aren’t exactly breeders… yet.  But this whole campus is a massive investment in Apple’s future, and their employees will not stay 25 forever. They’re going to grow up, and they’re going to start having kids. And as soon as they do, they’re going to be crazy thirsty for a place to drop those children off while they do their work. Too bad they're not going to find it.  They will, however, find a daycare on Google's campus.  Apple's shiny new HQ is not even open yet and already this thing feels like a relic of the past. That's what you get for building something exactly in the way Steve Jobs envisioned it. He wasn't exactly known for his own work-life balance, and so it's not a surprise that his idea of the future didn't include anyone who might want to actually see their family.  Here’s the thing, though. Jobs is dead. And so is the idea that there’s no need for work-life balance in Silicon Valley. Lean in, riiiight? It may take a while for startup culture to come around to having families in-office, but it'll happen sooner or later. It says a lot that Apple’s current leadership decided to double-down on such a family-unfriendly policy now. It’s especially ironic, coming from a company whose famous for the motto “Think Different.” This is some very same-y, old school thinking.  And, make no mistake, there was plenty of thinking involved in this endeavor. Every molecule of the campus was designed within an inch of its life. They designed the door handles, the specific angle of the windows, the goddamn pizza boxes. They didn’t forget to put a daycare in, they just didn’t want one.

Weeks, Corning’s chairman, chief executive officer and president. “This investment will ensure our plant in Harrodsburg remains a global center of excellence for glass technology.” In the US, Apple now supports 2 million jobs across all 50 states, including 450,000 jobs attributable to Apple’s spend and investment with US-based suppliers. Last year alone, Apple spent over $50 billion with more than 9,000 domestic suppliers and manufacturers. Since the inception of Gorilla Glass in 2007, the partnership between Apple and Corning has created and sustained nearly 1,000 US jobs across Corning’s R&D, manufacturing and commercial functions, including over 400 in Harrodsburg. Corning has procured enough renewable energy to cover all of its Apple manufacturing in the US.

It isn't easy, but here are a few pointers to help. Image: Fitbit Fortunately for those looking to consolidate their health and fitness data, most of these services have APIs, so there are options for pooling stats from different devices and apps. It's what Google and Apple have been trying to do with their own health and fitness portals, though with a limited amount of success so far. Using Google Fit Image: Google Google Fit now comes as standard on Nexus and Pixel devices, using the sensors packed into your phone (or Android Wear watch) to keep track of steps, sleep, and other measurements automatically. As you would expect from Google, it's slick and available on the web, but we're yet seeing much in the way of support from non-Google devices, even though Google Fit was first announced way back in summer 2014. Image: Screenshot There are a decent number of apps that work with Fit: Strava, Sleep As Android, and Runtastic, for example, so if you use these apps to track your running, walking, sleeping, and workouts then Google Fit is a decent option for consolidating everything in one place. What's missing is direct compatibility with the major wearable makers, the likes of Fitbit and Misfit, though Withings devices are supported. Compatible apps (here's a list) are usually connected from within each individual app's settings, so you'll need to dig around to find the option. From within the Google Fit app on Android, choose Settings from the menu then tap Apps connected to see what's piping data into Google Fit. Using Apple Health Image: Apple It's a similar story with Apple Health as it is for Google Fit — strong integration with Apple's own kit and support for some big-name apps, but more limited compatibility with actual devices you might be wearing on your body (unless it's the Apple Watch). Health is much broader in scope than Fit, acting as a repository for all of your medical data, not just the number laps your ran this morning. It also goes into greater depth when analysing your progress and making recommendations about where you can improve (like when to stop and take a breath). Image: Screenshot There's no easy way of checking which apps work with Apple Health and which don't, but as with Google Fit, Strava and Runtastic have joined the party, and Health links to apps from Misfit, Withings and Garmin too, so you can in theory use any of their wearables and pipe data through the default apps then on to Apple Health. Fitbit is the big hold-out. As with Google Fit, access is granted to Apple Health through the individual apps. Tap the Sources link on the front page of the Health app to see what you've linked up and adjust which variables each of the apps is allowed to edit. Using IFTTT Image: Screenshot We're unashamed fans of IFTTT (If This Then That), and the service plugs into just about every fitness tracking API out there including Fitbit, Jawbone, Withings, Misfit, Strava and more. This makes it even broader in scope than the offerings from Google and Apple. It's a shame then that IFTTT doesn't work with Google Fit or Apple Health directly. IFTTT isn't a repository for your data either, so once you've collected all the information from your various trackers and apps, you need to put it somewhere else. Fortunately, there are lots of options to pick from. You can pipe your statistics out to Evernote, for example, or a Google Drive spreadsheet, or OneNote, or even a blog post if you want the world to know what you're up to. A bit of trial and error might be required to get the data in the shape you need, but you've got plenty of scope for collecting and analysing feedback from multiple apps and devices. If you want to log your daily Fitbit stats to a Google Drive sheet, for example, choose Fitbit then Daily activity summary as your trigger, then Google Drive and Add row to a spreadsheet as your action. With a bit of touching up on the sheet itself, you can get a very decent-looking record of your exercise and sleep. Then you can import information from the spreadsheet into various apps. Using Exist We may well have saved the best until last. Exist draws in a ton of data from a range of fitness apps and devices, and will even go to the trouble of analysing it for you, letting you know which days you're most productive, and even how the weather affects your exercise. Exist works with Fitbit, Jawbone, Misfit, Withings, Google Fit, Apple Health (and the Apple Watch), Strava, Moves, Runkeeper and more besides. It can also pull in data from the likes of Last.fm, Spotify, Twitter, Dark Sky and RescueTime to try and chart your exercise against other factors like social media activity and how much music you're listening to. A subscription to Exist will set you back $US6 ($8) a month but there is a 30-day free trial available so you can work out whether it's for you. Once you've got yourself up and running, you can connect various services with just a few clicks. The online interface is a breeze to use and lets you dig into your stats in great detail, letting you chart different variables against each other. It also tries to pick out trends for you, letting you know everything from which music artist gets you exercising more to how your tweet patterns boost your step count.

Chris Jager 21 May 2017 4:30 PM The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has released its average weekly earnings report which does exactly what it says on the tin. By taking the average weekly earnings and multiplying them by 52, it's possible to work out the average annual wage in Australia. Here's how much you should be earning. Ask LH: How Do You Remove Those Tiny Shell Fragments From Raw Egg? Chris Jager 22 May 2017 1:30 PM Dear Lifehacker, What's the best way to get those little bits of egg shell out of a cracked egg? Sometimes I try to be cool by cracking eggs with one hand, but if my attention lapses for a second a bit of egg shell can escape into the bowl of shelled eggs. When I try and retrieve the little thing it lets me get really close to grabbing it but at the last minute inevitably slips through my fingers, teasing me to the point of madness. Any ideas?

Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive A party on the bridge: 'Walk and Roll' event showcases new Yucca Loma expanse Saturday May 20, 2017 at 4:54 PM May 20, 2017 at 4:56 PM Monica Solano Staff Writer @DP_MonicaInes APPLE VALLEY — Before rubber hits the road, thousands of residents and their pets literally took to the streets to experience the town's new Yucca Loma Bridge. “How often do you get to party on a bridge,” said Town spokeswoman Kathie Martin. “This has been in the talks for such a long time and to now see (the bridge) finally complete and open is such an exciting moment for our town.” After 11 years in the making, thousands of people came out to celebrate the newly completed Yucca Loma Bridge on Saturday morning. The bridge opened to pedestrian traffic on Friday. “We wanted to give residents the chance to experience the new bridge and bike path for themselves before it’s in full swing Monday morning,” Marin said. “So many people have told me how excited they were to finally be able to walk along the bridge. One man told me he had lived here for 40 years and would always look out from his window anticipating to use the bridge.” As children happy walked across the bridge with their parents by their side, others took to their bicycles and rode their way down to the end of the bridge while the first 750 participants received free event T-shirts. Timothy and Tara Lang, of Apple Valley, happily watched as their three sons Noah, Drew and Maxwell played with their toy cars along the walls of the bike path while they prepared for a bike ride down the bridge. “We told our kids this is the only time they’ll really get to play on the street,” said Timothy Lang jokingly. “We’re all really excited for this bridge. I used to ride my bicycle along the sidewalk on Bear Valley but it would terrify me with the cars being so close. I know my family and I will be using this bridge a lot.” Appearing on San Bernardino County circulation plans since as early as the 1960s, the bridge was identified as the town’s top transportation priority in 2006 in order to relieve traffic on Apple Valley Road and its intersections at Bear Valley and Highway 18. Today, it is the longest bridge in the High Desert that includes two lanes in each direction, barrier-protected pedestrian and bike paths, and Class II bike lanes on each side and travels from Apple Valley Road, across the Mojave River, past Mojave Narrows Regional Park along Yates Road and connect with Ridgecrest Road, according to Martin, The City of Victorville is also planning the third phase of the project that will extend Yates Road over the BNSF Railroad to Green Tree Boulevard at Hesperia Road. “It’s a wonderful addition to the community and we have been enjoying watching all the people come by and seeing the smile on their faces,” Martin said. The Yucca Loma Bridge is scheduled to open to traffic at approximately 9 a.m. Monday, according to officials. Monica Solano can be reached at MSolano@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6231.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 22 May 2017 | MYT 12:23 PM Ford using first over-the-air software updates to its 2016 cars The latest upgrade to Sync 3, Ford's interactive touchscreen system, will be accomplished through an over-the-air (OTA) update using WiFi. — Ford SAN FRANCISCO: Ford Motor Co said it would delve into the growing arena of "over-the-air" software updates, adding Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to its Sync 3-equipped 2016 vehicles for the first time via a wireless software update.  The latest upgrade to Sync 3, Ford's interactive touchscreen system, will be accomplished through an over-the-air (OTA) update using WiFi, not unlike how new software gets uploaded to smartphones by manufacturers.  After Tesla Inc's early lead in 2015 introducing OTAs, traditional automakers are slowly beginning to embrace the new technology, within limits. Concerns about security and resistance from dealers worried about losing service revenue have hampered its adoption.  Thus far, established automakers have not used OTAs for safety systems, only for non-critical systems like infotainment.  Customers can also get the update via the traditional means of visiting their dealer or using a USB drive, Ford said.  Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are operating systems from Alphabet's Google and Apple Inc that allow drivers to connect their smartphones to their vehicles' dashboard.  Ford's first use of OTAs comes about two months after it said it would hire 400 engineers to work on connectivity, mostly from Blackberry Ltd's shuttered phone handset business. Blackberry QNX powers Ford's Sync 3 system.  Besides being more convenient for customers, OTAs can bring automakers cost savings, as a substantial percentage of warranty repair issues and recalls can be corrected through OTAs. — Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested Find out what information your apps are collecting about you WannaCry victims, stop being lazy with updates The evolution of mobile phones Coway promotes a healthy lifestyle When the CEO is your mentor 10 after work habits for personal success Others Also Read Malaysian street artist to make his mark in Melbourne Venezuela's Maduro attacks 'fascist' protesters for setting man alight Cat club holds seminar to help breeders get certified advertisement Latest News Amazon sets sights on UK grocery with checkout-free trademark Google woos developers to catch Amazon in digital assistant race WannaCry attack is good business for cyber security firms Ex-IBM employee from China pleads guilty to code theft charges Amid industry pushback, China offers changes to cyber rules: sources Most Viewed in Tech French researchers find way to unlock WannaCry without ransom Uber’s new pricing model tests how much riders will stomach Ex-IBM employee from China pleads guilty to code theft charges Did your package get dumped in transit?

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Companies Softbank-Saudi tech fund becomes world's biggest with $93 billion of capital Besides Softbank and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, the new fund's investors include Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment, Apple Inc, Qualcomm, Taiwan's Foxconn Technology and Japan's Sharp Corp. Reuters May 22, 2017 10:34 IST SoftBank Group Corp chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son attends a news conference in Tokyo, Japan, February 8, 2017.Reuters file The world's largest private equity fund, backed by Japan's Softbank Group and Saudi Arabia's main sovereign wealth fund, said on Saturday it had raised over $93 billion to invest in technology sectors such as artificial intelligence and robotics. "The next stage of the Information Revolution is under way, and building the businesses that will make this possible will require unprecedented large-scale, long-term investment," the Softbank Vision Fund said in a statement. Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, chairman of Softbank, a telecommunications and tech investment group, revealed plans for the fund last October and since then it has obtained commitments from some of the world's most deep-pocketed investors. In addition to Softbank and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), the new fund's investors include Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment, which has committed $15 billion, Apple Inc, Qualcomm, Taiwan's Foxconn Technology and Japan's Sharp Corp. The new fund made its announcement during the visit of President Donald Trump to Riyadh and the signing of tens of billions of dollars worth of business deals between U.S. and Saudi companies. Son was also in Riyadh on Saturday. After meeting with Trump last December, Son pledged $50 billion of investment in the United States that would create 50,000 jobs, a promise Trump claimed was a direct result of his election win. The fund may also serve the interests of Saudi Arabia by helping Riyadh obtain access to foreign technology. The Saudi economy has been severely damaged by low oil prices, and policymakers are trying to diversify into new industries. The PIF signalled an interest in the tech sector last year by investing $3.5 billion in U.S. ride-hailing firm Uber. Saturday's statement did not say how much the PIF had committed to the fund, but previously it has said it would invest up to $45 billion over five years. Softbank is investing $28 billion. The new fund said it would seek to buy minority and majority interests in both private and public companies, from emerging businesses to established, multi-billion-dollar firms. It expects to obtain preferred access to long-term investment opportunities worth $100 million or more. Other sectors in which the fund may invest include mobile computing, communications infrastructure, computational biology, consumer internet businesses and financial technology. The fund aims for $100 billion of committed capital and expects to complete its money-raising in six months, it added.

Memorial day, summer's big kick-off, is a week away and my nervous tick is back. For good reason. According to climatologist Mark Seeley Minnesota's statewide average rainfall is roughly 30 percent higher now than it was from 1921 to 1950. There's more water in the air, and it's coming down harder, especially spring and early summer months. 4 to 6 inches of rain swamped the area last week as a stalled trough of low pressure incubated 3 separate sloppy storms. A 'Sunshine Watch' has been issued for today. Please don't stare up at that bright, glowing mystery-orb, but try to enjoy 60s before a few instability thundershowers mushroom to life. Showers spill into Tuesday before improving weather midweek. A warming trend is still brewing - we should top 70F by late week. No more drenching, all-day rains in sight, but a swirl of chilly air aloft may set off weekend showers, especially up north. Far from perfect, but a definite improvement in the weather. More Than a Month's Worth of Rain in 7 Days. The coveted Golden Rain Gauge Award goes to South St. Paul, where 5.08" rain fell since last Monday, according to local observers. The MSP Airport in Richfield picked up a cool 4.18" of rain with 3.45" in St. Paul. Accumulated Rainfall. 24-hour Doppler radar rainfall estimates are available from NOAA's AHPS Precipitation Analysis site, along with a wealth of additional information. Excessive Rainfall Potential Today. NOAA WPC is outlining an area of southern Louisiana and Mississippi, including New Orleans and Gulfport, for extreme rains capable of sparking flash flooding today; a slight risk of urban flooding from Houston and Shreveport to Birmingham with a marginal risk for the Mid Atlantic region. Serious Wet Bias East of the Rockies. Check out 84-hour predicted rainfall amounts for the Gulf Coast and Southeastern USA; a streak of 3-6" amounts forecast from Houston and New Orleans to Atlanta and the Carolinas. The west coast gets a welcome break from puddles in the coming days. Loop: Tropicaltidbits.com. Sluggish Pattern Increases Flood Risk. When weather systems slow or stall bad things often result. A very slow-moving area of low pressure drags a line of heavy showers and T-storms across the southern USA today, another wave of moisture tracking over the same waterlogged counties by Wednesday. Meanwhile dry, sunny, increasingly warm weather is the rule over the western half of the USA. Stumbling Into Spring. It's been a rough 7 days, battling a veritable parade of storms. The pattern will slowly improve, although temperatures this week still trend below average. We get a glimpse of spring today before another (minor) relapse tomorrow. With a little luck and Divine Intervention we may rebound into the 70s by late week. Twin Cities ECMWF forecast: WeatherBell. 2-Week Weather Darts: Warmer! Confidence levels are low due to an ongoing tendency for the atmosphere over North America to get temporarily locked into a blocking pattern, where weather systems slow or even stall for days on end. GFS guidance hints at a hot ridge of high pressure building over the southern USA, expanding into the Plains and Midwest. We'll see. Summer Outlook: Here is the temperature (left) and precipitation outlook for June, July and August, courtesy of NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. Much of the USA is forecast to experience a warmer-than-average summer, with the exception of the northern Rockies, northern Plains and Upper Mississippi River Valley, where temperatures are forecast to be close to average. A wet bias is predicted from the Rockies into the Plains for meteorological summer. Flooding Overview. Floodlist.com has continuous updates, broken out by continent, related to ongoing flooding episodes around the planet. Here's an excerpt of a new United Nations report highlighted on the site: "A recent report by the UN, “The Human Cost of Weather Related Disasters”, reveals that in the last 20 years, 157,000 people have died as a result of floods. The report also says that between 1995 and 2015, floods affected 2.3 billion people, which accounts for 56% of all those affected by weather-related disasters – considerably more than any other type of weather-related disaster..." Image credit: UNISDR / CRED. Scientists Look to Skies to Improve Tsunami Detection. Here's a snippet from an interesting NASA story: "A team of scientists from Sapienza University in Rome, Italy, and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, has developed a new approach to assist in the ongoing development of timely tsunami detection systems, based upon measurements of how tsunamis disturb a part of Earth’s atmosphere. The new approach, called Variometric Approach for Real-time Ionosphere Observation, or VARION, uses observations from GPS and other global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to detect, in real time, disturbances in Earth’s ionosphere associated with a tsunami. The ionosphere is the layer of Earth’s atmosphere located from about 50 to 621 miles (80 to 1,000 kilometers) above Earth’s surface. It is ionized by solar and cosmic radiation and is best known for the aurora borealis (northern lights) and aurora australis (southern lights). When a tsunami forms and moves across the ocean, the crests and troughs of its waves compress and extend the air above them, creating motions in the atmosphere known as internal gravity waves..."

As the wave (dark blue/white lines approaching from the northeast) moved, it perturbed the atmosphere and changed the density of ionospheric electrons as reflected by navigation satellite signal changes (colored dots)."

The Atlantic explains our good collective fortune: "The next time someone says you’re living in a bubble, remind them that we all are. A pair of NASA space probes have detected an artificial bubble around Earth that forms when radio communications from the ground interact with high-energy radiation particles in space, the agency announced this week. The bubble forms a protective barrier around Earth, shielding the planet from potentially dangerous space weather, like solar flares and other ejections from the sun. Earth already has its own protective bubble, a magnetosphere stretched by powerful solar winds. The artificial bubble that NASA found is an accident, an unintended result of the interplay between human technology and nature..." (File image: NASA). Solar Employs More U.S. Workers Than Apple, Google and Facebook Combined. With a little perspective on renewables and employment here's a clip from ThinkProgress: "...As of 2016, California has just over 100,000 solar jobsâ—âa one-third increase over the previous year. The country added a record 50,000 solar jobs last year. The U.S. solar industry currently has more than 260,000 workers nationwide, according to The Solar Foundation. Their executive director, Andrea Luecke, points out that’s more workers than “Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon combined.” (As a point of clarification, Amazon has added jobs at a torrid pace in the last couple of years, so the 260,000 solar jobs is ‘only’ more than Apple, Google, and Facebook combined.)..."

NPR reports: "As part of President Trump's executive order to review "job-killing regulations," the Environmental Protection Agency last month asked for the public's input on what to streamline or cut. It held a series of open-mic meetings, and set up a website that has now received more than 28,000 comments, many of which urge the agency not to roll back environmental protections. "The EPA saves lives," wrote Benjamin Kraushaar, who described himself as a hydrologist, hunter and flyfisherman. He wrote that environmental regulations "ensure safe air and water for our future generations. This should not be even up for debate..."

I agree with all 5; here's an excerpt from Linda Steil at Chrysler Capital: "...I’ve already extolled the virtues of this amazing and free app. When we lived in the city, there were many times it got us around traffic jams, not to mention the help it gave us navigating messy downtown construction. Now that we live in a more country-like setting, I’m still constantly reaching to put my destination in Waze. Even when I know where I’m going, but want to predict an arrival time or tell someone else (another Wazer) when I’ll be meeting them, it’s amazingly accurate, updates real-time and is very simple to use..." The Worst Tourist Trap in Every State. I disagree with Business Insider's perspective on MOA, Mall of America in Minnesota. Otherwise the list looks fairly reasonable: "Maybe you're touring the US as a citizen out to see your homeland. Or maybe you're coming from afar to see what America has to offer. Either way, you probably want to make the most of your travels. While some tourist spots across the country have become legendary landmarks that everyone should see, others are just disappointing tourist traps. Some are blatant attempts to make money, others are plain weird, but either way, they should be avoided at all costs. Save your time, money, and sanity by skipping these 50 tourist traps..."

May 22, 2011: A strong EF-1 tornado with wind speeds up to 110 mph strikes north Minneapolis, causing extensive tree and structural damage. The tornado touched down in St. Louis Park and moved through north Minneapolis, lasting 14.25 miles before dissipating in Blaine after causing minor damage to the Anoka County Airport. The tornado reached a peak width of 1/2 mile.

Racing to Find Answers in the Ice. The New York Times has done a remarkable job, journalistically and visually, telling the story of what's happening in Antarctica - why not just coastal residents need to pay attention: "...Unraveling the answers, and gaining a better understanding of how Antarctica’s ice has waxed and waned in the past, may offer a rough guide to the changes that human-caused global warming could wreak in the future. Already, scientists know enough to be concerned. About 120,000 years ago, before the last ice age, the planet went through a natural warm period, with temperatures similar to those expected in coming decades. The sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than it is today, implying that the ice sheets in both Greenland and Antarctica must have partly disintegrated, a warning of what could occur in the relatively near future if the heating of the planet continues unchecked..." Map credit: "Red areas have lost significant amounts of ice since 2010." Climate Change Could Slash Staple Crops. CO2 is plant food? Yes, but too CO2 can ruin the recipe. Climate Central explains: "Climate change, and its impacts on extreme weather and temperature swings, is projected to reduce global production of corn, wheat, rice and soybeans by 23 percent in the 2050s, according to a new analysis. The study, which examined price and production of those four major crops from 1961 to 2013, also warns that by the 2030s output could be cut by 9 percent. The findings come as researchers and world leaders continue to warn that food security will become an increasingly difficult problem to tackle in the face of rising temperatures and weather extremes, combining with increasing populations, and volatile food prices. The negative impacts of climate change to farming were pretty much across the board in the new analysis. There were small production gains projected for Russia, Turkey and Ukraine in the 2030s, but by the 2050s, the models “are negative and more pronounced for all countries,” the researchers wrote in the study published this month in the journal Economics of Disasters and Climate Change..." Photo credit: Andrew Seaman/flickr Looming Floods, Threatened Cities. What if all those ("alarmist") scientists who specialize in this stuff turn out to be right? Here's an excerpt of Part 2 of The New York Times series on troubling changes in West Antarctica: "...In 2016, Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and David Pollard of Pennsylvania State University published a study, based on a computer analysis of Antarctica, that raised alarms worldwide. Incorporating recent advances in the understanding of how ice sheets might break apart, they found that both West Antarctica and some vulnerable parts of East Antarctica would go into an unstoppable collapse if the Earth continued to warm at a rapid pace. In their worst-case scenario, the sea level could rise by six feet by the end of this century, and the pace could pick up drastically in the 22nd century. Dr. DeConto and Dr. Pollard do not claim that this is a certainty — they acknowledge that their analysis is still rough — but they argue that the possibility should be taken seriously..." The Arctic Doomsday Seed Vault Flooded. Thanks, Global Warming. Oh the irony. WIRED.com reports: "It was designed as an impregnable deep-freeze to protect the world’s most precious seeds from any global disaster and ensure humanity’s food supply forever. But the Global Seed Vault, buried in a mountain deep inside the Arctic circle, has been breached after global warming produced extraordinary temperatures over the winter, sending meltwater gushing into the entrance tunnel. The vault is on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen and contains almost a million packets of seeds, each a variety of an important food crop. When it was opened in 2008, the deep permafrost through which the vault was sunk was expected to provide “failsafe” protection against “the challenge of natural or man-made disasters...” Why Do We Crave the Awful Futures of Apocalyptic Fiction? Aeon Videos has a memorable clip that's worth a look. A Future of More Extreme Floods, Brought To You By Climate Change. The Verge has a must-read story: "Extreme floods along the coastline may become much more common if sea levels continue to climb unchecked, new research says. Scientists estimate that as soon as 2030, a 4-inch sea level rise could double the frequency of severe flooding in many parts of the world, and increase it by as much as 25 times in the tropics. For the communities and ecosystems in the floodwaters’ path, the toll could be catastrophic. Right now, the global sea level is slowly but surely creeping upwards a fraction of an inch each year (0.118 to 0.157 inches per year to be exact). That doesn’t seem like much, but we’re already feeling the consequences of rising waters and eroding coastlines. Tides high enough to flood homes and infrastructure have become more common in some parts of the US like Florida — “turning it from a rare event into a recurrent and disruptive problem,” as a report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration put it earlier in 2017. In Louisiana, an entire community was driven from their homes on Isle de Jean Charles by rising seas..." Photo credit: "Flooding after Hurricane Katrina Photo by Lieut.

Staff Directory May 21 Record Rainfall Saturday - Over 4" Last Week - Risk of Spring This Week Well that was fun. A true monsoon rain - typical for October or March, but rare in May, when convection (showers and T-storms) should be the norm. Then again it didn't snow - things can always be worse. A shower or sprinkle is possible today, but no more heavy/soaking rains for awhile. We warm up later in the week - 70s possible by late week, closer to where we should be right now. Staff Directory May 19 Paul Douglas: More March than May, with a Saturday soaker It's a little early to panic, but I'm starting to wonder (out loud) if Minnesota will experience a coolish, super-soggy summer. We've been in a blocking (holding) pattern which may break down in the coming weeks. Plenty of sweaty days ahead, in theory. But not this weekend. Today will be perfectly normal, for late March. Have a Plan B. Better weather returns next week; milder and drier. Staff Directory May 19 "Plan B" Saturday - Springy Again Next Week - Tornado Terminology For Extreme Twisters A few light showers are possible today, especially south of the Twin Cities, but the main event, the third (and last) surge of heavy rain, arrives Saturday. Throw in low, scrappy clouds and temperatures holding in the 40s and low 50s and you have a miserable day, more typical of late March. Sunday looks better with some partial clearing by afternoon as a drying northwest wind kicks in behind the storm. Next week will be better. Not perfect, but better.

This has resulted in reports indicating that the phone could be released in the later part of the year, or possibly even early next year. However according to a report from Seeking Alpha (via Cult of Mac), it seems that analyst at Morgan Stanley think that Apple will no longer encounter any delays with the launch of the iPhone 8, and that it is apparently still on track for a launch this September which is usually around that time of the year that Apple makes new iPhone announcements. So much so that the analysts have given Apple’s stock price a price target boost based on the belief that there aren’t going to be any delays. Of course this is just the opinions of analysts who may or may not end up being right, so you’ll obviously want to take this with a grain of salt for now, although we guess we wouldn’t be surprised if initial stock was low as Apple tends to run into shortages at launch due to overwhelming demand. The latest from the analysts seem to back a tweet by @OnLeaks earlier this month in which he states that mass production is on track for August in anticipation of a launch in September, but we guess we’ll just have to wait and see. According to my sources: DVT started last month. PVT will start between June and July. Final mass production in August for September launch. https://t.co/2M2YyMjyi8 — OnLeaks (@OnLeaks) May 11, 2017 Filed in Apple >Cellphones >Rumors. Read more about iPhone.

Google, along with Facebook and Apple, is making huge investments into artificial intelligence and augmented reality. Google Lens is its first implementation of these technologies. Google CEO Sundar Pichai provided some details about Google Lens and claimed it is a major inflection point for the company. "All of Google was built because we started understanding text and web pages," Pichai explained. "So, the fact that computers can understand images and videos has profound implications for our core mission." Google Lens will bring a level of intelligence to the phone that combines images with artificial intelligence and augmented reality, combining the real with the virtual. Some of the examples he cited let you point your phone’s camera at a flower and its name, along with information about the flower, will be shown on the screen. Point it at a restaurant or another store and reviews and information will be shown above the store’s image. You’ll also be able to use Google Lens as a means of search. Point the camera at an object and it will tell you where you can buy it or other information about what it recognizes. Google Lens will also be added to Google Photos and allow you to search them by what’s in the images, or modify the photos themselves. Pichai demonstrated how your images can be cleaned up using artificial intelligence. He used the example of taking a picture through a chain link fence and removing the fence from the picture automatically. These areas of technology are the focus of Apple and Facebook as well, and many expect us to be fully engaged with apps using them before the end of the year. Facebook is pouring billions of dollars into developing virtual and augmented reality software. They envision that we’ll be able to just wear a special pair of glasses, and the information will be presented to us without the need for a phone. Apple CEO Tim Cook has praised the benefits of augmented reality and has hinted that the new iPhones being introduced this fall will make heavy use of it. We can see some examples today of the potential. Vivino, a free app used by 23 million people, lets you take a picture of a wine list and see the ratings for each wine. It’s a multi-step process now: take the picture, enter it, wait for the processing to occur, and then view an image of the wine list with the ratings.

Other reports state that it may be delayed, while the Inquisitr recently claims that it will be launched on time after all. In either case, the much-awaited 10th anniversary iPhone will be worth the wait and the expected price, judging by the most recent leaks and rumors. iPhone 8 Design Leak The latest leak to hit the internet involves the molds for the upcoming iPhone 7s, 7s Plus, and iPhone 8. The leak confirms what has been rumored again and again in the past, but it also reveals that the 10th year anniversary iPhone’s size sits between its siblings. As can be seen in the image below, the iPhone 7s Plus has a significant difference in size compared to the alleged iPhone 8, which is only slightly larger than the 7s. BGR comments that it goes against a previous rumor saying that it will be the same size as the 7s with the display of the Plus variant, but Apple may have failed to cram the entirety of the bigger display into the smaller chassis, forcing the company to adjust the sizing. #Apple – #iPhone8 – #iPhone7s – iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus and iPhone 8 molds pictured next to each other https://t.co/qsDALfrmTM pic.twitter.com/HS1TM3H4Cv — /LEAKS (@Slashleaks) May 20, 2017 The leak also corroborates the recent iPhone 8 design rumors that indicate a vertical dual-camera set-up. It also verifies that the set-up and design of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are carried over to their successors, meaning that the larger variant still has horizontally arranged dual cameras while the smaller one has a single camera. The iPhone 8 design was also previously revealed by BGR in the form of a dummy model, seen below. Notice how the back looks exactly like it came from the mold, but that may be because it has only one design element and that is the camera. Nonetheless, it is getting more and more convincing with every supposed leak. Is this what the iPhone 8 will look like?Photo: BGR The internet has become awash with …https://t.co/QRfjj8gGuM pic.twitter.com/GhI3OA7T27 — Tech News Daily (@technewsbuzzer) May 21, 2017 iPhone 8 Release Date The latest belief is that the iPhone 8 will be revealed alongside its siblings, the 7s and 7s Plus, in September. Amid rumors of delay that may result from difficulties in accomplishing some of its features, Morgan Stanley’s researchers believe that the smartphone is on track to the planned release date. With that in mind, a September reveal and a launch soon after may still be a go, contrary to previous rumors saying that the iPhone 8 will be released in Q4 instead. If so, this will be the first time that three iPhones will be announced at the same time, but not the first instance of three models releasing in the same year. Last year, months before the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus came about, Apple launched the entry-level iPhone SE with the form factor of the iPhone 5/5s and the specs of the iPhone 6s sans the 3D Touch. [Image by Apple] iPhone 8 Specs, Price The leaks above show a stainless steel frame sandwiched between curved glass panels. The front and back basically look the same save for the camera and the logo (and maybe the Touch ID) at the back. This design apparently allows Apple to set up the wireless charging feature, which may or may not appear also on the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. The camera is set up vertically allegedly due to some augmented reality features that may also be exclusive to the iPhone 8, contributing to its believed exaggerated price tag. The cheapest model is said to be priced at $1,000 with 128GB internal storage, while the 256GB model might sell for $1,099. With a full display, improved cameras, wireless charging, and upgraded internal specs, the iPhone 8 might just be worth the price despite being hundreds of dollars more expensive than other flagships. But fans will not know for sure until it is revealed hopefully in September. Stay tuned for more iPhone 8 updates.

But we also trust cloud services to protect our data. And that extends to deletions. ElcomSoft has proven that it is possible to retrieve deleted notes after the 30-day window that Apple has set for getting notes back. Deleted notes are stored in the Recently Deleted folder in the iOS and macOS Notes application. After 30 days, the notes disappear. But it seems Apple isn't actually clearing the data from their stores. Elcomsoft has been able to find deleted notes going all the way back to 2015,. They've told Apple about this, just as they did with a couple of similar issues they detected previously, which Apple has previously patched. In short, if you're using Notes for iOS or macOS, you can't be 100% confident data you delete is actually gone until Apple resolves the issue.

Chris Jager 21 May 2017 4:30 PM The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has released its average weekly earnings report which does exactly what it says on the tin. By taking the average weekly earnings and multiplying them by 52, it's possible to work out the average annual wage in Australia. Here's how much you should be earning. Ask LH: How Do You Remove Those Tiny Shell Fragments From Raw Egg? Chris Jager 22 May 2017 1:30 PM Dear Lifehacker, What's the best way to get those little bits of egg shell out of a cracked egg? Sometimes I try to be cool by cracking eggs with one hand, but if my attention lapses for a second a bit of egg shell can escape into the bowl of shelled eggs. When I try and retrieve the little thing it lets me get really close to grabbing it but at the last minute inevitably slips through my fingers, teasing me to the point of madness. Any ideas?

The AI-powered Google Assistant is Google's answer to the likes of Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana, always at your beck and call to answer those tricky questions and help manage your life. Google Assistant is at the heart of the Google Home smart benchtop speaker, which is coming to Australia this year, but the search giant is determined to see its talkative assistant on as many devices as possible. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Google Assistant is making Android TV smarter than ever. Photo: Adam Turner On the box Google's smart TV platform is an obvious candidate for Google Assistant integration, considering your television is the home entertainment hub and often left switched on. The integration of Google Assistant is part of Android TV's Android O upgrade which enhances Google's efforts to seamlessly weave free-to-air, recorded, subscription and streaming television into the one interface. The source of the content is irrelevant, the idea is to simply help you find something of interest and start watching as effortlessly as possible. You can pin your favourite apps and sources to the top "My Apps" row of the home screen, underneath which is a Netflix-style "Watch Next" list and "Recommended" where all apps have the ability to place recommendations based on your tastes and recent viewing habits include programs you're in the middle of watching. Advertisement Content thumbnails are actually live video previews – not just playing the clip from the beginning but instead finding the actual trailer for that piece of content. When you click play you go directly to the content and start watching, rather than simply being dumped into that app. Talk the talk Sony offers one of the slickest Android TV implementations, which already has some great search features, but Google Assistant takes it to the next level. It won't be available on televisions for several months, so its developers offered a demo running on an Nvidia Shield at the recent Google I/O developer conference in Mountain View, California. For starters Google Assistant allows Android TV to handle far more complex searches, with the contextual awareness to follow your chain of thought. For example "Find Winona Ryder on Jimmy Kimmel" calls up a list of YouTube clips of his show and you can simply say "play the first one" to listen to them discuss Stranger Things, rather than spelling out exactly what you want the television to do. From here you can call up Google Assistant over the bottom of the screen, with a casual "Okay Google" and then ask "tell me about Stranger Things" followed by "how many episodes does it have?". At this point Google Assistant will start reading the answers aloud whilst displaying the details, all without disrupting the playback of the Jimmy Kimmel YouTube clip. If you've decided that you're keen on the show then simply say "Okay Google, Play Stranger Things" and it will smoothly transition across to Netflix and start playing the first episode. It's an incredibly slick user experience when you consider how clunky it would be to go through all those steps in your average lounge room. Sit back Of course another advantage of having Google Assistant in your television is that you can talk to it like Google Home, asking it to dim the lights, pause the music in the next room and order you a pizza delivery while you sit back to watch the first episode. If you remember that you're supposed to be somewhere else, Google Assistant on the television can check traffic conditions and travel times to see if you can afford to spend a few more minutes on the couch. One disappointment is that Google Assistant on Android TV can't yet recognise different voices but it's coming and this will certainly take the personalised Android lounge room experience to the next level. How smart is your lounge room and how would you put Google Assistant to good use on your television? Adam Turner travelled to the Google I/O conference in California as a guest of Google.

While it was widely anticipated that the iPhone 8 would see a September 2017 release, speculations were high that the production problems might end up pushing the flagship smartphone’s release as far back as November 2017. Fortunately, recent reports have emerged stating that no delays would happen with regards to the iPhone 8’s release date. The device, however, would likely be extremely expensive. If a recent Morgan Stanley report is any indication, the alleged production problems with the iPhone 8 components are rather inaccurate. According to a Seeking Alpha report, the global financial services firm has concluded that the manufacture of the iPhone 8’s components has not hit a significant roadblock as of yet. “Morgan Stanley’s Greater China Technology Research colleagues have not yet seen delays in the supply chain and still expect new iPhone production to start on time for most of the components (including OLED).” With this in mind, the September 2017 release date for the iPhone 8 definitely appears to be entirely plausible. If any, the conclusion from Morgan Stanley’s researchers points to a high-profile smartphone launch happening sometime this September, in line with initial rumors about the device’s debut. #Apple – #iPhone8 – #iPhone7s – iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus and iPhone 8 molds pictured next to each other https://t.co/qsDALfrmTM pic.twitter.com/HS1TM3H4Cv — /LEAKS (@Slashleaks) May 20, 2017 While the conclusions from Morgan Stanley’s researchers are no doubt encouraging, a number of reports have emerged stating that the iPhone 8’s components are becoming a bit more expensive to produce. As mentioned in a DigiTimes report, the Chinese-language newspaper Economic News Daily has published an article stating that the manufacturer for the iPhone 8’s 3D Touch sensor is now charging Apple 2.5 times more than what it charged for the same components in the iPhone 6S and iPhone 7. This means that the 3D Touch engine, which was speculated to cost Apple about $7 to $9 to make, is now charging the Cupertino-based tech giant around $18 to $22 to manufacture the component. The massive price increase, however, has a pretty good reason. According to the Chinese publication, the notable increase in price for the iPhone 8’s 3D Touch sensor is a result of the upcoming flagship’s OLED display, since, OLED panels are far more fragile than the traditional LCD displays that Apple utilized in the past. “The solution directly bonds 3D Touch sensors on LTPS TFT-LCD display panels of the iPhone, but 3D Touch solution for OLED panels entails bonding of a glass cover on the front and back side of an OLED panel each to reinforce the fragile OLED panel.” #iPhone8 White/Rose Gold Version. (by Pierrick Pichaureaux) #AppleLeaker pic.twitter.com/8fA1Rjn2ey — AppleLeaker (@AppleLeaker) May 12, 2017 Interestingly, the production process for the iPhone 8’s 3D Touch engine is reported to be costing the manufacturer of the component up to 50 percent more. Apple, however, seems set to pay 150 percent more for the iPhone 8’s 3D Touch sensor. This is quite an interesting detail, especially since Apple has a reputation for being extremely firm when negotiating component costs with its suppliers. With the iPhone 8’s 3D Touch sensors, however, the Cupertino-based tech giant appears to have covered most of the added expenses in order for the upcoming flagship’s production to commence without delay. It’s not just the 3D Touch sensors of the iPhone 8 that are rumored to have increased in price as well. Recent speculations have emerged stating that Apple would also be paying far more for the iPhone 8’s OLED display and faster NAND/DRAM memory. With all these additional costs piling up, it definitely appears that Apple’s 2017 flagship would be one of the costliest smartphones of the year. Currently, the iPhone 8 is rumored to cost $999 for the 128GB version and $1,099 for the 256GB variant. Considering the raised prices of its components, these pricing speculations might prove accurate.

 I was there for the first iPhone release 10 years ago — here's what it was like Daryl Deino, Observer May 21, 2017, 3:26 PM 3,069 facebook linkedin twitter email print Steve Jobs introducing the first iPhone. AP It was the night of June 28, 2007. I was living in Torrance, Calif. at the time and had waited since January to get my hands on the new iPhone, which Steve Jobsannounced on January 9 earlier in the year. There were a lot of thoughts going through my mind: Would my credit go through? If it did, would I be able to get a local number? (There were rumors that AT&T didn’t have many 310 area code numbers for new activations.) Would I be able to play my video files on the iPhone, or would I have to convert them? If I have to convert them, will there be a program available for that? Here’s what I wrote for my blog that evening. “The iPhone will go on tomorrow at most Apple and AT&T stores. With a two-year contract, a 4GB version will run you $499, and an 8GB version will run you $599. Is this phone overpriced? Probably! Is this phone overhyped? Yes! But as you can tell, even hard to convince technophiles such as myself have bought into the hype. Tonight, I am preparing to camp out for the iPhone. I first have to make sure I have enough food, water, and other protective gear (such as an umbrella to prevent sunburn) before I reach my final iPhone destination in Southern California (which I’m not sure exactly where yet) tonight. Am I crazy? Yes!” I ended up not camping out anywhere, especially since the phone didn’t go on sale until 6 p.m. the next day. However, I woke very early and chose the AT&T store on Hawthorne Blvd. in Torrance. It proved to be a good choice because nobody else was lining up yet. I put my bean bag down and started fantasizing about rubbing my fingers on the iPhone and pinching them apart in order to zoom in on a web page. I was upset that the iPhone would only run on AT&T’s slow (even for 2007) Edge network instead of using a 3G one. The world would have to wait one more year for that. By 8 a.m., about 20 other people arrived. We all felt like we were about to become a part of history and were correct: The launch of the first iPhone certainly changed history. Like the Cupertino company had always done, Apple took a device that was already available by other manufacturers, perfected it, and marketed it to the masses. Before the iPhone, there was the Palm Treo. There was also the Blackberry, which would be the top selling smartphone for businesses during the 2000s. There were also several Windows Mobile phones, but the iPhone was the first device that made one feel they were putting a small computer in their pocket. The iPhone was the first device that was a music player, a portable video player (still a big deal in 2007), a camera, a phone, and an internet surfing machine all at once. It seemed to have everything but the kitchen sink. ­However, the first-generation device had some major flaws besides a slow Internet connection. For one thing, the App store didn’t take off until 2008, when the iPhone 3G was released. There was also the fact that 8GB of storage really wasn’t enough when one had a huge video and music library. Then, there is the fact that the iPhone debuted at $499 for the 4GB version and $599 for the 8GB model, and those were on-contract prices. And the battery life was a nightmare for most users, although it was expected that a phone with that much power wouldn’t last as long as a regular cell phone. Still, the flaws didn’t stop thousands across the country from lining up at AT&T or Apple retail locations. The 11 hours I spent in line at the AT&T Store in Torrance went by fast, especially since we all felt like a community of geeks who bought coffee and donuts for each other while making sure to hold people’s positions in line when they went to the bathroom. At 5 p.m., several news cameras appeared as if the president was in town. We looked in the window and drooled as the AT&T workers set up the iPhone stands. Then, at 6 p.m., we heard a loud roar of cheers. I walked in and posed for pictures while a nice, young lady prepared my iPhone. On July 1, I wrote my review. This was my final paragraph: “Despite a few shortcomings, the iPhone is still a major technological innovation that will only alienate a small minority of smartphone users in its first-generation release. Three days after using it, I still find myself saying “wow!” all the time. One has to feel sorry for other carriers such as Sprint, Verizon, and T-Mobile, who are about to become extinct unless they come up with something just as impressive.” The other networks tried to outdo AT&T with “iPhone killers” such as Verizon’s disastrous Blackberry Storm and Sprint’s failed Palm Pre. Had the iPhone not arrived to these networks after the AT&T exclusivity contract ended in 2011, it’s quite possible they wouldn’t exist today. Ten years later, the iPhone is still the best-selling smartphone in the world. Even though many believe there are better smartphones than the iPhone, Apple’s device was the one that started it all. June 29 will always be a holiday for technophiles and smartphone-obsessed geeks like myself. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

By the time September rolls around, it’s widely believed Apple will release three brand new iPhone models: an iPhone 7s, an iPhone 7s Plus, and last but not least, the highly anticipated iPhone 8. Don't Miss: Hackers are trying to bring the WannaCry ransomware back from the dead While the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus will sport the same form factor as the iPhone 7, the iPhone 8 will introduce a completely new design, complete with an advanced edge-to-edge 5.8-inch OLED display that will essentially take up the entire front end of the device. In fact, reports from the rumor mill suggest that the bezels surrounding the iPhone 8 display will only be about 4mm all around, a tidbit seemingly confirmed by our exclusive look at an iPhone 8 dummy model earlier this week. With June right around the corner and the finalized iPhone 8 design likely locked down at this point, there’s a good chance that the number of leaked iPhone 8 moldings and schematics will rise significantly in the weeks and months ahead of the iPhone 8 release. To this point, Slashleaks today points us to a new series of photos — originally sourced via Weibo — which show us three different iPhone molds corresponding to the three new iPhone models Apple will release later this year. While the photo above doesn’t shed a whole lot of new light on Apple’s 2017 iPhone lineup, it does suggest that the iPhone 8 may be slightly taller than the iPhone 7s. While previous reports claimed that the iPhone 8 will pack a display the size of an iPhone 7 Plus into the form factor of an iPhone 7, the iPhone 8 may actually be slightly larger if we assume that the molds above were all aligned uniformly. Another point worth noting is that the camera module on the iPhone 8 is oriented vertically, a design which echoes a number of leaked schematics and designs we’ve seen over the past few months. It’s widely believed that the vertical orientation of the iPhone 8’s camera module has to do with the rumored augmented reality features Apple is planning to show off later this year. With the iPhone 8 design said to feature one giant piece of glass, it’s widely believed that Apple will incorporate the Touch ID sensor into the display itself. Though some previous leaks have featured a cut-out for a Touch ID sensor on the back, it’s believed that the final iPhone 8 design will be far more elegant and user-friendly. Now as for when we can expect to see the iPhone 8 finally hit store shelves, the good news is that we won’t have to wait longer than usual. Despite an onslaught of rumors claiming that the iPhone 8 release date might be pushed back by 4-8 weeks, more recent reports from credible sources indicate that the iPhone 8 release, like most other iPhone releases, will go down in September. Price wise, it’s no surprise that Apple plans to charge a premium for the iPhone 8, with the entry-level 128GB model said to retail for $1000 and the more storage-friendly 256GB model said to retail for $1,099.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) buying Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). The odds, according to InvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli, are less than 5%, perhaps non-existent. No, there’s another number that you might want to focus on when considering an investment in Tesla stock. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 153.06 +0.52 +0.34% Tesla Inc TSLA ▼ 310.83 -2.23 -0.71% Tim Cook recently announced that Apple was establishing a billion-dollar fund to create advanced manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Part goodwill gesture, part public relations effort, part good business, Cook recognizes that Apple’s success is intertwined with a healthy American economy. On May 12, Apple made its first investment from the fund, awarding Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) $200 million to put toward research and development and capital equipment needs for its glass business. Apple, not coincidentally, uses Corning as a supplier of glass screens for its iPhones. “Corning is a great example of a supplier that has continued to innovate and they are one of Apple’s long-standing suppliers,” Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams said in a statement. “This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone, and today every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America.” While this move might seem self-serving to some, it shows just how important technology and innovation is to economic development in this country or any other … and that leads to an important factor when it comes to Tesla stock. Leveraging Innovation Apple claims that it’s indirectly responsible for creating 2 million jobs in the U.S., including 80,000 Apple employees in all 50 states. Since 2008, U.S. app developers have made $16 billion from the App Store. Over the past 19 years, Apple has directly created 75,000 jobs in the U.S. — a compound annual growth rate of 15.7%. 7 Cash-Rich, Debt-Free Stocks to Buy to Clobber the Market It’s impossible to overstate the importance of Apple to the U.S. economy; the same applies to TSLA. More than four years ago, I wrote an article entitled Why America Needs More Teslas, in which I laid out why the risks associated with owning Tesla stock were worth it. It’s up 1,000% since then. Why such dramatic gains? Innovation, of course. The kind that Apple’s investing $1 billion to help nurture. Tesla’s Value to the Economy Well, first consider the direct contribution Tesla’s made regarding job creation. In the past four years, Tesla and SolarCity created 24,551 jobs, perhaps as many as 90% of those in the U.S. — a compound annual growth rate of 53%. So, if Apple created jobs in the U.S. at a rate of 16% per year, and Tesla/SolarCity did so at 53% annually, one might argue that Tesla’s contribution to American job creation is almost four times as great on an, ahem, apples-to-apples basis. I get that Tesla didn’t spend anywhere near the $50 billion that Apple spent in fiscal 2016 with its 9,000 U.S. suppliers and manufacturers, but again, it’s all relative. In fiscal 2016, Apple had $215.6 billion in revenue. That means it spent 23.2% of its revenue with U.S. suppliers. At the same rate, Tesla would have spent $1.6 billion on U.S. suppliers. According to an annual study by the Kogod School of Business at American University, the Tesla Model S is 75% American made. The rate’s not higher because the battery is made in Japan. However, it’s estimated that the new Model 3 will be 95% American made because the battery will be made in Nevada. Tesla had $7 billion in revenue in fiscal 2016; it spent $7.7 billion producing that revenue for an operating loss of $667.3 billion. If you use the 75% number from above, it’s conceivable that Tesla spent as much as $5.8 billion, or 82.9% of its 2016 revenue on U.S. suppliers. Thank Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock for All Your 2017 Gains Bottom Line on Tesla Stock I’m not saying you should buy TSLA because of the company’s contribution to the job market or the U.S. economy — significant given its size — but if you already own it, you ought to be proud of the work it’s doing to push the innovation envelope. Ultimately, it might go bust, but what it’s doing in the automotive and energy industries will pay dividends for the country for years to come. That’s something tangible a lot of stocks can’t claim. As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

She suffered burns to her face, neck, and hands, and after throwing the headphones to the floor, they were reportedly partially melted before water was poured on them by flight attendants. Now Apple, the owner of Beats, has concluded its investigation into the incident and says the headphones’ batteries were to blame. Apparently the woman’s headphones were purchased back in 2014, meaning they were an older model that ran on AAA batteries, and are no longer produced. Despite her injuries, the anonymous woman was only requesting that Apple reimburse her for the cost of the headphones and some of the clothing she was wearing at the time of the incident. Battery explosion mid-flight prompts passenger warning. Read more: https://t.co/ggCwATEiDI pic.twitter.com/YTTP9rEzFf — ATSB (@atsbinfo) March 14, 2017 Apparently representatives for Apple told the woman’s lawyer that their “investigation indicated the issue was caused by a third-party battery.” Following the incident, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau also stated that it believed the batteries were to blame, however the woman notes that neither the headphones nor their packaging stated what brand of batteries should be used. The brand of battery used when the headphones caught fire was never made clear, and Apple has yet to make a direct comment on the incident. Since then Australian regulators have recommended that passengers leave battery-powered devices stowed away when not in use, but that doesn’t do much to help the woman involved, and it may not have prevented the explosion in the first place.

He suggested doing something that had never been done before and could potentially upend the $350 billion telecom market. "It can't be so difficult to build our own system," the engineer said, referring to the telecom equipment that sends data across cables and wireless networks, and which the engineer suspected could be made to operate faster and cheaper than the pricey equipment sold by big vendors like Nortel, Huawei, Ericsson, Cisco or Juniper Networks. The engineer was suggesting building the telecom industry's first "white box" transponder, made with off-the-shelf parts such as chips from Broadcom and Acacia Communications, optical equipment from Lumentum, and software from one of the many new networking startups cropping up these days. Facebook's director of engineering Hans-Juergen Schmidtke, who was among those on the couch that day, was at first a naysayer. "I was a little bit skeptical about it at the time," he recounted to Business Insider. As a former engineer at Juniper Networks, Schmidtke knew from experience that building telecom equipment systems was an expensive undertaking that involved hiring teams of specially trained engineers and sizeable R&D budgets.  "Building a system ten years ago was like building a new company," Schmidtke said.  Still, Schmidtke agreed to help this tiny group hack together a white box system at one of Facebook's famous hackathons. Three months later they had a working prototype. Six months later, on November 1, they announced it to the world as a real product called Voyager.  The product’s unveiling sent shockwaves through the telecom industry, putting gear makers on notice that the lucrative market they controlled for decades was about to get turned upside down — and not necessarily to their advantage. While the effort is essentially a side-project for Facebook, a social networking company whose bread-and-butter business is online advertising, the stakes could not be higher for the telecom equipment companies which risk seeing their specialized products reduced to interchangeable commodities and their influence diminished.  For the industry’s established companies, there’s unease about Facebook’s growing clout and its ultimate intentions. But in a sign of how serious Facebook’s foray is being taken, there’s already a recognition by some that the repercussions could be even more painful it they don’t adapt. Voyager has already been tested by Facebook and European telecom company Telia over Telia’s thousand-kilometer-telecom network. Plus, German telecom equipment maker ADVA Optical Networking is manufacturing the device and, as of a few weeks ago had nine customers trying it out for their telecom needs, a mix of big telecom companies and enterprises, it said. And Paris based telecom provider, Orange is also testing the device, working with Equinix and African telecom company MTN. "We pulled it off essentially showing that when a few engineers can build a system within six months, the world has changed," Schmidtke said. One person told us that Schmidtke, who is insanely proud of Voyager, has become a star in his own corner of the tech world. When he and his team "go to conferences, they treat him like a tech celebrity, like a rock band," that person said. From one cult to another Voyager was the first product, and a major proving point, for Facebook's young Telecom Infrastructure Project (TIP), a consortium led by Facebook and launched at the industry's worldwide gathering, Mobile World Congress, on February 21, 2016. FacebookTIP is a spin-off from a similar organization Facebook launched a few years ago called the Open Compute Project (OCP). Facebook launched OCP and TIP because it had to take control over the technology it uses to support over 1.8 billion people uploading billions of photos, videos and updates every day. It has been designing its own IT equipment for years, things like computer servers, hard drives/storage systems and data center networks. Its versions were cheaper to build and easier to maintain than standard gear made by companies like Dell, HP, EMC and Cisco, it says.  Lots of big internet companies build their own tech, including Amazon and Google. But Facebook is unusual in that it openly shares all the designs, literally gives them all away for free, inviting anyone at any other company to come work on them, with contract manufacturers standing by to sell it all. It's a concept called open source hardware. In this way, Facebook gets lots of help in maintaining and advancing its infrastructure. And the rest of the world gets access to tech designed to work in the most demanding circumstances, like at a huge internet company. OCP has radically changed the data center tech industry and those involved say it has created a cult-like following. For instance, when secretive Apple refused to join OCP to let its IT engineers collaborate with others, it's crew of network engineers quit their jobs. They turned around and launched a startup called SnapRoute and built network software for the OCP community, the story goes. Apple later joined OCP. SnapRoute wound up being the software chosen for Voyager. OCP created so much competetion for hardware vendors like Hewlett Packard and Dell that they opted to join the organization and embrace the white box concept. The alternative was to be squeezed out of selling their products to companies with the biggest and fastest-growing data centers in the world, not just Facebook, but Microsoft, Goldman Sachs and dozens of others. There was just one major area that had been somewhat left out of OCP's free and open source hardware revolution, the telecommunications part. That's the equipment that connects homes, businesses and data centers together across long distances, via undersea cables, wireless networks, and so on. FacebookAnd the big telecom companies, those that spend millions of dollars a year on this gear, wanted in. They needed an OCP of their own, Facebook discovered when it launched its Internet.org, CEO Mark Zuckerberg's project to bring internet to underdeveloped countries. "As we were thinking about Internet.org and helping get more people connected, the idea was, we're doing this thing called OCP to help the data center community to build infrastructure that's more efficient, more cost effective, that's greener and more sustainable, more flexible. And we said, can we do that for the telco industry?" said Facebook's VP of engineering Jay Parikh. "Facebook, having learned from OCP, comes in and says, we can play maybe a catalyzing function," Parikh said, describing early meetings he and his crew had at Mobile World Congress. "We're investing our people and our dollars into technology that is going to solve these problems and we're going to contribute that technology, that IP [intellectual property] into the ecosystem so that you all can benefit from this." Voyager is one big example. "That's something we developed and it's like, wow, we actually solved a problem that a bunch of operators seem to be struggling with," he said. Signing on huge partners South Korea Telecom's CTO Alex Choi agrees that telecom operators like SKT want faster, cheaper and more open equipment and were inspired by Facebook to take it into their own hands. Mobile World Live"The idea all started from Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg was always addressing the importance of connecting the unconnected," Choi said.  In 2015 and 2016, Zuckerberg came to the MWC conference, gave keynote speeches and hung out with top telecom executives. He wanted to know what was keeping those people off the internet. He discovered that bringing telecom services to far-out parts of the world "was too expensive," for telecom operators, Choi recalls. Facebook wanted to help bring the costs down. But developed nations in Europe, Asia and the Americas had the same problem. People are buying more devices, using more video. And with the Internet of Things, millions more objects are joining the internet daily, communicating over telecom networks. "There's a huge growing traffic demand. That means we have to install more base stations, find more sites, invest more in the fiber and the backbone and supporting IT infrastructure," Choi said. But telcos can't charge more to cover the costs. People are are pushing them to charge less, for unlimited data plans. David Ramos/Getty ImagesWhile Zuck didn't do the actual recruiting to get TIP off the ground, he "inspired people" Choi said. When Facebook executives approached him about forming the new organization, (including Aaron Bernstein, responsible for partnerships with mobile providers, and Jason Taylor, Facebook's vice resident of infrastructure who leads OCP), Choi liked the idea so much, he became the chairman of the TIP organization. It felt revolutionary. OCP has invented lots of cool new hardware for the data center and telecom operators had never banded together to build their own gear, he said. "Operators rely too much on the big telco incumbent vendors. We kept pushing the vendors to do more innovations, to do something to bring down their premium price tag. They are making efforts and making progress but not as fast as we want them to be. So what can you do? You explore other opportunities," he said. Deutsche Telekom's Axel Clauberg was in a similar boat. He first got in touch with Facebook in 2015 about participating with OCP's networking efforts. There had been a push for more telcos to join OCP at that time because Facebook has been helping usher in a new way to build computer networks. It takes all the fancy, complex features out of the hardware and put them into software. In the corporate network world this push is called software-defined networking (SDN). But it's happening in the telecom service provider world, too, where its called Network Function Virtualization or NFV. Facebook didn't invent SDN or NFV, but in the slow and conservative world of network engineering, OCP and TIP are radically pushing these concepts forward. OCP is proving the technology works even for a huge demanding internet site like Facebook or for a giant telecom network like AT&T. "We are facing exponential traffic growth," explains DT's Clauberg. "We needed to do something." And there's one more issue going on besides tight budgets and huge growth, he said: the war for talent. Decades ago, hardware and communications engineers went to the telcos to build amazing new things, like mobile networks. Then they went to the tech companies like Cisco to build the tech that created the internet. Today, they are going directly to the internet companies like Google and Facebook and creating new hardware so they don't have to rely on the vendors, he said. TIP gives them a way to access the smartest minds, without having to poach them. "When [engineers] come out of the universities, which companies are they looking at? In old days, it was the telcos, then it was the suppliers, now it's the internet companies. The funny thing is with OCP, you have all these parties working together. I envision achieving the same [with TIP]. So having players from internet companies, from startups and established vendors, and the telcos, working together on what the infrastructure of the future should look like." DT's Clauberg joined TIP as a founding board member, alongside SKT's Choi. This was a powerful first step. SDK and DT are two of the most advanced telcos in the world, role models for many others. Facebook also convinced Intel's Caroline Chan to join TIP, which was an easy sell. Intel is also a founding member of OCP. And TIP was off and running. But there was one surprise founding member of TIP: Nokia's Laurent Le Gourrierec. The brave choice of Nokia Telecom devices that can be put together with standard parts and software are deeply threatening to the multibillion telecom equipment market dominated by companies like Huawei Technologies, Ericsson, Cisco, ZTE, and Nokia. YouTube/GEN15And Voyager isn't the only product. TIP's OpenCellular project is working on an open source 4G LTE/LTE base station, the hardware and the software.    As SKT's Choi describes it, TIP wants to "democratize" the technology, making it easier for anyone to build, use, or modify. That means taking it out of the hands of the equipment providers who create proprietary radios and base stations today. TIP's impact won't happen overnight, explains analyst Rohit Mehra, vice president of IDC's Network Infrastructure practice. But the goal is clear: to overhaul the telecom equipment industry which he says is about a $350 billion market today, when factoring in software, hardware and services. "This is not the first time Facebook has done this. They've been somewhat successful with what they call OCP," Mehra says. "The Telecom Infrastructure Project is disruptive not just to telecom equipment makers but in some cases the telecom service providers. Though in some cases it helps the service providers because it intends to give them more cost-effective infrastructure." So TIP is, in some ways, threatening Nokia's main telecom business. But Nokia is a close partner of Facebook and the one telecom equipment vendor embracing TIP as a founding member and board member. Nokia's Laurent Le Gourrierec explains why, via an adaptation of Abraham Lincoln's famous quote. "The best way to predict the future is to invent it," he tells Business Insider. "You have all these equipment makers saying, 'The world is changing so let's try to hold on to what we know.' But the thing is that the world is changing anyway, so it's much better to take an active role in shaping the future." If all goes well, TIP and Facebook will actually help create new customers using new telecom services, those people in undeveloped nations that never had telecom or internet, Le Gourrierec believes. "So it's best to participate in the definition of new partnerships, new services in partnership with the existing actors in addition to the new ones," Le Gourrierec said. From spies to community members When Facebook created Voyager, Nokia didn't shake in fear. Engineers there thought, "Maybe we can learn something for this," Le Gourrierec said. But there are other equipment makers who are, technically, part of TIP too. Currently the organization boasts over 100 members from all facets of the industry.  But Choi, Clauberg and Le Gourrierec said that many of them have only been nervously watching the group so far. Nokia"They are not actively contributing," Le Gourrierec said. Obviously, the kumbaya concept of open source doesn't work well like that. Everyone has to contribute their ideas for a community to blossom. One way that TIP is encouraging them to jump in is a different approach to sharing intellectual property. Participants don't have to share all their closely held, lucrative ideas and secrets for free like they do with OCP, or with other open source organizations, like Linux. Each working group in TIP can instead decide to use an older, more established method for sharing, known as Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory Terms (RAND). RAND allows vendors to be paid tiny fees by everyone who uses their intellectual property as long as those fees are reasonable and the tech is made available to everyone without bias. The company can't, for instance, jack up the price to its competitors.  The TIP board members are also encouraging participation by telling members that TIP will lead to plenty of other new commercial opportunities, too, even if TIP successfully turns the hardware into low-cost generic white boxes. Teleco providers can instead develop new software that can be bought via lucrative subscriptions, similar to the software startups that have sprouted up around OCP. In fact, Nokia is already experimenting with a high-performance software product able to run on low cost, ordinary computer network hardware. It's geared toward businesses, not service providers, but it's a start, Le Gourrierec tells us. TIP is also encouraging engineers and companies to join by creating a "culture" working group that helps teach telecom engineers how to "work fast and break things" as the internet world does.  "One of things we learned in the last 1.5 years in working on TIP is people saying, 'How do you help me transform my culture and my team so that we can move faster?'" Facebook's Parikh said.  Telecom is a world that traditionally frowned on that. Working fast and breaking things could take down the network and get you fired.  The culture group has become a popular entry point for engineers wanting to check out TIP. They then bring these ideas back to their jobs. It helps some engineers become more open minded about sharing. For others, like Le Gourrierec, it inspires "a new sense of urgency," in his work at Nokia, he describes. Afraid of Facebook  We only heard one major criticism regularly lobbed at TIP: that Facebook is becoming extremely powerful. Maybe too powerful. After Facebook launched Voyager, Facebook dominated the gossip at the last Mobile World Congress, sources told us. FacebookThere's good reason to worry. Facebook is making equipment with TIP and OCP, it's got state-of-the-art data centers, it has a roster of talented engineers and it's also laying its own telecom cable, including a new record-breaking fast subsea cable installed with Nokia between New York and Ireland. It could snap its fingers and become a powerful telecom and cloud operator tomorrow, some people fear (and others predict) like Amazon did with Amazon Web Services or Google did with Google Cloud and Google Fiber. But Parikh said that Facebook has zero interest in doing that. "We aren’t operating any networks ourselves. We are trying to help the telcos solve this," he said. The idea is to "share" lessons and technology to "always benefits" the whole community. SKT's Choi just shrugs off the idea that Facebook is a threat, saying telecom operators have more to gain than to lose. "I can understand the concern. It's very much natural, because operators are always being disrupted," he said, especially by large American internet companies "like Amazon, Google, and Facebook." Facebook TIP"But in the long run, I strongly believe in mutual benefits," he said. He notes that because Amazon helped create cloud computing, there are brand new billion-dollar markets and "everyone benefits. I think the same thing will happen in the teleco sectors." Not everyone is convinced that TIP will succeed. IDC's Mehra cautions that it's a huge undertaking and the two biggest telecom equipment vendors, Ericsson and Huawei, have remained cool toward the project, for obvious reasons, he says. "TIP may see progress over the years. But the challenges are higher. They are working on four to five different domains of telecom infrastructure, each with its own set of technologies and own set of tech providers," Mehra says. All the board members of TIP admit the project is in its early days and could fail. It could fail to attract a community. It could fail to produce products the world wants to use.  But they believe it will succeed. "Today most telecos remain as the status quo but all the telcos leadership, if you ask them, they want transformation. They want changes. They want innovation. They have to overcome it by collaborating with Facebook and others," he said. "Again, witness all the innovations that have already happened in the cloud industry. We want to apply all those innovations to the telco industry, which will make operators happier and customer happier and for everyone, a win/win."  Join the conversation about this story » NOW WATCH: Here's what popular dog breeds looked like before and after 100 years of breeding See Also: White House officials say Trump is 'undisciplined' and 'self-destructive' US Air Force fighter jets escorted an American Airlines plane into Hawaii after a passenger disturbance Google will let you search LinkedIn, Monster, Facebook, and more job sites all at once SEE ALSO: AT&T just completed a first-of-its-kind test — and Cisco should be terrified SEE ALSO: This guy took a Facebook project people hated, made them love it ... and catapulted into an incredible career Top Stories Mugshots: Guns, drugs seized in Port Neches Hearse stolen from McDonald's, body dumped in ditch Clock Boy's case implodes in court Ex-West Orange-Stark coach will now serve time Feds search Harbor Health, agents confiscate boxes Sour Lake driver indicted on intoxication manslaughter 14-year-old could face life as sex offender for sex with...

The jury is still out on whether it was alternative medicine that killed him. Green tea extracts, herb teas and garcinia cambogia for weight loss, bilimbi juice for reducing high cholesterol levels, soy foods for relieving menopausal symptoms. People are generally happy and feel safe taking these herbal supplements rather than modern medicine pills for various health issues However, the increasing use of dietary supplements, body-building and weight loss supplements and self-administered herbal remedies among people have led clinicians to sound the warning that many of these substances can cause significant harm to the liver and kidneys Natural as safe ? “The claim that anything natural is safe is questionable. There are plant compounds like Pyrrolizidine alkaloids which have been proven to be harmful to health. Drug-induced liver toxicity and renal failure due to the indiscriminate use of herbal medications is a growing problem but in many cases, we are unable to pinpoint one herb or ingredient as a causative factor,” says K. Vinayakumar, former Head of Gastroenterology, Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram (GMCT). Researchers in the U.S who looked at cases of liver damage reported to the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network, a program funded by the National Institutes of Health, has reported that in 2014, 20% of the liver injuries were linked to herbal remedies and dietary supplements. “Last year, we had 21 inpatients with serious drug-induced liver injuries and in four cases, we could find a clear link to herbal or so-called Ayurvedic preparations. Some of the herbal drugs for joint pains and body-building supplements have also been associated with liver toxicity. We do not know the full ingredients in these supplements. And worse, the patient fails to tell us if he is on some herbal medicine long-term because he might not link it to his condition,” says K. Krishnadas, Head of Medical Gastroenterology, GMCT. Ayurvedic medicines prepared in the traditional way, with years of standing, does have a margin of safety. But even the safety of traditional herbs may be compromised if it is prepared the non-traditional way. Herbal medicines do have adverse effects, which might be inconspicuous or which develops gradually. Sometimes, it might be some undisclosed ingredient which is used to ‘spike’ the herbal supplement that results in hepato or nephro toxicity. Green tea extract Even too much of green tea can interfere with conventional drugs like statins and warfarin. Green tea extract, a main ingredient in the so-called weight loss supplements, has produced symptoms ranging from mild increase of serum aminotransferase levels to fulminant hepatitis requiring liver transplant, according to British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology (2015 March).I n fact, about 60-70 per cent of dietary supplements being sold across India are fake, unregistered and unapproved, besides being extremely difficult to identify, the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) reported in December 2015 Patients with chronic illnesses like diabetes and dyslipidemia (high cholesterol) are the ones who usually opt for self treatment using known or unknown herbal remedies and supplements. Bakul et al has reported in the Indian Journal of Nephropathy in 2013 about a series of cases from Kerala hospitals wherein people were hospitalised for renal failure, requiring several dialysis sessions, after they treated themselves with the juice of Averrhoa bilimbi (‘irumban puli’), for high cholesterol. “Cases of unexplained kidney failure has been growing in number, often due to self medication or medicines prescribed by some indigenous practitioners. The main problem is that kidney damage comes to fore only when the injury is fairly well advanced. Patients may recover the renal function but the residual damage to the kidneys remain and puts them at increased risk of chronic kidney diseases later,” says Noble Gracious, Associate Prof. of Nephrology, GMCT The message to the public is that long-term and indiscriminate use of prescription medicines, over-the-counter drugs and the innumerable supplements available online, without regular follow-up with the doctor, can harm the kidneys and liver.

A new set of photos have surfaced on Weibo purporting to show molds for all three of the new phones. They don’t really reveal anything what we haven’t seen rumored before, but it’s interesting to see the new size in context. More photos after the jump … Try Amazon Prime 30-Day Free Trial Something to note about this particular leak is that molds are usually jumping through two layers of indirection. The molds are likely meant to create iPhone cases or dummy iPhone units, not the actual iPhones themselves. Of course, case leaks have been a reasonably accurate predictor of next-gen iPhone hardware in previous years, so it would be silly to discount it outright. As reported before, the iPhone 8 — pictured middle — is much closer to the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 chassis size than the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. Despite the similar physical dimensions, the iPhone 8 is expected to feature a 5.8-inch display thanks to dramatically smaller bezels horizontally and vertically. From the new photos, it seems the iPhone 8 is marginally taller and a fraction wider than the iPhone 7. The molds include cutouts for the rear camera. Again matching previous leaks, the iPhone 8 mold shows a vertical camera module. Other schematics indicate that this single bulge will contain two camera sensors and the flash. Apple likely had to reorient the dual-camera system from horizontal to vertical due to the drastic reduction in chassis width. All three molds include two holes near the middle of the extrusions. This is unlikely to relate to any specific iPhone hardware change and is simply a manufacturing artefact of how these molds are made. You can see a more complete iPhone 8 dummy from April to get a better idea about how the final phone would look. In terms of features, the iPhone Pro/iPhone 8 has been reported to tout new 3D-sensing front cameras, upgraded waterproofing, an Apple A11 chip, a bigger battery and more inside the redesigned stainless steel and glass chassis. The 7s phones may swap out aluminium for glass as the back material but in generally will look similar to the current generation iPhones. Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 7s, 7s Plus and iPhone 8 in the fall at a media event in September. All three phones should feature wireless inductive charging capabilities. The iPhone 8 may go on sale later (October) than the modest iterative devices and is expected to carry a significantly-higher premium price tag. iOS 11 may give some more clues about what to expect from the next-gen iPhones; many are expecting the announcement of a Dark Mode to take advantage of the rumored OLED display, for example. Apple will announce iOS 11 at its WWDC keynote on June 5, as well as new versions of macOS, tvOS and watchOS. The debut of the 10.5-inch iPad Pro (also reported to be bezel-less) and a new Siri Speaker product have also been rumored to be unveiled at WWDC.

Another piece of the 2017 iPhone puzzle just showed up online, in the form of an image showing molds for three iPhone models. Published on Weibo and reported by 9to5Mac, the picture shows chassis molds for the iPhone 8, the iPhone 7S, and the iPhone 7S Plus, the three handsets that had been widely expected to appear later this year. As previously predicted, the iPhone 8 is closer in size to the iPhone 7S than its bigger brother. We also get a look at the camera position and sizes, and again what we see here fits in with what we've already heard: dual-lens cameras for the two larger iPhones, and a vertical configuration for the iPhone 8, maybe to power some kind of augmented reality feature. Sizes do matter Based on everything that's been hinted at so far, it's gradually become clear that Apple is planning a minor upgrade for the standard iPhone models - the iPhone 7S and the iPhone 7S Plus - as well as a special one-off model to celebrate the tenth year of Apple's iconic handset in the shape of the iPhone 8. With a lot of premium materials and upgraded tech crammed into the iPhone 8, including a front-facing display that takes up almost the entire frame, it has been rumored that this model is going to go on sale later than usual. Meanwhile the usual camera and processor bumps are being rumored for all three handsets, as well as perhaps a long-overdue upgrade in display resolution. This new image doesn't come from a particularly well-known source, and it's worth bearing in mind that these molds are probably being used to make cases rather than actual iPhones; but the photo does back up other rumors that we've heard up to this point, as well as giving us an interesting look at the relative sizes of this year's iPhones.

He suggested doing something that had never been done before and could potentially upend the $350 billion telecom market. "It can't be so difficult to build our own system," the engineer said, referring to the telecom equipment that sends data across cables and wireless networks, and which the engineer suspected could be made to operate faster and cheaper than the pricey equipment sold by big vendors like Nortel, Huawei, Ericsson, Cisco or Juniper Networks. The engineer was suggesting building the telecom industry's first "white box" transponder, made with off-the-shelf parts such as chips from Broadcom and Acacia Communications, optical equipment from Lumentum, and software from one of the many new networking startups cropping up these days. Facebook's director of engineering Hans-Juergen Schmidtke, who was among those on the couch that day, was at first a naysayer. "I was a little bit skeptical about it at the time," he recounted to Business Insider. As a former engineer at Juniper Networks, Schmidtke knew from experience that building telecom equipment systems was an expensive undertaking that involved hiring teams of specially trained engineers and sizeable R&D budgets.  "Building a system ten years ago was like building a new company," Schmidtke said.  Still, Schmidtke agreed to help this tiny group hack together a white box system at one of Facebook's famous hackathons. Three months later they had a working prototype. Six months later, on November 1, they announced it to the world as a real product called Voyager.  The product’s unveiling sent shockwaves through the telecom industry, putting gear makers on notice that the lucrative market they controlled for decades was about to get turned upside down — and not necessarily to their advantage. While the effort is essentially a side-project for Facebook, a social networking company whose bread-and-butter business is online advertising, the stakes could not be higher for the telecom equipment companies which risk seeing their specialized products reduced to interchangeable commodities and their influence diminished.  For the industry’s established companies, there’s unease about Facebook’s growing clout and its ultimate intentions. But in a sign of how serious Facebook’s foray is being taken, there’s already a recognition by some that the repercussions could be even more painful it they don’t adapt. Voyager has already been tested by Facebook and European telecom company Telia over Telia’s thousand-kilometer-telecom network. Plus, German telecom equipment maker ADVA Optical Networking is manufacturing the device and, as of a few weeks ago had nine customers trying it out for their telecom needs, a mix of big telecom companies and enterprises, it said. And Paris based telecom provider, Orange is also testing the device, working with Equinix and African telecom company MTN. "We pulled it off essentially showing that when a few engineers can build a system within six months, the world has changed," Schmidtke said. One person told us that Schmidtke, who is insanely proud of Voyager, has become a star in his own corner of the tech world. When he and his team "go to conferences, they treat him like a tech celebrity, like a rock band," that person said. From one cult to another Voyager was the first product, and a major proving point, for Facebook's young Telecom Infrastructure Project (TIP), a consortium led by Facebook and launched at the industry's worldwide gathering, Mobile World Congress, on February 21, 2016. Read More View photos Facebook Hans Juergen SchmidtkeMore (Hans Juergen SchmidtkeFacebook) TIP is a spin-off from a similar organization Facebook launched a few years ago called the Open Compute Project (OCP). Facebook launched OCP and TIP because it had to take control over the technology it uses to support over 1.8 billion people uploading billions of photos, videos and updates every day. It has been designing its own IT equipment for years, things like computer servers, hard drives/storage systems and data center networks. Its versions were cheaper to build and easier to maintain than standard gear made by companies like Dell, HP, EMC and Cisco, it says.  Lots of big internet companies build their own tech, including Amazon and Google. But Facebook is unusual in that it openly shares all the designs, literally gives them all away for free, inviting anyone at any other company to come work on them, with contract manufacturers standing by to sell it all. It's a concept called open source hardware. In this way, Facebook gets lots of help in maintaining and advancing its infrastructure. And the rest of the world gets access to tech designed to work in the most demanding circumstances, like at a huge internet company. OCP has radically changed the data center tech industry and those involved say it has created a cult-like following. For instance, when secretive Apple refused to join OCP to let its IT engineers collaborate with others, it's crew of network engineers quit their jobs. They turned around and launched a startup called SnapRoute and built network software for the OCP community, the story goes. Apple later joined OCP. SnapRoute wound up being the software chosen for Voyager. OCP created so much competetion for hardware vendors like Hewlett Packard and Dell that they opted to join the organization and embrace the white box concept. The alternative was to be squeezed out of selling their products to companies with the biggest and fastest-growing data centers in the world, not just Facebook, but Microsoft, Goldman Sachs and dozens of others. There was just one major area that had been somewhat left out of OCP's free and open source hardware revolution, the telecommunications part. That's the equipment that connects homes, businesses and data centers together across long distances, via undersea cables, wireless networks, and so on. View photos Facebook Jay ParikhMore (Jay ParikhFacebook) And the big telecom companies, those that spend millions of dollars a year on this gear, wanted in. They needed an OCP of their own, Facebook discovered when it launched its Internet.org, CEO Mark Zuckerberg's project to bring internet to underdeveloped countries. "As we were thinking about Internet.org and helping get more people connected, the idea was, we're doing this thing called OCP to help the data center community to build infrastructure that's more efficient, more cost effective, that's greener and more sustainable, more flexible. And we said, can we do that for the telco industry?" said Facebook's VP of engineering Jay Parikh. "Facebook, having learned from OCP, comes in and says, we can play maybe a catalyzing function," Parikh said, describing early meetings he and his crew had at Mobile World Congress. "We're investing our people and our dollars into technology that is going to solve these problems and we're going to contribute that technology, that IP [intellectual property] into the ecosystem so that you all can benefit from this." Voyager is one big example. "That's something we developed and it's like, wow, we actually solved a problem that a bunch of operators seem to be struggling with," he said. Signing on huge partners South Korea Telecom's CTO Alex Choi agrees that telecom operators like SKT want faster, cheaper and more open equipment and were inspired by Facebook to take it into their own hands. View photos SKT Dr. Alex ChoiMore (Dr. Alex Choi, CTO, Executive Vice President and head of South Korea Telecom's corporate R"The idea all started from Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg was always addressing the importance of connecting the unconnected," Choi said.  In 2015 and 2016, Zuckerberg came to the MWC conference, gave keynote speeches and hung out with top telecom executives. He wanted to know what was keeping those people off the internet. He discovered that bringing telecom services to far-out parts of the world "was too expensive," for telecom operators, Choi recalls. Facebook wanted to help bring the costs down. But developed nations in Europe, Asia and the Americas had the same problem. People are buying more devices, using more video. And with the Internet of Things, millions more objects are joining the internet daily, communicating over telecom networks. "There's a huge growing traffic demand. That means we have to install more base stations, find more sites, invest more in the fiber and the backbone and supporting IT infrastructure," Choi said. But telcos can't charge more to cover the costs. People are are pushing them to charge less, for unlimited data plans. View photos mark zuckerberg mobile world congressMore (BARCELONA, SPAIN - MARCH 02: Founder and CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg walks onto the stage prior to his keynote conference during the first day of the Mobile World Congress 2015 at the Fira Gran Via complex on March 2, 2015 in Barcelona, Spain.David Ramos/Getty Images) While Zuck didn't do the actual recruiting to get TIP off the ground, he "inspired people" Choi said. When Facebook executives approached him about forming the new organization, (including Aaron Bernstein, responsible for partnerships with mobile providers, and Jason Taylor, Facebook's vice resident of infrastructure who leads OCP), Choi liked the idea so much, he became the chairman of the TIP organization. It felt revolutionary. OCP has invented lots of cool new hardware for the data center and telecom operators had never banded together to build their own gear, he said. "Operators rely too much on the big telco incumbent vendors. We kept pushing the vendors to do more innovations, to do something to bring down their premium price tag. They are making efforts and making progress but not as fast as we want them to be. So what can you do? You explore other opportunities," he said. Deutsche Telekom's Axel Clauberg was in a similar boat. He first got in touch with Facebook in 2015 about participating with OCP's networking efforts. There had been a push for more telcos to join OCP at that time because Facebook has been helping usher in a new way to build computer networks. It takes all the fancy, complex features out of the hardware and put them into software. In the corporate network world this push is called software-defined networking (SDN). But it's happening in the telecom service provider world, too, where its called Network Function Virtualization or NFV. Facebook didn't invent SDN or NFV, but in the slow and conservative world of network engineering, OCP and TIP are radically pushing these concepts forward. OCP is proving the technology works even for a huge demanding internet site like Facebook or for a giant telecom network like AT&T. "We are facing exponential traffic growth," explains DT's Clauberg. "We needed to do something." And there's one more issue going on besides tight budgets and huge growth, he said: the war for talent. Decades ago, hardware and communications engineers went to the telcos to build amazing new things, like mobile networks. Then they went to the tech companies like Cisco to build the tech that created the internet. Today, they are going directly to the internet companies like Google and Facebook and creating new hardware so they don't have to rely on the vendors, he said. TIP gives them a way to access the smartest minds, without having to poach them. "When [engineers] come out of the universities, which companies are they looking at? In old days, it was the telcos, then it was the suppliers, now it's the internet companies. The funny thing is with OCP, you have all these parties working together. I envision achieving the same [with TIP]. So having players from internet companies, from startups and established vendors, and the telcos, working together on what the infrastructure of the future should look like." DT's Clauberg joined TIP as a founding board member, alongside SKT's Choi. This was a powerful first step. SDK and DT are two of the most advanced telcos in the world, role models for many others. Facebook also convinced Intel's Caroline Chan to join TIP, which was an easy sell. Intel is also a founding member of OCP. And TIP was off and running. But there was one surprise founding member of TIP: Nokia's Laurent Le Gourrierec. The brave choice of Nokia Telecom devices that can be put together with standard parts and software are deeply threatening to the multibillion telecom equipment market dominated by companies like Huawei Technologies, Ericsson, Cisco, ZTE, and Nokia. View photos Deutsche Telekom Axel ClaubergMore (Vice President and CTO at Deutsche Telekom AG Axel ClaubergYouTube/GEN15) And Voyager isn't the only product. TIP's OpenCellular project is working on an open source 4G LTE/LTE base station, the hardware and the software.    As SKT's Choi describes it, TIP wants to "democratize" the technology, making it easier for anyone to build, use, or modify. That means taking it out of the hands of the equipment providers who create proprietary radios and base stations today. TIP's impact won't happen overnight, explains analyst Rohit Mehra, vice president of IDC's Network Infrastructure practice. But the goal is clear: to overhaul the telecom equipment industry which he says is about a $350 billion market today, when factoring in software, hardware and services. "This is not the first time Facebook has done this. They've been somewhat successful with what they call OCP," Mehra says. "The Telecom Infrastructure Project is disruptive not just to telecom equipment makers but in some cases the telecom service providers. Though in some cases it helps the service providers because it intends to give them more cost-effective infrastructure." So TIP is, in some ways, threatening Nokia's main telecom business. But Nokia is a close partner of Facebook and the one telecom equipment vendor embracing TIP as a founding member and board member. Nokia's Laurent Le Gourrierec explains why, via an adaptation of Abraham Lincoln's famous quote. "The best way to predict the future is to invent it," he tells Business Insider. "You have all these equipment makers saying, 'The world is changing so let's try to hold on to what we know.' But the thing is that the world is changing anyway, so it's much better to take an active role in shaping the future." If all goes well, TIP and Facebook will actually help create new customers using new telecom services, those people in undeveloped nations that never had telecom or internet, Le Gourrierec believes. "So it's best to participate in the definition of new partnerships, new services in partnership with the existing actors in addition to the new ones," Le Gourrierec said. From spies to community members When Facebook created Voyager, Nokia didn't shake in fear. Engineers there thought, "Maybe we can learn something for this," Le Gourrierec said. But there are other equipment makers who are, technically, part of TIP too. Currently the organization boasts over 100 members from all facets of the industry.  But Choi, Clauberg and Le Gourrierec said that many of them have only been nervously watching the group so far. View photos Laurent Le GourrierecMore (Laurent Le Gourrierec, VP Strategic Partnerships at NokiaNokia) "They are not actively contributing," Le Gourrierec said. Obviously, the kumbaya concept of open source doesn't work well like that. Everyone has to contribute their ideas for a community to blossom. One way that TIP is encouraging them to jump in is a different approach to sharing intellectual property. Participants don't have to share all their closely held, lucrative ideas and secrets for free like they do with OCP, or with other open source organizations, like Linux. Each working group in TIP can instead decide to use an older, more established method for sharing, known as Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory Terms (RAND). RAND allows vendors to be paid tiny fees by everyone who uses their intellectual property as long as those fees are reasonable and the tech is made available to everyone without bias. The company can't, for instance, jack up the price to its competitors.  The TIP board members are also encouraging participation by telling members that TIP will lead to plenty of other new commercial opportunities, too, even if TIP successfully turns the hardware into low-cost generic white boxes. Teleco providers can instead develop new software that can be bought via lucrative subscriptions, similar to the software startups that have sprouted up around OCP. In fact, Nokia is already experimenting with a high-performance software product able to run on low cost, ordinary computer network hardware. It's geared toward businesses, not service providers, but it's a start, Le Gourrierec tells us. TIP is also encouraging engineers and companies to join by creating a "culture" working group that helps teach telecom engineers how to "work fast and break things" as the internet world does.  "One of things we learned in the last 1.5 years in working on TIP is people saying, 'How do you help me transform my culture and my team so that we can move faster?'" Facebook's Parikh said.  Telecom is a world that traditionally frowned on that. Working fast and breaking things could take down the network and get you fired.  The culture group has become a popular entry point for engineers wanting to check out TIP. They then bring these ideas back to their jobs. It helps some engineers become more open minded about sharing. For others, like Le Gourrierec, it inspires "a new sense of urgency," in his work at Nokia, he describes. Afraid of Facebook  We only heard one major criticism regularly lobbed at TIP: that Facebook is becoming extremely powerful. Maybe too powerful. After Facebook launched Voyager, Facebook dominated the gossip at the last Mobile World Congress, sources told us. View photos Facebook Voyager optical network deviceMore (Facebook Voyager optical network deviceFacebook) There's good reason to worry. Facebook is making equipment with TIP and OCP, it's got state-of-the-art data centers, it has a roster of talented engineers and it's also laying its own telecom cable, including a new record-breaking fast subsea cable installed with Nokia between New York and Ireland. It could snap its fingers and become a powerful telecom and cloud operator tomorrow, some people fear (and others predict) like Amazon did with Amazon Web Services or Google did with Google Cloud and Google Fiber. But Parikh said that Facebook has zero interest in doing that. "We aren’t operating any networks ourselves. We are trying to help the telcos solve this," he said. The idea is to "share" lessons and technology to "always benefits" the whole community. SKT's Choi just shrugs off the idea that Facebook is a threat, saying telecom operators have more to gain than to lose. "I can understand the concern. It's very much natural, because operators are always being disrupted," he said, especially by large American internet companies "like Amazon, Google, and Facebook." View photos Facebook OpenCellular access pointMore (Facebook's OpenCellular access pointFacebook TIP) "But in the long run, I strongly believe in mutual benefits," he said. He notes that because Amazon helped create cloud computing, there are brand new billion-dollar markets and "everyone benefits. I think the same thing will happen in the teleco sectors." Not everyone is convinced that TIP will succeed. IDC's Mehra cautions that it's a huge undertaking and the two biggest telecom equipment vendors, Ericsson and Huawei, have remained cool toward the project, for obvious reasons, he says. "TIP may see progress over the years. But the challenges are higher. They are working on four to five different domains of telecom infrastructure, each with its own set of technologies and own set of tech providers," Mehra says. All the board members of TIP admit the project is in its early days and could fail. It could fail to attract a community. It could fail to produce products the world wants to use.  But they believe it will succeed. "Today most telecos remain as the status quo but all the telcos leadership, if you ask them, they want transformation. They want changes. They want innovation. They have to overcome it by collaborating with Facebook and others," he said. "Again, witness all the innovations that have already happened in the cloud industry. We want to apply all those innovations to the telco industry, which will make operators happier and customer happier and for everyone, a win/win."  Related: For more news videos visit Yahoo View, available on iOS and Android.

Andrew Cunningham - May 21, 2017 2:00 pm UTC reader comments 37 Share this story The 13.3-inch version of the LG Gram. Andrew Cunningham The webcam is mounted below the display. The keyboard is good, and the trackpad is OK, but it isn't a Microsoft Precision Touchpad. Andrew Cunningham The fingerprint reader is small and a bit fiddly. Andrew Cunningham The Gram’s design isn’t bad, but it’s generic to the point of blandness. Andrew Cunningham The LG logo is pretty much the only thing that breaks up a seat of matte grey. Andrew Cunningham Left side: Power, USB, HDMI, USB-C, indicator lights. Andrew Cunningham Right side: microSD, headphones, USB, lock slot. Andrew Cunningham The underside of the laptop looks just like the rest of it. Andrew Cunningham We live in uncertain times, but when it comes to laptops, we’re actually pretty spoiled these days. The low-end still has plenty of junky machines, but buying good, thoughtfully designed computers for $700 and up is also easier than ever. Further ReadingWhat we’ll be looking for in laptops for 2017 That means that sweating the details is more important than ever. A thin-and-light design, a nice IPS screen, a non-terrible keyboard and trackpad, and a good (and/or forward-looking) port selection can all be expected from a high-end laptop these days. So purchasing decisions and recommendations increasingly come down to the little things. Enter the LG Gram. We haven’t historically paid much attention to LG’s laptops, but the Gram caught my eye because of its decent starting price ($899 for a non-touchscreen model with a Core i5, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage) and its surprisingly light weight (2.07 pounds/0.94kg, particularly low for a 13-inch laptop). In practice, the Gram does many things well, but it falls short in just enough ways to keep it from being a universal recommendation. Look and feel: You take the good with the bad Specs at a glance: 13.3" LG Gram Screen 1920×1080 IPS touchscreen at 13.3" (166 PPI) OS Windows 10 x64 CPU 2.5GHz dual-core Intel Core i5-7200U (Turbo up to 3.1GHz) RAM 8GB 2133MHz DDR4 (single-channel) GPU Intel HD 620 (integrated) HDD 256GB SATA III solid-state drive Networking 867Mbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 2x USB 3.0, 1x 5Gbps USB-C, HDMI, microSD card reader, headphones Size 12.1" x 8.3" x 0.6" (307.3 x 210.8 x 15.2mm) Weight 2.07 lbs (0.94 kg) Battery 60Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $999.99 (same specs, no touchscreen) Price as reviewed $1,099.99 Other perks Webcam, lock slot, fingerprint reader I handle a lot of laptops, and I was still pleasantly surprised by just how light the Gram is. It weighs 2.07 pounds, just a tiny bit more than Apple’s 12-inch MacBook, but the Gram manages to fit in a larger 13.3-inch screen. If anything, it feels too light, a bit like it’s filled with more air than components—that’s the case with larger, cheaper, plastic laptops, and it lends the Gram a hint of a cheap feeling. That’s the only real downside; otherwise, having a slightly larger screen that doesn’t also add much extra weight is great. The Gram’s design is almost aggressively bland. It uses the same matte grey finish on the lid, palmrest, sides, and bottom, and the LG logos in the corner of the lid and in the bezel below the screen are its only identifying marks. I’m a fan of minimalist designs, but it’s possible to make a simple, unadorned computer that still retains a visual identity and a bit of personality (à la a ThinkPad or a MacBook). The Gram isn’t a bad-looking laptop; it just looks like the sort of PC you might see on a TV show or commercial where they’ve taped over all the logos to avoid product placement. All of that aside, the Gram is well-constructed. The lid has a bit of flex just because of how slim it is, but the base doesn’t creak or flex at all—LG’s “magnesium alloy” is sturdy. A super-slim reminiscent of the Dell XPS 13’s surrounds the top and sides of the screen, though the bezel underneath is much larger. As in the XPS 13, though, the webcam is mounted below the display (in the XPS 13, it’s in the bezel; in the Gram, it’s embedded in the hinge). This means that anyone you’re chatting with is going to be looking right up your nose, and you’re going to look like you’re looking over your head to see something the entire time you’re talking. It’s a compromise we don’t like in the XPS 13, and we still don’t like it here. One thing I can’t damn with faint praise is the screen itself. It’s a 1080p IPS panel with a nice, even backlight, and LG sells both touch and non-touch models ($100 separates the two, and not much else). Though higher-resolution screens are often options in high-end 13-inch laptops, 1080p is what I’d recommend for most people—sharp enough to give you some leeway with the scaling settings so you can balance readability with density, but not so sharp that it becomes a huge drain on the battery. The port selection is also solid, a decent mix of forward- and backward-looking. There are two regular USB 3.0 ports, one on each side, along with a proprietary power jack, a headphone jack, a microSD card slot, and a lock slot. In addition, the single USB-C port on the left side can be used for driving a display or for data, though, unfortunately, it doesn’t support Thunderbolt 3. It can also be used to charge the laptop, a feature I really like when I encounter it—a proprietary power jack is fine, but it lets you use a standard USB-C charger for everything if you’ve got one. We’re still early enough in the transition to USB-C that this strikes me as an acceptable compromise. The Gram’s keyboard, trackpad, and fingerprint reader, on the other hand, all bring us back to “mixed bag” territory. On the one hand, the keyboard has a good layout, key spacing, and enough travel (for a chiclet keyboard) that you’ll have no problem adjusting to it. The trackpad seems accurate and sufficiently clicky, and it supports Windows 10’s multitouch gestures without any major issues. And the trackpad-embedded, Windows Hello-enabled fingerprint sensor works. It senses fingerprints. But all three have minor annoyances that you don’t have to deal with many of the other laptops we like. The Gram’s keyboard has a backlight, but it must be manually enabled and disabled and turned up and down (most adjust themselves based on the ambient light in the room). The trackpad isn’t one of Microsoft’s Precision Touchpads, so as Windows 10 continues to evolve and Microsoft adds more trackpad gestures and trackpad-related features, it won’t automatically pick up support for them. And the fingerprint sensor is tiny—small enough that it rejected my fingerprints something like one-third-to-one-half of the time I used it. I’d rather have some biometric authentication than none, but the larger fingerprint sensors Dell and Apple use are much more reliable. Software LG ships a mostly clean version of Windows 10 on the Gram; our review unit arrived running the Anniversary Update, but I upgraded to the recent Creators Update with no issues. It includes a handful of preloaded LG support apps, an “On Screen Display” app that shows you messages as you toggle the keyboard light or the Caps and Scroll Lock keys, and a “reader mode” app that tints your screen orange à la iOS and macOS’ “Night Shift” or Windows 10’s own “Night Light.” Since Windows natively supports this feature as of the Creators Update (and because the app sends you a notification every time you turn the laptop on), it can be uninstalled without removing anything of value. This is also true of all the support apps. Additionally, at least LG doesn’t use any of your 256GB of storage for a redundant recovery partition. The laptop relies solely on Windows 10’s pretty-good built-in system restore capabilities, so there’s no need to give up space or recover it manually just so you can reset the laptop to its default state.

Even when I tell you about it, you could think it's not important. But it just might be. Tech Industry by Chris Matyszczyk May 20, 2017 2:46 PM PDT @ChrisMatyszczyk Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives. Enlarge Image You missed this Apple event? Apple/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET It's all about the iPhone 8, right? Oh, some new MacBooks would be nice, and a new iPad or two would lift the spirits. But when the new iPhone comes out, that's when you'll be clear about Apple's (latest) new direction. Or will you? Last week, Apple unveiled its Today at Apple concept. This involves concerts and free classes at Apple stores. Its spirit is to entice you in, not to buy products but to be part of the brand, and to allow the brand to be part of you. It's hard to overstate how important this actually may be, because it's an example of Apple anticipating the world as it's becoming, not as it is or was. Look at the Today at Apple ad launched last week and you won't see one instance of selling and buying. As online purchase becomes normal for just about every product on earth, the concept of a physical store ceases to revolve around basic transactions. When it comes to Apple products, they're written about so much that many people feel as if they know them long before they touch them. Many will touch them for the first time when the products arrive on their doorsteps. So what will the stores now be for? For everything that happens when you're not buying the product. They'll exist to bind you to the brand on a more consistent basis, not just when a new iPhone launches or your old iPhone needs fixing. They'll exist to make you believe Apple isn't a brand that sells products, but a club to which you've purchased membership. Forget the old concept of the Apple fanperson. This is something more sophisticated, longer-lasting and more regular. You won't be a fan. You'll be a member. Fans are excitable, fickle even. Members have a certain status and permanence. Apple said on its last earnings call that its services business enjoyed an 18 percent revenue rise. This includes such things as Apple Pay, iCloud and the App Store. These aren't cyclical business like iPhones and iPads, which are so heavily swayed by new launches. So now its stores will be an even greater part of Apple's overall service. That service doesn't just comprise buying things or even fixing them. It offers you inspiration, camaraderie and many other emotional benefits of membership. Soon, Apple will find ways to make you pay a little for it, of course. You'll hardly feel a thing. Americans increasingly want to spend money on experiences, not things. Apple understands that by offering more experiential brick and mortar outlets, it's anticipating a trend that's left many physical retail establishments, and shopping malls as a whole, far behind. Apple can have only so many product events every year. Its stores, however, can be a venue for events every month, every week, every day. Those happenings can involve and bind in a way that TV ads and other forms of hype just can't anymore. Look back in a few years' time and I fancy you'll find that this launch seems like the stamp of a new direction, one in which people's relationship with Apple materially changed, far more than it did with the launch of the iPhone 8.

Photo: Ste Smith/Cult of Mac Apple’s own battery case, cleverly titled the Smart Battery Case, has been on the market for over two years now. I had never really taken an interest in it;  it was just another battery case, only this one looked like it was pregnant with an iPod. That was until last week, when I was desperately in need of some form of charger for my iPhone and decided to pick one up. Since then, my thoughts on what was just an ugly, overpriced battery case have totally changed. Check out the video below to find out why it’s earned a place in my heart — and is now my favorite iPhone case. We all know that the Smart Battery Case is ugly. It’s the Quasimodo of iPhone cases. I’m not going to argue on that one. But if, like me, you’ve never actually tried one, you may be surprised to hear it’s actually really comfortable to hold. It adds much-needed extra grip to an otherwise slippery smartphone, and the rubberized texture feels great in the hand. That hump on the back not only makes it really easy to hold in one hand for long periods of time but also stops the case feeling bulky — unlike some other battery cases I’ve tried. In fact, it’s still easily slim enough to slide in and out of my jeans pockets. A lot of people may be bothered that there are no LED indicators around the phone to show how much juice the case has left. Thankfully, though, it’s super easy to check the exact percentage by swiping down into the Notification Center.  There is also an LED indicator on the inside of the case (for when my phone’s not in there) to indicate that the case is charging. In the bottom chin of the case, there are two speaker grills. These direct the sound towards you when you’re holding your iPhone, rather than down towards your feet. As a result, I can hear a significant difference in volume. Behind the speaker grills, there’s actually a pair of acoustical ports for the speaker and microphone channels making sure the sound doesn’t become muffled. Apple probably could have squeezed in a 3.5mm headphone jack adapter in the chin, but to be honest, it doesn’t bother me that it’s missing. I’m not in the army of headphone jack protesters as I either use Bluetooth headphones like my Beats X, or on rare occasions the Lightning EarPods that came with my iPhone. The meat and potatoes of the Smart Battery Case is a 2365 mAh battery, which claims to deliver 26 hours of talk time, 22 hours of LTE browsing, and 24 hours of video playback. That means it nearly doubles the battery life of your iPhone 7. How does that translate to real-world use? Well, my battery used to be at about 20 percent by around 3 p.m. every day after moderate use. Now, my phone will now still be 100 percent come 9 pm. It’s really rather strange to see my iPhone’s battery still completely full after using it for an entire day. Once the case has been drained I’ll then see my battery percentage begin to drop as usual. If you’re interested in buying one, be sure to check out Amazon, as I’ve since found the case to be cheaper there. In fact, at this moment in time, you can pick one up for just under $85 — and it’s well worth it. Subscribe to the Cult of Mac YouTube channel to stay up to date with the latest videos! Leave a comment Deals of the Day See all deals jbairdjr I would love to see this case made for the Iphone 7 Plus. I would buy one in a heartbeat Harald Striepe Totally agree. My wife has a 7 with the Smart Case and NEVER worries about her battery. daniele.mcgarry@mail.ru I’am freelancing using the web, finishing fundamental projects that only requires from you computer desktop or alternatively laptop computer and also internet service accessibility and I couldn’t be more satisfied… 6 months have passed on since i initiated this and also i obtained up to now overall 36,000 bucks… Basically i make profit about $80/hourly and work for 3 to four h on daily basis.And awesome point regarding this job is that you can actually decide when to do the job on your own and for how long and you are compensated by the end of each and every week.>>>> S.ID/2hh David Definitely agree! I recently bought Smart Battery Case for my iPhone 6 and I couldn’t be more satisfied. And I even like the design. klue211 i agree on one for the 7+ klue211 what is apple waiting on? Harald Striepe Form really does follow function in this “case.” Alan Goldberg Ugly to whom? I love the fact that when the phone is face up, it just looks like a regular case and the iPhone is floating above the table. I think this Quasimodo crap is just a bandwagon everyone has latched onto. And when you repeat something often enough, it appears to be true. I like the way it looks.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search iPhone 8 design molds leak, revealing similar size to iPhone 7 Adam Westlake - May 21, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit When it comes to the much-rumored “iPhone 8,” we’ve long been hearing that Apple will debut the premium, flagship smartphone alongside the slightly updated iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. The belief is that the iPhone 8 will feature newer advanced features over the 7s models, namely an edge-to-edge 5.8-inch OLED display. Previous leaks have indicated that despite having a larger screen, the device will be smaller than the current 7 Plus thanks to significantly reduced bezels. The latest evidence to back this up comes in the form of an image from China’s Weibo claiming to show a trio of molds of the three new iPhone models. The mold in the center is the one for the so-called iPhone 8, and it reveals a device size that’s much, much closer to the iPhone 7s on the right, with the left being the iPhone 7s Plus. The mold for the iPhone 8 features a cutout for the vertically aligned dual camera lenses, another feature we’ve been hearing a lot about lately. Since the other iPhone models coming this year are expected to follow the pattern of Apple’s typical “S”-updates, the 7s and 7s Plus should have the same physical dimensions as the existing 7 and 7 Plus, as well as their 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays, respectively. It’s important to note that molds like these aren’t used in manufacturing the phones themselves, rather they’re used for producing iPhone cases or other possible accessories. Keeping that in mind, the image shows that the iPhone 8 could very well be just a little taller than the standard iPhone 7 we already have, and only a tiny bit wider, all with a display that’s over an inch larger. That would make for an impressive change in the device-to-screen size ratio, all thanks to cutting down the bezels.

PHOTO: AFP Ford Motor Co said on Friday it would delve into the growing arena of “over-the-air” software updates, adding Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to its Sync 3-equipped 2016 vehicles for the first time via a wireless software update. The latest upgrade to Sync 3, Ford’s interactive touch-screen system, will be accomplished through an over-the-air (OTA) update using Wi-Fi, not unlike how new software gets uploaded to smartphones by manufacturers. Qualcomm shows off wireless charging for electric vehicles After Tesla Inc’s early lead in 2015 introducing OTAs, traditional automakers are slowly beginning to embrace the new technology, within limits. Concerns about security and resistance from dealers worried about losing service revenue have hampered its adoption. Thus far, established automakers have not used OTAs for safety systems, only for non-critical systems like infotainment. Customers can also get the update via the traditional means of visiting their dealer or using a USB drive, Ford said. Introducing electric cars Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are operating systems from Alphabet’s Google and Apple Inc that allow drivers to connect their smartphones to their vehicles’ dashboard. Ford’s first use of OTAs comes about two months after it said it would hire 400 engineers to work on connectivity, mostly from Blackberry Ltd’s shuttered phone handset business. Blackberry QNX powers Ford’s Sync 3 system. Besides being more convenient for customers, OTAs can bring automakers cost savings, as a substantial percentage of warranty repair issues and recalls can be corrected through OTAs.

Connacht Tribune News BREAKING NEWS CITY TRIBUNE Sport Life Entertainment Business Property Cars Farming Video Opinion Home Breaking News Apple Athenry data centre probed by EU competition watchdog Breaking News Apple Athenry data centre probed by EU competition watchdog By Our Reporter - May 21, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Galway Bay fm newsroom – It’s been revealed that the €850 million Apple data centre planned for Athenry was the subject of a probe by the EU’s competition watchdog. It followed a complaint that the deal reached over the purchase of the land from state body Coillte breached state aid rules. According to the Sunday Business Post, the 2015 deal involved a back-to-back transaction involving the IDA which was previously not disclosed by any side. It’s stated Apple identified the almost 200 acre site and was keen to keep its interest in the land owned by state agency Coillte under wraps. The IDA was subsequently brought into the transaction and a deal was agreed on the purchase of the site for an amount believed to be between 10 to 15 million euro. It’s understood a third party made a complaint to the European Competition Commission about the arrangement, believing it breached state aid rules. However, the EU body says after assessing the case, it finds no reason to pursue the matter under EU state aid rules. The proposed 850 million euro data centre received the green light last year, but is currently the subject of a High Court judicial review.

Close by Autocar 21 May 2017 Follow @@autocar Whether it's new powertrains, in-car technology or self-driving cars, automotive technology is advancing at an incredible rate. New technology and systems are reinventing many of the fundamentals of the car, and the motoring landscape is going to change forever as a result. But with so much change going on, and so much new terminology, it's easy to get confused. So we produced a special report to guide you through it. Read on to learn about the future of the car. 1: What makes a connected car? The term ‘connected’ is probably second only to ‘autonomous’ on the automotive industry’s list of future-car buzzwords. In its simplest form, a connected car is one with a built-in internet connection. Connected cars already exist thanks to the widespread use of LTE/4G cellular networks for infotainment, fleet management and safety functions (think Vauxhall OnStar). In the near future, the combination of the Dedicated ShortRange Communications (DSRC) wireless communications standard and faster cellular links will open the door to new safety and convenience features, but car makers, technology suppliers and road operators will need to collaborate so vehicles can talk to each other and the wider world. If all goes to plan, connected car technologies, such as real-time satnav mapping and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, will make highly automated driving, and even full autonomy, possible just a few years from now.  Here we take a look at some of the key issues and areas of development in the automotive technology industry. Connected cars: Mobile connectivity vs security Cars can already be operated via a mobile phone, or have their specifications changed through over-the-air (OTA) software upgrades. But increasing connectivity to other vehicles and infrastructure increases the risk of your family transport being hacked, so car makers are working with suppliers, such as Harman and Magna, to ensure that cyber security doesn’t become a problem for connected cars. New software will not only mitigate an attack but also log the details so manufacturers can spot patterns and fix any weak spots via OTA updates. Why communication is key for future cars Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication via DSRC roadside units will require cars to interact with infrastructure such as traffic lights and junctions. A combination of V2I and V2V (see below) could eliminate collisions at blind junctions, for example. By integrating this data with digital maps in the Cloud in real time, vehicle navigation systems will be updated every few seconds rather than every few minutes, by faster cellular connections. Trials of these technologies are already under way by suppliers such as Here, Panasonic, Orange and Ericsson, working in combination with road operators and car companies in Europe, the US and beyond. Mobile home, mobile office, mobile life: connected cars to the Internet of Things Mobile phones have become central to people’s lives and car makers have been quick to respond by improving car-to-phone connectivity and adding Apple CarPlay and Android Auto to the specification sheet. If recent concept cars and a gaggle of new partnerships between auto and tech companies are anything to go by, life inside and outside the car is set to become ever more closely integrated, with the car becoming a part of the same digital ‘ecosystem’ that contains everything from your appointments calendar to your Internet of Things-connected fridge. A digital assistant from the likes of Amazon, Microsoft, Apple or Google could run your life, whether you’re on the sofa at home, behind the wheel or in the office. How connected cars can boost vehicle safety Cars will communicate with other nearby vehicles and share information about the road conditions and hazards ahead. The DSRC already fitted to the Cadillac CTS, for example, can handle 1000 messages per second from vehicles up to 300 metres away. When a V2V-equipped car engages its stability control, brakes hard or switches on its hazard lights, drivers behind are alerted to give them more time to react, in turn smoothing the traffic flow. In Honda’s Safe Swarm vision, DSRC-connected cars will move seamlessly and safely together, like a shoal of fish.   2: The future of electric vehicles - can they crack the range barrier? Can the EV ever replace petrol and diesel cars, or will they only work for short journeys? Dave Greenwood, professor of advanced propulsion at the Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), also heads battery development at the Advanced Propulsion Centre. He thinks that expecting the EV to one day match the range of a petrol or diesel car may be unnecessary for most drivers. “Ninety eight percent of journeys are less than 50 miles,” he says. “If we continue the race for range with EVs then very few journeys would take advantage of that. The cost of increasing the range of an EV from 100 miles to 200 miles would double.” Based on today’s prices, that would mean a jump in battery price from £5000 to £10,000 for a car the size of a Nissan Leaf, just to allow for occasional long trips. “A more realistic scenario is that buyers would purchase a mobility package including an affordable EV to use daily for shorter journeys, then book a car from their dealer for longer trips,” Greenwood adds. Nevertheless, the energy density of lithium ion batteries is improving and it is this that EV range depends upon. The size and weight of today’s batteries has more to do with mechanical rather than chemical elements. “Only 35% of the battery’s mass is electrically active,” Greenwood says. The rest of the weight comes from the electrical equipment and the ‘Russian doll’ packaging of components within components. “Even if we did nothing to the chemistry we could reasonably double the energy density,” he adds. “WMG has demonstrated technology with 80% better energy density than current batteries.” Today only a tiny percentage of cars are EVs, but if the numbers rise, charging will present challenges. “Charging speed and infrastructure will matter more than range,” says Stephen Doyle, Ricardo’s head of hybrid and electrical products. Faster charging requires more powerful chargers and batteries capable of receiving that power. Tesla’s superchargers currently charge at a maximum rate of 120kW per car, but Doyle predicts an alternative to Tesla’s network “pushing that up to 150kW”. Beyond that, ultra-fast charging at 350kW is being researched in Europe and the US, and the Ultra E consortium, including Audi, BMW and utility companies, has said it will deliver 25 350kW stations by next year. One of the challenges is heat. “Charging at 120kW generates about 10kW of heat,” says Doyle, but 350kW generates more like 50kW, or the equivalent of 16 domestic room heaters. “Inductive ‘wireless’ charging by parking over a pad is limited to 22kW on passenger cars to meet electromagnetic compatibility standards and ensure there’s no impact on pacemakers or electrical devices like phones,” adds Doyle. Lithium ion chemistry is likely to dominate for at least a decade, but the use of different materials should increase range. Much later, other improvements may include a move to smaller, lighter batteries filled with solid rather than liquid electrolyte.   3: The future of self-driving cars - when a car becomes a mobility service The Sedric is the Volkswagen Group’s self-driving car of the future. The concept itself won’t make production but much of the technology will – in around 10 years’ time, says the firm. The technology could appear in all VW Group brands including Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Seat, Skoda and includes just three controls – Go, Stop and Call – as well as advanced voice control tech that will be able to run all but the crucial systems. Volkswagen says self-driving cars will first find favour in controlled environments such as factories and car parks, then for car sharing before finally reaching private ownership. Sedric pods could be private or public. Public pods could be identified when they arrive by colour and audio, so the visually impaired can use them.  An array of sensors includes a 360deg Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR), camera and radar sensors. The system gives ‘triple redundancy,’ each method covering the other in case of confusion or failure.   4: The future of hydrogen cars - why they're a matter of when, not if  Hydrogen fuel cells combine hydrogen and airborne oxygen to make electricity, with only water and heat as by-products. A fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) is simply an EV that uses a fuel cell as its source of electricity. The fuel cell’s hydrogen supply can be replenished at a pump in about the same time as it takes to refuel a conventional car, and fuel cells could take over as the favourite power source for EVs beyond 2025. Experts are split over the benefits, arguing that producing hydrogen, compressing or liquefying it, transporting it then filling a car with it all consumes too much energy to be efficient. There is a compelling argument for hydrogen, though. It is the most abundant element in the Universe, it can be made sustainably, it can be manufactured at the point of sale and it can be used for energy storage, by producing it using surplus off-peak electricity.Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes and Toyota have been serious about fuel cell vehicles since the late 1990s, with GM, Toyota, Hyundai and Honda still pursuing the technology. GM and Honda have extended a partnership formed in 2013 to collaborate on fuel cell technology. In January this year, the two companies opened a £68.5 million joint venture, called Fuel Cell System Manufacturing, to begin the mass production of fuel cells by 2020. GM made its first fuel cell vehicle in the 1960s and has since invested £2.4bn in fuel cell tech. FCEVs represent a re-invention of the wheel in a business sense, so there’s a compelling reason for car manufacturers to grab a piece of the action, while oil companies are looking for something to produce when the oil runs out.   5: Cars and technology - move over virtual reality, 'mixed reality' has arrived Advanced software originally developed for gaming is now being used to help designers and engineers use virtual reality to create the next generation of in-car displays. Behind every great video game, whether it be on an Xbox, Playstation or PC, lies a software ‘engine’ on which images are created in real time, 90 times a second, rather than decided upon in advance and then stored for later use. It’s this technology that makes today’s computer games so compelling and dynamic. Software company Unreal Engine Enterprises has made the jump from gaming to automotive. Using its technology, BMW has developed ‘mixed reality’ environments using virtual reality headsets to overlay images on basic 3D-printed models of car interiors. What users touch may be a simple and quickly produced rendition, but what they see is the finished thing. “This creates a relationship between virtual reality and the real world,” explains Unreal Engine Enterprise director Simon Jones. “When you open the door, you feel the weight of the door, when you sit in the car you smell the leather and feel it compress, and when you reach for the steering wheel you can feel it.” The same high-speed imaging technology is expected to revolutionise in-car displays. Jones is seeing a move towards displays that occupy entire dashboard areas, with context-sensitive information more closely related to what the driver is doing.    6: The future of electic cars - brace yourself for the 48V jolt In the next two to three years most premium cars going on sale will be 48V mild hybrids, and the lower echelons of the market are likely to follow suit. These 48V systems will also help to meet the increasing demand for connected car and infotainment features, more advanced driver assistance systems, electric superchargers and autonomous technology. The Audi SQ7 is the first production car with a 48V electrical system and electrically powered compressor (EPC). The 48V technology is relatively simple and cheap to add to existing vehicle architectures and integrate with 12V electrics. A belt-integrated starter-generator (BiSG) can be bolted to the engine in place of the existing 12V generator. The addition of a beefier drive belt means it can provide a smoother, faster-acting stop-start function and also feed torque to assist the engine. Blending the BiSG’s regenerative braking with the mechanical brakes using its Structure Engine Control architecture, automotive tech supplier Delphi says it can capture 85% of the braking energy available in the forthcoming Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) fuel test cycle. The 48V systems also fall below the 60V threshold for costly highvoltage classification. “A plug-in hybrid is 10 times the cost,” says Mary Gustanski, a senior vice president of engineering at Delphi. “That’s what makes the technology so attractive. When you step on the accelerator you have a flawless launch, and you cannot tell you’re using stop-start.”    7: Who's doing what with autonomous cars? Be in no doubt: fully autonomous cars are on the way and most manufacturers are working hard to develop them. Here’s what the major players are up to: BMW Group Showed-off its first serious autonomous technology, in collaboration with Bosch, back in 2013. BMW Group teamed up with Mobileye, a specialist in computer vision and machine learning, and Intel. Mobileye’s data software will be installed in 2018 BMWs to accelerate the creation of digital mapping. Ford Ford expects the autonomous car to have the same impact as the Model T: huge. It has pledged to make autonomous cars available to everyone, not just the wealthy. General Motors GM currently has a fleet of 40 vehicles on test in California. The US giant began testing on public roads in Michigan in 2016. Hyundai and Kia Both Korean brands have announced they will be selling partially autonomous cars by 2020, with the first fully autonomous cars following in 2030. Jaguar Land Rover JLR is creating a fleet of more than 100 vehicles to test and develop connected car and autonomous vehicle technologies over the next four years. It has also demonstrated vehicles capable of overtaking without driver intervention. Daimler Mercedes is chasing autonomous tech aggressively. Its S500 Intelligent Drive research car completed a 62-mile drive from Mannheim to Pforzheim back in 2013, and the company has recently announced a collaboration with Bosch. Nissan Has committed to delivering cars with a “significant” level of autonomy by 2020. The new Leaf and Qashqai will both be equipped with ProPILOT autonomous drive tech for single-lane autonomous driving on motorways. PSA Group Peugeot’s 300bhp Instinct PHEV concept can switch between Drive and Autonomous modes for do-it-yourself driving or fully autonomous operation. Four Citroën C4 Picassos have covered 37,000 miles in testing. Tesla Has a habit of taking huge leaps forward rather than adopting the cautious linear progression preferred by other manufacturers. In January it rolled out the second generation of Autopilot on its Hardware 2 platform. It has 360deg vision from eight cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors and forward-facing radar. Volkswagen Group The Self DRIving Car (Sedric) shown at the Geneva motor show in March illustrates the company’s plans to become a mobility provider. Ideas from its new Future Centres are made available to the individual brands within the group. Volvo The Chinese-owned Swedish car maker started the Drive Me project last year in Gothenburg with an autonomous XC90 SUV. It also joined forces with Uber in a £241 million project.  The six levels of autonomy explained 0 - No automation. Driver in full control, even when helped by warning or intervention systems. 1 - Level one is when an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) is in play. 2 - Partial automation takes place when more than one ADAS is functioning. 3 - Conditional automation denotes automated driving, with the driver responding to requests to intervene. 4 - High automation: the automated system can cope even if the driver doesn’t respond to a request to intervene. 5 - Full automation: the fully driverless car. It does what a human can do.   8: Batteries vs conventional fuel: how do they compare? Today one of the most powerful EV batteries ‘fuelling’ the £129,400 Tesla Model S P100D is the size of a queen-size mattress, weighs more than half a tonne and stores 100kWh of energy. The battery would be too big and too expensive for use in a small EV. The price of lithium ion batteries has fallen over the past five years but still stands at around £200 per kWh, so the approximate cost of a 100kWh battery is £20,000. Compared like for like, there’s still a yawning chasm between the weight, space and cost efficiency of battery energy storage compared to that petrol or diesel, especially when it comes to small, non-premium cars. Experts say this is improving, though. How about the cost of the energy? At the moment, electricity is about 12p/kWh. The 100kWh battery contains around £12 worth of electricity, although not all of that can be used. Two gallons of diesel also stores 100kWh worth of petrol or diesel and costs around £12. The range of a Tesla S P100D is a claimed 381 miles, but two gallons of diesel would take a Tesla S competitor only around 60 miles. The EV scores higher here because it’s electric powertrain is more efficient at converting stored energy to mechanical energy. Around 80% of the usable energy stored in an EV battery reaches the wheels, whereas only around 20% of the energy stored in petrol or diesel makes it to the road, mainly due to the inefficiency of combustion engines. If EVs one day take the place of petrol and diesel cars completely, expect heavier taxation, either on the energy used to charge them or on some other aspect of driving.  Jesse Crosse and Graham Heeps Tweet Widget Facebook Like Google Plus One Tweet Widget Facebook Like Google Plus One Our Verdict Tesla Model S In theory, this all-electric luxury car looks a hit.

I can't charge an ev at home, having one which would run all week would be great. no, before you ask, i don't pass any convenient charging stations. i have nothing against hybrids and evs, although i find a hybrid with more electrical capacity than it needs for regenerative braking to be simply carrying too much weight and therefore defeating it's own object somewhat. then, i look at all the other things and my first thought is "Colin Chapman must be spinning in his grave". meanwhile, has anyone found themselves wondering why phones are being so integrated into cars and yet we're also being told that phones are the coming of all evil and mean you're guaranteed to crash and kill everyone. the more things they jam in to cars the more i miss actually being able to see out of them properly, and it not feeling like a massive numb sponge. so, mazda have given up on the hydrogen rotary then? they had that running in the 90s.

Surely driving will he a luxury that only the wealthiest will be able to afford due to am increase in insurance premiums. AUTONOMY is a fast track to controlling us even further. Maybe the modern day driver requires this but those of us who enjoyed driving at their own free will may have a harder time accepting this ambiguous technological advancement. Darren malcolm Log in or register to post comments spqr Read the Telegraph this week instead 21 May 2017 As pointed out in an excellent article speed limit recognition systems (a vital part of autonomous cars) are so useless that a Peugeot 3008 on test thought the speed limit was 145mph for a large part of a journey. Other cars tested by the journalist thought that the speed limit on Mile End Road was 50mph and another on the same stretch of road determined it was 15mph. As the article states until cars can get the important detail of a speed limit right they cannot be allowed to make life and death decisions autonomously. When it will be safe to allow AI to make the "Speeding Cart" decision will be many decades away. Until the car can pass that test it cannot be allowed on the road without a human in control. Log in or register to post comments fadyady Many moons ago 21 May 2017 Many moons ago when magazines started talking autonomous driving, I asked the question whose fault is the crash in an autonomous vehicle? Is it the driver, the car maker, the software designer, the other party driver or their car maker or software or hardware designer, the computer glitch, the non-updated software, the tuner, or weak GPS signal? It's gonna be a nightmate and I don't look forward to it.

It can be installed using an USB stick if the user wants to do it without assistance, but a visit to the dealer can also be scheduled to achieve the same objective. For the first time, the Blue Oval offers an over-the-air update, which is possible if the car is connected to a Wi-Fi network. If you have a compatible vehicle and want to perform the update yourself, you should go to owner.ford.com and follow the steps presented on the page, along with downloading the update on a USB stick. We suggest using a new thumb drive to be able to format it without fear of losing data. The update version is 2.2, and Ford says that the platform has been designed to be easy to update. It is a big step for traditional automakers like the Blue Oval, while younger brands, like Tesla, have gone to further lengths to implement over-the-air updates in some of their products. The first update ever offered for SYNC came in 2009, but the third generation of the system comes with the possibility of automatic updates over Wi-Fi. Evidently, a designated network must also be in the range of the automobile's receiver. From there, a setting to allow the vehicle to update its multimedia unit without further assistance has to be turned on. The solution does not require the engine to be running for the update to take place. If you want to try updating SYNC 3 over a Wi-Fi network, avoid using a free or open channel that can be accessed by anyone. We suggest making a hotspot from your smartphone, if your data plan is generous enough, or use a friend’s Wi-Fi after asking their permission and password.

But as it turns out, touch-screens have far from ended killing them, but rekindled parents’ interest in them instead, according to the world’s largest toy retailer. “Categories like family board games, which we were told five years ago were going to die, are absolutely flourishing at the moment,” Andre Javes, president, Asia-Pacific with Toys“R”Us told the South China Morning Post. “This is a very interesting trend.” The toy industry giant was referring to the ubiquitous table-based games such as Monopoly, chess and checkers, that get the entire family together face-to-face, at a time when most people get increasingly engrossed in the likes of Facebook, Candy Crush or Pokemon Go, on their own. His remarks will come as great relief for Hong Kong manufacturers of the often gaudy, plasticky or cuddly “Made in China” toys that played a significant role in the city’s rise as the “global king of toys” and China’s transition to “the world’s factory” over the 1980s and 90s. They also bode well for Hasbro Inc, the New York toy titan celebrated for its huge variety of Monopoly board games, based on geographical location, as well as Lego, the Danish maker of interlocking plastic bricks – a company which has just reported record annual revenues for 2016, after 85 years in business. Made in Hong Kong: toys exhibition at history museum tells the lost tale of an industry In his Kowloon office, adorned with a rainbow of stuffed animals, Transformers, and Lego figures, Javes reckons the projection that the iPad would spell nothing but doom for toy chests “couldn’t be further from the truth.” “Some of the traditional, older toys are actually coming back strongly,”he said. And surprisingly, it’s arguably the most ambitious Chinese parents who are bringing them back into fashion, in order to make their children more “sociable”. “The trend is that mom is saying ‘you spend too much time on technology’,”Javes said. “When you play these more traditional toys you have to socialise with people, and people see huge value in that.” Many parents’ concerns are based on a growing body of research, including from Britain’s Michael Cohen Group, which indicates touch-screen devices are beating rubber clocks, wooden puzzles and other traditional toys in popularity among kids. In China, it has become common in urban homes, of course, to see young parents checking their smartphones – but their toddlers too are playing Angry Birds or Candy Crush on their own iPads. Many are now starting to claim that to get too hooked on tech devices hampers a child’s social skills, potentially distracting them from getting a head start on the career ladder. A recent study by JAMA Pediatrics found that whiz-bang playthings such as baby laptops and baby cellphones will make infants less likely to have real-life verbal exchanges with their parents. Geek heaven or smart business? Inside Hong Kong’s high-end toy industry “What has changed a lot in China is that toys have become less of a reward, and parents are concerned about the development of their kids, both socially and educationally,” Javes said, adding that even nostalgia nurturing dolls were “making a comeback in a big way”. Interlocking bricks, puzzles and construction sets designed to improve hand/eye coordination, patience and creativity have regained their places on the “hot list”, as have board games that enhance decision-making skills, according to another report released this year by Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC). The renaissance of traditional toys with educational functions could eventually lead to a rethink of the Hong Kong and mainland factory owners’ output agendas, according to some industry insiders, according to HKTDC.

Such is the case of the pizza container that prevents pizzas from getting soggy. Apparently, the patent for such a container was submitted in 2010 by none other than iPhone manufacturer Apple, reports Wired. Apple Park cafe chief Francesco Longoni appears to have participated in its design. The pizza container is round in shape, made of recycled materials, and has air vents that let moisture escape. This helps to prevent the oil in the pizza from solidifying. ADVERTISEMENT This might seem trivial coming from one of the world’s top tech companies, but it is in fact part of an initiative that will be implemented in the new Apple Park, the forthcoming headquarters of Apple Inc. in Cupertino, California. The goal is to have an environment that would motivate engineers, designers, and even cafe managers to always aspire for innovation and quality. And of course, anything that concerns hot, non-soggy pizza is always a pursuit worth undertaking.

By the time September rolls around, it’s widely believed Apple will release three brand new iPhone models: an iPhone 7s, an iPhone 7s Plus, and last but not least, the highly anticipated iPhone 8. While the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus will sport the same form factor as the iPhone 7, the iPhone 8 will introduce a completely new design, complete with an advanced edge-to-edge 5.8-inch OLED display that will essentially take up the entire front end of the device. In fact, reports from the rumor mill suggest that the bezels surrounding the iPhone 8 display will only be about 4mm all around, a tidbit seemingly confirmed by our exclusive look at an iPhone 8 dummy model earlier this week. With June right around the corner and the finalized iPhone 8 design likely locked down at this point, there’s a good chance that the number of leaked iPhone 8 moldings and schematics will rise significantly in the weeks and months ahead of the iPhone 8 release. To this point, Slashleaks today points us to a new series of photos — originally sourced via Weibo — which show us three different iPhone molds corresponding to the three new iPhone models Apple will release later this year. While the photo above doesn’t shed a whole lot of new light on Apple’s 2017 iPhone lineup, it does suggest that the iPhone 8 may be slightly taller than the iPhone 7s. While previous reports claimed that the iPhone 8 will pack a display the size of an iPhone 7 Plus into the form factor of an iPhone 7, the iPhone 8 may actually be slightly larger if we assume that the molds above were all aligned uniformly. Another point worth noting is that the camera module on the iPhone 8 is oriented vertically, a design which echoes a number of leaked schematics and designs we’ve seen over the past few months. It’s widely believed that the vertical orientation of the iPhone 8’s camera module has to do with the rumored augmented reality features Apple is planning to show off later this year. With the iPhone 8 design said to feature one giant piece of glass, it’s widely believed that Apple will incorporate the Touch ID sensor into the display itself. Though some previous leaks have featured a cut-out for a Touch ID sensor on the back, it’s believed that the final iPhone 8 design will be far more elegant and user-friendly. Now as for when we can expect to see the iPhone 8 finally hit store shelves, the good news is that we won’t have to wait longer than usual. Despite an onslaught of rumors claiming that the iPhone 8 release date might be pushed back by 4-8 weeks, more recent reports from credible sources indicate that the iPhone 8 release, like most other iPhone releases, will go down in September. Price wise, it’s no surprise that Apple plans to charge a premium for the iPhone 8, with the entry-level 128GB model said to retail for $1000 and the more storage-friendly 256GB model said to retail for $1,099.         LATEST STORIES (17) Hundreds of Militants, Their Family Members Leave Damascus for Idlib Syrian Army Repels ISIL's Attack on Gov't Positions in Deir Ezzur Tens of Gunmen, Family Members Leave Homs for Northern, Northwestern Syria Bahrainis Continue Protest in Support of Shiite Cleric Sheikh Issa Qassim Yemen: Thousands of Demonstrators Condemn US, Saudi Warmongers More Villages Liberated by Iraqi Popular Forces West of Mosul Turkey to Set Up New Militant Army in Northern Syria Iran Condemns Bahraini Court Verdict against Sheikh Qassim Aleppo: People in Al-Bab Rally against Turkish Army, Allies Battle for Mosul Day 205: Weapons from Saudi Arabia Seized in Mosul Ukrainian Military Shells Lugansk 8 Times over 24 Hours Iraq's CTS Commander Says Troops Liberated 47 out of 74 Districts in Western Mosul Iraqi Army Captures Over Dozen ISIL Car Bombs in West Mosul Texas Congressman Threatened with Lynching after Calling for Trump’s Impeachment Assassinated Egyptian Scholar 'Predicted ISIL Rise' 25 Years Ago Hundreds of Militants, Their Family Members Leave Damascus for Idlib TEHRAN (FNA)- 1,076 gunmen that refused to join peace with the Syrian government left Barzeh district along with 1,596 of their family members for other militant-held regions in line with the third phase of the peace plan in the district.

You play as an old man who receives a letter that seems to upset him. He immediately grabs a backpack and walking stick and sets out into the countryside on a journey. Along the way, you clear a path for the traveler by manipulating the landscape to solve a series of puzzles. The puzzles aren’t difficult, but they help draw you into the beautiful interactive environment and pique your curiosity about the man’s story. Before long, I found myself completely absorbed by Old Man’s Journey. There is no dialogue in Old Man’s Journey, just a pleasant soundtrack supplemented by sound effects as you interact with your surroundings. As you progress through each stage, your character’s story is told through memories revealed at the end of each stage of the game. Interaction with the game’s environment is the central element of Old Man’s Journey. To advance through the countryside, you need to move hills and other parts of the landscape into positions that the old man can traverse, which is complicated by the fact that you cannot move the ground on which he stands. As you master moving hills, the game adds variety by requiring you to do things like use wheels to knock down walls and transition from hiking to taking different modes of transportation, all the while clearing a path through the landscape. The scenes in the game are beautiful and have a storybook feel. The images are two-dimensional but layered in a way that gives the game a sense of depth.1 Coupled with the lack of dialogue, the overall effect gives Old Man’s Journey a dream-like quality that works well with the flashbacks that slowly tell the story of the man’s past. There are some interesting gameplay parallels between Old Man’s Journey and a couple of my favorite games of 2017. Most of the puzzles in Old Man’s Journey involve manipulating the landscape around the protagonist to allow him to reach the next stage of the game, which immediately reminded me of Stagehand, which Federico reviewed earlier this year. The two games couldn’t be more different in most respects, but there’s something about manipulating the environment to help your character advance that is compelling in both games. It’s a mechanic that requires a shift in perspective and focus that drew me into both games. Almost everything in Old Man’s Journey is interactive too. Tap on a bird sitting on a wire, and it flies off, or tap on a door, and it opens. Each interaction is accompanied by wonderful sound design that helps bring the story to life in a way that is similar to Hidden Folks, which I reviewed earlier this year. Again, this is a very different game, but it’s a common approach that makes Old Man’s Journey more dynamic. Old Man’s Journey is a relatively short game that can be completed in a few hours. Unlike many mobile games, this is one that is better played for longer stretches on the biggest screen you have. In some respects, the experience of playing Old Man’s journey is closer to watching a good movie or reading a book than playing a game, which I liked. If you want to lose yourself in a good story this weekend, Old Man’s Journey is an excellent choice. Old Man’s Journey, which is an Apple Editors’ Choice game, is available in the App Store. TouchArcade has an excellent behind the scenes look at the development of the artwork that is worth a look. ↩︎ Tags: game day, games Sign Up Unlock MacStories Extras Club MacStories offers exclusive access to extra MacStories content, delivered every week; it’s also a way to support us directly.

Even when I tell you about it, you could think it's not important. But it just might be. Tech Industry by Chris Matyszczyk May 20, 2017 2:46 PM PDT @ChrisMatyszczyk Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives. Enlarge Image You missed this Apple event? Apple/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET It's all about the iPhone 8, right? Oh, some new MacBooks would be nice, and a new iPad or two would lift the spirits. But when the new iPhone comes out, that's when you'll be clear about Apple's (latest) new direction. Or will you? Last week, Apple unveiled its Today at Apple concept. This involves concerts and free classes at Apple stores. Its spirit is to entice you in, not to buy products but to be part of the brand, and to allow the brand to be part of you. It's hard to overstate how important this actually may be, because it's an example of Apple anticipating the world as it's becoming, not as it is or was. Look at the Today at Apple ad launched last week and you won't see one instance of selling and buying. As online purchase becomes normal for just about every product on earth, the concept of a physical store ceases to revolve around basic transactions. When it comes to Apple products, they're written about so much that many people feel as if they know them long before they touch them. Many will touch them for the first time when the products arrive on their doorsteps. So what will the stores now be for? For everything that happens when you're not buying the product. They'll exist to bind you to the brand on a more consistent basis, not just when a new iPhone launches or your old iPhone needs fixing. They'll exist to make you believe Apple isn't a brand that sells products, but a club to which you've purchased membership. Forget the old concept of the Apple fanperson. This is something more sophisticated, longer-lasting and more regular. You won't be a fan. You'll be a member. Fans are excitable, fickle even. Members have a certain status and permanence. Apple said on its last earnings call that its services business enjoyed an 18 percent revenue rise. This includes such things as Apple Pay, iCloud and the App Store. These aren't cyclical business like iPhones and iPads, which are so heavily swayed by new launches. So now its stores will be an even greater part of Apple's overall service. That service doesn't just comprise buying things or even fixing them. It offers you inspiration, camaraderie and many other emotional benefits of membership. Soon, Apple will find ways to make you pay a little for it, of course. You'll hardly feel a thing. Americans increasingly want to spend money on experiences, not things. Apple understands that by offering more experiential brick and mortar outlets, it's anticipating a trend that's left many physical retail establishments, and shopping malls as a whole, far behind. Apple can have only so many product events every year. Its stores, however, can be a venue for events every month, every week, every day. Those happenings can involve and bind in a way that TV ads and other forms of hype just can't anymore. Look back in a few years' time and I fancy you'll find that this launch seems like the stamp of a new direction, one in which people's relationship with Apple materially changed, far more than it did with the launch of the iPhone 8.

What if you can get a military-grade, rugged smartphone with thermal imaging that can help you see in the dark at the same price? Recognising India’s potential as a grown-up smartphone market, US-based construction machinery manufacturing company Caterpillar Inc has for the first time launched the sturdy CAT S60 smartphone targeting both consumers and the B2B sector in the country. Priced at $1000, CAT S60 is the first smartphone with an integrated thermal camera, allowing users to detect heat loss around windows and to see in complete darkness. Here is what works for the device. The device does not have great looks like the Samsung Galaxy S8 or iPhone 7 Plus, but the moment you hold the S60, it feels tough and robust, with heavy-duty specifications backing it up. The device is IP68 certified — a global standardisation which makes it dustproof and shockproof. It is also “MIL-SPEC 810G” certified which means the device is ready to bear extreme temperature, vibration, humidity and is claimed to have been built to withstand drops from 1.8 metres. The device is waterproof up to two metres that extends up to five metres to block more water if you flip the “Lock Down” switches on the front-facing speakers which enables the smartphone to be used as an underwater camera. CAT S60 stands out from other smartphones for its thermal camera. The technology is provided by US-based company FLIR that specialises in the design and production of thermal imaging cameras, components and imaging sensors. Users need to use the FLIR app to take thermal images (which was a delight to experience).The thermal camera visualises heat that is invisible to the naked eye and highlights temperature contrasts.

This year, through its partnership with WWF in China, Apple has transitioned approximately 320,000 acres of forest in China toward Forest Stewardship Council certification. This advancement means, in just two years, the company has now reached its goal of protecting and creating enough sustainably managed forests to cover all its packaging needs. Apple’s forestry work is just the beginning of its efforts to conserve the world’s precious resources. The company also announced the ambitious goal of creating a closed loop supply chain, where products are built using only renewable resources or recycled material.

It was his favorite setting for thought. Apple Park captures his spirit uncannily well,” said Laurene Powell Jobs. “He would have flourished, as the people of Apple surely will, on this luminously designed campus.” “Steve invested so much of his energy creating and supporting vital, creative environments. We have approached the design, engineering and making of our new campus with the same enthusiasm and design principles that characterize our products,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. “Connecting extraordinarily advanced buildings with rolling parkland creates a wonderfully open environment for people to create, collaborate and work together. We have been extremely fortunate to be able to work closely, over many years, with the remarkable architectural practice Foster + Partners.” CategoriesUncategorized TagsPress Release Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Apple’s WWDC returns to San Jose June 5-9, 2017 Next PostNext Apple introduces iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition Search Recent Posts 28 y/o entrepreneur talks about her sustainable swimwear line and how she is saving our oceans one bikini at a time Consortium to lead design of the ‘airport of the future’ Kiwi Property annual profit falls 43% Credit Simple reveals best (& worst) names ranked by score Fit for transport animal welfare app launched today Business Directory Business Contacts Meta Log in Entries RSS Comments RSS WordPress.org Proudly powered by WordPress

It started with no fees attached, but in 2015 the company added Peerby Go, a rental platform. 25 percent of the proceeds go back to the company. (Photo: Peerby) By Eszter Zalan BRUSSELS, Today, 07:10 For Anja Kuhner, sharing is a lifestyle. She shares her Duesseldorf apartment and her knowledge about the city, free-of-charge, with strangers from all over the world, who might eventually become lifelong friends. The journalist and executive director of the non-profit home sharing service BeWelcome says it is about the experience, not about money. Couchsurfing has existed for years, and was originally free. (Photo: Open Minder) She argues that hosting people from around the world helped her to better her understanding of different cultures. “Each person brings something to your life, a story, pictures, experiences,” she says. The once laid-back approach of opening a home became an industry in the late 2000s, with smartphones becoming a convenient access point to sharing services. Businesses started to make billions under the umbrella of sharing. Some, like Kuhner, still stick to the original philosophy and are frustrated with the new, profit-making phenomenon. As many researchers in this area tend to do, she distinguishes between the “fake” and “real” sharing economy. Kuhner, who has written a book on free hospitality services, argues that the real sharing economy is in fact a niche. As soon as it gets out of this niche, it becomes a real business. “The real sharing will never be mainstream,” Kuhner told EUobserver. The app revolution Experts put the birth of the so-called sharing economy - sometimes also labelled the "gig", "platform" or "collaborative consumption" economy - in 2008, when Apple introduced its app platform that made it simple for anyone to create apps and services. Apps acted as amplifiers and sharing services got an immense boost. Airbnb, the home sharing service, was founded in 2008. It now has 150 million users, and is valued at over $20 billion USD (around €18.8 billion). Uber, another company that has become a household name, was launched in 2009, and now has an eye-watering valuation of $60 billion USD (around €56.5 billion). Couchsurfing, one of the biggest home-sharing services launched in 2004 also decided to go for-profit in 2011. It currently has around 14 million users. While the idea is still based on people sharing their own property, car or home, it is no longer solely based on generosity, but instead on profit. In a sense, it is not primarily for sharing anymore, but rather appears more like renting. Still, people do get to meet each other, and might be able to learn about different perspectives, which has been the basic philosophy held by the "original" sharers, along with sharing instead of owning. Positive social impact That is why Benita Matofska - a global expert and speaker on the sharing economy, and founder of The People Who Share, which aims to “mainstream the sharing economy worldwide” - does not believe in the dichotomy of the “fake” and “real” sharing economy. She says the benchmark on making a judgement on a business should be whether it has a positive social impact. Matofska defines the sharing economy as "a socio-economic ecosystem built around the sharing of human, physical and intellectual resources”. She argues that there are different types of sharing resources, but that the media has been focusing on the business side of the sharing economy, distorting its image. “They are just a small part of the story,” she told EUobserver, hoping to re-balance the image. But not everybody is convinced. Kuhner’s organisation, BeWelcome, follows the more “traditional” way of sharing. It was founded in 2007, is a non-profit, and now has 100,000 members. Everyone at the organisation is a volunteer, and it makes use of donations to cover its administrative costs, for things such as internet server payments, banking fees, and trademark registrations. Last year they had expenses amounting to around €260,000. Kuhner admits their 100,000 membership is “nothing” compared to Couchsurfing's numbers but she argues, for her, that is not the point. “It’s not about the number of members, but the number of encounters. That is what has value for us,” Kuhner says, adding: “We do our thing, we don’t think about numbers." She admits to being “disappointed” with sites like Airbnb misleadingly using sharing for their business. She went on to call the site: “just a bed and breakfast with a different platform”. She was also "negatively surprised" by the fact that people think Airbnb and Uber are the real thing, while she refers to them as the “fake sharing economy”. “We will never be mainstream,” she said. People benefit But the changing business model is altering how businesses look at communities. Matofska argues that even the impact of Airbnb, which has been criticised and regulated in various cities due to it inflating property prices, has been positive. It enables people to access cheaper accommodation, to travel, to stay in areas where they usually would not, and spend more money on the local economy. She also highlighted several social enterprises that work with shared resources, which aim to have a positive impact on society. The UK project and registered charity, FareShare, is working to save food that is still good, but is normally thrown away and wasted. They send it to community groups who create meals for people in need. Another example from the UK, Streetbank, is a community of over 50,000 neighbours sharing things, such as kitchen equipment, to help communities get to know each other. Similar initiatives exist in other countries, as well. “All of this has value, as it is a part of a culture-shift to enabling people to access shared resources,” Matofska says. The fact that the sharing economy has disrupted the traditional economy is a good thing, she argues, as traditional business are trying to up their game by giving access to their resources, for instance, hotels reaching out to local communities. Matofska says people are increasingly looking for companies that share, or participate in the sharing economy with a positive social impact. This acts as a positive push for traditional companies, and the experience becomes more personal even if the initial choice is based on the prospect of spending less money on a service. She argues that companies need to be encouraged to create more of a social impact while the sharing economy is still young and evolving. In June, she will spearhead the Global Sharing Week, where people get together to share experiences and participate in the sharing economy. “I believe people are benefiting much more,” she argues.

(Photo by ... more Photo: Ethan Miller Editorial: FCC stepping backward 1 / 2 Back to Gallery THE ISSUE: The loosening of government regulations on the internet could backfire. THE STAKES: The result could be suppression of new and creative ventures that could fuel our economy and enhance our lives. --- Even before the state began awarding economic development grants to spur the growth of New York's burgeoning video game industry, Troy was already becoming a mini-hub for such innovation. The right combination of creative, tech-savvy talent and a supportive environment fueled the launch of some enterprises that could become the next generation's Google, Apple and Microsoft. To provide the ecosystem where such innovation can hatch and thrive, we must have a free and open internet. That way all the players, big and small, can rise or fall depending on the quality of their creations. Unfortunately, action by the Federal Communications Commission last week threatens that dynamic. The commission voted to move away from the Obama-era policy of regulating the internet like it's a public utility, where the broadband providers have no say who uses the web and how it is used. Some compare this to the way an electricity provider only delivers the power to your home and how you use it is your business. This concept of maintaining open and equal access to the internet is commonly called "net neutrality." Under the policy pushed by the new FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, the big internet service providers, like AT&T and Verizon, will get to set rules about how the net can be used and who has access. Some fear this may result in these companies limiting potential competitors by charging them more to get onto the high-speed lanes of the so-called information superhighway. For example, if Verizon has new apps or is streaming its own programming, it could conceivably charge online services like Netflix and Amazon more. Multibillion-dollar corporations like Amazon or Netflix could absorb the extra cost, but for the new kids on the block it may be prohibitive. For a talented individual or a small technology company, like those taking root in Troy, this could be the difference between success and failure. Open and neutral internet access allowed once-little startups like Facebook and Twitter to became major players. More Information To comment: tuletters@timesunion.com or at http://blog.timesunion.com/opinion In the ever-changing tech economy we don't know what products will be the next big thing, but it's clear that video games have enormous economic potential. It's a global industry worth $25 billion in the U.S. alone. Through grants last year to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, New York University and the Rochester Institute of Technology, the state hopes to expand its relatively small share of the industry. Companies like Vicarious Visions, launched in Troy by RPI grads Guha and Karthik Bala, or their newest company, Velan Studios, and others like them, are taking their place alongside other tech enterprises that are making our region's future bright. This could all be stifled if the big tech giants are allowed to run the internet in a way to suit their own needs. It's bad public policy that threatens to keep creative new ideas from ever coming to fruition. This is a TU+ story. Click for more information.

(Image: Reuters) The world's largest private equity fund, backed by Japan's Softbank Group and Saudi Arabia's main sovereign wealth fund, said on Saturday it had raised over $93 billion to invest in technology sectors such as artificial intelligence and robotics. "The next stage of the Information Revolution is under way, and building the businesses that will make this possible will require unprecedented large-scale, long-term investment," the Softbank Vision Fund said in a statement. Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, chairman of Softbank, a telecommunications and tech investment group, revealed plans for the fund last October and since then it has obtained commitments from some of the world's most deep-pocketed investors. sponsored OnePlus 3T (Gunmetal, 6GB RAM... ₹ 29,999.00 OnePlus 3T (Soft Gold, 6GB... ₹ 29,999.00 For OnePlus 3 / 3T... ₹ 599.00 In addition to Softbank and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), the new fund's investors include Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment, which has committed $15 billion, Apple Inc, Qualcomm, Taiwan's Foxconn Technology and Japan's Sharp Corp. The new fund made its announcement during the visit of President Donald Trump to Riyadh and the signing of tens of billions of dollars worth of business deals between U.S. and Saudi companies. Son was also in Riyadh on Saturday. After meeting with Trump last December, Son pledged $50 billion of investment in the United States that would create 50,000 jobs, a promise Trump claimed was a direct result of his election win. The fund may also serve the interests of Saudi Arabia by helping Riyadh obtain access to foreign technology. The Saudi economy has been severely damaged by low oil prices, and policymakers are trying to diversify into new industries. The PIF signaled an interest in the tech sector last year by investing $3.5 billion in U.S. ride-hailing firm Uber. Saturday's statement did not say how much the PIF had committed to the fund, but previously it has said it would invest up to $45 billion over five years. Softbank is investing $28 billion. The new fund said it would seek to buy minority and majority interests in both private and public companies, from emerging businesses to established, multi-billion-dollar firms. It expects to obtain preferred access to long-term investment opportunities worth $100 million or more. Other sectors in which the fund may invest include mobile computing, communications infrastructure, computational biology, consumer internet businesses and financial technology. The fund aims for $100 billion of committed capital and expects to complete its money-raising in six months, it added. ai private equity fund Softbank-Saudi Tech Fund First Published: May 22, 2017, 9:34 AM IST Read full article Next Story Recommended For You Moto C, Moto C Plus Unveiled: Price, Specifications and More Aaradhaya Steals the Thunder From Mom Aishwarya at Cannes 2017 IPL 2017: Goenka Compares Dhoni-Smith to Iconic Jai-Veeru Pair IPL 2017: Jos Buttler Does a Ranbir Kapoor to Celebrate Mumbai Indians Win Fly with AirAsia and Avail the Lowest Airfare to Travel Across India Popular Deals Coolpad Cool 1 (Gold, 3GB... 10,999.00 OnePlus 3T (Gunmetal, 6GB RAM... 29,999.00 Moto G5 (3 GB, Lunar... 11,999.00 About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News Antonio Conte Says Arsenal Are Favourites to Win FA Cup Arun Jaitley Files Fresh Defamation Suit Against Kejriwal, Again for Rs 10 Crore IPL 2017: Mumbai Beat Pune to Lift Record Third Title New 'Sesame Street' Theme Park to Open in US IPL 2017: Teamwork Wins You Titles, says Rohit Sharma Watch LIVE From Network18 News18 India CricketNext News18 States Pradesh18 Bangla News Gujarati News Urdu News Marathi News Topper Moneycontrol Firstpost CompareIndia History India MTV India In.com Burrp E-Learning Franchise Opportunity CNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2016 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

Johnson/HBO NOT AS MANY SPOILERS THIS TIME BUT STILL “The Blood Boy” opens in the garage where Hooli was founded, painstakingly reconstructed inside the much larger garage in Gavin Belson’s mansion. Garage fetishism is quite a thing in Silicon Valley (the place)—they carry a ton of symbolism for what the tech world likes to believe about itself. Independence and self-reliance. The spirit of tinkering and invention. Tools and stuff. Google and Hewlett-Packard have preserved the garages where they were founded as museums/shrines. The garage where Steves Wozniak and Jobs started Apple was landmarked by the city of Los Altos. Many companies looking to recapture their spirit of innovation have created incubators and experimental divisions and actually called them “garages,” complete with roll-up doors. This era is fading. The founder’s garage is a conceit that makes about as much literal sense as an “elevator pitch” does when hardly any Valley venture capital offices are more than two stories tall. Facebook was founded in a Harvard dorm and graduated to a shared house in Palo Alto before getting proper office space, but they’re probably the last future tech hegemon to do so. Why? Here’s that house on Zillow today: Matt Corwine Note the median home price in that neighborhood—it’s hard to believe any scrappy entrepreneurs can afford to live there. On the show, even the corner of Erlich’s garage where Jared lays his glassy eyes to rest is starting to seem about as realistic as the apartments on Friends. (By the way, did you notice that Jared is now using a Microsoft Surface laptop?) Erlich’s incubator can only exist because he lucked out with a previous startup—and it still seems implausible, since he isn’t exactly what economists call a “rational actor." Most startups today don’t require a garage: they're conceived in coffeehouses and coworking spaces and gestate in the cloud, a frugal approach to space that’s a little harder to seal up and save for posterity. Maybe in a hundred years there will just be little blue plaques everywhere—“At this espresso counter was founded YumFun, a food-sharing startup that pivoted to build autonomous killer robots.” Back to the show. Just as the Valley likes to think of itself as an aw-shucks gang of tinkerers in suburban garages, it also fancies itself a sleek meritocracy—not so, says “The Blood Boy”’s subplot on Monica’s palace intrigue at Raviga. When Laurie Bream’s baby shower features a suspicious number of tequila-swigging dudes, Erlich smells a coup in motion and guides Monica to ingratiate herself with the bros to save her job: to “bro down, or go down.” Apparently Laurie’s pregnancy could be spun as a weakness and used as an excuse to push her out—which is dubious, since carrying a child doesn’t seem to affect anything other than her center of gravity. And pointless, since she was aware of the plot all along—Monica shotgunned warm beers and watched sportsing videos with Ed Chen and his lacrosse stick for nothing. (Speaking of gender, it has been interesting to see Dinesh’s now-incarcerated now-ex-girlfriend Mia played against type - she scans as (mostly) sweet and mousy, while she in fact has a stronger hacking game than Gilfoyle - which is saying a lot. Given that female hackers in TV and film tend to be portrayed as at least a little punky or butch, it’s nice to see the show forego the lazy casting and suggest that the next Guccifer doesn’t need to be either a wiry pale dude or Aeon Flux. And the idea that technical == masculine is [dumb], anyway.) Another Valley trope evoked in “The Blood Boy” is the quest for life extension that drives the episode’s main plot. It turns out that Gavin Belson is an actual vampire: he gets regular blood transfusions from a healthy young man named Bryce, to preserve his vitality and extend his lifespan. "He’s a picture of health! He looks like a Nazi propaganda poster!” (Bryce also knows Jared as Donald from a past I’m a little frightened to learn about.) This fluid-bonding means that the Pied Piper team needs to listen to Bryce’s ideas and manage his moods as if he were Gavin himself, to keep both of their cortisol levels within a healthy range. After annoying Richard (and triggering Jared’s lingering rage) by speaking out of turn and questioning Pied Piper’s rollout plans, Bryce is eventually exposed as a Ho Ho-chomping stoner. This deception sends Gavin’s cholesterol through the roof - “at this rate, I’ll be dead by the age of 120." Bryce is also deeply resentful of the nerd-centric Valley’s attitude towards attractive people: “To people like you I’m just a beautiful bag of blood.” Not true Bryce, we also value your behavioral data. Hacking your biochemistry and treating death as a high-severity bug in humanity’s kernel is up there with terraforming other planets as a go-to aspiration for stewards of massive tech fortunes. MIT researcher Pattie Maes once collected all the tech-world predictions of when humans will achieve immortality, and figured out that immortality tended to arrive just before the predictor was expected to die. The predictors were not amused. In the end, I suspect this line of research will prove out what Maciej Ceglowski says about the coder’s mindset: The Programmers’ Credo: we do these things not because they are easy, but because we thought they were going to be easy — Pinboard (@Pinboard) August 5, 2016 I could be dead wrong about this, but at least I won’t be around to hear you to say “I told you so." Side note: I’ve always found it funny when anyone who believes in a future of immortality and material abundance also buys things with Bitcoin, an inherently deflationary currency. If every Bitcoin that could exist will eventually exist, and the cost of all material goods will approach zero, and the economy will grow forever because nobody dies anymore, why would you spend a single Bitcoin today? Your great-great-grandchildren might be able to buy their own Death Star with it, if money is still a thing at that point. I am aware that this scenario is debatable, but it’s fun to think about. Matt Corwine is a writer, tech worker and expat Seattlite in Brooklyn. This is his third tech bubble.

When Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) recently said it, along with a consortium, is investing $14 million into the creation of a News Integrity Initiative, it came as a no surprise and reflected the kind of menace fake news is turning out to be. Wikipedia founder James Wales is also part of the initiative spearheaded by Facebook, with academicians and non-profit organizations also joining them. A Wikipedia-Founder Initiative Wales for his part has also opted to go solo, launching WikiTribune, which is being promoted with the tagline evidence-based journalism. WikiTribune identifies itself as a news platform that brings journalists and a community of volunteers together. "We want to make sure that you read fact-based articles that have a real impact in both local and global events. And that stories can be easily verified and improved," it said. How WikiTribune Plans To Purge News In a bid to present unbiased news with real facts, WikiTribune looks to ensure journalists write articles based on only verifiable facts. And it would present the sources to readers so that a reader can make up his own mind without being presented with prejudiced information. WikiTribune is planning to take the advertisers out of the equation, as it is supposed to be 100-percent ad-free. In the process, the parties involved do not have any vested interest in anything other than providing real news. The website doesn't have any paywall, thereby giving access to everyone. In order to involve community members, who otherwise have their say in the form of comments in the bottom of the article, WikiTribune intends to have professional journalists and community members work side by side as equals, supported by readers and not advertisers. These readers can take the role of monthly supporters. To increase transparency, WikiTribune intends to publish financials regularly. Joining Wales would be a luminary of advisors, including former Apple marketing wizard Guy Kawasaki, renowned journalist Jeff Jarvis, English actress Lily Cole and academician and political activist Larry Lessig. Banking On Supporters WikiTribune intends to raise finances from supporters, who it said really care about good journalism. Apart from plans to raise enough money upfront to get started, it seeks regular commitments from supporters to help in delivering real news. And it seeks to channelize the money raised to finance hiring journalists rather than splurging on expensive offices. WikiTribune suggested that it would refund all its supporters, minus transaction fees, if it doesn't achieve its goal of hiring ten journalists. As of now, the website claimed to have 10,214 supporters and hired six of the 10 journalists targeted. The Good That Can Come From WikiTribune Objective reporting has suffered so much in recent times that there has been a real thirst for real news. The results of a survey by Fox News showed that 84 percent voters surveyed said they are concerned fake news is hurting the country, with 61 percent saying they are very worried and 23 percent suggesting they are somewhat concerned. Interestingly, the survey also revealed that majority of the surveyed voters could not differentiate real news and fake news. One of the pressing problems many now quote is the cognizance of trusted source of information. Against this backdrop, when someone offers to take upon them the onus of delivering trusted news and information, it is a more than welcome development. The Bad: Pitfalls Of Fact-Focus News would tend to be the mere recitation of facts, with attributions to support the facts, if it takes the route of being merely fact-focused. This is unlikely to help readers in a big way. According to an article in ABC News, a proper journalist should sift through the facts, weigh them up and make editorial judgments about their relative strength and importance, and then present them in a way that illuminates the truth of a matter. "This process of making editorial judgments about facts is fundamental to great journalism," the article said. Making editorial judgment brings in an element of bias, which defeats the very purpose of which the news site is being launched. Read More A case in point is news sites such as PolitiFact that operate under the premise of extra rigorous evidence-based reporting have been criticized for a myopic interpretation of information. Such an approach promotes the idea that there is no room for differing or contrary interpretations to a news item. There are doubts whether the editorial policy on the site will succeed in being as transparent as it promises and really fix the problem of fake news or just create a technocratic alternative to corporate media. Additionally, the fact-focused mechanical reporting may not augur well for the letter and spirit of reporting per se.

Yet behind the scenes, the conglomerate is also making a name as a contract manufacturer of complex medicines to treat diseases like cancer. On a piece of reclaimed land along the western coast of South Korea, Samsung BioLogics Co Ltd is building a $740 million factory that will give it the capacity to become the No. 1 producer by volume of a class of drugs called biologics, many of which are derived from mammal cells. The Samsung Group diversified into the pharmaceutical sector in 2011. Now, it's mobilising its expertise in semiconductor making and engineering know-how to make the way biologics are produced on behalf of Big Pharma more efficient. The market for biologic medicines, which are used for everything from cancer to arthritis, is projected to exceed $223.7 billion by 2021, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis. A worker cleans the floor in a bioreactor hall at Plant 3. Being a force in biologics is crucial to Samsung and South Korea. Galaxy smartphones and other consumer electronics face intense competition from Apple Inc and Chinese brands such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, and the chaebol is grappling with the arrest of de facto leader Jay Y. Lee in a scandal that brought down the country's former president. Meanwhile, the broader economy needs new industries as shipbuilding and heavy manufacturing slow. If the past 40 years of global economic growth were fueled by technology, said Kim Tae-han, chief executive officer of Samsung BioLogics, the next would be fueled by where that converges with health care. Edison In an interview at company headquarters in Incheon, Kim said he was preparing to ramp up production and is in negotiations for more than 15 new contracts. The Samsung board gave him the green light and $2 billion to start the business about six years ago. "Yet, on the strength of demand and business performance, I've already spent $3 billion!'' Kim said. Sales totalled 107.6 billion won ($96 million) in the first quarter, a 2.1% increase from a year earlier, though the unit still posted a net loss. More than 2,000 construction workers -- most with experience building semiconductor facilities -- are buzzing around the factory site about an hour's drive from Seoul. It is called Edison and is the company's third drug facility. Its five floors encompass 34 metres, making way for custom-made vats that are so big some shoot through several floors. Biologic drugs are grown from cells. That necessitates a more complex manufacturing process than typical pills -- a mixture of chemicals -- but makes biologicsmore effective and capable of being targeted toward certain diseases. Building a biologic plant is similar to one for semiconductors. There are clean rooms that cannot tolerate dust or other contamination, so Edison is being built without nuts or bolts to prevent any drilling. As such, everything is welded and tilted to fit together. "One day, Kim said, contract manufacturing could extend to helping clients build the factories.'' Roche, Squibb "We know how to optimise that process," Kim said, citing the experience in semiconductors. "We could be competitive in quality, speed and cost." Samsung already is a contract manufacturer for some blockbuster drugs, including for Roche Holding AG and the Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. "It will take three years for the plant to ramp up to full capacity after being completed this year and opening at the end of 2018,'' Kim said. At its Incheon facilities, staff are on site 24 hours a day to ensure continuity: researchers in white smocks spend the day monitoring the production process, checking on centrifuges or poring over data on computer monitors. English is the working language and some are alums of Genentech Inc or Amgen Inc, the US-based biotechnology giants. It has 1,700 employees, and their average age is 28, the youngest in the Samsung affiliates. "Globally, the drug industry produces four million litres of biologic drugs a year, and that's projected to double by 2030,'' Kim said. With its new plant, Samsung BioLogicsis positioning itself to double its market share. Equipment stands in a bioreactor hall at Plant 3. Contract Making Kim's company faces some formidable competitors, who are also expanding. Switzerland's Lonza Group AG and Germany's Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH have long histories in the biologics contract manufacturing business, and Japan's Fujifilm Holdings Corp also entered the business. "We are aware of expansions and further investments in mammalian cell culture capacities by Big Pharma and contract manufacturers worldwide," Boehringer Ingelheim said in a statement. "The company is investing almost €700 million ($767 million) to build a production facility in Vienna that will create about 500 jobs,'' Boehringer Ingelheim said in an email. "Fujifilm is investing 14 billion yen ($123 million) to accelerate its drug-manufacturing capacity in the US and UK,'' it said in April. "Through subsidiary Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies, it's targeting revenue of 100 billion yen for the contract development and manufacturing business by March 2024,'' it said in an email. Lonza declined to comment. Kim was tasked with finding new industries for Samsung in 2007. He spent three years overseeing a team studying as many as 60 growth sectors that Samsungcould veer into, including electric cars. Convincing Board It took him three years to convince the group's board it was worth the gamble to pivot into making drugs. One big supporter was Lee, who remains in police custody. While ongoing projects haven't been affected by Lee's detention, some long-term strategic projects were put on hold, Kim said. One accusation against Lee is that he sought the former president's help in restructuring Samsung affiliates and getting Samsung BioLogics listed on the Korean exchange last year. Lee and the company deny the allegations. Adding to the pressures, the country's Financial Supervisory Service is auditing Samsung BioLogics. Kim said he was confident in the bookkeeping standards. Samsung and other companies in the sector have benefited from the Korean government's support of biopharmaceutical businesses. The Incheon Free Economic Zone offered Samsung BioLogics the factory land for 50 years without rent, the company said. New President Moon Jae-in railed against the chaebol during his campaign, but Samsung said in an email it expected him to boost the biopharmaceutical and health-care industries. "The government has been pushing for this for a few decades, but we are at the very beginning,'' said Laura Nelson Carney, a senior analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein. "The government has been helpful in funding a lot of basic research, changing listing requirements to make it easier for emerging biotechnology companies to raise money in public markets and pushing for favorable technology-transfer rules,'' she said. Samsung isn't the only player in its home market. A slew of other companies have also been making steady headway on the international biologics drug scene -- either by contract manufacturing or by developing their own biosimilars, which are generic versions of biologic drugs. Celltrion Approvals One is Incheon-based Celltrion Inc, which made waves in the pharmaceutical world by receiving a slew of international regulatory approvals for its biosimilars. For Remsima, a cheaper copy of Johnson & Johnson's arthritis drug Remicade, it claimed 30% of the market share in Europe since receiving regulatory approval last year, Kim Ho-ung, head of the strategy and operations division for Celltrion Healthcare, said in an April 18 interview. Still, Samsung's deep pockets and ability to throw money at building its presence in a new industry remain a big advantage. Increased pressure for Big Pharma to cut costs is one driving factor for why it might outsource to a company like Samsung BioLogics rather than make drugs in-house, Kim said. Meanwhile, the industry is graduating from using surgical and chemical ways of treating diseases, with many of the new medicines in development of the biologic or cell-based variety. In 2015, six of the world's 10 best-selling drugs were biologics, including Remicade and Sanofi's Lantus for diabetes, according to researcher IMS. Kim's modelled his aspirations on the trajectory followed by the chips industry. His benchmark is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, which entered the contract manufacturing market when no one was outsourcing and now is the largest chipset maker for iPhones. "We want to be a global top player in whatever industry we enter," Kim said. "By 2030, we would like to be regarded as one of the global leaders in biopharmaceuticals."

There are over a billion WhatsApp users worldwide right now. The bad news? Your mum has already found her new favourite way to spam you. The good news? You can easily avoid her on the down-low, and that’s just one of the messaging service’s many secret tips you probably don’t know about. From disabling its ‘last seen’ feature to bookmarking messages you don’t want to forget about, there are loads of tricks to make your favourite IM app more useful than ever. You just have to be in the know. Luckily enough, we’ve scoured every inch of WhatsApp to gather up its most useful features. Read these top tips and you’ll be a pro in no time at all. 1. BEGONE, BLUE TICKS OF MISERY We know how it is. You're at figure skating practice, your phone buzzes, and you glance down briefly before nailing a spectacular triple axel. Clearly, you've not got time to respond immediately. But at the same time, you don't want the sender to realise that you've already looked at the message, lest they think you're ignoring them when you fail to reply for two more hours. That's the privilege the blue ticks take away. Recently though, the chat app has realised the error of its ways and silently come up with a workaround. The liberty of message-mulling is ours again. How: Users can just access Privacy via Settings and disable Read Receipts. There, now it's time to iron out the kinks in your friendships that the blue ticks have caused. 2. FIGURE OUT YOUR BFFS What’s the difference between a casual acquaintance and a bezzie mate for life? How often you message them on WhatsApp, of course. If you’re not sure how to divvy up the members of your social circle, then why not check how often you’ve messaged them. How: Head to Settings > Data and Storage Usage > Storage Usage and you’ll see a list of your most important groups and contacts ranked according to the data you’ve expended on their behalves. Ah, the romance of modern living. 3. SEE WHEN YOUR MESSAGES ARE READ Think the double-blue ticks are the worst thing to happen to relationships since Tinder? Think again. Here's another way you could annoy your loved ones. In addition to finding out the exact time your messages are delivered, you can also choose to see the exact time your message was read (assuming you choose to stick with the ticks). How: Go to any of your WhatsApp chats, tap and hold on any of the messages you’ve sent in that chat, followed by the Info option. For iOS users, you can also drag towards the left to reveal a window which will show the time your message was delivered and subsequently read. It works for group messages too, with the window listing the time each participant read the message. 4. HIDE YOUR PROFILE PIC Batman. David Bowie. Pepe the Prawn. All people who have built their much-vaunted careers on an air of mystique and otherness. You can bet they’d have their WhatsApp profile pics set to private, instead of treating the world to a bedraggled photo of them and a bottle of Lambrini. So, as the saying goes, always be yourself unless you can be like Batman. How: Head to Settings > Privacy > Profile Photo > Nobody. 5. Mute group chats We’re all in at least a few group chats at any one time, created because someone (likely the group admin) was bored. People tend to get overzealous in chats, especially since WhatsApp allows group conversations of up to 50 participants. Who hasn’t woken up to the horror of 100+ unread messages fuelled by a night of boredom? How: To prevent yourself from being woken up by the constant lighting up of your smartphone screen, you can (a) either flip your phone over and ignore it or (b) mute the offending group chat. Tap on the group chat of your choice, then the name to bring up Group Info where you will find the option to Mute the chat for eight hours to one week or a year. Alternatively, you can exit it altogether. 6. Get shortcuts to conversations If there are certain people you chat to more often, it might be a good idea to create a shortcut for them directly on your homescreen, so you don’t have to keep opening and closing WhatsApp. How: Tap and hold on the chat (group or individual) of your choice and a tab will pop up. Select the Add Conversation Shortcut option and the chat in question will appear as the person's profile photo on your mobile desktop. Unfortunately this only applies for Android users and not iPhone ones. Sorry guys. 7. Find out the truth about where your friend is We've all been a victim of that “on the way” lie when the person in question is still in bed. To prevent yourself from ever getting duped again, insist that the contact shares their current location with you by tapping on the arrow icon next to the text box and then Share Location. There's also a way of preventing them from manually entering their location... How: The way the location appears is a clue. If it’s a real GPS-based location, the location share will appear as a dropped pin, but if it’s a location they entered, its address will appear beside the dropped pin. Feel free to call them out on it. 8. Go incognito by switching off 'last seen' WhatApp’s ‘last seen’ feature is a nightmare for anyone with self-esteem issues. ‘Why are they online and not replying to you right now? Do they have someone more important to be talking to? Surely it’s not Joel? That devilish son of a gun.’ If you’d rather your people didn’t think this way of you, there’s an easy ‘get out of jail’ card to be deployed. Just turn off the ‘last seen’ feature altogether, or restrict it to only your contacts. How: Head to Settings > Privacy > Last Seen > Nobody. 9. Send messages hands-free with Siri Ugh! Typing is a right faff when you want to use your hands for other stuff such as eating, cooking or fine embroidery. Once again WhatsApp has come to the rescue to this most first-world of problems via compatibility with both Apple’s Siri and Google Assistant. So you can now dictate any missives to your phone instead of punching them in with your digits like a total chump. How: Shout out ‘Hey Siri’ or ‘OK Google’, then name the contact you want to send a message to and the contents of that message. 10. Send public messages privately If you’ve got a generic announcement to make - an invite to a weekend BBQ or an intervention about your friend's unhealthy obsession with KFC - and you don’t want to do it on the loudmouth platform that is Facebook, this feature works in pretty much the same way as BCC-ing people in an email. Your recipients will get the message as if it was a privately composed one, oblivious to the fact that you’ve sent the exact same invite to 342 other people. Sincerity? What's that? How: On the top-left-hand corner of your WhatsApp Chats window, just below the search bar, you’ll notice a Broadcast Lists. Tap on it for the option to create a new list of contacts you want your message to go out to, and message away like you would normally. 11. Stay selectively notified Not all group chats are created equal, as some are filled with nothing but white noise. And it’s exactly those group chats you want to ignore until you get some downtime to sieve through everything that’s been said. On the flipside, there are the group chats you want to stay on top of, such as the ones deciding dinner plans for the night and so on. Here’s how you can stay selectively notified. How: Go to the significant group chats, tap on the name to bring up Group Info and then Custom Notifications. There, you can select a custom message alert for the group chats of your choice. All you have to do now is remember which alert tone you assigned to which group chat. This customisation is only applicable for group chats though. 12. Back it up Worried about losing a year’s worth of messages? You don’t have to. WhatsApp knows how precious your chat history is to you and secures it all for you in the cloud. How: iPhone users get the option of backing their chat history to iCloud automatically on a daily/weekly/monthly schedule. If it’s only selected chat histories you desire, click on the chat you want, then the user’s name and finally email conversation to yourself. Android users can go to 'Settings', 'Chats and calls', and select the 'Chat backup' option, which will let you setup an automatic Google Drive backup. The next time you install WhatsApp from fresh on any device, you can simply select the Google Drive backup option at the setup screen, to have all your up-to-date messages injected into your device, straight from the cloud. 13. Save your media (and data allowance) When you’re on a 1GB data plan, every MB counts. You don’t want to be slapped with a hefty bill at the end of the month from sending stupid shareable memes and screenshots of every little thing. There’s a way to make sure that all that heavy-duty image sending won’t eat up what little complimentary data you might have in your plan. How: Go to Settings, then Chat Settings and then Auto-Download and tweak the settings for how you want your received media to be downloaded. Choose Wi-Fi if you don’t want to overload your data plan. Alternatively, you can trigger downloads manually by switching Auto-Download to Never. You can also save the hassle of having to clean up your camera roll every so often by tweaking Save Incoming Media off. 14. Tie the app to your number If you’re overseas and you get a new data sim, there’s no need to go through the hassle of registering the new number attached to the SIM and faff around adding contacts. Just carry on using WhatsApp with your regular number. How: When you put your new SIM in and activate WhatsApp, you’ll be prompted by the messaging service to register the new number. But doing so will mess up your contacts list. Just ignore the pop-up or cancel it, and your WhatsApp should work linked to your old number, while using your new data SIM. 15. Star messages When dinner time rolls around, the last thing you want to do is scroll through 352 frivolous messages to find the address of the restaurant you're meeting your friends at. Luckily WhatsApp lets you bookmark certain messages for easy access. How: Double tap on any message and tap on the star icon to mark it. To find it again, all you have to do is tap on the chat’s name, and tap on Starred Messages to see all the messages you’ve marked out. To see conversation context, just tap on the arrow next to it and you’ll be brought back to the exact place in the chat. When you’re done with it, just double tap the message, and hit the star icon again to unstar it. It’s only available for iOS users for now, so fandroids, wait your turn. 16. Make calls WhatsApp is more than just a run-of-the-mill instant messenger. You can use it to make calls too. How: Make sure you're using the latest version of WhatsApp. You should see a new Calls tab alongside the usual Chats and Contacts. Just send a voice call invite to another WhatsApp user and you'll be chatting away in no time. 17. Instantly add dates to your calendar It’s easy to forget appointments when you’re a busy bee. You make vague plans for drinks, settle on a date, then promptly forget about it as the conversation rolls on. This handy little shortcut makes sure you commit to an appointment. How: Just state a date and you get an automatic link to add it to your calendar. It also recognises words like ‘today’, ‘tomorrow’ and days. But it's still best to use specific dates, just in case you get the day wrong. No more excuses for forgetting drink dates anymore, then. At least, not for iOS users. Android users have to wait a little while longer we're afraid. 18. Use Whatsapp on the web WhatsApp Web is the best creation since...WhatsApp itself. It’s not an entirely new feature (as any smug Android user will tell you), but their gloating days are over, as it's now available on iOS too. How: To enable inconspicuous chatting on the web while you do your work, all you have to do is go to Settings and tap on WhatsApp Web. Then head to web.whatsapp.com on your computer and scan the QR code that appears using your phone. Commence chatting on the sly without downloading anything. Handy, and also very, very distracting. 19. Save data on calls Making calls via WhatsApp is a very convenient feature, but it can also consume a lot of data. Thankfully, there's a new option to help those of us with data shortage problems. How: Pop into Settings then Chats and Calls. Right at the bottom, you’ll find Low Data Usage. Turn that on to decrease the amount of data used during calls made via WhatsApp. We’d still advise using WhatsApp calls sparingly on data if you’re on a limited data plan, but you can still save on calls when connected to Wi-Fi abroad. 20. Locate group chat You can find old group chats by searching for individual members that were in the chat group, rather than the group name itself. This is useful for when you want to revisit old topics, as chances are you'll remember who was in the chat, more than the hilarious bants-laden group name that seemed so funny at the time. How: Just tap on any individual chats, and tap their name for more information. From there you’ll be able to see all the groups you have in common with said individual, even if they go way back. 21. Back up everything including video There was a time when you could only backup images in your chats, but not videos. Now that’s changed. How: Get into Settings, then Chats and Calls, and pop into Chat Backup. This is the control centre for backing up your wordy memories. You can choose when you want Auto Backup to happen (but make sure you disable backing up using data within your phone’s settings or there will be hell to pay). You can also choose to include videos in your backup by toggling Include Videos. Would it be greedy of us to ask for voice messages to be included in the next update too? 22. Visual reminders Have the habit of reading messages then forgetting to reply to them? Now you have no excuse to neglect them as there's a new Mark as unread feature which lets you mark chats with a blue dot so that you can come back to them later. How: Just swipe any of your chats to the right and the option to Mark as unread will show up. Tap on it and a blue dot will appear on the chat as a visual marker. Once you’re done with it, just swipe the chat to the right to unmark it. Simple. P.S. Android users can achieve the same thing by long-pressing on a chat. 23. Stop people from accidentally reading your messages Theoretically, all messages on WhatsApp are private - but not when you leave your phone on the table, and a new message notification pops up. How many times have you unintentionally read someone’s message just because you’ve curiously looked over when their phone screen blinked to life with a new message notification? Admit it, we’ve all done it, and sometimes read something we've regretted. How: Go to Settings, then Notifications, and disable Show Preview. Now you can gossip in peace, without anyone accidentally reading your conversations by glancing casually at your phone when a notification comes in. Your notification still reveals who has just messaged you, without divulging any of its super secret contents. 24. Reply directly from a popup Oh, new message! Swipe down the notification bar, tap the message and reply. Sounds simple, right? It is, but there's an even faster way - cut to the chase and reply directly from a notification. How: Go to Settings, Notifications, then Popup Notification, and choose from four different options. You can change this setting for both individual messages and group messages respectively. Unfortunately, this feature is only available for Android. For now, anyway. 25. Send an attachment Unlike EPMD’s hip-hop classic, WhatsApp’s ethos is by no means Strictly Business. If you do need to quickly send a document to a colleague, and email isn’t an option, it’s easily done.

This is a fight about the most basic urban resource: space. And although concepts like gentrification and displacement have no clear definition—nor does everyone agree these processes are detrimental—there is a widespread concern among urbanists and activists that the rich will push out the poor, that conquest-by-condo is inevitable, and that, one by one, the world’s great cities will become yet another luxury good. Johannesburg Subscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week This city was long considered unsafe, a gangland best avoided in favor of Cape Town, but that has started to change in the inner core of the city known as J’burg. “Blocks that were once no-go zones now house art galleries, cafes and museums,” The Guardian reported late last year. “New businesses are opening. Neighborhoods such as Braamfontein and Maboneng are now seen as hubs of creativity and cool.” But that has meant that squatters, some 60,000 of whom live in about 100 or so abandoned or “hijacked” buildings, must find somewhere else to sleep. In a sad irony, those displaced from the city’s center, The Guardian writes, frequently “end up in the crowded townships the apartheid regime originally established to house black workers away from neighborhoods designated for whites, which occupy the prime locations.” San Francisco San Francisco was once known as a countercultural haven, a place where society’s unwanted could always find a home. The advent of Silicon Valley changed that, making the suburbs south of the city home to some of the most valuable companies in the world: Apple, Facebook, Google. Much of that wealth has flowed north, into San Francisco, to the displeasure of many locals. The “Google bus protests” of 2013, though nominally about the use of the city’s infrastructure, were in large part motivated by antipathy for the hoodie-wearing elite. The battle has been especially fierce in the Mission District, once a destitute Latino enclave identified by moneyed hipsters as ripe for colonization. In 2014, a video went viral showing Dropbox and Airbnb employees trying to wrest control of a soccer field, which they had paid to rent, from local youth who figured they had every right to play there. The outcry over the incident led San Francisco officials to discontinue such rentals. “It’s a victory for the Mission’s remaining Latino community,” Julia Carrie Wong wrote for the The New Yorker, “but there’s no guarantee that the privatization of San Francisco’s other public parks and facilities won’t continue apace.” Tokyo This city is a paradox, at once reverent of antiquity and aggressively modern. But many of the dark, narrow yokocho alleyways that hint at the city’s past are now being bulldozed, with apartment towers rising in their stead. The city is home to 25 percent of Japan’s population, and while Japan’s population is declining, Tokyo’s population is growing. With nearly 38 million people in its metropolitan area, it is the largest urban zone in the world. The Wall Street Journal reports that Japan’s capital added 110,000 residents in 2014. The yokocho alleys are victims of this inexorable growth, as well as of the preparations for the 2020 Olympics. So while such alleys are celebrated in every travel guide to the city, they are facing extinction. In older neighbors like Higashi-Nakano, the oldtimers are hardly fooled by what’s happening, or why. “The word ‘redevelopment’ sounds trendy,” one resident of that neighborhood told The Japan Times, speaking from the Ma-Yan bar located on a street called Moon Road. “But, in truth, the agency just wants this property to make money off of it.” Berlin In the first few years after the Berlin Wall came down, the city retained a kind of thrillingly bifurcated identity, part Western metropolis, part Soviet backwater where artists could live as they might in Bratislava—without having to live in Bratislava. That is no longer the case, however, as the hollowed-out courtyards of East Berlin fall victim to development of both the commercial and residential variety. Nowhere has the battle been more forcefully waged than in Kreuzberg, which sits practically in the middle of the sprawling city. For years, it served as a refuge for artists and the kinds of young people who didn’t dream of careers at Deutsche Bank. That has started to change, to many locals’ consternation. They have tried to fight back, by staging demonstrations that have attracted international notice. “People are finally starting to defend themselves,” one activist told The New York Times earlier this year.   Pittsburgh  A few years ago, any suggestion that this former steel town was being gentrified would have been laughed at—and readily welcomed. But that would have been before Google set up offices in the Bakery Square section of the city, before Uber and other tech companies turned the seemingly faded Rust Belt metropolis into a hub of experimentation in robotics and autonomous vehicles. Much as Stanford is the brain center of Silicon Valley, so is Carnegie Mellon the talent hub for Pittsburgh, which some have started to call Silicon Valley East. Pittsburgh has also been called one of the best cities in the country to eat, and while any culinary tour of that city must include a calorie-packed Primanti Brothers sandwich, the kinds of restaurants being touted by the national press (Vandal, Whitfield) are unaffordable for many longtime residents, signaling clearly to some that the city’s cultural and economic ascendancy will inevitably lead some behind. Those fears were confirmed in the East Liberty neighborhood, an African-American enclave where the Penn Plaza housing development was demolished. Slated to replace it is that universal symbol of gentrification: a Whole Foods.

"The next stage of the Information Revolution is under way, and building the businesses that will make this possible will require unprecedented large-scale, long-term investment," the Softbank Vision Fund said in a statement. Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, chairman of Softbank, a telecommunications and tech investment group, revealed plans for the fund last October and since then it has obtained commitments from some of the world's most deep-pocketed investors. In addition to Softbank and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), the new fund's investors include Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment, which has committed $15 billion, Apple Inc, Qualcomm, Taiwan's Foxconn Technology and Japan's Sharp Corp. The new fund made its announcement during the visit of President Donald Trump to Riyadh and the signing of tens of billions of dollars worth of business deals between US and Saudi companies. Son was also in Riyadh on Saturday. Masayoshi Son, President and Chief Executive Officer of Softbank. Reuters The fund may also serve the interests of Saudi Arabia by helping Riyadh obtain access to foreign technology. The Saudi economy has been severely damaged by low oil prices, and policy makers are trying to diversify into new industries. The PIF signaled an interest in the tech sector last year by investing $3.5 billion in US ride-hailing firm Uber. Saturday's statement did not say how much the PIF had committed to the fund, but previously it has said it would invest up to $45 billion over five years. Softbank is investing $28 billion. The new fund said it would seek to buy minority and majority interests in both private and public companies, from emerging businesses to established, multi-billion-dollar firms. It expects to obtain preferred access to long-term investment opportunities worth $100 million or more. Other sectors in which the fund may invest include mobile computing, communications infrastructure, computational biology, consumer internet businesses and financial technology. The fund aims for $100 billion of committed capital and expects to complete its money-raising in six months, it added. #Abu dhabi#Apple#Artificial intelligence#Donald trump#Foreign technology#Foxconn technology#Information revolution#Masayoshi son#Mubadala investment#Newstracker#Private equity fund#Public investment fund#Qualcome#Robotics#Saudi arabia#Sharp corp#Softbank#Tech fund Published Date: May 22, 2017 08:27 am | Updated Date: May 22, 2017 08:27 am Also See On Saudi Arabia visit, Donald Trump to ask Muslim world leaders to 'sign a pledge' to make extremism illegal On his maiden overseas trip Donald Trump aims to 'unite civilised world against terrorism' Donald Trump participates in Saudi Arabia's ceremonial sword dance 'ardah' T20 LEAGUE SCHEDULE Match Date Details Full Schedule Top Stories IPL 2017: Mumbai Indians held their nerves when it mattered to finally beat RPS and clinch third title Restaurant-made Idlis Expose Yeddyurappa's Gimmick at Dalit House Mercury on the rise in Kashmir and near LoC: Army gears up to stop militant infiltration during summer GST rate: Common man to benefit but why on earth is cinema clubbed with gambling?

Annie Wermiel MORE FROM: Jennifer Gould Keil Hamptons hotspot to get an Italian makeover Geraldo moving to Ohio — and leaving his UES apartment behind Jaime Lannister has a Tribeca photo shoot Top Elliman broker selling posh West Village pad Meet the Hamptons' highest sale of the year — so far Imagine your kid getting a taste of fine dining at top restaurants like Agern, Jean Georges, the Modern and Zuma. No chicken fingers allowed — and no parents, either. That’s the vision-made-real of Claus Meyer, co-founder of Copenhagen’s world-famous Noma restaurant, whose Kid’s Table project is gearing up for its second annual run in the Big Apple next month. For one day a year, Kid’s Table gives kids aged 7 to 14 the chance to experience fine dining with their peers — for a reasonable cost of $35 per child. “New York City’s eating scene is a little bit adult-centric. Imagine if together we could change it?” Meyer tells Side Dish. Meyer — whose Noma, famed for transforming foraged Nordic fare into fine cuisine, was designated the world’s best restaurant four times before it closed earlier this year — also launched Kid’s Table in 2011 in Denmark, where it sells out within hours. Meyer, a Danish TV personality, is also co-owner of multiple restaurants in Denmark including Radio, which has one Michelin star. This is Kid’s Table’s second year in New York, where Meyer is launching his own empire, from Agern and the Great Northern Food Hall in Grand Central Station to Meyers Bageri in Williamsburg. He also has over the top buzz for Aska, the two-Michelin-starred eatery with Chef Fredrik Berselius and Restaurant Norman, with Berselius, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, which also has a cafe, bakery and bar. “Loris Malaguzzi [the childhood expert] once said that children are born with 100 languages, but we deprive them of 99. Our kids have the capacity to heal the broken food systems. It just won’t happen if they grow up on fast food,” said Meyer, known as the father of New Nordic Cuisine. “This current generation of kids could be the first in history to teach their parents how to cook. I want to grow old knowing that I did what I could to make that happen.” This year, the event is on June 8, from 4 pm to 5:30 pm. Chefs will create three-course menus using three pre-selected ingredients: asparagus, guinea hen and strawberry. The money goes to Meyer’s charity, Melting Pot Foundation, which has a project in Bolivia, and will also operate the new Brownsville Community Culinary Center in East New York, and charities chosen by the other participating restaurants, which this year include Blue Hill, Lilia, Perry Street, and Rebelle. While Per Se participated last year, it is not on this year’s list. Parents sign their kids in and are asked to wait outside the restaurants. Ticket sales launch Monday.

This guide will help you create your own iPhone ringtones and alerts for free. Apple makes it easy to buy a collection of ringtones and alerts, but if you prefer to make your own ringers and text alerts from movie clips and music, you can do so pretty easily. We’ll assume you have iTunes 10.5 and iOS 5 installed on your computer and on your iPhone. These new ringers can be set to alert you to new calls, texts and other iPhone sounds. How To Create Custom Ringtones and Alerts for the iPhone Find the song or audio clip you want to use. This needs to be a DRM free file. You can use DRM free songs you purchase on iTunes, movie clips you find online and even those you create with your voice. 1. Open up iTunes 2. Find your Song, in this example “santascoming” 3. Right click on it and click on Get Info Click on Get Info to start making a iPhone Alert Tone 4, Click on Options 5. Set the time of your clip. The clip can be no longer than 30 seconds. Choose the length of your iPhone Ringtone 6. Click OK 7. Right click on your song and choose Create ACC version. This makes a shortened version of the clip. Convert your shortened clip to AAC 8. Right click on the new ACC file and choose Show in Finder or Show in Windows Explorer. Rename your iPhone ringtone to .m4r. 9. Copy the file to your Desktop 10. Rename the file, changing the file extension to .m4r Change the file type so iTunes knows this is a ringtone. 11.When prompted, click Use .m4r 12. Remove your converted ACC file from iTunes. (Right Click -> Delete) 13. Double click on the new .m4r file and iTunes will add it as a ringtone. Once you have a Ringtone, iTunes will add this menu. 14. Sync your iPhone with iTunes and make sure you are syncing Ringtones in your iPhone Sync settings. 15. Assign the ringtone or alert in the Settings -> Sounds section of your iPhone. How to choose your new iPhone ringtone. Enjoy your new alerts. Make sure you keep your text alerts short and sweet, otherwise you’ll find yourself back at it in a few days. Even the 9 second clip I created is long for a text alert. If you are on a Mac, you can also create free iPhone ringtones and alerts in Garageband. 120 Responses 10/27/2011 s2c Reply do these same instructions apply for the iPHONE 4G? 03/07/2012 Gottabemobile Reply iPhone 4G doesn’t exist 08/28/2012 BananaCow Reply Although that’s not the specific name, it is the iPhone 4G (4th Generation) 09/26/2012 Slyo Rolan Reply Just wondering iPhone 4G 10/28/2011 Daaneyal Khan Reply I’ve done the above, as I have been doing for year with the previous versions of itunes. For some reason when I double click on the m4r file it doesnt go in to my ringtones folder and I cant seem to add it in there either :( 10/30/2011 Anonymous Reply Have you tried to drag and drop it into iTunes from your desktop? 11/01/2011 Scattered Frog Reply I’m having the same problem as Daaneyal. Specifically, iTunes will only add the m4r as a SONG, even though it says “Ringtone” next to “Kind” in the Summary. Since upgrading to the latest iTunes, creating custom ringtones has been impossible. 11/02/2011 Kobus Strydom Reply Works fine for my iphone 4G on latest itunes. Did you enable sync of ringtones? 01/04/2012 DeniseFelisha Reply how do you enable sync ringtones 01/07/2012 Maytheende Reply When you have your iPhone connected to iTunes, click it. Then you’ll find some tabs. Click on Tones tab, you’ll find sync setting, for all tones or selected. 08/05/2012 bd noir bro u r awesome .. love u… it’s work………. 11/04/2011 Kevin Howe Reply Hi, I have followed all the instructions, managed to sort of get there but its not coming up in my settings on the phone. When i plug the phone into itunes it registers that i have a ringtone but its not in settings??? iphone 4s. 11/22/2011 Mohammed Fuad Reply click at your iphone at the iTunes, then select ringtones tab so there you can select your desired ringtone 03/03/2012 Davross Reply For anyone not seeing the ringtones on their iPhone after converting: don’t use spaces in the ringtones name.  It will appear correctly then.  Good luck. 03/05/2012 Srinibas322 Reply Thanks for your reply. I was scratching my head all the long what’s going wrong. Once I removed the space, it appeared on iPhone4 with iOS 5. 07/27/2012 sanjay Reply i spent full two night just due to the space in ringtone name, finally i got ur valuable tip. Thank u so much 11/07/2011 Miu Reply How come there’s no ‘Ringtones’ in my Library? 04/03/2012 Melfucious Reply  Ringtones or “Tones” as it appears in the Sync page, did not appear for me until I got some ringtones added to the itunes. 11/30/2011 Jefferson5436 Reply ISSUE: I followed all of these steps and I am still not hearing the custom tone when I receive messages. When I get to your step15 (Settings>Sounds>Text Tone) I see 2 categories of tones on my phone: alert tones and ringtones (it’s my understanding that both ringtones and alert tones have the same extension (.m4r)). My custom alert tones that I created following your steps DO APPEAR, but under ringtones. If I select a custom tone I created from within “Settings,” under the ringtones category, I can hear it play and see a check mark by it. But then whenever I receive texts I still only hear the tri-tone alert (even though there is not a check mark next to tri-tone). Note: all of the custom tones I created (8 tones in total) are between 3 and 10 seconds long, and the issue is the same if I were to check any one of them. What is going on and how can this be fixed so I can hear these custom tone when I actually receive texts? Thank you Spec notes: This is an iPhone 3gs and I just updated to iOS-5. Also, my longer custom RINGTONES are about 30 seconds long and those work fine when I receive incoming calls, I have just not been able to hear the custom text alerts. 12/11/2011 Yimechen Reply You need to go to Sound-> Text Tone and select your custom text tone under Ringtones and that should do it. It’s a bit confusing that you should set your tone under Ringtones for your Alerts. 03/11/2012 Aneurysn Reply Had the same problem, this was such an easy solution. Thanks so much! 12/02/2011 S.M. Reply Hey, I have tried to make my custom ringtones for my new iphone4s and I get up to number 10 where I rename with a .m4r after that it is shot to hell nothing, It does not ask me if I want to convert or anything, what am I doing wrong?  s.m. 01/16/2012 Arghmiester Reply I cannot convert it as well… I rename it and it says as a m4a 02/10/2012 Brokent69 Reply Then rename m4a to m4r. double click on file and it imports into itunes in the tones folder. 01/23/2012 Ziz Reply I also can’t get it to change to m4r. What am I missing? The name changes but the extension stays the same. 02/22/2012 Alexandra Irava Reply you cam download a program that converts m4a to m4r from:  http://www.mp3tom4r.net/download/as-iphone-ringtone-maker-428237.exe you will need a serial from: http://syrian-cracker.blogspot.com/2011/06/aiseesoft-iphone-4-ringtone-maker-v3326.html  folow the instruction and the ringtones are ready to be played :-)) 05/17/2013 Bri Reply If you’re using Windows, go to Start>Control Panel>Appearance and Personalization. Click Folder Options. Click on the “View” tab. Uncheck “Hide extensions for known file types.” Click OK. Now you can go back to your desktop and it will let you change it to a .m4r. 12/02/2011 Gelly Reply i managed to sync the ringtone, but it doesnt show up in my settings>sounds ? any suggestions? 12/07/2011 fizzeh Reply I have the same problem as Gelly, I’ve had this problem for some time now, I get to the settings>sounds part an the tone isn’t there. Am I doing something wrong? 12/08/2011 Xmagoon Reply I cant set them as text tones either. no matter how long they are. the ringtones work great though 12/12/2011 Mikasamc Reply i have the same problem.. my custom ringtones work fine under the ringtone category.. but when i get to the text tone part.. i can’t see any of my customed tones.. 12/10/2011 mtbdude Reply I don’t get the Create AAC Version option from iTunes after I make the clip.  Running Windows iTunes v. 10.5.1.4.2. 12/10/2011 D. Reply I had the same problem. I was getting “Create MP3”. Go to your preferences > general > “import settings” next ti When I import a CD > change “MP3 encoder” to “ACC encoder” and now you’ll get Create ACC version.

Works great after one try. Simple and easy instructions 12/15/2011 Randi Judge Reply Thank you so much! Great to know I chose to get an iPhone just in time. I don’t think I could have handled not having custom alert tones. xD 12/17/2011 Babyboo_e16 Reply I have done everything correctly but i don’t see the “Ringtone” icon on iTunes. I just see “Tones” 01/04/2012 DeniseFelisha Reply I have the same problem i can’t seem to get the ringtone onto my phone, it wont sync, is there something that i’m not doing correctly, maybe change the setting of the ringtones on the fone because it does not give me the option on itunes 01/08/2012 felinelovee Reply i cant either im soo disapointed in it maybe i am blonde after all grrrrr 04/03/2012 Melfucious Reply  I’m blond and I had no problem at all… haha 04/03/2012 Melfucious Reply  ….how would we know if you’re doing something incorrectly…we’re not there…and you haven’t said everything you did… ?? 04/03/2012 Melfucious Reply  Tones is it. 12/18/2011 Backlitcanopy Reply I have the same issue as Jefferson5436.  I can set these ringtones as text tones, but do not hear them unless I’m currently using the messages app. It doesn’t give me any sound at all.   If I set a normal text tone, it plays fine when the screen is off, if I’m in the homescreen, or if I’m using another app.  Is there maybe another filename we can change it to besides m4r. ? 01/07/2012 Maytheende Reply I have the same problem. I have successfully created the ringtone, with less than 30 secs. But it won’t sync to the iPhone. I use 3Gs, btw. Please help. I have no problem when I was still using iOS 4.3.5. Thanks in advance. 01/21/2012 Mima Reply SSH peopleeee 01/07/2012 Maytheende Reply I finally can sync the song. It has 12 secs length. 01/07/2012 Maytheende Reply It seems that you have to create a ringtone less than 20 secs. 01/08/2012 Ahnyung91 Reply I followed your instructions and everything worked perfectly. However it seems that the quality of the tone has been sharply degraded compared to the original mp3 file. Is there any way to retain some quality? I found that the bass is severely lacking and the overall sound is “tinny”. Thanks 01/23/2012 Archana Tank Reply it worked perfect!!! thanks a ton :) 01/24/2012 Gaulty1969 Reply How do I copy the file to desktop ? 04/03/2012 Melfucious Reply  I’m assuming you got your question answered by now, but if not… just highlight the file and drag it to your desktop.  what is better, so you don’t clutter your desktop, is create a folder, then drag it into there.  01/24/2012 Pugly1 Reply i have added the ringtone in itunes but when i try to get the ringtone into ringtone sounds on the phone i cannot.  when i click on iphone when in itunes there are no tabs as you say that say tone or ringtone anywere.  where is the tab to sync the ringtone?  i have the ringtone on my phone  but not in ringtone sounds? 01/25/2012 HaremGrrrl Reply Hi!

Thanks and good luck to the rest of you :-) 05/22/2012 SLS Reply Hi, I do not have a “Tones” tab on Itunes on my PC. I have converted the file to an .m4r. How do I create a Tones tab on Itunes?

Probably just a little different on every itunes version. But if you don’t find your newly created ringtones/ alert tones on your iphone, I suggest you adjust the time. Refer to Step 5 again, it should not be longer than 30s. When I adjusted the time, it worked just fine on my iPhone 4s. For text tone, not longer than 3s, i guess. 02/19/2012 Eperre01 Reply this website fill fix the cant convert to m4r from m4a on windows…. http://gnoud.blogspot.com/ 10/09/2012 Peter Kärredal Reply This was My problem and solved solution at the blog, Windows doesn’t Change file extension until the ext is shown for known filetypes. 02/21/2012 Dd Reply make sure you clear out all meta info from the song. this works  02/21/2012 Jeremykting Reply got it to work with both ringtones and texts.  the hiccups were converting the file extensions rather than just renaming the files and syncing the ring tones themselves to the phone through the TONE tab. question though.  when i play my regular songs that i turned into ringtones…the 30 second ringtone conversion supersedes the song so it only plays the segmented clip.  anyone know how to get past this? 02/24/2012 HopeThisHelps Reply When you’re in the GET INFO/OPTIONS window setting your time, there is a selection below the time entry boxes that says “Skip when shuffling” 02/24/2012 NgatiBoy Reply This worked perfect for me (original posting) So following the walk thru steps works as well.  02/24/2012 HopeThisHelps Reply excellent, except double click on .m4r file didn’t automatically do anything, so I drag/dropped the file over LIBRARY on left and it loaded it as ringtone. Then i clicked lower down the list under DEVICES to see it’s listed there too. Then sync phone by clicking on Myname iPhone just below DEVICES, look up at the top of the window to make sure TONES is selected, then choose ALL or SELECTED per your preference. (by the way, on my version it doesn’t list the word RINGTONES, just a bell icon next to TONES in the left nav for both LIBRARY and DEVICES/Myname’s iPhone) 02/25/2012 A tip Reply I had the same problem as a lot of people, when I double clicked on the .m4r file nothing happened. I tried to drag it into iTunes and still nothing… What worked for me was after changing the copy of the file to .m4r, delete the AAC version in iTunes (as instructed). Then before double clicking on the .m4r file, close iTunes down. Then double click on the .m4r file and you should see the file in the “Tones” portion of the library. It worked for me, hope that helps 02/29/2012 Boo BOo Reply I appreciate your easy step by step instructions. I’m usually pretty good with following directions, but for some reason my iphone 4s won’t allow me to sync my ringtones and when I keep trying I get a message saying the song doesn’t exist. What on earth am I doing wrong??? Please, anyone that may be able to assist me with an easy way of getting my ringtones. Tx! 03/09/2012 Christina Reply I have followed all of the instructions and my ringtone appears in my call ringtones, but not my text ringtones. How can I fix this? 03/20/2012 Steve Reply Im running widows 7 im having a problem with changing the file format through renaming how would i fix this 03/20/2012 Jonathan Reply Hi, I followed the steps and everything seemed to work out fine. I assigned one of my new tones to my “text tones” and it everything worked well for about 24 hours. Now when I receive a text the screen lights up but no sound. So I experimented and assigned another custom tone to my text messages and when I receive a text it works. The tone that does not work plays sounds when selected and it even plays when I set the tone to alert me for emails and other alerts. Just not text. I deleted it, did the entire process again and nothing changed. Thinking that the song is corrupt I made a tone using a random piece of the song and it actually worked. Now I am just plain confused. Please help, thank you.  03/23/2012 Jnorman1986 Reply Does this work with iPhone 4s, iOS 5.1, iTunes 10.5??? 03/25/2012 Ziggy Reply No it doesnt work. Apple likes you to buy your ringtones. Only jb iPhones can use custom ringtones 04/06/2012 VelvetFog09 Reply Make sure the file name of your ringtone isn’t overly long. I created a custom one that initially didn’t appear after syncing even though I saw the Ringtone playlist added in iTunes. Saw someone mention you can’t have spaces in the file name, and though perhaps it goes the same with the number of characters you use. After shortening the name and re-syncing I now see the ringtone. Btw mine isn’t jailbroken. 03/27/2012 Christina Lau ♔ Reply This works wonders. Thank you so so much! You saved my life from dying with default ringtones. 03/29/2012 Robbie Reply It is showing all of my custom ringtones in my ringtones folder but only shows a few of them in my settings that i can use for alerts????? 04/06/2012 VelvetFog09 Reply Reminder folks, this process works just fine. If you don’t see the tone you created after syncing check if you either have spaces in the name of the tone you created, or if there are too many characters (long file name). Try shortening it to approx no more than 10 characters, though I’m unsure what the limit is but apparently there is one of some sort. Hope this helps. 04/06/2012 David Salgado Reply Sweet! thank you! 04/07/2012 twimagination.com Reply Just upload your audio file to http://www.Ringer.org and cut it yourself there. 04/18/2012 Esther Reply Trying to convert track and won’t save shortened version.  No + next to price on iTunes.  This method has always been ok with other tracks.  What is going wrong? 05/18/2012 ishwor Reply try iRinger, the best one out there, freeware, easy to create, cuts only 30 secs as required……… http://iringer.en.softonic.com/ 05/22/2012 SLS Reply I was able to sync the .m4r file but it does not show up under the “sounds’ settings.

Do I need tech help or is there an easy fix that I’m missing? 11/15/2012 Dee Reply Have just got iPhone 5…first time iPhone user…and can’t believe how STUPID and ANTIQUATED Apple design is with regard to being able to use your own ringtones and text alert tones! On my old Blackberry phones, you simply downloaded your music, clicked on the tone and selected ‘Set as Ringtone’ or Set as Text Alert Tone’. APPLE YOU ARE A BUNCH OF PRATS to make this so impossible and frustrating for your users, whats your problem. Long winded process to create your own ringtone (which I have managed to do, but the time it took was ridiculously slow and unbelievable compared to your competitors), and as to NOT being able to create my own Text Alert Tones, really angry and not impressed. Your own alert tones are CRAP! Do not suit me at all, and I’m totally hacked off that I’m stuck with your stupid system! If I’d known this before I would probably NOT have got an iphone!!!!!!

Appleton Police, responding to reports of a shooting inside a bar, arrived at the Apple Pub just after 1:30 Sunday morning. One of the officers encountered a man with the gun and fired his weapon at the man. The suspect was taken to an area hospital, where he died. Two other men inside the business were transported to local hospitals with non-life threatening injuries. Appleton Police Chief Todd Thomas said during a news conference Sunday afternoon that one of the men was struck in the arm by a bullet, while the other received a non-gunshot injury to his shoulder. Thomas said the incident at the bar began as a dispute between two men, one of which pulled out a gun and fired at least one round at the other man. Appleton Police say that all individuals associated with this incident are accounted for and that there is no active threat to the community. The Green Bay Police Department is helping with the investigation, due to the shooting being officer-involved. Affiliate WTAQ contributed to this report.

When people mention horror, they may think of Alfred Hitchcock or Stephen King. Now we have Antwon Rollins, a Black man, whose mind is immersed in writing and shooting horror, but who is able to tell stories from a slightly different perspective: a common Black perspective. “#Victim 505” is a very heady, cerebral and artsy horror movie that gets straight down to business. Check out “#Victim 505” at the San Francisco Black Film Fest, as well as check out the filmmaker Antwon Rollins as he talks to us about filmmaking and “#Victim 505.” M.O.I. JR: What made you want to get into filmmaking? When? Antwon Rollins: Filmmaking for me started when I was a kid constantly touching the camera as my father recorded my brother taking batting practice. I always wanted to put the camera in my hand and move it around, but at that time moving the camera wasn’t important. Watching my father spending hours making baseball practice highlights was – using two VCRs, one for playback and the other for recording! Over two decades later, I found myself picking up the camera to do a commercial for Alameda College. At the time, I did not know that I will be finding my new career and filmmaking. The show never went according to plan and I found myself stuck with the footage and nothing to edit on; luckily a friend of mine had an Apple book computer and Final Cut program. I was forced to edit the project and shoot the project by myself. I knew then that it was time for me to get back into filmmaking. M.O.I. JR: How did you come up with the concept for “#Victim 505”? How did you conceive the characters? Antwon Rollins: The way I came up with “#Victim 505” was adapted from the true story of mine. As a young person, I witnessed many relationships being torn apart. I’ve witnessed people in my family – their marriages being torn apart. Growing up in a large apartment complex, young people see things I shouldn’t see, like people fighting with their spouse, their spouse hanging with other people in the neighborhood that you know they shouldn’t be hanging around, seeing people being players. But you also seen the repercussions from people being getting killed, people going over to smoking drugs to overcome their pain, people drinking alcohol to forget about what happened. The way I came up with “#Victim 505” was adapted from the true story of mine. As a young person, I witnessed many relationships being torn apart. So years later I decided what if there was a monster that stopped people from cheating. So I came up with it and 505 and over-exaggerated everything. The way I came up with the characters were quite interesting. Mr. McBride is bipolar and schizophrenic. I needed to come up with several characters that represented his multiple personalities. M.O.I. JR: What is it that you like about horror films? Antwon Rollins: The reason why I like horror movies is because it gives you a glimpse into the animalistic nature that people have. It actually shows you the extremes that people will go through, for their personal survival. The rituals that people will perform, the sacrifices that people would do. To watch a fictional horror movie and the way a director executes the craft is always fascinating too. The reason why I like horror movies is because it gives you a glimpse into the animalistic nature that people have. M.O.I. JR: How long did this project take from start to finish? Who did your casting? Antwon Rollins: This was originally a one-hour-long silent short film and was an adaptation of the 130-page script. The project probably took approximately two years to make. The longest part of the project was making a new set from the same world as if he was in the same space! Antwon Rollins I initially cut down the movie to 35 minutes. It still wasn’t exciting enough for us, so I decided to make it nine minutes so I can get straight to the action, straight to the monster, and create a shock effect on the audience! The casting was done by Thomas Carter. Thomas Carter was also the assistant director and a producer on the project. I decided to make it nine minutes so I can get straight to the action, straight to the monster, and create a shock effect on the audience! M.O.I. JR: Which filmmakers are you inspired by? Antwon Rollins: My favorite movie directors that inspire me are Alfred Hitchcock, Guy Ritchie, F. Gary Gray and Tyler Perry; however, I seem to find myself loving the edits more than the movie! Watching a lot of foreign films and seeing how they’re edited, how they’re cut – with a lot of boldness and camera angles – is what influences me the most. M.O.I. JR: What do you want people to get out of this film? Antwon Rollins: When people watch this film, I would like for them to appreciate the set designs – and the unique and original characters will hopefully interest them. We plan to make movies for each character. M.O.I. JR: Are you working on any feature length horror pieces? Antwon Rollins: We are currently working on “Cursed Sabbath Massacre: Mr. Mcbride’s Revenge.” The script is complete and is currently seeking funding. There are several sci-fi short films we are working on and also several horror short films. M.O.I. JR: Where and how did you learn how to use make-up and audio effects? Antwon Rollins: I actually learned how to use make up from YouTube, watching tutorials and seeing what worked and what didn’t. From there, I passed it along to a makeup artist, and we worked together on it and hopefully came up with something worth looking at. M.O.I. JR: How did you feel being accepted into the San Francisco Film Fest? Filmmaking is Antwon Rollins’ second career after years in professional baseball. Antwon Rollins: Being accepted to this film festival is an honor and happens to be in the same city I discovered my talents, while walking the streets of San Francisco! I was transitioning from professional sports to the real world, and as I was roaming the streets of San Francisco I came across a childhood friend who was doing a commercial for his senior project at the Academy of Art! This same freeing is the reason why I’m into film today! So to be a part of this festival, to me, is truly a dream come true, a vision coming forth! M.O.I. JR: How could people stay in touch with your work?

The Ashland Police Department teamed up with Ashland Fire & Rescue to launch on May 11 a new mobile application titled “Ashland Oregon Police,” designed to connect the city’s emergency service providers with members of the community through their smartphones. The free app, available for IOS (Apple), Android and Windows devices, allows APD and Ashland Fire & Rescue to send customizable push alerts regarding critical events and safety concerns to those who have the app. The line of communication goes both ways, too, as users can use the app to notify the city about non-emergency issues such as lost and found items and abandoned vehicles. Users can also pass along photos and use a geo-tagging feature. “Right now we can do that through a news release, but that’s dependent on the media picking it up,” Ashland police Chief Tighe O’Meara said. “And we can do it through Facebook, but that’s dependent on people looking at their Facebook page and wandering over to the APD Facebook page. And we can do it through Everbridge (Notification), but Everbridge is a really big system that is a very good tool but it’s not the exact right tool for this. And this seems like a really good way for us to push emergency notifications out to people immediately so that they can be updated to critical incidents in real time.” O’Meara said he learned about the app while attending a chiefs conference in Bend a few weeks ago. A vendor for a company named LogicTreeIT Solutions which, according to its website, builds mobile apps for law enforcement, schools, youth groups and business and community organizations, was on hand to push this product. O’Meara was impressed with the application’s capabilities and talked to a few other chiefs who already use it. All “raved” about how effective it was, so O’Meara decided to subscribe. The subscription fee is usually $2,000 a year plus a $500 setup fee, O’Meara said, but since he signed up at the conference Ashland received a discount — it cost the city $1,860 for the first year and the setup fee was waived. “Everybody had really positive experience with this application,” O’Meara said. “It’s all the same basic application, but each agency can customize it the way that they want to. We just put our logo on it, our contact information, we customize the buttons any way we want to. So it’s all the same basic platform, but each department makes it uniquely theirs. Everybody that I talked to that’s used it just raved about it and said it’s a really good tool, especially in emergency situations.” Only days after its rollout, the app was already put to use when a user used Ashland Oregon Police to report that the Alice Peil walkway near the Plaza had been tagged with graffiti. The report, which included a photo, went straight to APD’s graffiti abatement officer. “The other really neat feature about this is if we push an emergency notification out through the app, it auto populates our Facebook page, which in turn auto populates our web page,” O’Meara added. “So this really casts a really wide net when we’re trying to get the word out on critical situations.” The app is straightforward and easy to navigate. Its home page features an Ashland Police and Fire logo, under which is a horizontal scroll bar with nine tabs: Call, Welcome, AFR, Inform us, Notifications, Traffic Alert, Bulletins, Gallery and Directions. O’Meara said updates such as notifications and traffic alerts will be handled by himself and his managerial staff when they decide an update is necessary. Hypothetically, he said, APD could send out a notification that a robbery has just occurred and drop a picture of the suspect in the gallery. The app has also been customized to send reports from the public to the correct agency depending on what they’re reporting. Clicking on the “Inform us” tab, for instance, opens up a submenu of options that includes “Code Compliance,” and if you click on that one your message will be emailed directly to Ashland’s code compliance officer. “Even though the PD are the ones that decided to go down this path, we also decided that there was a lot more that could be done here than just a police offering so we partnered with Ashland Fire & Rescue to make it a public safety offering,” O’Meara said. “And the platform’s robust enough that we’re even able to bring in several other city departments to really make it a way for the community to stay in touch with the city in general and get information to the various city departments.” O’Meara stressed, however, that Ashland Oregon Police is not a substitute for 911. “It’s to report that abandoned vehicle that’s been in front of your house for a week, or that problem with the parks equipment, or the pothole on your street that you want to get fixed,” he said. “Those longstanding problems that don’t need an immediate response. It’s a good way for citizens to get that information to the right city representative.” Joe Zavala is a reporter for the Ashland Daily Tidings. Reach him at 541-821-0829 or jzavala@dailytidings.com.

Masayoshi Son, the SoftBank founder and the Saudi Arabian government announced the world's largest investment vehicle over the weekend timing it with the US President Donald Trump's visit to the Riyadh. The Saudi kingdom's Public Investment Fund will put $45 billion while SoftBank's committing $28 billion, with rest of the sponsors including Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Development Co, tech majors Apple, Foxconn, Qualcomm and Sharp chipping in the rest of the amount. The final close of the fund at $100 billion is slated for end of the year, a statement. The largest backer of Indian tech startups over the past few years, having ploughed $3.5 billion here, SoftBank is likely to make most of ts $100 million and bigger investments in India via this fund including the proposed investment in Flipkart which will come through after the sale of Snapdeal. The SoftBank Vision Fund (SVF) investment committee presently comprises Son and India-born Rajeev Misra who was designated as the chief executive officer of SVF last year, but will add more members going forward. Both new and follow-on investments at $100 million or more will be routed through the fund. In fact, a few of SoftBank's existing investments like Intelsat, SoFi and the group's stake in British chipmaker ARM may be acquired by SVF. The $28 billion that Softbank has committed as limited partner in SVF includes $8.2 billion of value ascribed to the 25% stake it holds in ARM. What's interesting is that ride-hailing startups like India's Ola, where SoftBank is a significant investor, may not get capital from the Vision Fund, some reports indicated due to a conflicts of interest between the two parties. Just last year, Uber picked up $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabia's PIF, the kingdom's main investment fund while SoftBank has backed Chinese cab hailing giant Didi Chuxing and Southeast Asia's Grab besides Ola. Digital payments firm Paytm which roped in Softbank in a $1.4 billion financing round too did not get the capital from SVF. Which means SoftBank group will continue to invest from its balance sheet in such cases, people familiar with the matter said on a case to case basis. SoftBank's other portfolio companies in India include hotel booking platform Oyo Rooms and e-grocer Grofers besides the beleaguered online retailer Snapdeal which is in the last leg of being sold to Flipkart. SoftBank may hire an India manager to look after all it's investments, sources said. In a prepared statement Son, said: "Technology has the potential to address the biggest challenges and risks facing humanity today. The businesses working to solve these problems will require patient long-term capital and visionary strategic investment partners with the resources to nurture their success. The SoftBank Vision Fund is consistent with this strategy and will help build and grow businesses creating the foundational platforms of the next stage of the Information revolution." SVP will back technologies like Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, robotics among others to help create Son's SoftBank 2.0 vision, something he had drawn up in 2014 to make the Japanese group more global in its presence. Headquartered in London, the fund will look to make both private and public market investments starting from $100 million upwards. In January, we had reported that the fund will scout for ventures beyond e-commerce and ride-hailing sectors here and may look at opportunities in public markets along with consumer sectors like telecoms and financial services.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Hackers are trying to bring the WannaCry ransomware back from the dead Yoni Heisler BGR News May 20, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share A little more than a week ago, a particularly nasty piece of ransomware dubbed “WannaCry” began spreading at an impressive clip all across the globe. Targeting Windows machines — and based off of a leaked NSA exploit — impacted users found that all of their computer files had been encrypted and could only be recovered by making a $300 payment in Bitcoin. With the ransomware showing no signs of slowing down, an enterprising researcher named Marcus Hutchins managed to effectively stop WannaCry dead in its tracks by inadvertently enabling a kill-switch. As we noted last week, WannaCry at the point of infection attempts to communicate with a domain name consisting of a long string of nonsensical characters. If the domain is registered, WannaCry will stop spreading. If the domain is not registered, WannaCry will go on about its havoc-wreaking business. Don't Miss: You won’t have to wait until November to buy Apple’s next-gen iPhone 8 After taking a look at the WannaCry code, Hutchins spotted an odd-looking domain name and out of mere curiosity registered it, having no idea at the time that he was enabling the ransomware’s kill-switch. Without question, Hutchins’ action here helped stopped the malware from spreading even wider, but not before it managed to infect more than 300,000 computers across the globe. Interestingly enough, security researchers now claim that there’s a clever and concerted campaign  to bring the malware back from the dead. The strategy? Taking the kill-switch domain off-line by any means necessary. According to a report from Wired, botnets are now being mobilized to launch a DDoS attack against the kill-switch domain. Now a few devious hackers appear to be trying to combine those two internet plagues: They’re using their own copycats of the Mirai botnet to attack WannaCry’s kill-switch. So far, researchers have managed to fight off the attacks. But in the unlikely event that the hackers succeed, the ransomware could once again start spreading unabated. … If the DDoS assault did succeed, not all WannaCry infections would immediately reignite. The ransomware stops scanning for new victims 24 hours after installing itself on a computer, says Matt Olney, a security researcher with Cisco’s Talos team. But anytime one of those infected machines reboots, it starts scanning again. “The ones that were successfully encrypted are in this zombie state, where they’re waiting to be reactivated if that domain goes away,” says Olney. At this point, there’s no way of knowing if the folks behind WannaCry are the ones trying to resurrect the malware. Some security researchers, though, believe that the new botnet campaign is actually being carried out by folks looking to have a bit of ill-advised fun at the expense of innocent users.

The event is set to introduce the opportunities of the RTPark program to business leaders and key members of the Caribbean Diaspora in New York and highlight the many advantages to doing business with the RTPark program and the US Virgin Islands. The UVI RTPark program, established in 2002, is a specialist economic development agency that aims to successfully establish the U.S. Virgin Islands as a premier business destination of choice for firms in knowledge and technology intensive sectors. It gives many qualified entrepreneurs and business owners an opportunity to #WorkFromTheBeach by benefiting from generous tax incentives while they enjoy the lifestyle of an island paradise. Investment projects that are focused on quality are screened for their likelihood of fit in the RTPark program. The priority sectors include bio-medical devices, personalized medicine applications, wellness and healthcare management, energy research and systems, including renewable and clean technology, energy efficiency, energy management and sustainability solutions, as well as firms that will draw on advances in marine science. The RTPark has also had success in attracting Internet advertising firms, technology-mediated entertainment companies and advanced logistics and supply-chain management firms and recently welcomed Intellectual Global Concepts LLC and Anvil 1 LLC as clients. "The RT Park program is at a very exciting stage. Ten years after our first client, we have fine-tuned the application process and now offer impact investors a unique opportunity and have drawn twenty new companies to the Virgin Islands since 2015," said RTPark executive director Dr. Gillian Marcelle. "Our recent clients are involved in projects that build the pipeline of skills in the US Virgin Islands and bring new ways of doing business to the Territory while the owners of these businesses enjoy living in an island Paradise." The RTPark program is headquartered in a US $13 million, LEED certified green two-storey, 18,000 square foot building near the main entrance of the University of the Virgin Islands, Albert A. Sheen campus just off of the Queen Mary highway, in St. Croix.

SoftBank’s massive Vision Fund raises $93 billion in its first close Posted yesterday by Jon Russell (@jonrussell) 0 SHARES Next Story The bizarre naming trends that modern startups follow SoftBank’s huge $100 billion investment fund — the largest tech fund in history — announced its first close today… and it’s huge. The Japanese telecom giant revealed that its VisionFund has closed an initial commitment of $93 billion from a bevy of high profile backers. They include Apple, Qualcomm, UAE-based Mubadala Investment Company, Saudi Arabia’s PID public fund, Foxconn, and Foxconn-owned Sharp. The plan is for the fund to reach its $100 billion target within the next six months through commitments from other investors. The fund is committing to a minimum of $100 million deal checks, with a focus on both minority and majority deals with companies that are either private or public. That leaves plenty of scope to play in, but some color can be found in a statement from Son explaining that the fund aims to develop the next phase of the internet and connectivity worldwide: Technology has the potential to address the biggest challenges and risks facing humanity today. The businesses working to solve these problems will require patient long-term capital and visionary strategic investment partners with the resources to nurture their success,” Son said in a statement. SoftBank has long made bold investments in transformative technologies and supported disruptive entrepreneurs. The SoftBank Vision Fund is consistent with this strategy and will help build and grow businesses creating the foundational platforms of the next stage of the Information Revolution. In terms of specific areas, SoftBank said its areas of focus include internet-of-things, AI, robotics, infrastructure, telecoms, bio tech, fintech, mobile apps and more. Given the credentials of the companies backing it and its sheer size, the Vision Fund is unprecedented in tech venture capital and it’ll be truly interesting to watch how it is deployed. Well, we can already pick up some clues. The fund has been active, even before this first close. Recent deals include Indian fintech unicorn Paytm, virtual reality Improbable Worlds, China’s Uber killer Didi Chuxing, and global connectivity company OneWeb. Beyond that, there’s been a steady flow of unconfirmed investments linking the fund to companies like WeWork. The party is just getting started. The announcement of the fund was coordinated alongside U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to the Middle East, where two of the Vision Fund’s key backers are located. That builds on earlier ties with the White House. Back in December, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son met with Trump and pledged to invest $50 billion into the U.S. with the goal of creating 50,000 new jobs.

Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co, Apple Inc, Qualcomm Inc, Foxconn Technology Group and Sharp Corp are also investing, and SoftBank aims to reach US$100bil with a final close within six months. Mubadala committed US$15bil, according to a separate statement. The Vision Fund will allow the billionaire Son to cut even more ambitious deals than he’s been able to do with his highly leveraged company. He has used money from his domestic telecom operations to pay for investments in startups in China, India and the US and for acquisitions of larger companies such as UK chipmaker ARM Holdings Plc and US wireless operator Sprint Corp. Now he sees richer opportunities than ever before in areas like artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. “SoftBank has long made bold investments in transformative technologies and supported disruptive entrepreneurs,” Son said in the statement. “The SoftBank Vision Fund is consistent with this strategy and will help build and grow businesses creating the foundational platforms of the next stage of the Information Revolution.” Yasir Alrumayyan, managing director of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, said the fund will help his country’s strategy of developing “a diversified, knowledge-based economy”. Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak, chief executive officer of Mubadala, said the SoftBank fund “perfectly complements” the company’s strategy to become an investor in high-growth technology companies. Son has made tens of billions from investments in companies including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Yahoo! Inc and Supercell Oy, and the new fund will pursue a similar strategy of backing technology companies at all stages. The US will be a focus after Son met with President Donald Trump in December and pledged to create 50,000 new jobs by investing US$50bil in startups and new companies. That same month, Softbank contributed US$1bil to a funding round in OneWeb Ltd, a satellite startup based at Exploration Park, Florida. – Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Stocks , Earnings , Markets , Investing , Softbank , Suadi Arabia , tech , investment Related Stories Related Stories Unsung tech heroes carry S&P 500 Chinese tech investments spur huge returns for pint-sized ETF CSE targeting tech startups Tweets, TED and change through technology China’s LeEco plans to sell US$420mil Beijing real estate You May Be Interested KLCI climbs early Monday, Petronas stocks up, AAX in focus Malaysian palm oil/Viegoils: Market factors to watch Monday May 22 The evolution of mobile phones Coway promotes a healthy lifestyle When the CEO is your mentor 10 after work habits for personal success Others Also Read Google woos developers to catch Amazon in digital assistant race Conte claims wounded Arsenal are FA Cup favourites Nora finds strength in Nedim Property Related advertisement Latest News Japan April exports rise again, trade surplus with US narrows China tells US trade representative stronger cooperation needed Nazir Razak steps down from EPF panel HNA said in talks to buy stake in Hong Kong’s Value Partners Tune Protect optimistic on premium growth Most Viewed in Business Genting risks RM1bil write-off Nazir Razak steps down from EPF panel Magnum under pressure, falls to multi-year low of RM1.81 Loss-making Cathay Pacific makes biggest job cuts in 20 years Bitcoin options exchange raises US$11.4m in funding Petronas stocks, GentingM up at midday but Magnum under pressure KLCI climbs early Monday, Petronas stocks up, AAX in focus Tune Protect optimistic on premium growth TSR Capital enters MoU to develop high-end properties at PD Waterfront Scomi to ensure on the dot delivery of four-car trains advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)
