Before long, many manufacturers have looked unto Apple as their source of new product features. Now, a new report suggests that the Cupertino-based company is once again aiming to introduce the biggest changes for the upcoming iPhone 8. According to a report from financial analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple might introduce a new technology for the Touch ID feature of the iPhone. In the said report, Kuo detailed that the company aims to improve the fingerprint reading hardware for the much rumored iPhone 8. The improvements will focus on the new technology to be used by Apple in order to incorporate the sensor underneath the phone’s display panel. The report also suggests that Apple is looking into embedding the entire Touch ID sensor underneath the display panel. This, however, will require major design changes on the part of the display makers. Nevertheless, Apple can still push the technology ahead. Especially if it meant that it will bring necessary value to the iPhone 8. iPhone 7 Touch ID (via apple.com) In addition to the improved Touch ID sensor, Apple is also working on facial recognition for the iPhone 8. Although not entirely new, Kuo believes that Apple intends to complement fingerprint scanning with facial recognition on the iPhone 8. Kuo also mentioned that Apple might get rid of the Touch ID sensor in factor of facial recognition. However, this may take some time since development of such will need massive engineering design efforts. Before Apple could potentially replace fingerprint reading with facial recognition, it will need to implement new technologies to make sure that it is fool-proof. For one, the facial recognition feature should be able recognize a photo from a real person. Furthermore, the facial verification database would have to be optimized for faster processing. That being said, it could be that Touch ID will be here to stay, at least for the time being. The iPhone 8, as it stands, will gain new features on release. Whether these rumours hold any grain of truth or not, readers are still advised to take caution. For more updates on the iPhone 8, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

The current version available is iOS 10.2, with 10.3 under developer’s beta. As for the next release, it could be that the iOS 11 will get a September release just like the previously version. However, some rumors have started to circulate regarding upcoming features of the next mobile operating system from Apple. According to recent article from The Verifier, the next iOS release will feature heavily on social media applications like iMessage and Facetime. The report also mentioned that FaceTime will get the much awaited group video call feature. FaceTime Group Video Calls As it stands, the group video call is only available on macOS versions of FaceTime. iOS users have long been waiting for Apple to finally include that group video calls on the mobile platform. However, if the claims turn out to be true, it would seem that mobile users will finally get what they have been asking for. Current iOS 10 User Interface (via apple.com) More iOS improvements Another feature that users expect from iOS 11 is the addition of the “dark mode”. Ever since iOS 9, many users have longed to have the same feature that Android devices have been using for years. However, as the current display for the iPhone remains to be of LCD technology, having the said feature will not bring any energy savings at all. Nevertheless, the rumored switch to OLED display may finally make it possible for Apple to implement such theme. iOS 11 official unveiling Apple normally announces upcoming products during its Worldwide Developers Conference event. This year’s WWDC will be held some time in June. As expected, will focus on products like the iOS and desktop and laptop hardware. There is a very strong chance that Apple will officially announce the iOS 11 during the said event. As far as the report goes, the group video call for FaceTime is currently under development. However, Apple still has the last say on whether the new feature will be included on the iOS 11 release. For more updates in iOS 11, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 21 January, 2017 23:00 - - - - print email Comments It's easy to dismiss the speculation that Apple is working on smart glasses. It's hard to picture Apple selling smart glasses. But it's also hard to picture them not doing it. If smart glasses become a popular and mainstream consumer electronics category, Apple will almost be required to enter the market as a fiduciary responsibility to Apple shareholders. Consider the plight of poor Apple. Smartphone margins are shrinking. The tablet market is flabby. Smartwatches aren't panning out as a mainstream platform. Apple TV is still not going to bring in huge profits. So Apple has to adapt and keep up with the evolution of consumer technology to continue to dominate the market as well as secure its growth. Also, the choice of smartphone in the future may be dictated by the use of smart glasses. If mainstream smart glasses require an Android phone, Apple could lose market share. What's certain is that Apple is working on smart glasses. Bloomberg reported in November that Apple was thinking about entering the "digital glasses" market. That report was based on anonymous sources, who said Apple is considering glasses that would go on sale next year and "show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality." ODG ODG's R-8 smart glasses give you what looks like a 90-inch 3D screen that appears to float 10 feet in front of you. The glasses also have two 1080p cameras. Apple would never make anything like this. The Financial Times reported early last year that Apple was building a large team focused on augmented and virtual reality, and had poached employees from Microsoft and Lytro. Intriguingly, Apple has made some augmented reality-based company acquisitions. Apple bought PrimeSense, which makes the sensor technology in Microsoft's Kinect. They also nabbed augmented reality startups Metaio, Faceshift, Emotient and Flyby. AR-related patents by Apple go back a decade. And tech blogger and evangelist Robert Scoble posted a rumor on Facebook that Apple may be working with Carl Zeiss on smart glasses. (I told you about Carl Zeiss Smart Optics technology in this space a year ago.) All that planning, thinking and spending may pay off for Apple when smart glasses go mainstream. And when I say mainstream, I mean totally mainstream. What if nearly all glasses were smart glasses? The company that makes your glasses is getting 'smart' The signs of the mainstreaming of augmented and mixed reality are everywhere. The biggest one yet happened earlier this week when French lens giant Essilor merged with Italy's eyeglass behemoth Luxottica in a $53 billion deal that will result in the world's largest glasses company, to be called EssilorLuxottica. Wait, Essilor? Luxottica? These aren't exactly well-known companies in tech circles. Let me introduce you. Essilor is the world's largest maker of corrective lenses. The company is strongly focused on research and introduced the world's first branded progressive lenses. You also may have encountered Essilor on its retail sites, FramesDirect.com and EyeBuyDirect.com. Your optometrist definitely has. The company runs the MyOnlineOptical e-commerce site for eyecare professionals. Essilor also unveiled last year a prototype of an augmented reality system for the visually impaired called MyEye, which enables any text to be read, converted to text and then read aloud to the wearer. And you're probably already a big Luxottica customer. The company sells under most of the mainstream brands you're familiar with, including Ray-Ban, Oakley, Vogue Eyewear, Giorgio Armani, Brooks Brothers, Bulgari, Burberry, Chanel, Coach, Dolce & Gabbana, DKNY, Polo Ralph Lauren, Prada, Ralph Lauren, Versace and many others. And you've likely shopped at Luxottica stores, including Sunglass Hut, LensCrafters, Pearle Vision, Sears Optical, Target Optical, Glasses.com and others. So the world's biggest lens company is merging with the world's biggest frame company. Here's the best part: Essilor CEO Hubert Sagnières told the media that the purpose of the merger was innovation in "connected glasses," and the ability to deliver them "extremely fast to consumers through all the stores of the world and all [our] networks," according to the Financial Times. I'll refer you to the list of brands and stores above. That's where the world's largest eyeglasses company plans to deliver smart glasses, and fast. What's wrong with today's smart glasses? While lots of companies explore what's possible with the technology, and what's desirable among consumers, the field is really wide open for Apple and EssilorLuxottica. Consider what's out there. We all know about the splashy, high-end, mixed reality projects, including Microsoft's HoloLens and Magic Leap's big project. And, recently, we learned a lot more from CES. A San Francisco-based company called Osterhaut Design Group (ODG), which already sells successful industrial AR smart glasses, this month unveiled a sub-$1,000 pair for consumers called the R-8. The glasses connect to an Android phone via Bluetooth LE. The company claims that the glasses show two 720p screens that look to the wearer like one 90-inch 3D screen that appears to float 10 feet in front. The glasses also have two 1080p cameras. This is a great example of what's happening in the market generally. Current consumer smart-glasses products are either too high-powered and therefore bulky, too expensive, too ambitious or too narrowly focused -- for example, on sports performance. The Sony SmartEyeGlass, GlassUp UNO and Factory 4.0, Epson Moverio BT-300, Jins Meme, Recon Jet, Optinvent Ora-2 Professional Smart Glass, CastAR, LaForge Shima, Oakley’s Radar Pace and HiAR Glasses all fall into these categories. They're all too much on the face to be worn around all the time. Another emerging category are so-called smart glasses that measure brain waves. Safilo Group, which is the company behind Dior, Fendi and Hugo Boss glasses, is developing ordinary looking glasses that measure brainwaves, then send that data to an app where users can monitor their moods. Finally, of course, there is the already thriving enterprise smart glasses market. Chinese computer and smartphone giant Lenovo launched new smart glasses at CES. The company's Glass C200 product comes with a pocket unit that connects the glasses via high speed LTE mobile wireless. I told you about Osterhaut Design Group's consumer announcement. They also announced an R-9 for enterprises. We've been hearing about Vuzix's M300 Smart Glasses for enterprise for quite a while, but the product should go on sale this month. Why the market is wide open for Apple All the bulky, goofy, expensive smart glasses on the market now may find niches in gaming, drone-control, enterprise and other uses. But they won't go mainstream, and therefore won't change how we use our mobile devices. I wrote in this space about Vue glasses, which use bone-conduction audio and blinking lights to deliver communion with a smartphone and thereby deliver smartness. They offer neither screen nor camera. But they do offer one feature that makes them more mainstream than all the other products I told you about: They can pass for regular glasses. They also demonstrate a core feature of smart glasses that just about everyone overlooks. It turns out that glasses are a perfect place to deliver audio interaction -- a microphone and bone-conduction audio. Because glasses can hold a bigger battery, glasses are better than earbuds for interaction with a virtual assistant, such as Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant or Cortana. They can be worn all day, every day. They keep the ears unobstructed. And the battery can last for days between charges. For that reason alone I believe smart glasses are inevitable. Any subtle integration of a screen -- perchance a camera -- is frosting on the cake, so to speak. The weird thing about wearables is that they're fashion, with all the attributes of customization and personal identity associated with fashion. The tech sector has proved that it's not really up to the challenge of offering compelling fashion designs in wearables. But Luxottica is a fashion company. And, let's face it, Apple is too. Apple demonstrated as much with its Apple Watch, which comes in a dizzying variety of types, faces and bands. I think the world of mainstream smart glasses is coming. These glasses will have to look just like regular prescription glasses and sunglasses. And you'll be able to order them as a check-box item whenever you get your regular glasses. When you think of smart glasses as ugly, bulky and dorky like today's smart glasses, it doesn't seem like Apple would enter the market. But when you realize that tomorrow's smart glasses will look like ordinary glasses, that they'll be mainstream consumer devices, and that they'll be luxury fashion goods, it's clear that Apple will definitely want to get a share of the market.

Now, the chipmaker has responded by saying Apple’s claims are “baseless” and encourages “regulatory attacks.” Here’s Qualcomm’s full statement: “While we are still in the process of reviewing the complaint in detail, it is quite clear that Apple’s claims are baseless. Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program. Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information. We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits,” said Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel, Qualcomm Incorporated. Up until 2016 with the iPhone 7, Qualcomm was the sole supplier for the LTE chips found in the iPhone. With the latest iPhone, in addition to Qualcomm, Intel began manufacturing LTE chips for the iPhone. Apple says that Qualcomm forced the company to use its chip and pay back a percentage of the phone’s selling price in return to access its patents.

OTOH, after reading both articles, Apple may actually have a point as Qualcomm is well known for attacking anyone and everyone like a patent troll, but in their case they own something like a third to half the patents to most everything electronic you use every day! (And they did develop them.) The most telling example of how extreme it is is that Qualcomm and others’ patents are why the Chinese developed TD-LTE. At the end of the day, though, it’s all about the pot calling the kettle black.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach The Apple MacBook Pro 2016 created immense buzz before it was released and even after it hit the shelves. While the laptop sports some pretty amazing specs, its battery life and lesser capacity RAM was criticised. Now, the Dell XPS 15 laptop has become quite a rage as it being marketed as the “world's smallest 15.6-inch laptop.” While both laptops are incredible additions and cater to specific consumer needs, it is important to know about the differences in specs and features for a more informed buying decision. Display-wise, the Dell XPS 15 laptop has a 15.6-inch 4K Ultra HD InfinityEdge display with a screen resolution of 3,840 x 2,160 pixels. Many find it slightly better than Apple MacBook Pro 2016’s 15.4-inch Retina Display that comes with a screen resolution of 2,880 x 1,800 pixels. Apple has promoted its display stating that it is 67 percent brighter than previous models and consumes 30 percent less energy. When it comes to processor capacity, Apple scores more though XPS 15’s RAM is better. The MacBook Pro 2016 has been incorporated with a quad-core seventh-gen Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost, which is significantly better than Dell XPS 15’s quad-core i5-7300HQ processor. However, Dell offers an 8GB RAM that is expandable up to 32GB. Fans expected the MacBook Pro 2016 to sport a better RAM than its current 16GB configuration, reviews Tech Times. The high-end Dell XPS 15 model has a 256GB SSD whereas the MacBook Pro 2016 comes with 256GB and 512GB SSD options. The Dell XPS 15 laptop runs on Windows 10 and offers 97 watt-hour battery while the MacBook Pro 2016 runs on macOS Sierra and offers 76 watt-hour battery. Both have a 720p HD camera though the XPS 15 has a widescreen camera. The MacBook Pro 2016 has Bluetooth 4.2 compared to XPS 15’s Bluetooth 4.1. The Dell laptop has a highly responsive keyboard and trackpad whereas the MacBook Pro 2016 has a new Touch Bar. When it comes to price, fans will be surprised by the difference. The Apple MacBook Pro 2016 price starts at US$2,499 (AU$3,300) and the Dell XPS 15 premium variant has a price tag of US$1,599 (AU$2,100). However, everything comes to individual tastes and preferences and what exactly people want their laptop to do.

'Apple is willing to invest in the facility together because they need the (panels) as well,' said Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou.  (Justin Sullivan / Getty Images File Photo)   By Bloomberg Sun., Jan. 22, 2017 Foxconn Technology Group Chairman Terry Gou told reporters in Taipei the company is considering a joint investment with Apple for a display manufacturing facility in the U.S., according to a report by the Nikkei Asian Review. The facility would cost more than $7 billion and may create an eventual 30,000 to 50,000 jobs, the publication cited Gou as saying. The rising demand for larger displays makes domestic U.S. production a better solution than shipping from China and “Apple is willing to invest in the facility together because they need the (panels) as well,” he said. Apple didn’t immediately respond Sunday to a Bloomberg request for comment. Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., is also planning a new moulding facility in the U.S., possibly in Pennsylvania, Nikkei reported. Separately, Smart Technologies, a Foxconn-controlled interactive display company in Canada, may move to the U.S. in light of President Donald Trump’s indication he may seek to alter terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Nikkei reported Gou as saying. Gou said he sees American protectionism as “inevitable” while questioning whether U.S. consumers will be willing to pay much higher prices for equipment of equal quality, according to Nikkei. The publication said Gou spoke to reporters after Foxconn’s holiday party in the Nankang district of Taipei.

US President Donald Trump announced before taking office a $50 billion deal by the two firms which he said would bring 50,000 jobs. Trump was speaking in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York alongside SoftBank's chief executive Masayoshi Son. Foxconn, a major supplier to Apple, had earlier said it was in "preliminary discussions" with US officials about a potential investment but gave no details. "I have discussed with my major clients about going to (the US) and they are also willing to invest, including Apple," Terry Gou told reporters in Taipei after the company's year-end party. The firm is the world's largest contract electronics maker and is best-known for assembling products for international brands such as Apple and Sony. "Pennsylvania is active and I urge other states to act more quickly or I will sign the contract with Pennsylvania," he said, adding that the investment could create 30,000-50,000 jobs. Foxconn is still waiting to see the tax policies of the new US government and what incentives state authorities can offer, such as cheap land and electricity, Gou added. Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai, employs around a million workers at its factories across China and has operations in more than 10 countries. Last year it took over the struggling Japanese electronics maker Sharp after acquiring a 66 percent stake for $3.7 billion in a move Gou described as "really worth it." In the US, it has a plant in Virginia for packaging and engineering which employes over 400 people. It has also announced a $40 million investment in a facility in Pennsylvania to build precision tools and develop a robotics programme. Gou said Foxconn aims to increase investment in China this year to try to boost Sharp's market share in the country, but denied reports that he had been pressured by China over his planned US investment. Almost immediately after he won the November election, Trump angered China by accepting a congratulatory call from Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen. He further upset Beijing when he threatened to get tough with what he sees as unfair Chinese trade practice and suggested that the "One China" policy is negotiable.   Tweet More by AFP RELATED NEWS October 10, 2016, 11:57 am Taiwan president calls on China to engage in talks with Taiwan April 21, 2016 LiLo confirms mulling converting to Islam September 20, 2012 Foxconn plant April 30, 2012 Foxconn workers sing its praises, but profit disappoints MORE IN BUSINESS January 24, 2017, 8:21 pm Oil prices rise as OPEC output cuts drain stocks January 24, 2017 Khurram seeks trade officers’ help to diversify exports January 24, 2017 Italian, Russian diplomats show interest in agri potential of Sindh January 24, 2017 Trump tells manufacturers he will cut taxes Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus TODAY'S POPULAR Most Viewed | Most Commented India was prepared to use hydrogen bomb on Pak nuclear ...

However, some could not help but notice the out-of-place product features of Apple devices all throughout the show. English actor Benedict Cumberbatch plays the titular character in the hit PBS-BBC drama series. Those who have been following the fourth installment noticed how he now uses gadgets by the Cupertino-based company. These are the iPhone 6S Plus and the MacBook Pro. Sherlock Season 4 viewers react CNET pointed out that it is not the first time for Sherlock Holmes to use the two products in the show. However, the placements are reportedly more predominant and striking based on the last couple of episodes. Because of this, both tech and show enthusiasts have been debating if it is appropriate for his character and the story. Some pointed out that Sherlock Holmes is supposed to be the greatest detective of all time. As such, the blatant placements of seemed very inappropriate. Others said that the glaring product features seemingly distracted viewers from the scene. Apple “too hip” for Sherlock? The report pointed out that fans are attracted to Sherlock due to his independent streak. The fictional icon is also known for thinking outside the box. In fact, he is even deemed as anti-social by some people. In spite of all this, the character’s unique personality has endeared fans and solved many mysteries. This has raised the inconsistency in suddenly having him “endorse” such as hip, popular product like an iPhone and Macbook. The said smartphone is currently one of the most recognizable handsets in the market. The pro version of Apple’s famous laptop is also known to be one of the most mainstream computers today. Parodical fan theories Sherlock Holmes was originally created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the late 1800s. Being a classic title,  it is no surprise why his hardcore fans have been snobbish about the Apple endorsement. It is also understandable why techies find the placements very odd for the show. The CNET report ran through several “fan theories” related to the issue. They jokingly alleged that the private detective probably wants to be “cool” and fit in. Others pointed out that Watson or his brother Mycroft might have a free upgrade on a family carrier plan. What do you think of the Apple placements in Sherlock season 4?

Don’t listen to the hype; Apple is still the most innovative tech company in the world. While it’s true that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus weren’t huge upgrades, a recent Inquisitr article notes that the iPhone 8 may be completely redesigned. Then, there is the issue of the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar series. While Apple would have been better off referring to it as the “2016 MacBook Air with Touch Bar” series, Apple’s new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros are solid performers with beautiful screens and greatly improved keyboards (though not everybody likes the butterfly keys). Apple’s AirPods are a hit. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] Then, there are the AirPods, Apple’s latest wireless earbuds, which were delayed by two months. Apple was criticized for saying that they don’t like shipping items until they’re “ready for our customers,” but once Apple shipped them at the end of December, the wait (if you were actually waiting) was worth it. The reason that not everybody was exactly waiting for the AirPods is because several different companies have tried to push usable earbuds to customers and have failed miserably. Leave it to Apple, once again, to swoosh in, take something that other companies have failed at and produce something that’s not only usable but groundbreaking. The AirPods aren’t like any other wireless buds or headsets in that they actually feel like an extension of your ears. Connecting them is incredibly simple (they connect once you take them out of the dental floss-shaped charger box), and after they sit in your ears for a short amount of time, you don’t feel like they are there. And despite fears that they will fall out, it’s almost certain that they won’t. If you are at the gym wearing the buds and forcefully take off your shirt, it’s possible the cloth can hit one of the buds and force it out of your ear. But that’s an example of a very rare occurrence. The best thing about the AirPods isn’t the way they fit or how easy they connect; it’s the sound quality that makes these shine the most. If you are expecting these to sound as good as your $300 – $400 Bose or Sennheiser wireless headphones, you’re missing the point of the AirPods. They are meant to be an affordable wireless solution that makes your life a lot more convenient. The technology isn’t there yet to make earbuds sound as good as wireless headphones with 40mm drivers. The AirPods prove Apple is still relevant. [Image by Daryl Deino] But that doesn’t mean Apple overlooked sound quality. As a matter of fact, as even Pocket Lint notes, the AirPods not only sound better than the regular EarPods that ship with the iPhone, but they sound better than just about any other in-ear buds. There is a noticeable bass presence, but the real star here is the clarity, which compares to that of many wired headphones. The AirPods don’t have noise cancellation yet as that would make the battery life last less than an hour. But if you used headphones with noise cancellation for the past several years, it will feel great to be able to hear an oncoming car while jogging. Sometimes, you don’t want to shun the rest of the world out. You will still use my Bose QC35s when sleeping (best sleep aid ever!) or writing articles at Starbucks, but the AirPods certainly have their purpose. Apple’s new buds represent the first product from Apple in several years that isn’t overpriced. For $159, Apple’s wireless AirPods offer a variety of features that will make your smartphone experience a lot more convenient. Your turn, Samsung.

January 22 AAPL: 120.00 0.22 Report: Apple & Foxconn ‘mulling’ $7B investment in U.S. manufacturing with ‘highly automated’ display facility Chance Miller - Jan. 22nd 2017 5:05 pm PT @ChanceHMiller AAPL Company Foxconn View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit According to President Trump, Tim Cook has “eyes open” to United States-assembled iPhones and a new report from Nikkei reiterates that. According to the report, Apple is “mulling” a joint investment with Foxconn for a $7 billion automated display facility in the United States… This isn’t the first we’ve heard about a possible United States expansion for Foxconn and Apple. Last month, it was reported that Foxconn had held discussions about an expansion. It was also reported that Apple itself had asked Foxconn and Pegatron to investigate manufacturing iPhones in the United States. Today’s report, however, details that Apple and Foxconn are considering a $7 billion joint investment in the United States. Specifically, the two parties are mulling a highly automated display facility that would eventually create some 30,000 to 50,000 jobs in the Untied States. Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou told reporters that Apple is interested in the partnership because it needs the panels: “Apple is willing to invest in the facility together because they need the [panels] as well,” Gou told reporters after the company’s annual year-end party in the Nankang district of Taipei. The U.S. production site eventually would create 30,000 to 50,000 jobs, the Taiwanese tycoon said. Gou, however, expressed doubt as to whether or not Americans would be willing to pay more for a U.S.-made product. To help combat the more expensive production in the United States, Gou pleaded with U.S. officials to offer concessions on the price of land and electricity: “In the future they may be paying some $500 more for [U.S.] products, but those do not necessarily work better than a $300 phone,” he said, after urging U.S. authorities to provide concessions on land and electricity to facilitate Foxconn’s manufacturing operations. Last week, we ran a poll asking two questions: “Should Apple manufacture the iPhone in America?” and “Would you pay more for an America-made iPhone?” The majority of readers respond that Apple shouldn’t have to make iPhones in America and that they wouldn’t pay more for an iPhone made in America. Apple itself has yet to comment on the speculation that it is planning an investment in United States manufacturing, but the company is also planning an investment in manufacturing in India.

Any idiot could see it the instant a dashing civil servant casually started making small talk in the queue for coffee from a kiosk in the Palace of Westminster. Anybody except Dr. Carmichael of course… She was far from an idiot but, unlike most of us, the attractive eminent genetic scientist obviously hadn’t watched the innumerable salacious scandals in TV dramas down through the ages from Bouquet Of Barbed Wire to The Affair. New drama: Anybody could tell things were going to end badly for Dr Yvonne Carmichael in Apple Tree Yard - the BBC's adaptation of Louise Doughty’s thriller Inevitably her life – like her emotions and her sense of reason – was soon spiraling out of control.

Share this article Share Mind you to be fair, not even the most experienced viewer could have foreseen the terrible, savage, sting in the tale that eventually befell her. (She was raped, and not by the man she had unwisely, illogically, become involved with.) Just like Bouquet Of Barbed Wire and The Affair (or Mistresses, Homeland, and House Of Games) the sex and the storyline in Apple Tree Yard were totally ridiculous but ridiculously gripping. The four-part adaptation of Louise Doughty’s controversial steamy thriller started with a classic voice-over by Dr. Carmichael (played by the mesmerising Emily Watson ) as she was taken to court, in handcuffs, in the back of a prison van. ‘Before I met you I was a civilised woman,’ she said. ‘Now I don’t even know what ‘civilised’ means.’ Not a good start to be honest…She'd clearly lost all knowledge of dictionaries. Dangerous territory: Just like Bouquet Of Barbed Wire and The Affair (or Mistresses, Homeland, and House Of Games) Apple Tree Yard was totally ridiculous but ridiculously gripping ‘Food, shelter, sex…Once those needs are covered we can pretend we’re in control’ she went on. ‘But really we’re all just animals. Do you know how I know that? Fear – fear for your life. Once you’ve felt that, this so-called civilisation is a dream. You’ve taught me that, my love. Fear makes animals of us all.’ We got the picture... Cut to nine months earlier. Dr Carmichael, an expert on DNA, had just given evidence to a Parliamentary Select Committee about ‘Franken-foods.’ ‘You were very articulate in there,’ purred a suave, suited, civil servant (Ben Chaplin) as they queued for refreshments. ‘First time I’ve known what a genome is !’ Having broken the ice with the old 'genome' line, he lured her into his clutches/web, asking ‘have you seen the chapel in the crypt?’ – a chat-up line we’ve all tried let's face it. It probably helps if you look like Ben Chaplin, who was certainly well-cast if not necessarily totally credible. Stranger: Dr Carmichael (Emily Watson) had just given evidence to a Parliamentary Select Committee when a suave, suited, civil servant (Ben Chaplin) lured her into his clutches Deep in the bowels of a Westminster, the real attraction of this beautiful ‘royal peculiar’ (the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft) was a tiny broom cupboard. Crammed inside she read the plaque commemorating this was the place where the Derby Day suffragette Emily Wilding Davison ‘hid herself illegally during the night of the 1911 census’, allowing her to record her address as being ‘in the House of Commons.’ ‘I knew you’d be interested,’ he said. He was right. But more in him than Emily Wilding Davison… Whether the suffragettes had fought for a woman’s right to have torrid sex up against the wall of a broom cupboard with a man she had only just met standing on a metal bucket was debatable. Whether Dr Carmichael's rationale (or lack of it) for becoming embroiled in the liaison was distinctly dubious too. We were given only cursory insights into her vague dissatisfaction with her notoriously ‘sensible’ life - married to a lecherous lecturer, missing her grown up son, and devoted to her work. Encounter: Deep in the bowels of a Westminster, the real attraction of this beautiful ‘royal peculiar’ (the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft) was an illicit encounter Anyway, when she bumped into ‘Mr X’ again, their affair began – without her ever knowing his name (in the manner of Last Tango In Paris) and always in public: playing ‘footsie’ under the table in bars, having sex in toilets or alleyways (specifically in ‘Apple Tree Yard’). She had started a ‘diary’ on her computer at home, filed on the computer under ‘VAT Query 3’ as a precaution. ‘What we did today is without doubt the most reckless act I have ever committed. I know nothing about you. Well one thing...Sex with you is like being eaten by a wolf. Will you even give me a second thought, or is this just something you do?’ This was one of those questions where if you have to ask deep down you probably know the answer. The signs were all there. After their frenzied passion in the broom cupboard, when she confessed ‘I’ve never done anything like that before’, he did not reply ‘me neither’ but merely grin ‘lucky me !’ He was revealingly too meticulous about how to cover things up, as a ‘spook’ would be: pointing out that she had been carrying her coat not wearing it just before they had sex ‘in case someone noticed’; having cigarettes on him even though he didn’t smoke because it was ‘handy sometimes’; and buying her a mobile for secret texts. Diving in: Their affair began – without her ever knowing his name and always in public: playing ‘footsie’ under the table in bars, having sex in toilets or alleyways ‘Don’t top it up at the same place twice - because it establishes a pattern,’ he recommended, enjoying observing ‘which is the exact opposite of what you do in your job.’ She had told him that the most common misconception about scientists was that ‘we know what we’re doing’ when the truth was ‘I’m just scrabbling about in the dirt’ – with him, more than ever. Even she didn’t know what 98% of the DNA in the human genome was really for. Not that this seemed to be the justification for her kamikaze actions. Their first row had been about genetics, when she realized he was ‘turned on’ by having sex in public places and he confessed she was right. ‘It just does ! It’s probably genetic,’ he made the mistake of suggesting (to a world expert). ‘Christ ! You really think that means something?!’ she spat. ‘That it absolves you of all responsibility - just hard wiring?!’ Trouble ahead: Their first row had been about genetics, when she realized he was ‘turned on’ by having sex in public places and he confessed she was right He had assumed she had been as aroused by the danger of sex in public as he was. ‘No,’ she stated simply. ‘It’s you actually. YOU turn me on.’ This was the moral of the story (or one of them): even with the most intelligent, complicated people this was what sex/desire/an affair comes down to. Anyone who had not read the book probably assumed Dr Carmichael’s undoing would be the affair - that she did not know what she was doing: the way she left her tablet lying around for her husband to find after she had been searching for ‘STD Clinics’ or standing underneath a CCTV camera in Apple Tree Yard, trying to work out if it was real and if their passion/debauchery had been recorded. But after she had inadvertently (drunkenly) let a lascivious, vicious, work colleague see her texting her lover, she paid an even higher, more terrible, price when she was punched in the face and raped in his office. ‘Fear – that’s what makes animals of us all. Before I met you I was civilised. Civilised ! So help me God…’ said her voice-over again, as she stood in the dock. What Dr Carmichael was charged with (and why), or what Apple Tree Yard is trying to say about women, sex, and infidelity with her story and its allusions to genertics and the Suffragettes also remains to be seen.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Will 2017 be the year of the Mac? Anthony Caruana 23 January, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News I’m not one for making predictions. As I’ve said before, trying to guess what Apple will do next is a mug’s game. It rarely follows market trends, preferring to set its own agenda and will release new products when it is good and ready – not when its customers want them. Apple has moved into a reasonably predictable pattern with the release of the iPad and iPhone. Typically, during the first half of the year, a new iPad hits the shelves with updated iPhones coming in the seond half. The iPod touch, iPod nano and iPod shuffle don’t get a lot of attention these days. We may see an update to the iPod touch with a faster processor and some new colours, but I think the days of the iPod are falling away. But the Mac – that’s a different story. The release of the new MacBook Pro in September was not all smooth sailing. The new TouchBar was variously applauded and derided by reviewers and there was great controversy late in the year when Consumer Reports reported some baffling battery life test results (which have since been explained and will be resolved). I suspect the entire Mac product line will be refreshed. The Mac Pro has not seen a single update since its release in 2013. Surely, it will be updated with new processors, better storage and memory options. The MacBook Air is almost a redundant product line in my view. The MacBook fills the needs of those looking for an ultra-thin notebook and the 13in MacBook Pro covers those looking for a more highly specced machine. We’ll get our annual update to macOS later in the year as well. What I’d really like is for Apple to commit to at least annual hardware refreshes for all the Macs. Each year, CPU, memory and storage technology improves. At the moment, Mac users miss all of that and I know it’s sending some Mac users over to the Windows side of the world. So, if anyone at Apple is reading this, how about showing your loyal Mac users the same sort of love you show iPhone and iPad users, who get annual processor and hardware improvements?

China-made smartphonesSamsung’s market share dropped by 14.2 percent in the third quarter of 2016, thecompany’s worst performance to date, which has mainly been attributed to widespreadbattery explosions of Samsung phones over the past year. But there’s no guarantee thebrand will return to the top even if it survives its current crisis. Meanwhile, Samsung’s foreign peer, Apple, has also failed to maintain its earlierperformance. With steadily decreasing sales, China has lost its title as Apple’s secondlargest market. One factor in this decline may be insufficient innovation. Experiencing”iPhone fatigue,” more and more Chinese customers are now moving to domestic brands. Since the first quarter of 2016, shipments of Chinese smartphones for the first timesurpassed the totals of Apple and Samsung. Statistics from global market intelligenceprovider TrendForce showed that production of Chinese smartphones reached 600 millionin 2016, accounting for 45 percent of the global total. In addition to marketing, Chinese brands are also devoting energy to new technologies.For instance, some Chinese phone-makers are already leading in technologies such as 5G,artificial intelligence, virtual reality and 3-D images. With the rise of Chinese brands comes frequent patent litigation between Chineseproducers and their foreign competitors. For this reason, analysts said domestic brandsmust systematically study international patent licensing and build their own patentportfolios as quickly as possible.

PHOTO: REUTERS SEOUL: The world’s biggest smartphone maker Samsung blamed faulty batteries on Monday for the fires that led to last year’s humiliating recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 device. Samsung Electronics was forced to discontinue the smartphone, originally intended to compete with Apple’s iPhone, after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire. The debacle cost the South Korean company billions in lost profit and reputational damage, in a torrid period which has also seen it embroiled in the corruption scandal that has resulted in President Park Geun-Hye’s impeachment. Internal and independent investigations “concluded that batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents”, Samsung said in a statement. Samsung to disable Note 7 phones via software update “We sincerely apologise for the discomfort and concern we have caused to our customers,” Koh Dong-Jin, the head of its mobile business, told reporters in Seoul. Samsung Electronics is the most prominent unit of the giant Samsung group, South Korea’s largest conglomerate with a revenue equivalent to about a fifth of the country’s GDP. It announced a recall of 2.5 million units of the oversized Galaxy Note 7 in September 2016 after several devices exploded or caught fire, with the company blaming batteries from a supplier, widely believed to be its sister firm Samsung SDI. When replacement phones — with batteries from another firm, largely thought to be Chinese manufacturer ATL — also started to combust, the company eventually decided to kill off the Note 7 for good. As many as 1.9 million of the phones were sold in the United States, where authorities banned the device from use on planes and even from being placed in checked luggage. Aviation authorities around the world issued similar prohibitions. The firm has since embarked on a campaign to restore its battered reputation, issuing repeating apologies and putting full-page advertisements in prominent US newspapers including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post admitting that it “fell short” on its promises. After Samsung Note 7, now Galaxy S7 also exploding? The next model in the series, the Galaxy Note 8, had been expected to be unveiled at next month’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, but Koh said it would be delayed to ensure that it had no safety issues. Samsung deployed around 700 researchers and engineers on its investigation, testing more than 200,000 fully-assembled devices and more than 30,000 batteries, it said. It did not identify the battery makers on Monday, but independent investigators UL and Exponent agreed with the findings. Battery A had a design issue that pushed down the right corner of the battery, while Battery B had defective internal welds, said Kevin White, principal scientist at Exponent. But Koh dismissed the possibility of suing the manufacturers. “Whatever parts we use, the overall responsibility falls to us for failing to verify its safety and quality,” he said. “At this point, I don’t think it’s right to seek legal action. Around 1,000 different parts from some 450 suppliers were needed for each Galaxy Note 7. PHOTO COURTESY: SAMSUNG Samsung acknowledged that it provided the specifications for the batteries, adding in its statement: “We have taken several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again. The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture.” Samsung might start selling refurbished Galaxy Note 7 devices The fiasco took a major toll on the reputation of the firm, which is set to announce fourth-quarter and full-year results on Tuesday. It has estimated the cost of the recall at $5.3 billion, according to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency. Samsung Electronics shares were up 0.5 percent at 1.87 million won in Seoul on Monday morning after the announcement. The firm has separately been caught up in South Korea’s wide-ranging political corruption scandal, with prosecutors last week seeking the arrest of its vice-chairman Lee Jae-Yong on charges of bribery, embezzlement and perjury. Lee, who became Samsung’s de facto head after his father suffered a heart attack in 2014, is accused of bribing Choi Soon-Sil, Park’s secret confidante at the centre of the scandal, and receiving policy favours from Park in return. Samsung is the single biggest contributor to two non-profit foundations controlled by Choi, but a court rejected the arrest request on grounds of insufficient evidence.

Do you suffer from nomophobia? January 23, 2017 09:53 IST Most people have this permanent nervousness about somebody separating them from their smartphones, says Shyamal Majumdar. Illustration: Uttam Ghosh/Rediff.com Apple may be celebrating 10 years of the launch of iPhone, but a friend who holds a senior position at a multinational company, hasn't quite got into the mood. His ire is directed at smartphones in general. Exasperated at the sight of his teammates frequently staring into their smartphones, even during important meetings, he was forced to find a novel way out. Before the daily morning meetings start, the giant screen behind him shows various slides. One just says, 'We live in the era of smartphones and stupid people'; another shows the visual of a couple on a rollercoaster ride looking intently at their phones; yet another shows two characters in heaven pointing at a few others and saying, 'Most of the new arrivals are incapable of conversation. They just stare at their hands in despair.' The friend says the effect hasn't been encouraging: People get fidgety and some of them take frequent breaks. He wonders what will happen once those billions of embedded cellular modules keep chattering through wearable phones -- in wristwatches, even spectacle frames. He isn't alone. Despite the obvious benefits of smartphones -- after all, they have brought an unprecedented level of convenience to our lives -- they have taken a heavy toll on the work-life balance. In fact, the use of smartphones to stay connected to work 24/7 is so common that it's now considered the new normal. So the phones nestle in pockets and sit by bedside tables. Most busy executives check their smartphones every five to 10 seconds and many feel guilty for depriving their team members of all the interesting things they have to say or text or tweet, without realising that they may have become victims of what clinical psychologists call 'nomophobia' -- a permanent nervousness about somebody separating them from their phones. A senior executive says he looks forward to his long drive from office to home as he can concentrate on working on the route. Even while on holidays, he reckons a few 'firefighting' business calls are unavoidable. There are many like him. They get anxious if there’s no Wi-fi in the hotel or mobile phone signal up the mountain. They fret if their phones get low on power, and secretly worry that things will go wrong at work if they are not there. These are the typical signs of 'always on' stress induced by smartphone addiction. Many of us are checking texts and emails first thing in the morning and last thing at night. A study by the Centre for Creative Leadership found that professionals, managers and executives who carry smartphones for work, report interacting with work 13.5 hours every workday (72 hours a week, including weekend work). The study also found that, on average, they have only about three hours on workdays for 'discretionary' activities such as being with their family, exercising, showering and all those chores at home that someone has to do. 'Startlingly, they don't blame technology for this dilemma that has them scrambling to manage their personal lives.' That's why many people are fatigued and angry about being 'always on' and never done, the line between their personal and professional lives blurred if not eliminated. The most dangerous thing is to fall into a mode of permanent activity and continuously consult one's smartphone to see whether any new mails have come in. Other research on occupational stress has revealed how the smartphone sitting on our nightstand impairs our sleep and makes it impossible to detach from work owing to its invasive, 'always on' nature. Many people, who use their smartphones for work-related communications, tend to have a difficult time psychologically detaching from their jobs. This, in turn, makes them vulnerable to work-related exhaustion, leading to more burned-out employees, who are exhausted and cynical. Thankfully, smart employers are realising that they won't retain their best workers if they treat them like a 24-hour concierge service. The final call to take advantage of the incredible benefits that smartphones bring lies with you, by being disciplined about its usage. So, if you're getting ready to go on a holiday, set up those 'out of office' email alerts and switch off your phone when you go to bed. After all, you are rarely the only who can resolve issues. They can do without a 'smart' call from you.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 23 January 2017 | MYT 11:37 AM Apple files US$1bil lawsuit against chip supplier Qualcomm Big player: Qualcomm supplies modem chips to Apple and Samsung. — Reuters REUTERS: Apple Inc filed a US$1bil (RM4.44bil) lawsuit against supplier Qualcomm Inc, days after the US government accused the chip maker of resorting to anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for "modem" chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40% of Qualcomm's US$23.5bil (RM104.3bil) in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in US District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some US$1bil (RM4.44bil) in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple's discussions with South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple's claims "baseless." "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," Rosenberg said in the statement. "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on "reasonable" terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a "no license, no chip" policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm US$854mil (RM3.7bil) in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a US$975mil (RM4.3bil) fine in China, while the European Union in Dec 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. On Tuesday, the US Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose "onerous" supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel's shares closed up 1% after the Qualcomm suit was announced. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm "has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time," Rasgon said. Apple is known for seeking multiple suppliers to keep prices down, said Jim Morrison, vice president of technical intelligence for TechInsights, which tears down devices to analyse their parts. —  Reuters You May Be Interested Singapore 2G switchoff highlights digital divide Bring cheer to the underprivileged this festive season Time to say goodbye TM offers free speed upgrade – do you qualify?

I was in Taipei for Computex. I'd just walked into a group press conference ready to take notes and transcribe. I opened up my Macbook Air and ... half the screen was blank. In between interviews, my screen died. So like many people, I waited most of 2016 hoping Apple would announce a serviceable replacement for the Macbook Air. But they never did. So over the last month, I've been using Razer's similarly-priced answer: the latest Razer Blade Stealth laptop. What Is It? Image: Kotaku/Alex Walker Unlike the gaming focused, and vastly more expensive Blade Pro, the Blade Stealth is an ultrabook targeted at students, creative professionals and other industries in the market for a "productivity" device. Starting from $1499.95 for the 128GB model with 16GB DDR4 RAM and a 12.5" 1440p display, the Blade Stealth ranges up to $3000 for the model with a 4K screen and 1TB of storage. You're venturing into Blade Pro territory there, however, so it's really a laptop aimed at those considering a Macbook Air or a Surface Pro. The pitch is that you're paying about the same amount for the Razer Blade Stealth, but you're getting much more modern hardware. The baseline model comes with Intel's latest Kaby Lake processor, the i7-7500U CPU (2.7GHz/3.5GHz) with the integrated HD Graphics 620. There's 2 USB 3.0 ports on the laptop and a Thunderbolt-3 USB-C port, which doubles as the laptop's charging port. Extra benefits include Bluetooth 4.1 support, touch screens on all models, built-in webcam, speakers, a HDMI 2.0a port, a 3.5mm microphone/headphone combo jack, a 64-bit install of Windows 10 and wireless functionality. All models come with a IGZO panel for the screen, although only the 4K Blade Stealth screens will support 100% Adobe RGB (the baseline models are only rated at 70% Adobe RGB, which photographers and editors might want to consider). The whole unit weighs 1.29kg and is 1.31cm x 32.1cm x 20.6cm, which is delightfully small. It's not the smallest ultrabook you can find, particularly given what was shown at CES this year, but it travels easily enough. The 12.5" screen is also just the right size that you can pull the Blade Stealth out on the train or bus and continue working without having to worry too much about the seat in front of you, although it's a fraction too large for those hoping to do a bit of red-eye typing in cattle class. Razer's also bundled in support for their Chroma lighting software so you can get a funky rave going on your keyboard, although more on that later. What's It Good At? Image: Kotaku/Alex Walker Intel's integrated graphics have come a long way. While the HD 620 is no match for some of last year's beefiest titles, like DOOM or Battlefield 1, you can get around 30fps in Overwatch if you play at 720p and turn the resolution scale down a bit. Other games, like Civilization 5 and Stardew Valley, are perfectly playable. And if you dabble in a bit of Dota 2 or League of Legends, you'll be able to get through a match without screaming at the monitor. The gaming power is really just a bonus, though. The Blade Stealth is all about productivity first, with a bit of gaming on the end. And it's a great laptop for typing on, once you become accustomed to the reduced profile of the keys. It's not a mechanical keyboard, but it's comfortable enough after long typing sessions. The Razer Synapse software is more than just lighting profiles though. It's disabled by default, but you can enable Synapse to track how many keys you've pressed, the average keystroke distance, how many macros you use, and it maintains stats for individual games as well. It'll track your mouse movement in game too, which is probably more helpful for the Blade laptops with discrete GPUs than it is the Blade Stealth. And the core aspect of any laptop, especially one with the Macbook Air in its sights, is the quality of the trackpad. It's not as good as Apple's creation - few are - but it's accurate enough, especially after you bump up the default sensitivity by a couple of notches. It's not quite as clever when it comes to detecting your palms, which results in some "Where's Waldo's Mouse Cursor" moments. But as far as a Windows-powered trackpad goes, it's serviceable enough. And the 45W supplied USB-C charger is also reasonably small, which is a hugely helpful considering you'll never want to leave home without it. Oh and while some might argue that laptops are all about the hardware, the Blade Stealth is a real stylish piece of hardware. People don't often buy laptops for the look, but the Blade Stealth is pleasing on the eye, especially when the keyboard and back logo have that soft, green glow. (Or whatever other colour you prefer.) What's It Not Good At? Images: Razer Kaby Lake might be the epitome of Intel's 14nm processors, but if you were hoping for the glory days of 12, 13, 14 hours battery life you're gonna have a bad time. With the Chroma lighting going, the in-built network manager for the Killer wireless card and the automatically enabled Dolby Digital Plus software, the Blade Stealth chews up battery fast. Playing a game or watching a video will drain your battery in a couple of hours. When typing, editing photos and doing my regular day job, the standard battery life was around six hours. The USB-C port can also be used to power Razer's separate graphics dock, the Razer Core. Problem is, the Razer Core isn't available in Australia. And even when it is, you're still paying hundreds of dollars for a basically a dock that houses a GPU, which you have to either purchase or have automatically lying around. (And most people don't have spare GPUs chilling in their closet.) As much as Razer wants to pitch the Blade Stealth as a gaming device, the HD 620 isn't really that practical as an all-round gaming laptop. Games released in the last couple of years will generally hit around the 30fps mark, which isn't the sort of performance you'd want for twitch shooters or games relying on fast reaction times (like a F1 2016). If you stick to indie titles, and older AAA games (think around 2013-2014), you'll be perfectly fine. I praised the trackpad earlier, but something it's not great at is palm recognition. It's all too easy to end up clicking on something accidentally because your hand has brushed over the trackpad mid-sentence. I'd also avoid using the touchscreen if you don't like fingerprints; the glossy surface means you'll be easily reminded of just how greasy your fingers are. Should You Buy It? Image: Razer Before the turn of the year, I strongly considered buying my own Razer Blade Stealth. I wasn't going to pay the several hundred dollars to have the panel on my Macbook Air replaced. I loved that laptop to bits, but Apple hardware costs enough as is the first time around. So I started seriously considering the Razer for two reasons: the Kaby Lake CPU with an integrated GPU, which would be enough for older games like Dungeon of the Endless or Risk of Rain, and the fact that it came in at around the same price point. Getting an i7-7500U with 16GB of RAM for $1500 is a solid deal when you consider the current Dell XPS 13 costs just under $1900, and only has the i5-7200U and 8GB of RAM. The Blade Stealth will also have a faster processor than the XPS 13 2-in-1 model when that becomes available in Australia. The higher end model does outperform the Blade Stealth slightly, as Gizmodo found, but it'll cost you $1614 for a 128GB model with 8GB of RAM. The same version with a 256GB SSD will set you back $1699, and the starting price for an XPS 13 with an i7-7500U is $1954. The extra money isn't really worth it, for me. Not having to deal with the XPS 13's chunky proprietary charger is a plus as well; the Blade Stealth's USB-C charger is relatively small, and it'll only become more versatile in the years to come. It does mean that you can't charge the Blade Stealth and use the USB-C port at the same time, but that issue never cropped up once in my testing. The sticking point for most people will be the battery life. Both the XPS 13 and the Macbook are vastly superior, and it's something you'll need to factor in if you're a regular traveller. But that can be managed by thinking ahead, and you can eek extra juice out of the machine once all the Chroma lighting is disabled. Razer's laptops have always been a joy to use, even if they weren't quite perfect. But the Blade Stealth now has one other notch under its belt: it's reasonably priced, considering the hardware inside and the cost of its competitors. I won't say it's the ultimate ultrabook for gamers who need to work first and play second. But it's satisfying to use, travels well and is neatly designed. That's a good package for $1500, and it's a good looking package at that. Comments labrys @labrys Jan 23, 2017, 3:11pm I've had my eye on the stealth to replace my 2011 MBA when it eventually dies. So this is the perfect review for me. :) Battery life is a bit of an issue but usually my MBA is plugged in so I can probably live with it. I do like Razers pricing structure on this with the only difference between the laptops being the screen and the size of the hard drive. I love my MBA keyboard and trackpad though. The best I have ever used so if Razers aren't in that league it could get annoying quickly. I do love the idea of the Core though. Being able to turn the laptop into a gaming PC by simply plugging it in is fantastic. It means I can get one device to do everything I need. And I have to say I have always had a question mark on Razer's quality. It just always seems to fall a bit short and from reviews on amazon this is the same here which gives me pause in getting one. Reply 0 ted @ted Jan 23, 2017, 7:24pm I was foolish enough to buy a Razer keyboard, mouse, headset and (expensive) mouse pad all in one go a few years back. Never again. Terrible build quality, constant issues with the keyboard especially and Razer support ignored every email I ever sent them. Reply 0 labrys @labrys Jan 24, 2017, 9:09am Yeah I've heard many similar stories. My mate's Razer mouse just died on him and it was only a couple of years old. My Cyber Snipa Striker mouse has lasted me around 7 years with no problems. I don't think the company even exists anymore and the mouse keeps going. My wife bought me a pair of Razer Headphones for Christmas since my Logitech G35s died so I will be interested to see how long these last me. These quality issue stories are what have prevented me getting Razer mice and keyboards in the past. Reply 0 Zombie Process Guest Jan 23, 2017, 10:40pm Funny story - I bought a "New" Razer Blade 2016 while I was attending WWDC in San Francisco last year. I've been an Apple fan since the mid-90s, and even worked for them from 2005-2010. But damn if I was not tired of waiting for something worth while that would replace my 2013 MBP. So I bought the Blade..and I love it. It's not a total MBP replacement, but in some ways it comes close (disregarding battery life, but I have a 12 retina MB for that). And it has no problem playing modern AAA games, which my MBP really won't do. I'm a developer, but increasingly need to work cross platform. The MBP has been good, but the latest versions don't give me enough to warrant the $4000 it would cost. Apple makes great hardware.. or did.. but I wish they'd wake up to the world around them and give us something really compelling. Reply 0 matt1234 @matt1234 Jan 24, 2017, 11:03am Razer laptops are great quality - I've had a Razer blade 14 for about 2 years now and it's left on 24/7. I take it to work and travel both domestic and overseas with it, it is also my only home PC and plugged into my TV for media centre and gaming. I've even upgraded the ssd drive for more storage and installed win 10, I haven't had it stuff up once. The only downsides i will give it is * Noise - when gaming it gets quite noisy, and i mean NOISY (but better that than overheating, and it's quiet during normal use) * Fingerprint magnet Last edited January 24, 2017 11:04 am Reply 0 Matt50 Guest Jan 24, 2017, 12:04pm This looks perfect! for someone who wants 16GB of ram, this looks to work out way cheaper than a mac. just a shame about the battery life. I consider that a critical stat (given it is meant to be a portable computer after all). would be good if they could have a slightly thicker, heavier version with a bigger battery.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Foxconn Reiterates their Plan for a U.S Plant | Main | Xiaomi Ousts Hugo Barra after the Company's Smartphone Market Share Tanked last Quarter » January 22, 2017 Samsung and Experts Point to a Short Circuit in the Batteries as the Fault of the Note7 Fires   On December 5, 2017 Patently Apple posted a report titled "A new Report Claims that Samsung's Aggressive Note7 Design Caused its Battery Explosions." Tonight in a live conference, Samsung noted that in their own investigation they found that the cause of the Note7 fires were caused by a short circuit in both batteries. The second investigative body, the UL, concluded in their report that, "In summary, design and manufacture issues with the batteries led to field failures of the Note 7 devices. A third investigative body was Exponent led by Dr. Kevin who noted that "The important take home message was that electronics did not contribute to the failure of either manufacturer's cells."   Our December report provided as much or more of an explanation of the battery problem with the Note7. Considering that only Samsung's Note7 was hit by the battery problem, it seems highly suspect that it was solely the fault of the two different batteries from two different companies and not with a design flaw in the design of the phone.    With that said, the Korea Herald reports tonight: "Samsung's mobile chief and President Koh Dong-jin apologized again and pledged to come up with follow-up measures, including launching a Battery Advisory Group consisting of external experts, to improve battery safety and innovation.   'Today, more than ever, we are committed to earning the trust of our customers through innovation that redefines what is possible in safety, and as a gateway to unlimited possibilities and incredible new experiences,' Koh said in a press conference held at the Seoul headquarters.   Since the phone's global recall issued on Oct. 11, 2016, Samsung has poured all-out efforts to find the exact cause of several fires. About 700 Samsung researchers and engineers replicated the incidents by testing more than 200,000 devices and 30,000 batteries, the company said.   The probe was also joined by several independent expert organizations, including UL, Exponent and TUV Rheinland.   The joint investigation team pinpointed faulty batteries as the cause of the accidents. The Note phone used batteries from two manufacturers -- Korea's Samsung SDI and China's ATL -- that showed different defects.   The graphics below are from the live conference held earlier this evening covering various points made in the Exponent presentation.   Samsung's Mobile Chief DJ Koh Video replay may be available on this site in the future.   During Koh's opening statement he had noted that 96% of all Note7's have been returned to Samsung to date.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Growth in the quarter ending in December ticked up to 6.8 percent over 2015, supported by government spending and a real estate boom, a gain from the previous quarter’s 6.7 percent, government data showed Friday. Still, for the full year, growth came in at a lackluster 6.7 percent, down from 6.9 percent in 2015 and the weakest since 1990’s 3.9 percent. That temporary upturn is unlikely to last, economists said. Ford Expects $2B Net Income Drop Due to Pension Change DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) – Ford says that a change in the way it values pension obligations will cut its 2016 net income by $2 billion. Ford will record a pretax pension charge of about $3 billion for the year. It says the loss is a special item so it won’t affect adjusted pretax profit. Ford still expects to meet guidance of about $10.2 billion in adjusted pretax profit for last year. Ford Motor Co. reports fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on Thursday. Apple Depicts Qualcomm as a Shady Monopolist in $1b Lawsuit SAN FRANCISCO (AP) – Apple is suing mobile chip maker Qualcomm for $1 billion in a patent fight pitting the iPhone maker against one of its major suppliers. The complaint filed Friday in a San Diego federal court depicts Qualcomm as a monopolist abusing its power in a key segment of the mobile chip market to extort royalties for iPhone innovations that have nothing to do with Qualcomm’s technology. Apple says it has been cooperating with government regulators who have been investigating Qualcomm’s business practices, prompting Qualcomm to retaliate by withholding about $1 billion in scheduled payments. Court: Indian Lending Companies Subject to Federal Probe SAN FRANCISCO (AP) – A federal appeals court says lending companies operated by Native American tribes are subject to investigation by a government regulator. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Friday rejected a claim by three tribes that their lending companies were protected by tribal sovereignty from investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. At issue were for-profit lending companies created by three tribes — the Chippewa Cree, Tunica Biloxi and Otoe Missouria. The Chippewa Cree’s lending company, Plain Green, has been accused of predatory loan practices — a claim that company officials deny. Las Vegas Sands Paying $7M to Settle Corrupt Practices Probe LAS VEGAS (AP) – Las Vegas Sands Corp. will pay almost $7 million to U.S. authorities to end a more than five-year corrupt practices investigation, company and federal officials said Thursday. With the agreement, the company resolved twin probes over more than $60 million paid to an unnamed agent retained in 2006 to acquire a Chinese basketball team, plus other business dealings that include a Beijing real estate deal to promote casinos on the Cotai Strip of Macao. The company wasn’t charged with a crime and did not admit guilt in either case.

After more than four months, the world's largest smartphone manufacturer is ready to reveal the exact reason that the Galaxy Note7 — its most advanced smartphone ever, and the year's strongest competitor to Apple's iPhone 7 — was recalled. How To Watch Samsung's Galaxy Note7 Recall Press Conference 11:30AM: Hi everyone! If you're just tuning in, you've got a solid half hour to wait before the actual conference gets underway. The livestream is right here if you want to open it in another tab and watch along. 11:45AM: T-minus 15 minutes, ladies and gentlemen. The stream is up and running — there's even a backup stream in case the original dies. It's pretty clear that Samsung wants this press conference to go off without a hitch. 11:55AM: With five minutes to go, it's worth diving into the numbers just for a bit of context. In the few short weeks between the phone's original launch on August 19 and when sales were halted on September 5, Samsung sold 51,060 Note7s in Australia. Of those 51,060, around 48,500 were returned to the company through the second recall program. That's a recall rate of around 95 per cent, far outstripping the average Aussie recall rate (for any consumer product, from cars to homewares to washing machines) of 56 per cent. The Note7 recall is expected to cost Samsung in the region of $3.4 billion in the six months after it was instituted. There's no value placed on the company's ongoing Galaxy brand performance, though, or the damage that has been done to the goodwill of loyal customers — that'll take years to pan out. 12:00PM: OK, we're off and running. The livestream is up, and we're just running through some housekeeping before the event itself kicks off. 12:02PM: Samsung's DJ Koh, president of the mobile business division, is up on stage to officiate the event. "I deeply apologise to all our customers... and all of our business partners." "We have invested all our efforts and substantial resources over the past several months... in order to fully investigate the issue. We will be sharing the results of our investigation today." Koh is currently giving a brief background of the Note7's lifeline. Two weeks between the phone's initial launch and its first recall. "The device was discontinued globally on October 11th." That's the date of the second and final recall, after phones kept exploding. 96 per cent of about 3 million devices sold and activated have been returned. "We are grateful to Note7 owners... for their help to expedite this process and achieve this exceptional return rate." "We have examined every aspect of the device... including hardware, software, assembly, quality assurance and logistics... were reviewed in detail. To ensure that we encouraged a thorough investigation." 12:07PM: "We built a large scale charge and discharge test facility, where we were able to replicate the incidents from market, and complete a detailed analysis." Samsung also hired "respected industry analysts" to independently verify their results. They'll be speaking in a few minutes. Was fast charging or wireless charging to blame for any of the battery fires? Was it water resistance? Samsung conducted repeated charge and discharge tests with all three of these criteria put to the test — including charging with the back glass battery cover off — in its charge facility. The same is true of Samsung's iris charging tech and the USB Type-C port. Samsung also ran tests on preloaded and downloaded third-party apps, to test whether software was to blame. "None of these tests demonstrated an abnormality or correlation to the reported incidents." Logistics was also put to the test, including tracking the handling of all parts delivered — including the batteries — "in an effort to determine whether there were contributing factors." "Although none of these... presented an abnormality, we have nontheless added additional [steps to improve processes]." 12:11PM: Thousands of complete Note7 devices and batteries were subjected to "repeated charge and discharge tests." Both fully assembled devices and batteries exhibited the same incidence of failure rate of devices in the field. "This indicated that the incidents were caused by the battery cells themselves." Both Battery A from the first recall and Battery B from the second recall had a failure, but different incidents. "Incorrect positioning of the negative electrode tip" was responsible for the failures on Battery A, which caused the initial fires and recall. "Melted copper on negative electrode" on Battery B had caused a short circuit in that area of the battery. An internal short circuit as a result of abnormally high welding bars — from the ultrasonic battery building process — was what caused the second battery's continued issues. Some batteries were also missing insulation tape. 12:15PM: UL is an "independent science and safety organisation", and conducted its own analysis of the Note7 to determine the issue. The same is true of US-based Exponent, which did a "detailed analysis" of hardware and software. The third independent organisation was TUV Rheinland. The first independent business to present its findings is UL's Sajeev Jesudas. "Our mission is to promote safe... living and working environments. We have deep experience with lithium ion batteries." UL's knowledge includes forensic levels of investigation into battery failures. UL tore down and examined 10 damaged Note7 devices with "Company A" batteries, and 110 new Company A batteries, "to identify battery issues." There were signs of internal short circuits on the upper right cells of the batteries. "Multiple contributing factors" were responsible for the Note7's battery failures, says UL. The higher energy density of the Note7's battery — 3500mAh — could have contributed to the severity of each incident. UL's investigation is ongoing into why the deformation of the Note7 batteries from Company A — one of the two major suppliers to Samsung — happened in the first place. Company B, responsible for the replacement batteries, had its batteries and damaged Samsung Note7 devices examined by UL including 10 teardowns and 40 new batteries being disassembled. Multiple short circuits across the battery and missing insulation tape on some cells contributed to those Company B battery failures. The Note7's battery drain from Company B met Samsung's specifications, including maximum temperature, cell voltage and discharge and charge rate. Uneven charge across the battery, internal short circuit, and sharp edges of welding joins within the Company B battery were partly responsible for the "higher possibility of separator puncture" — the kind of thing that short circuits within battery cells. 12:24PM: Higher energy density and thinner cells are, basically, what's to blame for Samsung's Note7 issues. Thinner phones with higher capacity batteries make compromises, and this was one. 12:25PM: Dr Kevin White is now up on stage to give his presentation. He's the Principal Scientist from Exponent in the US. "Two distinctly different failure modes" for each of the Note7's batteries — that's the trend we're seeing in this press conference. "A suite of destructive and non-destructive tests on devices returned from the field... and new devices supplied by Samsung. The proposed root causes are consistent with the... independent and impartial analysis." We're getting an explainer from Exponent on how batteries are assembled, and how interaction of negative and positive electrodes at any point throughout the lithium-ion cell itself. For Company A: "The most likely root cause was determined to unintended damage to the negative electrode windings consistently in the corner of the cell closest to the negative tab." For Company B, the issue was also with the battery, but "a new and distinctly different defect that was not present in the initial investigation." These cells were the ones manufactured after Exponent's initial investigation. Electrode bending — physical damage to the battery — caused damage to the negative electrode and its lithium plating, causing the short circuit. "Remember that all these failures occurred very early in the life of the device." Welding defaults in some incident cells were found to bridge the distance to the negative element, causing short circuits. Dr White: "In some batteries tested, a protective layer [was not installed], likely due to an error in the manufacturing process. In those cases, the incidence of short circuit was higher." "Poor welding causes tall welding defects. Normal swelling forces those welds into the negative electrode. During high states of charge, the heating of the cell causes thermal runaway." And that's the ball game, folks. White is now saying that the battery system, and its electronic safety measures to address issues like short circuits, met or exceeded industry standards, and that Samsung's electronics did not contribute to the failure of either Company A or Company B's battery cells. 12:36PM: Holger Kunz from TUV Rheinland is now on stage to give that company's analysis of the battery issues. TUV's role was to investigate the logistics system — processes of the China and Vietnam battery production lines, and the road transport system from China to Vietnam for those batteries during the devices' final assembly, packaging and distribution. TUV Rheinland's testing and factory assessment ran from November to December, and "showed no detection of relevant weaknesses" in the battery production or transport process. Two pallets of the batteries with instruments measuring acceleration, strain, temperature and humidity were shipped between China and Vietnam, and additional tests for any transport condition — any time, any season of the year — were also run. The batteries passed those tests, suggesting that logistics were not the issue. A total of 650 batteries from the transport and off the production line were tested by TUV Rheinland and passed normal environment and abuse testing. "No specific detection of weakness, concern or obvious danger" from Samsung's processes and workstation in the Vietnam and main Korean assembly line was detected by Samsung, and the tested batteries passed "relevant safety requirements" after road transport. = 12:43PM: Samsung's DJ Koh is back on stage to talk about the company's preventative measures going forward. "Smartphone designs have become more compact, and battery usage has increased." "It was important to support various functionalities, so high battery capacity was among the most important features during product planning." "A higher capacity of 3500mAh [was used in the Note7], in a more compact form than previous Note models. New designs and manufacturing designs and technologies were used." "We are taking responsibility for our failure." Samsung is committed to quality and safety, DJ Koh tells the audience. "Comprehensive preventative measures" have been implemented, says Koh, including internal measures to enhance quality assurance and quality control. "We are building upon our existing quality assurance.. with the addition of teams that are exclusively dedicated to focus on each core component of the device, includign the active re "We have formed a battery advisory group... to ensure we have an objective review of device safety." The advisory group has consulted with Samsung on the Note7, and will continue on future devices. 12:49PM: The group includes professor of chemistry Dr Clare Grey from the University of Cambridge, materials science and engineering professor Dr Gerbrand Ceder from UC Berkeley, and materials science and engineering professor Dr Yi Cui from Stanford, as well as and Dr Toru Amazutsumi, Ph.D from Amaz Techno-Consultant. An 8-point battery safety check will include X-ray and random disassembly at the manufacturers, with additional inspections along the way to assembly. Large-scale charge and discharge testing will be conducted on batteries — including two weeks of continuous use in a "full range of customer scenarios". "We have adopted and provided preventative measures, with improved safety standards for the battery." "A new hardware design means more space around the battery to accommodate a new bracket design to protect against force, even when the device is dropped." We hope this case will serve as an opportunity to improve the safety of lithium ion batteries, not only for us but for the entire industry." Samsung says it is reviewing its plans to share its battery safety procedures with industry standard bodies. "It has been a challenging period for Samsung... and the customers that have trusted us to provide them with safe products." Samsung takes great pride in its ability to listen, learn and improve, it says. "Today, more than ever, we are committed to earning the trust of our customers, through innovation that redefines what is possible in safety." 12:55PM: Samsung's DJ Koh and the independent experts are now taking questions from the audience. 12:57PM: It appears that Samsung has cut the live feed of its press conference at the end of Koh's speech, rather than broadcasting the panel's responses to press questions. Thanks for reading! Now read: Here's a timeline of the short life and long death of the Galaxy Note7, as it happened in the late months of 2016. Samsung's Galaxy Note7 Recall: The Timeline The Samsung Galaxy Note7 was unveiled to the world at an event in New York City on August 3. It went on sale to customers in Australia on August 19. It was praised for its excellent design and futuristic iris scanning biometrics. Sales of the phone were suspended due to battery issues causing devices to overheat and catch fire on September 2, first reported by Gizmodo Australia. That was escalated to a full recall a few days later on September 5. Samsung offered customers the choice of a replacement phone (with a temporary loaner handset in the interim), a refund or exchange to a similar Samsung phone like the S7 Edge, as well as around $250 in incentives which varied depending on the telco or retail store the Note7 was purchased through. Stock of replacement Galaxy Note7s — with the battery issue apparently fixed — arrived in Australia on September 20. Customers who had returned their phone for an exchange were contacted and told they would receive trouble-free units. That stock was distributed to Samsung's customers and carrier partners, until ongoing battery issues and fires with replacement phones forced a second halt of sales and replacements. Samsung Australia repeatedly told customers to switch off both original and replacement Galaxy Note7 phones, and to return them to their place of purchase. he company limited the state of charge of phone batteries to 60 per cent, disabled Gear VR support, and cut it off from Australian mobile networks. Currently, over 95 per cent of Samsung Galaxy Note7s have been returned to Samsung in Australia. Approximately 2500 phones are still at large. This recall rate is far ahead of the average Australian recall return rate, which is around 56 per cent according to a 2013 statement by longtime ACCC chairman Rod Sims. Samsung's 23 January press conference is likely to be the last official conference on the matter, but the issues with the Note7 will continue to affect Samsung's public perception for some time. The impact of the Note7 recall is expected to cost Samsung at least $3.4 billion in the Q4 2016 and Q1 2017 quarters.

I think that this will proof to be a learning experience for most, if not all, designers and manufacturers of similar equipment. Reply 0 ok @ok Jan 23, 2017, 10:30pm Agreed. Reply 0 WaitAMinute Guest Jan 23, 2017, 3:09pm Wasn't Company A Samsung Batteries? I thought I saw somewhere that one of the battery suppliers was a Samsung subsidiary. Reply 0 pepee63 @pepee63 Jan 23, 2017, 5:08pm Yes it was. Company B was a different company. Reply 0 WaitAMinute Guest Jan 23, 2017, 9:36pm So when they keep calling it 'Company A' rather than 'Samsung Batteries' they are being open and honest and taking responsibility. Reply 0 pepee63 @pepee63 Jan 24, 2017, 6:41am They always said the first batch was Samsung batteries. We knew that from the start. Reply 0 WaitAMinute Guest Jan 24, 2017, 8:58am The press conference did not mention this. That would seem to be a deliberate PR strategy to mislead. Note that this article and many other media reports of the press conference have not mentioned that Battery A was a Samsung battery. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Jan 24, 2017, 9:45am I'm not sure you appreciate how conglomerates and subsidiaries work. The Samsung conglomerate sells electronics, makes clothing, builds ships, sells life insurance, runs an advertising agency and operates a theme park, just to name a few. The only thing Samsung Electronics and Samsung SDI have in common is the name. They have different shares on the stock exchange, different leadership and operations - for all intents and purposes they're separate companies. They have as much in common with each other as Dairy Queen and BNSF Railway do in the US. Last edited January 24, 2017 9:50 am Reply 0 pepee63 @pepee63 Jan 24, 2017, 11:56am They had a story right here on this site that stated the faulty batteries were Samsung batteries when the problem first arose. I think I heard it on the news as well. It's no secret Reply 0 elias @elias Jan 23, 2017, 4:22pm Suggestion for next time, a summary, would be great. Ain't nobody got time to read a minute log.

You must have the attention span of a goldfish. Reply 1 Campbell Simpson @campbellsimpson AUTHOR Jan 23, 2017, 5:10pm Well heck, pal. Summary: not the phone, but the battery. Two different problems with two different batteries. Batteries were too thin, physical damage + heat = short circuits = thermal runaway = boom. Problem solved for next time with a new hardware design and much better QA for batteries. Reply 1 magani @magani Jan 23, 2017, 11:33pm Also, just possibly having *removable* batteries? Just saying...

Reply 0 Campbell Simpson @campbellsimpson AUTHOR Jan 23, 2017, 5:11pm Design called for a battery that was too thin for the technology required to create it. Attempting to build those batteries led to manufacturing defects which caused the fires. Reply 0 g-man @g-man Jan 23, 2017, 5:19pm Ahh I see. Maybe a bit of a case of worked fine on the highly calibrated prototyping equipment but not in looser tolerance mass production. Last edited January 23, 2017 5:21 pm Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Jan 23, 2017, 6:58pm The 0.002% failure rate in the wild suggests that it probably would have been difficult to pick up the manufacturing fault in QC. Reply 0 dazzler @dazzler3622 Jan 23, 2017, 10:34pm That's after only a few weeks in the wild though, I'd be interested to know the % of devices which were faulty and would have failed within 1-2 year lifespan if not recalled. If it's over 1% you'd think their QA procedures should've caught it. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Jan 24, 2017, 6:50am The report seems to indicate a manufacturing defect, not a degradation failure. Time wouldn't matter much if so, and detection would come down to frequency. I mentioned in another article, the typical 'high' standard for manufacturing defects is 25 PPM, and the SDI battery's known failure rate is 20 PPM, so it may not have tripped typical processes, or even been detected at all.. Reply 0 TickTickTick Guest Jan 24, 2017, 8:47am According to ArsTechnica fault in battery B was burr created by poor weld puncturing cell insulation with cyclic cell swelling/contraction from repeat recharge/discharge. This would be a time dependent degradation failure mode. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Jan 24, 2017, 9:25am The ATL batteries had nothing to do with the initial fault and recall, nor anything to do with Samsung's QC. Reply 0 pepee63 @pepee63 Jan 23, 2017, 5:11pm Good to see it was only the battery. Knowing that, they'll give all the returned stock good batteries, refurbish them and put them out for sale. I'd love a cheap note 7 Reply 0 velt @velt Jan 23, 2017, 6:29pm I doubt it, it was the thinness of the battery that lead to all the manufacturing problems. I don't think they'll risk it again. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Jan 23, 2017, 7:04pm The investigation into the cause of the Samsung SDI batteries' deformation defects is still underway, according to the article. Koh mentions that a stronger bracket to protect against impact damage is one of the key changes they're introducing so it may not be the thickness of the SDI batteries that was the cause, but rather that they weren't adequately protected within the device. I suppose we'll find out when the UL investigation results are published. Reply 0 pepee63 @pepee63 Jan 24, 2017, 6:40am They'll just add a thinner battery. Why would they throw away perfectly good phones when the only problem was the battery. Doesn't make sense. Reply 0 velt @velt Jan 24, 2017, 12:40pm Because it was the thinness of the battery that was the problem. As Campbell says above: Design called for a battery that was too thin for the technology required to create it. Attempting to build those batteries led to manufacturing defects which caused the fires. You can't fit a better battery into the chasis because it would have to be bigger and wouldn't fit. Reply 0 pepee63 @pepee63 Jan 24, 2017, 2:28pm Sorry you didn't understand me. Maybe if I said smaller. Reply 0 amfomy @amfomy Jan 23, 2017, 10:02pm Too bad the 'Note' branding has been tarnished already. When they did the announcements on the planes, then you know it's reached the masses. I still get exploding jokes with my Note 4 (and admittedly started some, too). Last edited January 23, 2017 10:02 pm Reply 0 Campbell Simpson @campbellsimpson AUTHOR Jan 23, 2017, 10:27pm I flew on a plane back from IFA in Berlin (where I reported the battery fires and imminent recall) filled with about a dozen journos carrying Galaxy Note7s, plugged in and charging. That, these days, is a recipe for disaster. And I dropped and smashed one within about 12 hours of getting it to review, so I'm really actually kinda surprised I didn't win the lottery on this one. Reply 0 ok @ok Jan 23, 2017, 10:45pm It's sad the fault wasn't discovered in time to either; - tweak the Note7's back casing and put a bigger, more traditionally built battery, or - retain the design but fit a smaller battery used in the existing S7 fleet, but under-clock the hardware slightly The latter probably wouldn't been as receptive to customers I guess. Good to see Samsung being transparent with their review process. Last edited January 23, 2017 10:46 pm Reply 0 Potatoes @mendoza Jan 23, 2017, 10:45pm Unfortunately the damage is already done for me. Months and endless fighting with the company to get a refund for a recalled product that had ready been returned. How can I ever trust their products or services again? Last edited January 23, 2017 10:46 pm Reply 0 bringerofmuffins @bringerofmuffins Jan 24, 2017, 8:17am Two questions: 1: Is anybody incorporating fuses (or their electronic equivalents) into phone batteries? It seems like a no-brainer due to the potential for harm and the exposure of external components. 2: I was under the impression that modern batteries incorporate electronics which stop complete discharge. (Thus the capacitor-trick.) Was I wrong? Reply 0 skrybe @skrybe Jan 24, 2017, 10:54am Wouldn't help in this situation. The damage is literally connecting positive and negative together so it'd bypass any of those sort of measures you're talking about. You can't stop that other than making the batteries more robust.

Jaideep Mehta 2017 will see the gradual influx of 3D printers into manufacturing firms, research labs and the possible odd hospital. Photo: iStock Imagine this: you are travelling for work to London and staying in an apartment rented through Airbnb. As you hail the Uber cab for your business meeting, your phone beeps an urgent message and you swipe your finger on the fingerprint scanner to read the notification. You learn that a critical machine on your shop floor is overheating, and the message tells you that based upon previous experience, it is likely to break down soon. As a precautionary measure, the system has automatically sent a request to the in-house 3D printer to produce the component likely to be impacted. You pull out your Oculus from the briefcase, connect it to the app on the phone and get a visual of the machine and the impacted component. At the click of a button, the system also gives you three scenarios of the impact on the production if the machine goes down. You make the necessary phone calls using the low-cost WhatsApp and speak to the factory manager. Comforted by his response, your mind is clear for your upcoming meeting. What you have just done is leveraging mobile, next-generation security, Internet of Things (IoT), cognitive computing, natural interfaces and analytics technologies to perform a simple but critical management intervention which ensured the smooth running of your business. Welcome to your new world, Ms CEO. A tsunami of new technologies has hit the business ecosystem. The first ripples were felt in the middle of the last decade and were evidenced by the likes of Salesforce.com and that upstart called Amazon Web Services, Inc. What a curious idea it was for an e-commerce company to expose, and rent out, its underlying infrastructure to third parties! IDC predicts a third of all industry leaders will be replaced by 2020. That’s how profound the disruption is. Click here for enlarge On the consumer side, the waves intensified towards the end of the decade as social media took centre stage and e-commerce boomed in every single major economy in the world. As I write this, Facebook has nearly 1.8 billion users and Alibaba has sold $18 billion worth of products in a single day. Consumer services companies, vividly exemplifying the sharing economy, have become household brands: today, more millennials possibly identify with Uber and Airbnb than they do with venerable corporations such as Johnson & Johnson, and GE. The force of the sharing economy is reshaping vast tracts of the consumer ecosystem, effecting the closure of retail giants such as Circuit City and Woolworths, and acquisitions such as that of Starwood Hotels by Marriott. The waves are swamping those without the lifeboat of digital capabilities. The first intense wave of change came with technologies which created what IDC calls the third platform of computing. The four pillars of the third platform, namely social, mobile, analytics and cloud (SMAC), today aggregate to a market exceeding $0.5 trillion. According to IDC research, it’s still expected to grow in excess of 13% in 2016, taking more than 35% of overall technology spending. It accounts for 110% of the industry’s growth: traditional IT spending, while still two thirds of overall spend, is shrinking at greater than 5% a year. The third platform of computing is a profound shift in the computing paradigm. Users have moved from millions to billions, devices from tens to hundreds of millions and there’s enough data generated on Planet Earth to fill up the memory of a stack of Apple iPads all the way to the moon— and back. SMAC technologies have transformed IT fundamentally, and opened up entirely new opportunities for businesses. From smart products to analytics businesses and from real-time system enabled mobile field forces to digital supply chains, businesses across the spectrum have embraced these in different ways to drive economic value. The maturing of the third platform of computing has enabled entirely new technologies, and combinations, to develop and mature. IDC collectively calls them the innovation accelerators, as our research identifies their potential to drive not just technology and process but also complete business disruption. Of these technologies, the following five are likely to take centre stage in India in 2017. Watch out for them. Next gen security If you’re like me and have a continuous wrestling match with your store of forgotten “capital letter-alphanumeric—change-them-every-two-weeks” passwords, then I can give you some comfort. The era of the complicated password will soon pass. Next generation security systems are integrating biometrics (fingerprint, voice, iris recognition) with behavioural analytics (usage location, onsite/on-app behaviour, transaction patterns) to help make bank accounts, health records, government databases and countless other stores of sensitive information ever more secure. Though not visible to most, the security of the networks our data whizzes around on, and of the data centres which power up the modern economy, is also undergoing radical modernization. For example, network security is not just about appliances detecting ‘bad actors’ anymore: it’s moving to a managed services model where the network is monitored for bad actors, real-time responses become a reality and damage control processes kick in instantly in the event of a hack. From Apple’s fingerprint readers to behavioural security platforms being introduced by the likes of Intel Security and Cisco, the industry is racing to help us realize the possibilities these technologies unlock. Expect a new paradigm in security to make life easier, and more secure, for you in 2017 and beyond. Cognitive systems The notion of intelligent machines has fascinated man for decades. It has been the subject of Hollywood movies, science fiction books and doomsday theories. Well, they’ve arrived but not in the way you thought. I must stress that intelligent machines of the current generation do not have native intelligence as humans do. They are getting ‘smarter’ on the back of their ability to process vast quantities of data really fast, and identify patterns and trends to be used. Who knows what the next generation of machines brings, though? A common example is the “May I help you?” assistants, which have appeared on e-commerce websites. Increasingly, you are not interacting with a human but a piece of software if you do ask a question. It has been programmed with learning algorithms, and fed masses of product catalogue and user behaviour data to be able to help you. Intelligent machines are also parsing through all the published legal cases and court decisions in recorded history to help lawyers serve their clients better; and doing exactly the same with doctors trying to figure out what might be wrong with a sick patient. IBM’s Watson platform is perhaps the best known in this space, but it’s not the only one. Google has a different approach with the TensorFlow and Google Cloud Machine Learning combination. The analytics platforms from the likes of SAS are evolving too, as are new-age data storage systems from NetApp, HP Enterprise and their peers. The year 2017 will see consumer services firms in different sectors adopting cognitive technologies more aggressively. Expect the likes of banks, e-commerce companies, telecom service providers and hospitals to deploy them faster than others. From a wider perspective, the full story will unfold in 2018-19. Internet of Things (IoT) The Internet today has enabled interactions and engagement in society in ways which were not imagined even a decade ago. Video calling through the phone at practically zero marginal cost, cloud computing which allows organizations to think at global scale without the need for massive technology investments and a plethora of consumer services at your doorstep are just three manifestations of the amazing power of the Internet. The next wave is now upon us: machines are now interacting with each other and triggering processes without human intervention. In the process, mountains of data are being generated daily, enabling machine learning and cognitive computing. This is IoT. The 2016 IDC IoT survey in India, which covered 470 companies, reveals a great enthusiasm for IoT already. Process manufacturing companies as well as logistics services and trucking firms are leading the way. The Industrial Internet is born. The year 2017 is likely to see the inflection point of IoT adoption in India. Billions of sensors will help monitor oil pipelines remotely, control home air-conditioning systems and track trucks and pallets as they move through our vast countryside. Its potential is staggering, its promise mouth-watering. It can generate crores of rupees worth of efficiencies and productivity gains in the corporate sector; for consumers, it could mean being able to switch on your air conditioner before you reach home; or your coffee machine grinding the beans when the sensors in your bedroom note that you’ve up. 3D printing At a recent conference, Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, shared that they had put a 3D printer in a school as part of corporate social responsibility and R&D initiatives. The group was keen to see what innovation the children might come up with if they are given the right tools. The results are awaited but early signs are promising. The term 3D printing, in some ways, is a misnomer. They are actually capital goods equipment which operate visually like printers do. In the future, this technology is likely to radically remake manufacturing. Supply chains will be disrupted and the manufacturing process for many products will be democratized, with the possibility of garage-based production and retail store production already being realized. Nike’s Fly Knit shoes are made in-shop after your foot is scanned and the images sent to the 3D printer. Skin grafts have been synthesized in labs; auto parts are being 3D printed. In 2017, we will see the gradual influx of these machines into manufacturing firms, research labs and the possible odd hospital. It will take some time and price cuts before 3D printers go mainstream. But it holds much promise and would be especially useful for far-flung areas of the nation. Natural user interfaces What I wouldn’t give to not have to get up for the remote control, and simply change the channel on the television with a swipe of my hand, or through a conveniently placed gadget that would recognize my voice and change the channel! That’s Natural User Interface (NUI) for you and it’s here to stay. But really, while that TV remote is still important, a lot of what we experience is now being redefined by new forms of cognitive controls. The shift from text to graphics was a major leap, courtesy of Xerox Corpo ration, and popularised by Apple with their hallmark Macintosh OS in 1984. More recently, we’ve witnessed a revolution of sorts in the UI space: touch (smartphones), voice (Siri) and even gesture (Microsoft Kinect, Nintendo Wii). Today consumers want amplified, immersive and authentic experiences from what they consume; NUI enables just that. The human-machine interface is fast changing our experiences, thus heralding an era of multi-touch surfaces, powerful and lightweight mobile devices and now the emerging market of wearable technology. We are entering a fascinating world sans constraints physical and virtual. On the enterprise side, firms today are increasing the connect with their ecosystem of customers, employees, suppliers and partners, moving away from mere CX (customer experience) to authentic experiences. At IDC, we’re seeing this extensively in media and gaming; it is a matter of time before NUI permeates retail, healthcare, fashion and automobile verticals. It is my considered view that when the neural capabilities of touch, voice and gesture and the capable hardware that’s available to process these inputs (at consumer prices to boot) are coupled with the large scale APIs to leverage these NUI opportunities, a new age of platforms which can redesign and revolutionize your experience will dawn. 2017 shall be a year when the increasing clamour for experience by consumers and the omni-experience transformation needs of enterprises shall see a scaling up of investments towards this aim. As this technology transformation evolves, so too will its impact on consumer experience and the digital business ecosystem. In sum, 2017 will see the next technological revolution reshaping Indian society, business and the government landscape. Recent events have already triggered the digitalization of the payments ecosystem at warp speed. The five technologies described above, individually and in combination, will herald the dawn of the next technological age. Jaideep Mehta is managing director, IDC India and South Asia. Five trends that can change the tech world by 2021 Internet-of-things (IoT) software and solutions: IoT will be driving new levels of customer insight and engagement for some by 2021, but technology diversity and the need for organizational changes will still stymie or delay many firms. Intelligent agents: Intelligent agents and related robots will have eliminated a net 6% of jobs by 2021. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR): By 2021, AR will be commonplace, while VR will remain niche. Artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive technology: Solutions powered by AI/cognitive technology will displace jobs with the biggest impact felt in transportation, logistics, customer service, and consumer services. Hybrid wireless: 5G will be rolling out by 2021, creating a high-bandwidth cellular backbone to support IoT devices. In addition, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi will expand their capabilities to support IoT devices.

It depends, but even a 2-door in terrible condition should fetch about $7 or $8k. What is a 1971 Ford Torino covered in 3D printed crap worth? $5500. This is the first ‘3D printed car’ on an auction block. It looks terrible and saying ‘Klaatu Varada Nikto’ unlocks the doors. Old Apple IIs had a DB19 connector for external floppy drives. Some old macs, pre-PowerPC at least, also had a DB19 connector for external floppy drives. These drives are incompatible with each other for reasons. [Dandu] has a few old macs and one old Apple II 3.5″ external floppy drive. This drive can be hacked so it works with a Mac Classic. The hack is simply disconnecting one of the boards in the drive, and it only reads 400 and 800kB disks, but it does work. The US Army is working on a hoverbike. Actually, it’s not a hoverbike, because it doesn’t have a saddle or a seat, but it could carry 300 pounds at 60 mph. That’s 136,000 grams at 135 meters per second for the rest of the world out there. This ‘hoverbike’ will be used for very quick resupply, and hopefully a futuristic form of jousting. Over the past few months, we’ve seen a few new microcontrollers built around the RISC-V core. The first is the HiFive1, a RISC-V on an Arduino-shaped board. The Open-V is another RISC-V based microcontroller, and now it too supports the Arduino IDE. That may not seem like much, but trust me: setting up the HiFive1 toolchain takes at least half an hour. The NAMM show has been going on for the last few days, which means new electronic musical gear, effects pedals, and drum machines. This is cool, but somewhat outside our editorial prerogative. This isn’t. It’s a recording studio using a Rasberry Pi. Tracktion is working on a high-quality digital audio input and output add-on for the Pi 3. This is really cool, and you only need to look back at MPCs and gigantic Akai samplers from 15 years ago to see why. Hey LA peeps. Sparklecon is next weekend. What’s Sparklecon? The 23B hackerspace pulls out the grill, someone brings a gigantic Tesla coil, we play hammer Jenga, and a bunch of dorks dork around. Go to Sparklecon! Superliminal advertising!

Yup, nitpicky. I have had bids rejected over this point, though. Report comment Reply JIm B says: January 22, 2017 at 4:56 pm First of all, Brian was being humorous by expressing it that way. Second: really, you think Kg is the base unit? Is a gram defined as a milli-Kg?

They should round all that off to 1 (or 0, it may be easier for them to calculate some values) and create new units called the SM. Report comment Reply James Sleeman says: January 22, 2017 at 5:52 pm > Kg is the base unit Strange but true. Reason: simple convenience, in the late 1700s and early 1800s when these things were being decided, having a gram as the standard mass was recognised to be really inconvenient, too difficult when most things dealt with in every day life weigh a lot more than a gram, so it was decided to have the standard mass as 1000 times greater than the gram (which had been decided already), and therefore the gram got “back annotated” if you like to be 1000 times less than THE (as in the physical Kg prototype) Kg. Report comment Reply targetdrone says: January 22, 2017 at 8:10 pm If you’re going to pick oh him, you should have called him on his real mistake: 60MPH is more like 26 m/s. 135 meters per second is about 300 miles per hour! While I think a 300 MPH hoverbike would be completely awesome regardless of how many grams or kilograms of load it can carry, I don’t think that’s what they’re developing. Report comment Reply Z00111111 says: January 22, 2017 at 8:20 pm Also 60 miles per hour isn’t 303.75 miles per hour… 60 mph is approximately 26.67 m/second Report comment Reply Saabman says: January 22, 2017 at 4:12 pm I think this line in the artical about the car sums it up “artist who attended the Academy of Fine Arts ” Art seems to me to be – take some amazing technology and produce crap.

They did it using feet per second as a system of measurement. Why should I be forced to learn metric, a different, obviously outdated system of measurement? /trollbait Report comment Reply addy771 says: January 22, 2017 at 4:41 pm Hackaday published an article. They did it inaccurately. Why should they check their facts and figures, as long as clickbait titles bring in the ad revenue? /trollbait Report comment Reply Tom says: January 22, 2017 at 4:39 pm Well… If you take 60mph and convert to km/h, then take that value as mph, and convert *that* to *feet* per second… You get about 140…. No, I’ve no idea either.

Report comment Reply jrfl says: January 22, 2017 at 11:26 pm This car is clearly an empty husk, with just enough mechanical components to allow it to be trailered. The frame was probably rusted completely through and worthless even for doing a restoration. For example there currently is a car on classiccars for $1000 with no bids that is a rolling frame (missing engine/transmission). If you consider that the artist probably didn’t care what car he started with its likely that the frame was a scrap frame that he got for free. Depending on the cost of the time on his 3d printer it is very possible that that artist made a few grand on this piece. The real sucker who bought it!

The interviewer accidentally knocks the cube over. The interviewer quickly picks the cube up and “rights” it while apologizing. The “art critic” insults the interviewer saying something along the lines of “You’re not an artist, you wouldn’t understand real art.” and “that is a piece of art worth more than what you make in a year.” The interviewer apologizes again as the critic re-positions the cube. The camera focuses on the cube as the interviewer comments that it looks like trash. The critic explains that an artist did make it from the junkyard and used a compactor to make the cube but only a true artist would understand the message behind it. Yes… Garbage stuffed into a compactor then sold for what? 100k? That Ford Torino reminds me an awful lot like that cube of garbage.

How COULD she? The ‘she’ being Yvonne Carmichael (Emily Watson), a respected, married scientist whose self-sabotaging decision to become immediately intimately involved with an urbane stranger sends her life into freefall. We have three more episodes to discover how Yvonne ends up where we first find her, in handcuffs, under arrest, in court, on trial, but there are some other more immediate questions to tax us. Namely...  BBC Yvonne's life will clearly come undone once she surrenders to the temptation of Mr X How many previous guests has Mr X invited into his broom cupboard? He seems to know all about the keys, its celebrated history, what noise the cleaning tools make when they’re kicked in the height of passion... Did the broom cupboard encounter really mean as much to mysterious ‘civil servant’ Mr X as it clearly did to Yvonne? Is it possible to turn on the TV for some contemporary drama without catching sight of Scottish actor Mark Bonnar? Already familiar to ‘Unforgotten’ fans, here, he’s on duty as Yvonne’s unsuspecting, but possibly unfaithful, husband Gary… It soon became clear that Gary had his own fan club, with research assistant Rosa even turning up, distraught, on their doorstep. Was he just being a good professor, having “shut down the possibility” of an affair, or has he got his own secrets? How is Mr X so adept in the art of covering his tracks? The phone he’s bought Yvonne is ‘Pay as you go, never from the same place twice’… Why is he carrying cigarettes when he doesn’t smoke? And does he really work for the government as he says? Why doesn’t Yvonne put her secret phone on silent? That beep with every new erotic message is ever so loud. Who’s the mysterious person, phoning their landline at home and then hanging up? Mr X, or perhaps Rosa? Why is Mr X so obsessed with video-cameras in public places? How does he know about that camera facing the wrong way in the alley way? And knows when a camera is working, and when it isn’t? Are these just tools of his trade, or will it be how he and Yvonne get discovered, or is he planning to stitch her up?  Following the shocking conclusion of this first episode, will Yvonne’s secret life work against her when it comes to seeking justice?  And what IS she on trial for? Watch this space. ‘Apple Tree Yard’ continues on BBC One on Sundays. Catch up on BBCiPlayer. Top 10 Favourite TV Drama Moments Top 10 Favourite TV Drama Moments 1 of 10 10.

WSJ's Lee Hawkins explains. January 21st 2017 4 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Aussie consumers turned to other Android phones in the wake of the exploding Samsung Note 7 fiasco. Picture: Ahn Young-joon Nick Whighamnews.com.au@NWWHIGHAM SAMSUNG has officially revealed faulty batteries caused its flagship Galaxy Note 7 phones to catch fire and has announced steps to avoid repeat incidents in the future. The announcement came more than three months after Samsung scrapped the short-lived competitor of Apple’s iPhones, wiping $US5.3 billion off its operating profit in one of the biggest tech failures in history. Investigations by the company and independent organisations found the batteries were the sole cause of the Note 7 fires, Samsung mobile chief Koh Dong-jin told reporters during a briefing in Seoul on Monday. The major headache for Samsung provided a big opportunity for its competitors to gain an edge in the increasingly competitive smartphone wars. Consumer confidence was always going to be rattled by Samsung’s exploding phones debacle, so which companies actually gained from Samsung’s loss? Surprisingly Samsung’s biggest rival, Apple, did not benefit from the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco in Australia as Aussie consumers sought other Android smartphone brands in the wake of the global recall. That’s according to figures released by consumer website Finder.com.au which measured “brand intent” among Aussie consumers comparing smartphones and mobile plans on the market. “We measured brand intent via our mobile phone plan engine, which is a page consumers visit to either switch phones and/or plans,” Finder.com.au’s technology commentator Angus Kidman told news.com.au. “Our data shows Aussies’ first handset preference, reflecting brand intent. This data does not indicate purchases or sign-ups.” This photo taken on September 13, 2016 shows a blown-up Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone in Gwangju, 270km south of Seoul.Source:AFP The 2016 smartphone brand analysis was based on the comparisons of 56,000 Australian consumers who visited the website, he said. From August to September (when the first incidents of the Note 7 catching fire occurred), brand intent for Samsung dropped by almost a third. It moved from 32 per cent of mobile comparisons involving Samsung devices to 23 per cent. It steadily decreased over the rest of the year, finishing at a low of 19 per cent brand intent in the month of December, the company said. That interest shifted from Samsung phones to other Android devices with Google being one of the big winners with the release of its first smartphone. Google brand intent almost doubled among Australian consumers, growing by 86 per cent, according to the analysis. Interest in Huawei doubled, increasing by 101 per cent while Oppo saw an increase in searches by 53 per cent. Apple remained the first smartphone preference for Australians with brand intent sitting at an average of 62 per cent, followed by Samsung at a 25 per cent average in 2016 and all other manufacturers at 13 per cent. However Apple brand intent among Australians remained relatively steady over the year. This graph shows the proportion of handset searchers on Finder.com.au. A clear decline for Samsung is evident from August.Source:Supplied Most Android phones are cheaper than Apple’s iPhone, which is probably why Apple failed to gain a major boost from the Samsung fallout. Mr Kidman also believes Australian consumers are creatures of habit, preferring to stick with a familiar operating system. “For many, choosing a new phone is swayed by the operating system. We’re creatures of habit and like the comfort of knowing our way around our phones. A new OS means figuring out how to do the simplest of tasks like changing your ringtone,” he said. There was also many consumers who reported being underwhelmed by the latest Apple iPhone. “There weren’t many major design changes in the iPhone 7 compared to previous generations, and one of the most notable was also highly controversial: eliminating the headphone socket,” Mr Kidman said. “For someone switching from Android, that could feel like a deal-breaker, especially when there is such a wide range of Android devices to choose from.” -With AAP Jump back to top Right now in technology 323Readers Dakota Access pipeline, Keystone XL pipeline revived by Dona... 186Readers Hear here: Apple just solved biggest flaw with AirPods 122Readers Windows 98 laptop: Man buys retro computer online, gets bril... 114Readers Beware the Slenderman documentary delves into deadly interne... 104Readers Oppo R9S in Australia: Never pay full price for a smartphone...

Maybe not‚ says FMF  Samsung Electronics was forced to discontinue the smartphone, originally intended to compete with Apple’s iPhone, after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire. The debacle cost the South Korean company billions in lost profit and reputational damage, in a torrid period which has also seen it embroiled in the corruption scandal that has resulted in President Park Geun-Hye’s impeachment. Internal and independent investigations “concluded that batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents“, Samsung said in a statement. “We sincerely apologise for the discomfort and concern we have caused to our customers,” Koh Dong-Jin, the head of its mobile business, told reporters in Seoul. Samsung Electronics is the most prominent unit of the giant Samsung group, South Korea’s largest conglomerate with a revenue equivalent to about a fifth of the country’s GDP. It announced a recall of 2.5 million units of the oversized Galaxy Note 7 in September 2016 after several devices exploded or caught fire, with the company blaming batteries from a supplier, widely believed to be its sister firm Samsung SDI. When replacement phones — with batteries from another firm, largely thought to be Chinese manufacturer ATL — also started to combust, the company eventually decided to kill off the Note 7 for good. As many as 1.9 million of the phones were sold in the United States, where authorities banned the device from use on planes and even from being placed in checked luggage. Aviation authorities around the world issued similar prohibitions. The firm has since embarked on a campaign to restore its battered reputation, issuing repeating apologies and putting full-page advertisements in prominent US newspapers including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post admitting that it “fell short” on its promises. The next model in the series, the Galaxy Note 8, had been expected to be unveiled at next month’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, but Koh said it would be delayed to ensure that it had no safety issues. Samsung deployed around 700 researchers and engineers on its investigation, testing more than 200,000 fully-assembled devices and more than 30,000 batteries, it said. It did not identify the battery makers on Monday, but independent investigators UL and Exponent agreed with the findings. Battery A had a design issue that pushed down the right corner of the battery, while Battery B had defective internal welds, said Kevin White, principal scientist at Exponent. But Koh dismissed the possibility of suing the manufacturers. “Whatever parts we use, the overall responsibility falls to us for failing to verify its safety and quality,” he said. “At this point, I don’t think it’s right to seek legal action. Around 1,000 different parts from some 450 suppliers were needed for each Galaxy Note 7. Samsung acknowledged that it provided the specifications for the batteries, adding in its statement: “We have taken several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again. The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture.” The fiasco took a major toll on the reputation of the firm, which is set to announce fourth-quarter and full-year results on Tuesday. It has estimated the cost of the recall at $5.3 billion, according to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency. Samsung Electronics shares were up 0.5% at 1.87 million won in Seoul on Monday morning after the announcement. The firm has separately been caught up in South Korea’s wide-ranging political corruption scandal, with prosecutors last week seeking the arrest of its vice-chairman Lee Jae-Yong on charges of bribery, embezzlement and perjury. Lee, who became Samsung’s de facto head after his father suffered a heart attack in 2014, is accused of bribing Choi Soon-Sil, Park’s secret confidante at the centre of the scandal, and receiving policy favours from Park in return. Samsung is the single biggest contributor to two non-profit foundations controlled by Choi, but a court rejected the arrest request on grounds of insufficient evidence.

Samsung is the single biggest contributor to two non-profit foundations controlled by Choi, but a court rejected the arrest request on grounds of insufficient evidence. advertisement In the headlines 36 government officials shared Shs6 billion oil bonus - MPs List tabled before parliamentary probe committee is dominated by officials from the Justice Col Kaka now new ISO boss Around 2014, he led Kalangala Fisheries Organisation (KAFO), a volunteer organisation fighting National Kayihura revokes Lwakataka gun licence   National Museveni warns wetland encroachers   National Schools set high S1 cut-off points   National Court rejects petition against MP Sekikubo   Advertisement National Chief Justice hits back at Kadaga over ‘stupid’ court order remarks National Makerere calls Mubs for crisis meet over graduation list National M23 men back at Bihanga barracks, army say Full Woman Moving on after losing hands and an eye to domestic violence Reviews & Profiles Arapapa on the path to new markets Advertisement Latest News National Police face 50,000 personnel shortage   National Three children dead, five bedridden as Bilharzia hits Mayuge   National FDC vets EALA candidates as party waits for House rules   National Herbalist accused of mutilating toddler   National FDC seeks to replace Muntu   National Danish man jailed 12 years for narcotics   National Byanyima again snubs police summons   Advertisement From The East African Comment What do we pay the new County officials?   Comment Waiting for Trump to be impeached or for the world to end   Comment Tin roofs and medical insurance: Rwanda’s small miracles   Opinion and Editorial ‘Not Another Silly Alliance!’   Comment Killing a snake or beating up a journalist?   Comment The army: Uganda’s abiding national obsession   News Museveni names new internal spymaster   Advertisement Web Mail e-Paper 93.3 KFM Business Directory Sqoop Dembefm NTV Uganda Africa Review The East African Daily Nation The Citizen Business Daily About us Contact us Advertise with Us Terms of Use Nation Media Group

What does it really mean? (Laughs) Calculation? It is not a calculation but a philosophy that depicts our way of life. 1+1=11. It is not Mathematics, instead, I call it Motomatics. People often get confused and ask me the meaning of this simple equation. It means, ‘Never give up’… It’s about going the extra-mile to make extraordinary moments out of ordinary situations and making the impossible, POSSIBLE. What have been the greatest challenges of your project in 2016? 2016 started for us on a very high and positive note. We sold our dream of the tallest residential building and Africa’s first fully automated building – LorenzoBySujimoto, to Nigerians and the world. Investors were thrilled by our ROI offering. The competition marveled at the audacity of our strides. As the list of our investors and friends has grown, so have our critics. Between January and December 2016, I had personally spoken to 1,850 investors & off-takers. 1,841 of them said ‘NO’. But, that didn’t discourage the entrepreneurship in me or make me lose focus on the Lorenzo dream. The dividend of reputation is a different type of currency. Something that’s been very clear is that, our investors and most importantly our off-takers would never lose their money, even, when it is clear that we are losing. I can tell you categorically that when one of our investors had an emergency need for his money, we had to refund about a hundred million naira. Money could be lost and easily regained. With Reputation, that is not so easy. Around April 2016, two of our major investors looked at the project, looked at the company, its leadership, identified the risk and mitigated it successfully. But when they looked at the economic situation, most importantly some government policies, they backed out immediately. One said Suji, if your project were in Togo, we would invest in it. I remember another saying, Suji, RISK we can mitigate, but UNCERTAINTY we can’t. In the last 365 days, my BP has risen from 110 to 150. There is no day that I wake up in the morning that I do not think about my company, my project and our dear country. At some point, I considered giving it all up. The biggest pain was when I had to let go of some of my best hands. To date, I call them and make myself available to help, whenever the need arises. But some things have kept me going; my mother, my brother Kanmi and my staff; their resolute hope, their unrelenting faith in the vision, and ultimately my faith, in the potential of this Country, we all call home. Tell us about LorenzoBySujimoto project. The Lorenzo is going to be the tallest residential building in Lagos, and the first fully automated building in Africa. It’s a lifestyle, where every square meter is an experience. Each apartment comes with two Armani or Pedini Kitchens, 2.6m doors, 4m floors to ceiling, virtual golf bar, two swimming pools (one of which is located on the 17th floor), tennis court, basketball, and 24-hour concierge service. The smallest apartment is 200m2. The Lorenzo can be likened to The Dorchester Hotel, even though it is an apartment property. We have studied the competitors in all other projects, and we have identified more than 11 different facilities and features that the Lorenzo has, which others do not. It is the only project today in Nigeria that’s promising investors 100% Returns on Investment. Nothing like this has been done anywhere else in Africa. Right now, we are finalising the financial aspect, which we are hoping to conclude before the end of next month. Hopefully, we’ll move to site by the end of April . In this recession, what makes you think people would want to take such kind of investment commitment? VALUE, ICONIC QUALITY REAL-ESTATE and RETURNS ON INVESTMENT. People are very optimistic about the project, and our existing Clients and prospects can’t wait for us to break ground. There’s nothing like Nigerians are broke, and can’t afford property worth a million USD. Yes, right now Nigerians are cautious and have created very effective spending policies. Nonetheless, most successful entrepreneurs know that even in crisis lies opportunity, a winning mindset requires long term vision, something which is rare to come by but necessary especially in times like this. People are still enquiring daily about the Lorenzo as well as our other projects. Just last month, I facilitated sales of two properties in Banana Island. Both of them amounted to about 8 Million USD. So yes, smart investors know that a recession is the best time to put money in real estate. There are rumours that you are cancelling the Lorenzo project. How true is that? That is impossible. The Lorenzo might have stalled, but make no mistake to think that we might jump ship, I am not Jonah. When we started, we knew things were going to be bad, but no economic Einstein could have predicted that the dollar would go from 180 to 500. That’s a 300% rise. But, that’s not enough to deter us form achieving this dream. One of our biggest strengths is the trust, which the Clients bestow on us. Cancelling this project would be direct evidence that we do not believe in the promise of true change that we made to the Nigerian people who are tired of inferior/substandard properties. The LorenzoBySujimoto project will stand. However, in order to ensure the project stands, we have reassessed our plans, reviewed all our decisions, and realised that one of our major setbacks in the grand scheme of things is the land location. We had to let go of the property and are now in talks with several landlords whom we want to do JVs with. What felt like an incarceration for us actually turned out to be a liberation. We will be moving to a larger space, with longer lease title. Is it not our elders who say ‘Many roads lead to the market?’ ’ Most importantly, note that the LorenzobySujimoto project will still be on Bourdillon road, just not at No16. What is the benefit of doing a Joint Venture as compared to owning the land in this situation? Some may say it is cheaper to own the land. But within this context, the advantage of a JV is most importantly, absolute transparency. The title document and all other documents would not be in my hand or the hands of the Landowner, but with a reputable Trustee. Also, bringing partners on board would reduce the weight of the project, as both parties would have shared responsibilities, which would mean efficiency during execution. I see this as a very positive and progressive step, given the current situation. Many people started their projects already. Why is yours stalling? The fact that someone started before you doesn’t mean they would do better than you, if that was the case, Nokia and Blackberry should have more ratings than Apple. Most projects, especially on Bourdillon all started their projects design way before us. Some of them started two years before us. But, that’s not an excuse. For us at Sujimoto, there are 3 fundamental principles of business. Number one is, the Customer is King. We envision and deliver exceptional products, striving for continuous and dedicated customer service. Secondly, our Employees. It is very critical to be encompassed by the right group of people who are hungry and passionate about our vision. Number Three is Competition. I can’t fight my Competitors. I learn from them. Our major intention when it comes to competitors is to study them and find ways of doing better than what they did, become the BEST, and never to compromise on quality. I am sure you have heard this saying, “It takes 6 days to assemble a Toyota, but 6 months to create a Rolls Royce.” In view of the current economic situation in the country, how have investors been responding to you? Over the last 7 months, I have spoken with more than 40 foreign investors. Every single one of them was skeptical about Nigeria; not the economy per se, but the inconsistency of government policies. We have finally seen a private investor from the Middle East who is willing to inject about 32 Million USD into the project at 4.2%. This for us is great news. Once this takes effect, we will stop selling, until the 26-story structure is standing. This is good for our early investors, because by the time we start selling back, the prices would have increased by 50%. It’s important to also note that we have finalised a building Joint Construction Agreement with one of the best Luxury builders in Spain/Qatar. Why did we not hire a local contractor or give the construction to a local company? Well, most of our subcontractors, almost 85% would be Nigerians, indigenous companies. However, we must not hide from the fact that Lorenzo is an extreme high-end luxury project with facilities and functionalities which make it similar to a 5star hotel (mind you, it’s not a hotel). We needed a company with advanced experience in building hotels, and we are glad we have this Company on board. What’s your experience with our Local banks? I don’t usually like to comment but, let me say that there are some few progressive leaders in the banking industry who believe in buffetism. That is, seeing the intrinsic value in human capital. But many have argued that this is not a great time to invest, especially in terms of luxury investments. For us at Sujimoto, our first intention is to create a platform that will give investors the best returns on their investments. In this economy, where money is scarce and obtaining funds is comparable to fighting war, we have nevertheless, been able to raise more than 1billion Naira. This is testimony of the trust that society has placed upon us. NOW is the best time to invest in value, in something substantial not in common, cheap crap. Crap becomes difficult to sell because everyone has it, but true luxury is rare yet easy to sell. Furthermore, there’s no better time to buy or build than now. Construction is cheaper than ever and the price of materials has not risen excessively. We are receiving discounts from several contractors and by the time we finalise our construction towards the end of 2019, we are optimistic that our country’s economic situation would have improved. Moreover, I must not forget to mention that this is also an effective way to hedge your naira against the dollar. What’s your opinion about other projects in Ikoyi, Bourdillon, VI, and Waterfronts etc.? I see lots of nice projects coming up, and if I were an investor who wanted a basic property with a diversified portfolio, I would buy some of them. But, permit me to say that they come nowhere close to the Lorenzo; LorenzoBySujimoto is like a Rolls Royce. But then, most of these ‘nice projects’ end up becoming empty apartments within Ikoyi. How viable do you think the luxury real estate market really is? Create sugar and ants will come. What’s the Sugar here? Integrity, Diligence, Innovation, putting customers first, and going the extra-mile.  Like I said before, one can sell luxury and one can sell a crap. By all means luxury is easier to sell, because it communicates long-term value and offers multiple returns on investment. There may be empty apartments. But, I tell you categorically, the luxury apartments, which offer true value for money, are not empty. Are Tango Towers, Ultimate towers and No. 2 Thompson empty? That tells you that value doesn’t sit on the shelf. It sells itself. What do you think about Nigeria and its potential? The best way to answer this question is to take a look at the United Arab Emirate, which was a land of sand and dust, but through vision and great leadership was transformed into a magnificent jungle of marble and towers, where the sky was not the limit. Nigeria on the other hand, is a land rich in natural resources and manpower, but wallowing in poverty and depravity. Someone once said; “An army of sheep, led by a lion, can defeat an army of lions led by a sheep. The difference is quality of leadership. I am very patriotic and I am a nationalist. I still have hope in the promises of Awolowo, the industrialisation offered by Azikwe and exceptional leadership of Tafawa Balewa. I have strong belief in the potential of this country, and I will be here to experience its dividends. So, what is your recipe for doing business successfully in Nigeria? I won’t lie doing business in Nigeria takes guts and lots of courage. For starters Our banks could be more helpful. But, for that to happen they need a total reform, not only of policy but mind set, because without the right support, many dreams would just die unrealised. Look at the Apple brand, the success it basks in today is not due to Steve jobs and his partner coming from wealthy homes or having powerful uncles, instead its due to them having great ideas and receiving the necessary support from established financial institutions. As far back as 1977, Steve Jobs was able to secure a bank loan of $250,000 USD. How many startups in Nigeria can hope to secure even a minimal $25,000 loan? Jack Ma of AliBaba got rejected by banks 77 times, but today he’s worth about 21 billion dollars. So as far as I am concerned, our philosophy is be a man of our word, let it be our bond, put quality first, nurture our dream until it becomes an empire that inspires my generation. So, you are saying that you regret your nationality … (Cuts in) Of course not! I am proud to be Nigerian. If I die today and comeback, I would never want to be Togolese, Ghanaian or South African. Nigerians are uniquely resilient people. Just consider that we generate our own lights, source our own water, maximise our own security and often build our own roads. We have produced world-class citizens who can compete against any standard in the world. Look at Aliko Dangote, Ms. Alakija, Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka, the great writer Chinua Achebe, and the legendary Fela Anikulapo Kuti. We achieved great things even with all the challenges we had to face. What do you think would have happened to Nigerians if we had the complete infrastructure that we truly needed? I keep telling my South African friends. Let’s do a swap for a day. Let all South Africans come to Nigeria, and we Nigerians go to South Africa. Then we’ll truly see what greatness the creativity of the average Nigerian can breed, if given the right opportunity. Olajumoke spoke recently about your gestures to her, sparking rumours of ulterior motives. What are your views on this? The Olajumoke story is an African story. Do you know what it is to move from sleeping on a bakery floor to sleeping into a 3bed apartment, or eat 3 full meals a day? Anyone who has had a rough and poor beginning, anyone who understands that ‘if your neighbor is hungry, your chicken is not safe’, anyone who believes in the alleviation of poverty, would understand why I helped that girl and her family. For me, I saw my mother in Olajumoke, a woman like many families who came to Lagos in search of opportunities. Olajumoke for us is a lifetime project; we would help her till she’s able to stand-alone and help others. So, how was the festive season? Let’s talk about all your gifts. (laughs) You know what? In December 2015, we brought about 3 billion naira into the banking system. In 2015, I gave out about 300 gifts, while I got about 20 presents. This year I gave out about a 100 gifts to people that had a direct impact on our organisation. In 2016, we had a cash flow of about 2 Billion naira in our bank. Guess how many gifts I received? Just TWO – from a friend and a Client. Sadly I received nothing from my bankers (sarcastic tone). I’m not upset. Respect, I have learnt, is a rare commodity, which now, is safe to say, this bank no longer deserves from me. As for Nigerians, they are just reminding me that I need to work harder. (laughs) What’s your plan for the LorenzoBySujimoto project in 2017, and what’s your message to Investors? Without the tough experiences of 2016, my entrepreneurial journey would have been, at best, shallow. So, I’m glad I went through these hard times, for they have shaped our company and me. 2017 is already looking bright for us, as we have finalised talks with our Saudi Investors. We have stopped selling Lorenzo for now until we break-ground around April May. We also have another small 20-townhouse project in Banana Island, and a low-cost boutique hotel in Ikoyi. We are doing something exceptional and unique in Victoria Island. It’s a secret for now. 2017 is our year of restoration. To all our Local and International partners, Investors and friends, I would like to say: ‘Thank you’ for believing in the Sujimoto Values and Vision. Let’s work together to make 2017, even better and more beneficial for us all!” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share via Email In this article: Sijibomi OgundeleThe Lorenzo You may also like ‘The church is accountable to God’ 3 days ago  Interview ‘NJC is not up to date with disciplining of judges’ 4 days ago  Interview We have developed the right energy mix for Nigeria, says Fashola 18 Jan 11  Interview Gabon 2017 Updates Top stories of the week 1 Nigeria’s petrol import drops by nine million litres in 2016 2 Ghana ready for Pharaohs in today’s last group game 3 Ex-VP, Atiku’s campaign poster floods Kebbi 4 Northern governors, emirs move to fight poverty, insecurity 5 FG releases N72b full counterpart funding for Lagos-Ibadan rail Contributor Rotimi Fawole Still on guaranteed unconditional transferability Exchange Monitor Currency Interbank Rate Parallel Rate USD 306 498 GBP 375 597 EUR 325 522 Last Modified: January 24, 2017 at 8:39 am Latest Imo Air born, to be operated by Dana 38 mins ago  Aviation French presidential favourite Fillon paid wife as aide 41 mins ago  World 2017 Budget: $42 crude oil benchmark will create room for savings in ECA -Commission 1 hour ago 1  Business News Kidnappers release kidnapped students, teachers 1 hour ago  Breaking News Spotlight Osinbajo inaugurates MSMEs clinics, booklet to boost business activities 1 hour ago 1  Nigeria Get the latest news and analysis of issues from Nigeria, Africa and around the world, direct into your inbox, daily Subscribe Now Stock Monitor UBA UNITED BANK FOR AFRICA PLC -0.06% N5.10   ACCESS ACCESS BANK PLC. -0.05% N7.00   PRESCO PRESCO PLC   — N44.12   DIAMONDBNK DIAMOND BANK PLC   — N1.08   ZENITHBANK ZENITH INTERNATIONAL BANK PLC -0.55% N15.40   NESTLE NESTLE NIGERIA PLC. +29.00% N749.00   SEPLAT SEPLAT PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LTD +15.00% N380.00   GUINNESS GUINNESS NIG PLC +2.50% N71.00   UACN U A C N PLC. +0.81% N17.13   STANBIC STANBIC IBTC HOLDINGS PLC +0.66% N16.80   7UP 7-UP BOTTLING COMP.

The world’s biggest smartphone maker Samsung blamed faulty batteries on January 23 for the fires that led to last year’s humiliating recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 device. / AFP PHOTO / YONHAP / South Korea The world’s biggest smartphone maker Samsung blamed faulty batteries on Monday for the fires that led to last year’s humiliating recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 device. Samsung Electronics was forced to discontinue the smartphone, originally intended to compete with Apple’s iPhone, after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire. The debacle cost the South Korean company billions in lost profit and reputational damage, in a torrid period which has also seen it embroiled in the corruption scandal that has resulted in President Park Geun-Hye’s impeachment. ADVERTISEMENT Internal and independent investigations “concluded that batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents”, Samsung said in a statement. “We sincerely apologize for the discomfort and concern we have caused to our customers,” Koh Dong-Jin, the head of its mobile business, told reporters in Seoul. Samsung Electronics is the most prominent unit of the giant Samsung group, South Korea’s largest conglomerate with a revenue equivalent to about a fifth of the country’s GDP. It announced a recall of 2.5 million units of the oversized Galaxy Note 7 in September 2016 after several devices exploded or caught fire, with the company blaming batteries from a supplier, widely believed to be its sister firm Samsung SDI. When replacement phones — with batteries from another firm, largely thought to be Chinese manufacturer ATL — also started to combust, the company eventually decided to kill off the Note 7 for good. As many as 1.9 million of the phones were sold in the United States, where authorities banned the device from use on planes and even from being placed in checked luggage. Aviation authorities around the world issued similar prohibitions. The firm has since embarked on a campaign to restore its battered reputation, issuing repeating apologies and putting full-page advertisements in prominent US newspapers including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post admitting that it “fell short” on its promises. The next model in the series, the Galaxy S8, had been expected to be unveiled at next month’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, but Koh said it would be delayed to ensure that it had no safety issues. No legal action Samsung deployed around 700 researchers and engineers on its investigation, testing more than 200,000 fully-assembled devices and more than 30,000 batteries, it said. It did not identify the battery makers on Monday, but independent investigators UL and Exponent agreed with the findings. Battery A had a design issue that pushed down the right corner of the battery, while Battery B had defective internal welds, said Kevin White, principal scientist at Exponent. But Koh dismissed the possibility of suing the manufacturers. “Whatever parts we use, the overall responsibility falls to us for failing to verify its safety and quality,” he said. “At this point, I don’t think it’s right to seek legal action. Around 1,000 different parts from some 450 suppliers were needed for each Galaxy Note 7. Samsung acknowledged that it provided the specifications for the batteries, adding in its statement: “We have taken several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again. The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture.” The fiasco took a major toll on the reputation of the firm, which is set to announce fourth-quarter and full-year results on Tuesday. It has estimated the cost of the recall at $5.3 billion, according to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency. Samsung Electronics shares were up 0.5 percent at 1.87 million won in Seoul on Monday morning after the announcement. The firm has separately been caught up in South Korea’s wide-ranging political corruption scandal, with prosecutors last week seeking the arrest of its vice-chairman Lee Jae-Yong on charges of bribery, embezzlement and perjury. Lee, who became Samsung’s de facto head after his father suffered a heart attack in 2014, is accused of bribing Choi Soon-Sil, Park’s secret confidante at the center of the scandal, and receiving policy favors from Park in return. Samsung is the single biggest contributor to two non-profit foundations controlled by Choi, but a court rejected the arrest request on grounds of insufficient evidence. play_circle_filled Nintendo reboots with new Switch game console January 15, 2017 play_circle_filled Avatar-style South Korean manned robot takes first baby steps January 04, 2017 play_circle_filled 'Heart-in-a-box' device helps save lives January 04, 2017 play_circle_filled Inquirer yearender: How will technology continue to revolutionize people’s lives?

The National Weather Service has issued a high wind warning for the Big Apple and southern New York state. Two to three inches of rain is expected to pour over the region. Northeast winds will likely blow 30-40mph with some gusts topping 60-70mph. The service mentions that a high wind warning means: 'damaging winds will blow down trees and power lines. Numerous power outages are expected.' There may be power outages in NYC as winds may hit 60-70mph on Monday. Pictured above, a cloudy day in the city on Sunday The northeast storm could cause power outages in NYC with winds blowing 60-70pmh New York is expected to get 2-3 inches of rain tomorrow in addition to the high winds 'Travel will be difficult, especially for high profile vehicles and on elevated roadway and bridges.'  The high wind warning begins at 1am Monday morning and ends 1am Tuesday EST. The worst winds will blow Monday afternoon and evening. Governor Andrew Cuomo warned New Yorkers in a statement: 'As this storm could cause power outages across downstate and flooding for communities near the coastline, I am directing all relevant state agencies to be on alert and ready to respond to whatever Mother Nature throws our way.' 'We will be closely monitoring storm conditions and deploying resources and equipment as necessary. I encourage all New Yorkers in these areas to plan ahead, avoid unnecessary travel, and above all else — stay safe.' High winds will affect the northeast tomorrow with some gusts reaching 60-70mph Rain is not expected to freeze tomorrow with temperatures staying in the low 40s Electricity provider Con Edison warned east coasters to be wary of fallen power lines.  Joseph Esposito, New York City's Emergency Management Commissioner said: 'We’re urging New Yorkers to use extra caution when outdoors Monday and allow for extra travel time during tomorrow’s commutes.' 'Coastal residents in vulnerable neighborhoods should take steps to protect their property ahead of this storm.' At least the rain shouldn't freeze in NYC tomorrow with temperatures expected to stay between 40 and 43 degrees. However, snow is expected to affect upstate New York and New England according to the Weather Channel.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Tom Brady is going to the Super Bowl! Patriots star POSES...

In the smartphone era, the journey from futuristic fantasy to everyday nuisance is short. When the Motorola Atrix 4G made phones with fingerprint scanners widely available in 2011, then when the iPhone 5S made them very widely available two years later, it was the sort of thing you would hungrily unpack the box to play with. Now, if a scanner gets your attention at all, it’s because the blasted thing won’t work. Right now especially. For many people, it is a winter ritual to place a thumb on the sensor, then place it again, then again, then try a finger instead and ... oh, forget it, just pretend it’s still 2011 and enter the code! As Apple explains, and as we all know: “Moisture, lotions, sweat, oils, cuts or dry skin might affect fingerprint recognition.” So might “certain activities ... including exercising, showering, swimming, cooking”. Which is just a typically wholesome day, of course, in the life of an iPhone user.

This is not because your phone is cold (although subzero temperatures can slow it down) or, per se, because your skin is. The issue here is cold weather actually changing your fingerprint enough to make it unrecognisable. This may in part be a matter of the tiny skin ridges stiffening temporarily. More often, it is a matter of your skin being dried and roughened by exposure to cold air, which alters the print shape and changes its conductivity. (The mechanics of optical, capacitative and ultrasonic fingerprint scanners are too complex to explain in the space available. This is a narrow escape because they are also too complex for me to understand.) Happily, there are many possible solutions. One is to use a lot of hand cream, and try to keep your fingertips summery and youthful. Another is to teach your phone the “fingerprints” of your gloves. Indeed, there are gloves made specifically for this purpose. Some people have even found that you can record a nose print instead of a finger, although it is not clear that the skin on your nose is any more resilient. Probably the best solution overall is to install a new set of “winter fingerprints” with your worn fingers, much as you might switch to a winter wardrobe. And just as classy, I’m sure you will agree.

Amazon and Google always thrive in the fourth quarter as people get out their wallets for Christmas. Both companies – or in Google’s case, its parent group, Alphabet – are therefore expected to announce booming revenues in their fourth-quarter results over the next fortnight, with Alphabet going first on Thursday and Amazon the following week. But analysts are already looking beyond the simple question of how many cardboard boxes Amazon filled and how many searches Google answered. They’re wondering which company will win the battle to control your home. That battle is being fought by two carafe-sized cylinders from the respective companies. One is Amazon’s Echo, with its voice-operated “personal assistant”, Alexa; the other is Google Home, which responds to the phrase “OK Google”. Both are internet-connected, home-based devices which can be command to do things: give the weather forecast; play music; read out news headlines; update shopping lists; and control “smart” devices in the home such as light bulbs or power points. In theory, if a device can be linked to it, the Echo can control or monitor it, and keep you informed. And simply by saying “Alexa, add sugar to the shopping list”, users can keep up to date on house supplies and even purchase them directly. Popular Searches Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 63.52 +0.56 +0.89% Verizon Communications Inc VZ ▼ 50.12 -2.29 -4.37% Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA ▲ 101.43 +3.02 +3.07% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 67.40 +0.75 +1.13% Amazon is in the lead, having launched the Echo in November 2014, two years before Google Home came out. Though Amazon has not – and does not – release sales figures for any individual item, investment bank Morgan Stanley estimates that 11m Echos had been sold by the end of November 2016; other estimates suggest a further 7m have been sold since. About 700,000 were estimated to have been sold in the UK and Germany, the only countries outside the US where it is available. The Morgan Stanley estimate would put an Echo in more than 8% of US households. This is a significant figure, especially compared with the best estimates for Google Home, which put its sales at less than a million since its launch in October 2016. Why should Google care about Amazon? Because voice is seen as the next big field for computer interaction, and the home is a far better environment for voice detection than the great outdoors. Research company Gartner reckons that by 2018, 30% of all interactions with devices will be voice-based, because people can speak up to four times faster than they can type, and the technology behind voice interaction is improving all the time. The risk to Google is that at the moment, almost everyone starting a general search at home begins at Google’s home page on a PC or phone. That leads to a results page topped by text adverts – which help generate about 90% of Google’s revenue, and probably more of its profits. But if people begin searching or ordering goods via an Echo, bypassing Google, that ad revenue will fall. And Google has cause to be uncomfortable. The shift from desktop to mobile saw the average number of searches per person fall as people moved to dedicated apps; Google responded by adding more ads to both desktop and search pages, juicing revenues. A shift that cut out the desktop in favour of voice-oriented search, or no search at all, would imperil its lucrative revenue stream. Amazon is copying one feature of Google’s success in smartphones: it is offering methods to connect and control smart devices via the Echo for free, rather as Google’s Android software was offered as a free platform for smartphones. There are signs it is paying off: Wynn hotels in Las Vegas announced in December that it would be adding Echos to all 5,000 rooms, for functions such as playing music and controlling curtains and blinds. That gained some notice, as much as anything because the life cycle of such hotels implies they will be there for a decade or so. Similarly, at January’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES), also in Las Vegas, commentators were struck by how many devices incorporated Alexa. And Amazon is even stealing into Google’s territory: some phones sold in the US from China’s Huawei, which uses Android, will incorporate Alexa rather than Google’s Assistant programme. Google’s natural reaction is to have its own voice-driven home system, in Home. But that poses a difficulty, illustrated by the problems it claims to solve. At the device’s launch, one presenter from the company explained how it could speak the answer to questions such as “how do you get wine stains out of a rug?” Most people would pose that question on a PC or mobile, and the results page would offer a series of paid-for ads. On Home, you just get the answer – without ads. What analysts wonder is: how can Home bridge that revenue gap? So far, Google hasn’t explained. Even if it can fend off the Echo, it may not be able to defend its core business. By contrast, the Echo’s benefit to Amazon is much clearer: it can make online shopping (at Amazon) a breeze, play music from Amazon’s paid-for subscription service, and generally act as a passive block on your using rival shopping sites – rather as Google cemented its dominance by being the default search engine on multiple browsers in the mid-2000s. Richard Windsor of Edison Investment Research suggests that time is running out for Google: “It has to act quickly, as Amazon is on the brink of becoming the industry standard for controlling smart home devices. “At CES, everyone was integrating with Echo, with Google Home and Apple HomeKit barely present.” Indeed, where are Apple and Microsoft, which also have their own voice-driven assistants in the form of Siri and Cortana? Although both can be used in the home – Siri on the iPhone or iPad, and to play content on the Apple TV set-top box, and Cortana on the Xbox games console – neither seems to be intent on the “home assistant” market. Phil Schiller, Apple’s vice-president of marketing, seemed to suggest recently that Apple wouldn’t follow Amazon and Google into offering a voice-only device: “Having my iPhone with me as the thing I speak to is better than something stuck in my kitchen or on a wall somewhere.” He also emphasised the importance of a visual display: “We still like to take pictures and we need to look at them, and a disembodied voice is not going to show me what the picture is.” Even so, there are persistent rumours that Apple has prototyped an Echo-like device in secret but is undecided on whether to release it. The company hasn’t commented. It could be ready to unveil something – or may never do so. Microsoft, meanwhile, is in more homes than the Echo via the Xbox, but isn’t trying to make itself a listening device linked to a shop. So, will we all be burbling away to thin air in a few years, asking how long our commute will take while our smartphones sit unused in the kitchen? Perhaps – though Ken Sena, a senior analyst at investment bank Evercore ISI, suggests that home-based voice assistants will never be used as widely as smartphones. According to Sena, they are not such a must-have. Yet, they were a hot Christmas present – and voice interaction is still in its early days, perhaps comparable to the smartphone market in 2005, when BlackBerry, Palm and Microsoft dominated. Or, it could be like the smartphone market now, effectively dominated by Google and Apple. But which? Alexa, can you see into the future?

X Close Nation Home > News > Nation < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 23 January 2017 | MYT 12:43 PM Samsung confirms faulty batteries cause Note 7 fires SEOUL (AFP): The world’s biggest smartphone maker Samsung on Monday blamed faulty batteries for the fires that led to last year’s humiliating recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 device. Internal and independent investigations “concluded that batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents”, the South Korean company said in a statement. The giant conglomerate was forced to discontinue the smartphone - originally intended to compete with Apple’s iPhone - after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire. The debacle cost the company billions in lost profit and reputational damage. ”We sincerely apologise for the discomfort and concern we have caused to our customers,” Koh Dong-Jin, the head of Samsung’s mobile business, told reporters in Seoul. Samsung acknowledged that it provided the specifications for the batteries, adding in its statement: “We are taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of battery design and manufacturing. ”We have taken several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again.” It deployed around 700 researchers and engineers on its investigation, testing more than 200,000 fully-assembled devices and more than 30,000 batteries, it said. Samsung announced a recall of 2.5 million units of the oversized Galaxy Note 7 in September 2016 after several devices exploded or caught fire, with the company blaming batteries from a supplier, widely believed to be its sister firm Samsung SDI. When replacement phones - with batteries from another firm, largely thought to be Chinese manufacturer ATL - also started to combust, the company eventually decided to kill off the Note 7 for good. The fiasco took a major toll on the reputation of the firm, which is set to announce fourth-quarter and full-year results on Tuesday. It promised to reform its production and quality controls to prevent a similar crisis, and said Monday: “The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture.” Samsung shares were up 0.5 percent at 1.87 million won in Seoul on Monday morning after the announcement. Samsung’s English-language Samsung statement referred only to Galaxy Note 7 “incidents” but in Korean it spoke of “damage by fire”.

(Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters) Related Stories Samsung's flammable phone scandal may cause consumers to hang up on them forever Taking a flight? No Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones allowed on Canadian, U.S. carriers Samsung exec wins court ruling in Korea scandal probe, but could still be indicted Samsung Electronics said Monday that after testing more than 200,000 Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, it found defects in two sets of batteries from two different manufacturers made the devices prone to catch fire. Samsung's mobile division president, Koh Dong-jin, ruled out any problems with other aspects of the Note 7, either in its hardware or its software. He denied the South Korean company, had rushed to release the premium phone to beat Apple's release of its new iPhone. The Note 7 was launched on Aug. 2, about a week earlier than its predecessor in 2015. Samsung discontinued the Note 7 just two months later in one of its worst product fiascos ever. It said that in ferreting out the cause of the problem, 700 researchers and engineers tested more than 200,000 devices and more than 30,000 batteries and replicated what happened with the Note 7 phones. ANALYSIS Note 7 fire debacle couldn't come at worse time ​Samsung Galaxy Note 7 banned from Canadian, U.S. flights U.S. companies UL and Exponent also examined the batteries supplied by South Korea-based Samsung SDI and China-based Amperex Technology Ltd., or ATL. The German company TUV Rheinland analyzed the Note 7 supply chain as part of the investigation, Samsung said. Samsung permanently dropped its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones October after reports they were overheating and catching fire. The company estimates the problems will cost it at least $5.3 billion US through early 2017. (Ahn Young-joon/Associated Press) The Galaxy Note 7 featured one of the biggest battery capacities so far for smartphones at 3,500 mAh, or milliampere hour, which gave it the highest energy density of all Samsung's devices. Koh said Samsung and the outside inspectors found no evidence that the high energy density alone had made the phones prone to overheating. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. A highly technical explanation of Note 7 problems boiled down to the relatively large batteries not fitting well into the phones, and not enough insulating material inside. In batteries by one manufacturer — likely Samsung SDI — used in the phones in the initial Note 7 recall, inspectors found damage to upper corners. That, combined with thin separators and high energy density, caused the phones to overheat. The cell-pouch design of the battery did not include enough room to safely accommodate its electrodes — another flaw. Pressed suppliers for innovation It was unclear to what extent the battery maker was responsible for those problems: Samsung said only that it had provided "targets" for the batteries. "We suggested that the Note 7 has innovations and a compact design and a 3500 mAh (battery) but we did not know how to make the separators within (the battery) or how many millimetres thick they should be," Koh told reporters. That may suggest a breakdown both in communication between Samsung and its suppliers and in quality control and testing. In other batches of batteries from a second manufacturer, presumably ATL, the researchers found welding defects and a lack of protective tape in some battery cells. Though it faulted the batteries from its suppliers, Samsung said in a statement "we provided the target for the battery specifications for the innovative Note 7, and we are taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of battery design and manufacturing." Koh said Samsung would treat the event as a "chance to strengthen the safety of lithium-ion batteries for the entire industry, not only us." Recalls of the Note 7s began in September after reports emerged that some of the phones were overheating and catching fire. At the time, Samsung blamed a flaw in the lithium batteries from one of its two suppliers, without saying which manufacturer was to blame. In October, Samsung dropped the phone for good after new Note 7s with different batteries issued as replacements also were found to be catching fire. It estimates the problems will cost it at least $5.3 billion through early 2017. The company has recalled 3.06 million Note 7 phones. About four per cent, or 120,000 units, of the recalled Galaxy Note 7, are still not returned. Samsung has taken heat for its handling of the recall and its hasty, apparently incomplete initial investigation into what went wrong. The company has said it is planning the release of its next generation Galaxy phones. To do so, it needed to definitively resolve the mystery over the Note 7. © The Associated Press, 2017 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Top News Headlines Trump gives OK to Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines read comments video Trudeau cabinet welcomes Trump's Keystone XL decision video There's no place like home: NASA releases beautiful satellite photos of Earth Teen dead 2 weeks, but school twice sends family automated notice he is absent Bodies exhumed of 2 seniors allegedly killed by nurse Latest Technology & Science News Headlines Tech companies note need for diversity, but there's been little progress Cruise ship passengers to visit HMS Erebus wreck this summer read comments Is the pen mightier than the mouse?

Samsung recalled and eventually discontinued it after numerous reports of it overheating and bursting into flames. Initially, Samsung said it found a small error in the manufacturing process for some of the batteries in the phones was to blame. It replaced the phones with a new battery but those replaced phones also overheated and caught fire, prompting Samsung to pull the phones from the market. That cost Samsung at least $5 billion.

Samsung Electronics was forced to discontinue the smartphone, originally intended to compete with Apple's iPhone, after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire. The debacle cost the South Korean company billions in lost profit and reputational damage, in a torrid period which has also seen it embroiled in the corruption scandal that has resulted in President Park Geun-Hye's impeachment. Internal and independent investigations "concluded that batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents", Samsung said in a statement. "We sincerely apologise for the discomfort and concern we have caused to our customers," Koh Dong-Jin, the head of its mobile business, told reporters in Seoul. Samsung Electronics is the most prominent unit of the giant Samsung group, South Korea's largest conglomerate with a revenue equivalent to about a fifth of the country's GDP. It announced a recall of 2.5 million units of the oversized Galaxy Note 7 in September 2016 after several devices exploded or caught fire, with the company blaming batteries from a supplier, widely believed to be its sister firm Samsung SDI. When replacement phones -- with batteries from another firm, largely thought to be Chinese manufacturer ATL -- also started to combust, the company eventually decided to kill off the Note 7 for good. As many as 1.9 million of the phones were sold in the United States, where authorities banned the device from use on planes and even from being placed in checked luggage. Aviation authorities around the world issued similar prohibitions. The firm has since embarked on a campaign to restore its battered reputation, issuing repeating apologies and putting full-page advertisements in prominent US newspapers including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post admitting that it "fell short" on its promises. The next model in the series, the Galaxy Note 8, had been expected to be unveiled at next month's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, but Koh said it would be delayed to ensure that it had no safety issues. - No legal action - Samsung deployed around 700 researchers and engineers on its investigation, testing more than 200,000 fully-assembled devices and more than 30,000 batteries, it said. It did not identify the battery makers on Monday, but independent investigators UL and Exponent agreed with the findings. Battery A had a design issue that pushed down the right corner of the battery, while Battery B had defective internal welds, said Kevin White, principal scientist at Exponent. But Koh dismissed the possibility of suing the manufacturers. "Whatever parts we use, the overall responsibility falls to us for failing to verify its safety and quality," he said. "At this point, I don't think it's right to seek legal action. Around 1,000 different parts from some 450 suppliers were needed for each Galaxy Note 7. Samsung acknowledged that it provided the specifications for the batteries, adding in its statement: "We have taken several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again. The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture." The fiasco took a major toll on the reputation of the firm, which is set to announce fourth-quarter and full-year results on Tuesday. It has estimated the cost of the recall at $5.3 billion, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. Samsung Electronics shares were up 0.5 percent at 1.87 million won in Seoul on Monday morning after the announcement. The firm has separately been caught up in South Korea's wide-ranging political corruption scandal, with prosecutors last week seeking the arrest of its vice-chairman Lee Jae-Yong on charges of bribery, embezzlement and perjury. Lee, who became Samsung's de facto head after his father suffered a heart attack in 2014, is accused of bribing Choi Soon-Sil, Park's secret confidante at the centre of the scandal, and receiving policy favours from Park in return. Samsung is the single biggest contributor to two non-profit foundations controlled by Choi, but a court rejected the arrest request on grounds of insufficient evidence.

Samsung Electronics Co. said Monday, Jan. 23, 2017, that problems with the design and manufacturing of batteries in its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones caused them to overheat and burst into fire. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) SEOUL, Korea, Republic Of – Samsung Electronics said Monday that after testing more than 200,000 Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, it found defects in two sets of batteries from two different manufacturers made the devices prone to catch fire.

It said that in ferreting out the cause of the problem, 700 hundred researchers and engineers tested more than 200,000 devices and more than 30,000 batteries and replicated what happened with the Note 7 phones. U.S. companies UL and Exponent also examined the batteries supplied by South Korea-based Samsung SDI and China-based Amperex Technology Ltd., or ATL.

Samsung announced tighter quality controls and more rigorous testing and took responsibility for failing to ensure that design specifications given to its suppliers were failsafe. The South Korean company was also delaying its next Galaxy phone, the Galaxy S8, which is usually announced in February. The spontaneous fires, many chronicled in videos circulated on YouTube, prompted Samsung to recall millions of phones and take a $5.3 billion hit on its earnings -- and an unknown amount in reputation. While praising Samsung's frankness and apologies, analysts question whether the world's largest smartphone maker has really gotten to the bottom of the problem in blaming flaws in the design and production of batteries. "Samsung said the weaknesses could make the phone prone to catch fire. That I understand, but what did trigger fires in such conditions? Did they discuss if there is another cause? No," said Park Chul Wan, a former director of the next generation battery research centre at the state-owned Korea Electronics Technology Institute. Forrester analyst Frank Gillett said the company's emphasis seems to be on detecting problems in manufacturing, not preventing design problems earlier. The company, he said, needs to find ways to prevent commercial pressures, such as getting a phone out quickly, from causing engineers to make bad decisions. Samsung's Note 7 was timed, in part, to beat Apple's iPhone 7 by weeks. Ramon Llamas, an analyst at research firm IDC, said he would like to see Samsung show more of a "human side" to solving its problem and say what it's doing to work with consumers affected by this. During a two-hour press conference livestreamed in English, Chinese and Korean, Samsung said tests involving more than 200,000 phones and 30,000 batteries showed different problems with both kinds of batteries used in the Note 7. Though some experts had speculated that the phones' ultra-thin design or water-resistant features could have made them prone to overheat, Samsung says the investigation found no such problems. Samsung also ruled out software or design with the rest of the phone's hardware, as well as the supply chain. The Note 7 has one of the biggest battery capacities for a smartphone, but Samsung said the company and outside inspectors found no evidence that the high energy density alone was to blame. Samsung introduced the Note 7 on Aug. 2 and weeks later recalled the first batch after reports emerged that the phones were overheating and in some cases exploding. After replacement phones also started catching fire, aviation authorities banned them on flights and the company dropped the product for good. Having received complaints for failing to fix the problem after the first recall, Samsung brought in three private inspectors to help. Inspectors found damage to the upper corners of batteries made by one manufacturer -- likely sister company Samsung SDI -- and used in the initial batches of Note 7s. That, combined with overly thin separators and high energy density, caused the phones to overheat, Samsung said. The cell-pouch design of the battery also did not have enough space to safely accommodate its electrodes -- another flaw. In other batches of batteries from a second manufacturer, presumably China-based ATL, used in replacements for the recalled smartphones, the researchers found welding defects and a lack of protective tape in some battery cells. Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights & Strategy, said the odds of two different suppliers having issues with the same phone are extremely low. The case "may signal we may have reached an inflection point in smartphone battery technology," Moorhead said. Though Samsung faulted the batteries from its suppliers, it said it would bear all costs. It was unclear to what extent the battery makers were responsible, as Samsung said only that it had provided "targets," such as capacity and thickness. That may suggest a breakdown in communication between Samsung and its suppliers and in quality control and testing. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire because of lithium battery problems. Manufacturers like the batteries because they weigh less and pack much more energy into the same space than other batteries. But they are also more susceptible to overheating if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Koh Dong-jin, president of Samsung's mobile division, said Samsung would use what it learned from its investigations to improve lithium battery safety for the industry. To avoid further problems, Samsung said it was introducing an eight-point battery safety check with more intense durability tests; a new test on accelerated usage and a charge and discharge test. The tighter safety measures will be implemented in "every element of the company's devices," it said, including overall design and materials used. Samsung said it also will seek advice on battery safety and innovation from a group of battery experts. The company has recalled 3.06 million Note 7 phones. About 4 per cent, or 120,000 units, of the recalled Galaxy Note 7s have not been returned. AP Technology Writer Barbara Ortutay contributed to this story from New York.

Breaking with tradition, the Korean electronics giant said it won’t unveil its latest flagship Galaxy S phone at Mobile World Congress at the end of February. The delay comes as the Samsung boss said the company needs to regain consumer trust after the botched release of the high-end Note 7. It also follows the long-awaited results of Samsung's investigation into the Note 7 fires, caused by a battery fault, which led to a global recall and $5.3bn (£4.2bn) being wiped from its operating profit. Images of blown up Samsung Note 7 handsets spread across social media  Credit: AP “The lessons of this incident are deeply reflected in our culture and process,” said Koh Dong-jin, Samsung’s chief executive. “Samsung Electronics will be working hard to regain consumer trust.” The S8 is expected to have a new design with a larger screen that fills the front of the device. Samsung is said to be ditching the physical home button to make room for the larger screen, which could use organic light-emitting diode technology and be the first mobile phone with a 4K screen, a high quality resolution to date reserved for televisions and computer monitors. Other reports suggest the flagship handset could be waterproof and come without a headphone jack, following Apple’s lead with the iPhone 7. Analysts expect the S8's delay, which arose in part because Samsung engineers were investigating the Note 7’s overheating fault, to be about a fortnight long and said it could still go on sale in April. Samsung assured customers that the S8 wouldn’t come with any of the problems of the Note 7, and that it wouldn’t be a fire risk. “We look forward to moving ahead with a renewed commitment to safety,” it said. “The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture.” Samsung Galaxy Note7 | October 11 statement An investigation, by the company and independent organisations, revealed the Note 7 fires were caused by faulty batteries from two suppliers rather than a problem with the Samsung’s hardware and software. An embarrassment for the company, Samsung was forced to recall the Note 7 after scores of phones and their replacements overheated, caught on fire and, in some cases, exploded. Samsung may start reselling the recalled Note 7 handsets, 3m of which had been sold, as refurbished phones fitted with new, safe batteries. The Korean company has recovered rapidly from the scandal and, having initially reported billion-dollar losses, is expected to reveal record high profits on Tuesday in its earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2016. Profits could hit a three year high of 9.2 trillion won (£6.2bn), according to the company’s earnings guidance. Its shares were up 2.3pc at the end of Monday despite the mobile phone news. The company remains bolstered by booming sales of its microchip and screen technologies.

Internal and independent investigations "concluded that batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents", the South Korean company said in a statement. The giant conglomerate was forced to discontinue the smartphone -- originally intended to compete with Apple's iPhone -- after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire. The debacle cost the company billions in lost profit and reputational damage. "We sincerely apologise for the discomfort and concern we have caused to our customers," Koh Dong-Jin, the head of Samsung's mobile business, told reporters in Seoul. Samsung acknowledged that it provided the specifications for the batteries, adding in its statement: "We are taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of battery design and manufacturing. "We have taken several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again." It deployed around 700 researchers and engineers on its investigation, testing more than 200,000 fully-assembled devices and more than 30,000 batteries, it said. Samsung announced a recall of 2.5 million units of the oversized Galaxy Note 7 in September 2016 after several devices exploded or caught fire, with the company blaming batteries from a supplier, widely believed to be its sister firm Samsung SDI. When replacement phones -- with batteries from another firm, largely thought to be Chinese manufacturer ATL -- also started to combust, the company eventually decided to kill off the Note 7 for good. The fiasco took a major toll on the reputation of the firm, which is set to announce fourth-quarter and full-year results on Tuesday. It promised to reform its production and quality controls to prevent a similar crisis, and said today: "The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture." Samsung shares were up 0.5 per cent at 1.87 million won in Seoul today morning after the announcement. Samsung's English-language Samsung statement referred only to Galaxy Note 7 "incidents" but in Korean it spoke of "damage by fire".   Tweet Go to Top Related Tweets Videos Anti-bullfighting protests erupt in Colombia Over two million people flood US cities for women's marches Women's March on Washington goes global Former President Obama waves goodbye Donald Trump officially sworn in as president US director Michael Moore says political bloodbath is on its way Violence flares in Washington during Trump inauguration Trump signs first executive order on Obamacare: Mattis, Kelly sworn in Live | Donald Trump: The Inauguration of the 45th President of the United States Videos Man dies trying to catch a glimpse...

In foreign policy, energy, jobs and trade, Donald Trump’s key plans put ‘America First’ “Secondly, the trend of politics serving the economy is clearly defined, and thirdly, the proportion of real economy [concerned with actually producing goods and services] is getting increasingly bigger.” His comments came two days after US President Donald Trump vowed in his inaugural speech to make “America First” one of the priorities of his protectionist agenda, which would include distancing the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement backed by his predecessor Barack Obama, and making US friends and allies pay for their security currently aided by Washington. Speaking at the same event, Gou reiterated that Foxconn was considering setting up a display-making plant in the US in an investment deal that would exceed US$7 billion. Whether the proposal could go ahead would depend on negotiations with US state and federal authorities, he said. In early December, Foxconn was reported to be planning to expand its US operations after Massayoshi Son, chief executive of Japan’s SoftBank Group, revealed a document following a meeting with Trump that showed Foxconn wanted to invest US$7 billion and create 50,000 jobs in the US over the next four years. Foxconn says it’s mulling a US$7 billion US plant for displays Beijing later expressed its concerns about whether it would mean a reduction in Foxconn’s multi-billion-US-dollar investments on the mainland. Gou reportedly told Beijing he did not plan to withdraw capital from the mainland, and that his US investment plan was still pending, and he would wait to see how the Trump government had settled in before making any final decision. Despite the rise of protectionism, Gou, said he was confident his company would be able to make profits this year owing to the return to real economy – the production of goods and services as opposed to an economy driven by buying and selling on financial markets. He said the increase in the production of goods would complement the internet of things business, which his company was developing. Foxconn’s profits were reported to have fallen 2.18 per cent to NT$4.36 trillion (HK$1.08 trillion) last year compared with 2015 – a performance which led Gou to apologise to both his staff and investors during the event. Taiwan’s tech-dominated manufacturers, which ship a large number of their products to the United States, are concerned about the potentially protectionist policies that Trump could adopt leading to increased customs tariffs to protect American jobs and businesses. Foxconn announces plans for new $8.8bn television flat-panel factory in Guangzhou In December Gou signed a framework agreement with Japan’s Sakai Display Products Corporation – mostly owned by him – to build a US$8.8 billion television flat-panel screen factory in Guangzhou. Foxconn is one of the biggest employers on the mainland where it operates factories that produce most of Apple’s iconic iPhones. In Taiwan, Gou is regarded as one of the most popular choices as the island’s future presidency among voters who are dissatisfied with the performances of both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the opposition Kuomintang, according to several opinion polls published in October and November. Former vice-president Wu Den-yih of the KMT and the party vice chairman, Hau Lung-bin, have expressed their support for Gou to run for president in 2020 if no one from the KMT has gained more support than him in polls. So far Gou has declined to comment on the matter.

Finance Search Battery defects blamed for Note 7 firesAAP – Mon, Jan 23, 2017 1:59 PM AEDT Related Content View Photo   Samsung has blamed faulty batteries for causing its flagship Galaxy Note 7 phones to catch fire and has announced steps to avoid repeat incidents. The announcement on Monday came more than three months after Samsung scrapped the short-lived competitor of Apple's iPhones, wiping $US5.3 billion off its operating profit in one of the biggest tech failures in history. In its first explanation of the cause of the debacle, the world's top smartphone maker ruled out problems with the premium device's hardware and software, and said there would be no repeat of the fires in future devices such as the S8. "We look forward to moving ahead with a renewed commitment to safety. The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture," the company said in a statement. While Samsung Electronics' mobile division is expected to have bounced back from the Note 7 failure during the fourth quarter, investors remained cautious about the outlook due to uncertainty about how the Note 7 fires would affect sales of future flagship devices. "Consumers will not be reluctant to buy the S8, expected in April or May, only if Samsung clearly finds out what caused the fires," Hi Investment analyst Song Myung-sup said. Investigations by the company and independent organisations found the batteries were the sole cause of the Note 7 fires, Samsung mobile chief Koh Dong-jin told reporters during a briefing in Seoul. Reports of Note 7 handsets catching fire spread on social media soon after their August launch. A recall to replace the batteries did not solve the problem, prompting a second recall and a discontinuation of the model in October. Despite the impact of the Note 7's demise, the South Korean company expects fourth-quarter operating profit to hit a more than three-year high, driven by booming chip sales. That forecast pushed Samsung's share price to a record high this month. Samsung will announce its final earnings figures on Tuesday.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel | 1 Comments The world's biggest smartphone maker Samsung blamed faulty batteries today for the fires that led to last year's humiliating recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 device. Internal and independent investigations "concluded that batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents", the South Korean company said in a statement. The giant conglomerate was forced to discontinue the smartphone -- originally intended to compete with Apple's iPhone -- after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire. The debacle cost the company billions in lost profit and reputational damage. "We sincerely apologise for the discomfort and concern we have caused to our customers," Koh Dong-Jin, the head of Samsung's mobile business, told reporters in Seoul. Samsung acknowledged that it provided the specifications for the batteries, adding in its statement: "We are taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of battery design and manufacturing. "We have taken several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again." It deployed around 700 researchers and engineers on its investigation, testing more than 200,000 fully-assembled devices and more than 30,000 batteries, it said. Samsung announced a recall of 2.5 million units of the oversized Galaxy Note 7 in September 2016 after several devices exploded or caught fire, with the company blaming batteries from a supplier, widely believed to be its sister firm Samsung SDI. When replacement phones -- with batteries from another firm, largely thought to be Chinese manufacturer ATL -- also started to combust, the company eventually decided to kill off the Note 7 for good. The fiasco took a major toll on the reputation of the firm, which is set to announce fourth-quarter and full-year results on Tuesday. It promised to reform its production and quality controls to prevent a similar crisis, and said today: "The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture." Samsung shares were up 0.5 per cent at 1.87 million won in Seoul today morning after the announcement. Samsung's English-language Samsung statement referred only to Galaxy Note 7 "incidents" but in Korean it spoke of "damage by fire".

Wrapping up its months-long probe, the world's top smartphone maker said faulty batteries from two suppliers were to blame for a product failure that wiped $5.3 billion off its operating profit. Samsung mobile chief Koh Dong-jin said procedures had been put in place to avoid a repeat of the fires as the South Korean firm prepares to launch the Galaxy S8, its first premium handset since the Note 7's demise. "The lessons of this incident are deeply reflected in our culture and process," Koh told reporters at a press briefing. "Samsung Electronics will be working hard to regain consumer trust." Koh said the Galaxy S8 would not be unveiled at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona beginning Feb. 27, the traditional forum for Galaxy S series launches. He did not comment on when the company planned to launch the handset, though analysts expect it to start selling by April. Investors have said Samsung needs to reassure consumers that it is on top of the Note 7 problem and can be trusted to fix it. Samsung's reputation took a hammering after it announced a recall of fire-prone Note 7s, only for reports to emerge that replacement devices also caught fire. Images of melted Samsung devices spread on social media and airlines banned travellers from carrying them on flights. The handset, Samsung's answer to Apple Inc's iPhones, was withdrawn from sale in October less than two months after its launch, in one of the biggest failures in tech history. Samsung said later on Monday it has not decided whether to reuse parts in the recovered Note 7s or resell any recalled phones. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters reselling some Note 7s as refurbished phones was an option. The firm said it has recovered 96 percent of the 3.06 million Note 7s sold to consumers. SHORT CIRCUITS Investigations by internal and independent experts ruled out problems with the Note 7's hardware and software. Instead, they said the batteries, which came from two suppliers, featured different manufacturing defects or design flaws that caused them to short-circuit. "The odds that two different suppliers had issue with the same phone is an extremely low likelihood and may signal we have reached an inflection point in smartphone battery technology," said Patrick Moorhead, president of technology analyst and advisory firm Moor Insights & Strategy. Samsung did not name the suppliers on Monday but previously identified them as affiliate Samsung SDI Co Ltd and China's Amperex Technology Ltd (ATL). SDI said separately it would invest 150 billion won ($129 million) to improve product safety and expected to continue supplying batteries for Samsung phones. ATL declined to comment. Samsung said it accepted responsibility and would not take legal action against suppliers. The company touted longer battery life and fast charging as major improvements when it launched the Note 7. "The current situation is not largely different from that of the first recall, when Samsung pointed the finger at battery defects," said Park Chul-wan, a former director of the Centre for Advanced Batteries at the Korea Electronics Technology Institute. BATTERY CHECKS Among other measures to boost safety, Samsung said it had implemented an eight-point battery check system to avoid any such problems going unnoticed again. While Samsung's mobile division is widely expected to have bounced back from the Note 7 failure during the fourth quarter, experts remained cautious about the outlook for sales of future flagship devices. "Consumers will accept the results (of the probe) only if there are no problems with the S8," said Park. Moorhead, however, said he thought Samsung had done enough to convince consumers that it can prevent future issues. Samsung Electronics shares ended up 2.3 percent in a flat wider market. Analysts said the rise was mainly due to a healthy outlook for makers of tech components such as memory chips but also boosted by hopes the firm will be able to put the Note 7 fiasco behind it. The firm expects fourth-quarter operating profit to hit a more than three-year high when it reports earnings on Tuesday, driven by booming chip sales.

Ltd. plans on Monday to reveal reasons behind the spontaneous combustion of its recalled Galaxy Note 7, as the world's biggest smartphone maker works to regain consumer trust before launching its next premium model. The announcement would come more than three months after Samsung scrapped the short-lived competitor of Apple Inc.'s iPhones, costing $5.3 billion in operating profit. Reports of Note 7 handsets catching fire began soon after their August launch. A recall to replace the batteries did not solve the problem, prompting a second recall. Its reputation damaged, sales of the Galaxy S8 will be widely seen as a barometer of Samsung's ability to bounce back from the debacle. "Consumers will not be reluctant to buy the S8, expected in April or May, only if Samsung clearly finds out what caused the fires," said Hi Investment analyst Song Myung-sup. Samsung is likely to offer several reasons for the fires, including the battery - whose capacity was 16 percent more than the preceding model - as well as heat management software, said former Samsung mobile engineer Kim Yong-serk. "Samsung may have given a really high target for its battery capacity to suppliers, as consumers demand longer battery life," said Kim, a professor at Sungkyunkwan University. "Its waterproof feature may have prevented heat from dissipating." 'BIG MISTAKE' Samsung on Friday said it would announce the findings of investigations conducted by itself and independent organisations, as well as a "quality enhancement plan". Mobile chief Koh Dong-jin will chair a briefing on the fires' causes. In September, the engineer-turned-president announced the recall of 2.5 million Note 7 handsets due to faulty batteries from a supplier, later identified as affiliate Samsung SDI Co. Ltd. But handsets with cells from another supplier - China's Amperex Technology Ltd (ATL) - continued to catch fire, casting doubt on the faulty battery explanation. That prompted a second recall and permanent end to sales. Analysts said shipping replacement phones before identifying the root cause of the fires injured Samsung's reputation. "The biggest mistake Samsung made was that it recalled its Note 7 again," said HMC Investment Securities analyst Greg Roh. The firm would have difficulty convincing investors the matter is resolved if it again only blamed the batteries, he added. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters last week that Samsung was able to replicate the fires and had identified the batteries as the main cause. The person said the fires could not be explained by hardware or software design. Despite the impact of the Note 7's demise, the South Korean firm expects fourth-quarter operating profit to hit a more than three-year high, driven by booming chip sales. That forecast pushed Samsung's share price to a record high this month. Samsung will announce its final earnings figures on Tuesday.

For the secretive U.S. hedge fund started by Jim Simons, it turned out to be an especially savvy bet. Shares of V Tech, as it’s known, surged almost threefold in 2016, with much of the gain coming after Renaissance first reported a stake. V Tech, whose market value has jumped to $690 million, posted the second-best stock performance in a broad index of Tokyo-listed companies last year. Shigeto Sugimoto Photographer: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg While Renaissance is staying silent on why it built a $27.8 million position in the stock, V Tech President Shigeto Sugimoto says he’s never been more confident about his company’s outlook. He’s betting V Tech will soon sign a revenue-doubling deal with one of the Chinese screen makers seeking to break Samsung Group’s dominance of the latest big thing in mobile phones: organic light-emitting diode displays. “The OLED market will have to grow,” Sugimoto, 58, said in an interview in Yokohama. “Our products can help make that happen.” Display makers in China, the world’s largest smartphone market, are stepping up investments in OLEDs as an increasing number of handsets come with OLED displays, which don’t need a backlight and have the potential to be curved, bendable and wearable. Perhaps ironically, China’s attempts to wrest market share from South Korea are expected to benefit Japanese suppliers such as V Tech. V Tech spent five years developing a key component of machines for manufacturing OLED screens, Sugimoto says, unveiling in 2016 an upgraded version of what it calls fine hybrid masks, which are used for patterning the organic layers on the displays. The masks are a potential alternative to those currently used by Samsung Electronics Co.’s display unit. Samsung controls about 98 percent of the OLED display market, according to Yi Choong-hoon, chief analyst at UBI Research in Seoul. V Tech is in talks with several Chinese display makers and hopes to sign a deal with one of them by March to supply the masks and other equipment, according to Sugimoto, who declined to identify the companies. An artist’s rendering of V-Technology’s partial laser annealing system. Source: V-Technology Co. Revenue Boost Such an agreement could bring in sales of as much as 50 billion yen ($441 million), Sugimoto says. V Tech’s revenue more than doubled to 39.2 billion yen in the fiscal year ended March. “Our company would double in size in one go,” he says. While Samsung Electronics adopted OLED screens for its smartphones in 2008, others stayed away due to high manufacturing costs. But as the technology develops and demand grows for more innovative mobile devices, more smartphone makers are opting for OLEDs. Apple  plans to ship at least one new iPhone with an OLED screen this year, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg last year. This isn’t Sugimoto’s first time to sense shifting tides in the display industry. The former engineer founded the company in 1997 as a maker of equipment for producing plasma displays. A few years later, he realized that manufacturers were shifting to liquid crystal displays. V Tech turned its focus to LCDs, which have been the dominant technology for mobile phones since the early 2000s. Read: Apple’s Search for Better iPhone Screens Leads to Japan’s Rice Fields In June 2015, Sugimoto bought a color-filter business from bearings-maker NSK Ltd. Color filters are used in producing LCD screens, which suddenly became increasingly in demand in China. “It was like winning the lottery,” Masahiko Ishino, a senior analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute Co., said of the acquisition. “They bought the business for 2 billion yen and won supply orders worth 15 billion yen and 18 billion yen,” he said. V Tech said the 18 billion yen order also included other products. V Tech shares soared 185 percent last year as LCDs helped boost earnings and investors bet on the company’s success in the OLED business. Renaissance first reported a holding in June and owned 4.8 percent of shares as of its latest filing, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Renaissance declined to comment. V Tech surged 16 percent in heavy trading on Monday in Tokyo. The stock posted its biggest gain in seven months and its highest close in more than a decade, even as the broader Topix index slid. With its new mask, V Tech is aiming to build on the OLED experience it gained through supplying quality-testing equipment to Samsung since 2009, Sugimoto said. Chinese Phones China’s OLED production capacity will probably more than double each year, accounting for 32 percent of the global total by 2021 from 6 percent in 2016, according to research firm Display Supply Chain Consultants. Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi Corp. are among Chinese phone makers that have already adopted OLED screens for some models. “China isn’t a land of risk for those in the display industry: it’s a land of opportunity,” said Sugimoto. “Upstart Chinese makers are willing to try out new techniques,” he said. “I’m asking the companies we’re in talks with to make a decision quickly.” Not everyone is optimistic that V Tech will succeed in finding a Chinese OLED partner.

I question whether any company is willing to go down that road with them.” Sugimoto sees a 60 percent chance of winning a contract. Any failure would be cushioned by a solid outlook for V Tech’s LCD business, he says. The company’s 70 billion yen sales forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2018 excludes its new OLED products, according to Sugimoto, who jokes he may retire if a deal comes through. “It’ll be huge if the company finds a business partner in China,” Tokai Tokyo’s Ishino said. “The odds are hard to predict but it would be explosive for the stock.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Wrapping up its months-long probe, the world's top smartphone maker said faulty batteries from two suppliers were to blame for a product failure that wiped $5.3 billion off its operating profit. Samsung mobile chief Koh Dong-jin said procedures had been put in place to avoid a repeat of the fires as the South Korean firm prepares to launch the Galaxy S8, its first premium handset since the Note 7's demise. "The lessons of this incident are deeply reflected in our culture and process," Koh told reporters at a press briefing. "Samsung Electronics will be working hard to regain consumer trust." Koh said the Galaxy S8 would not be unveiled at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona beginning Feb. 27, the traditional forum for Galaxy S series launches. He did not comment on when the company planned to launch the handset, though analysts expect it to start selling by April. Investors have said Samsung needs to reassure consumers that it is on top of the Note 7 problem and can be trusted to fix it. Samsung's reputation took a hammering after it announced a recall of fire-prone Note 7s, only for reports to emerge that replacement devices also caught fire. Images of melted Samsung devices spread on social media and airlines banned travellers from carrying them on flights. The handset, Samsung's answer to Apple Inc's iPhones, was withdrawn from sale in October less than two months after its launch, in one of the biggest failures in tech history. Samsung said later on Monday it has not decided whether to reuse parts in the recovered Note 7s or resell any recalled phones. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters reselling some Note 7s as refurbished phones was an option. The firm said it has recovered 96 percent of the 3.06 million Note 7s sold to consumers. SHORT CIRCUITS Investigations by internal and independent experts ruled out problems with the Note 7's hardware and software. Instead, they said the batteries, which came from two suppliers, featured different manufacturing defects or design flaws that caused them to short-circuit. "The odds that two different suppliers had issue with the same phone is an extremely low likelihood and may signal we have reached an inflection point in smartphone battery technology," said Patrick Moorhead, president of technology analyst and advisory firm Moor Insights & Strategy. Samsung did not name the suppliers on Monday but previously identified them as affiliate Samsung SDI Co Ltd and China's Amperex Technology Ltd (ATL). SDI said separately it would invest 150 billion won ($129 million) to improve product safety and expected to continue supplying batteries for Samsung phones. ATL declined to comment. Samsung said it accepted responsibility and would not take legal action against suppliers. The company touted longer battery life and fast charging as major improvements when it launched the Note 7. "The current situation is not largely different from that of the first recall, when Samsung pointed the finger at battery defects," said Park Chul-wan, a former director of the Center for Advanced Batteries at the Korea Electronics Technology Institute. BATTERY CHECKS Among other measures to boost safety, Samsung said it had implemented an eight-point battery check system to avoid any such problems going unnoticed again. While Samsung's mobile division is widely expected to have bounced back from the Note 7 failure during the fourth quarter, experts remained cautious about the outlook for sales of future flagship devices. "Consumers will accept the results (of the probe) only if there are no problems with the S8," said Park. Moorhead, however, said he thought Samsung had done enough to convince consumers that it can prevent future issues. Samsung Electronics shares ended up 2.3 percent in a flat wider market. Analysts said the rise was mainly due to a healthy outlook for makers of tech components such as memory chips but also boosted by hopes the firm will be able to put the Note 7 fiasco behind it. The firm expects fourth-quarter operating profit to hit a more than three-year high when it reports earnings on Tuesday, driven by booming chip sales.

ROS LBoard 1 Devolution of powers: Sarawak panel eager to send report to Cabinet Richard T.W. Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Samsung blames Galaxy Note 7 fires on faulty batteries AFP | January 23, 2017 We are taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of battery design and manufacturing. UPDATED SEOUL: The world’s biggest smartphone maker Samsung blamed faulty batteries on Monday for the fires that led to last year’s humiliating recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 device. Internal and independent investigations “concluded that batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents”, the South Korean company said in a statement. The giant conglomerate was forced to discontinue the smartphone — originally intended to compete with Apple’s iPhone — after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire. The debacle cost the company billions in lost profit and reputational damage. “We sincerely apologise for the discomfort and concern we have caused to our customers,” Koh Dong-Jin, the head of Samsung’s mobile business, told reporters in Seoul. Samsung acknowledged that it provided the specifications for the batteries, adding in its statement: “We are taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of battery design and manufacturing. “We have taken several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again.” It deployed around 700 researchers and engineers on its investigation, testing more than 200,000 fully-assembled devices and more than 30,000 batteries, it said. Samsung announced a recall of 2.5 million units of the oversized Galaxy Note 7 in September 2016 after several devices exploded or caught fire, with the company blaming batteries from a supplier, widely believed to be its sister firm Samsung SDI. When replacement phones — with batteries from another firm, largely thought to be Chinese manufacturer ATL — also started to combust, the company eventually decided to kill off the Note 7 for good. The fiasco took a major toll on the reputation of the firm, which is set to announce fourth-quarter and full-year results on Tuesday. It promised to reform its production and quality controls to prevent a similar crisis, and said Monday: “The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture.” Samsung shares were up 0.5 percent at 1.87 million won in Seoul on Monday morning after the announcement. Samsung’s English-language Samsung statement referred only to Galaxy Note 7 “incidents” but in Korean it spoke of “damage by fire”.

The fiasco cost the South Korean company $5.3 billion (£4.2 billion) in lost profit and reputational damage.  Scroll down for video  Samsung has blamed two separate battery issues for the fires that hit its flagship Galaxy Note 7 device last year, as it sought to draw a line under the humiliating recall  TWO MAJOR FLAWS The first issue was that the battery components in the Galaxy Note 7 did not fit in the battery's casing.  This caused the battery cell's upper right corner to be crimped by the casing.   The second round affected the devices sent to replace the original faulty phones. These were caused by manufacturing issues, including poor welding at the battery manufacturer. It came during a torrid period when it has also been embroiled in a corruption scandal that has seen President Park Geun-Hye impeached.  Internal and independent investigations 'concluded that batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents', Samsung said in a statement. 'We sincerely apologise for the discomfort and concern we have caused to our customers,' Koh Dong-Jin, the head of its mobile business, said bowing before hundreds of reporters and cameramen at a press conference in Seoul. The first issue was that the battery components in the Galaxy Note 7 did not fit in the battery's casing.  This caused the battery cell's upper right corner to be crimped by the casing.   The second round affected the devices sent to replace the original faulty phones.

Share this article Share 34 shares Samsung has blamed lithium-ion batteries for causing its Galaxy Note 7 mobile phones to overheat and catch fire  These were caused by manufacturing issues, including poor welding at the battery manufacturer. Samsung is the most prominent unit of the giant Samsung group, South Korea's largest conglomerate with a revenue equivalent to about a fifth of the country's GDP. It announced a recall of 2.5 million units of the oversized Galaxy Note 7 in September 2016 after several devices exploded or caught fire, with the company blaming batteries from a supplier, widely believed to be its sister firm Samsung SDI. When replacement phones - with batteries from another firm, largely thought to be Chinese manufacturer ATL - also started to combust, the company decided to kill off the Note 7 for good. The first issue was that the battery components in the Galaxy Note 7 did not fit in the battery's casing. This caused the battery cell's upper right corner to be crimped by the casing The world's biggest smartphone maker was forced to discontinue the smartphone, originally intended to compete with Apple's iPhone, after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire. Pictured is a test in which the Galaxy S7 battery caught fire under pressure  As many as 1.9 million of the phones were sold in the US, where authorities banned the device from use on planes and even from being placed in checked luggage. Airlines around the world issued similar prohibitions. The firm has since embarked on a campaign to restore its battered reputation, issuing repeating apologies and putting full-page advertisements in prominent US newspapers including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post admitting that it 'fell short' on its promises. Analysts said that Samsung was looking to move on from the crisis with the announcement, which did not implicate other devices. 'Consumers tend to be forgiving the first time,' said Tom Kang, research director at Counterpoint Technology. 'But if it happens again, it will leave a lasting mark on Samsung's quality and brand image.' Samsung had concentrated on innovative design, thinness and battery capacity rather than safety, he said. The firm's next model, the Galaxy S8, had been expected to be unveiled at next month's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, but Samsung's Koh said it would be delayed to ensure that it had no safety issues.  The second round affected the devices sent to replace the original faulty phones. These were caused by manufacturing issues, including poor welding at the battery manufacturer Koh Dong-Jin, president of Samsung Electronics¿ Mobile Communications Business apologises for the faults in its Galaxy Note 7 devices that led to their recall  Analysts said that Samsung was looking to move on from the crisis with the announcement, which did not implicate other devices. Pictured is the Galaxy S7  Customers whose devices spontaneously set on fire shared their pictures since the first incidents were reported in August Samsung deployed around 700 researchers and engineers on its investigation, testing more than 200,000 fully-assembled devices and more than 30,000 batteries, it said. It did not identify the battery makers on Monday, but independent investigators UL and Exponent agreed with the findings. Battery A had a design issue that pushed down the right corner of the battery, while Battery B had defective internal welds, said Kevin White, principal scientist at Exponent. But Koh dismissed the possibility of suing the manufacturers.  'Whatever parts we use, the overall responsibility falls to us for failing to verify its safety and quality,' he said. 'At this point, I don't think it's right to seek legal action. GIRL, 13, SUFFERS MINOR BURN FROM NOTE 7 REPLACEMENT   A Minnesota father says his daughter suffered a minor burn to her thumb when her replacement Samsung smartphone melted in her hand last week. Andrew Zuis of Farmington, Minn., said his daughter, Abby, was holding the Galaxy Note 7 in her left hand Friday when it melted. Zuis saidthat the family had acquired the new phone on the day the replacement phones were released. There had been no problem with the original phone, he said. 'She's done with Note 7s right now,' Zuis said of his daughter. Reports of more replacement phones catching fire continued  'It's very fortunate Abby was not injured and was holding the phone,' Zuis said. 'If it was in her pocket, I think it would have been a whole different situation. I'm just very disappointed in Samsung and their product.' Zuis provided KSTP-TV with receipts showing that the family bought a Galaxy Note 7 in August and then exchanged it Sept. 21 after Samsung announced the recall. Andrew Zuis, of Farmington, Minn., showed the replacement Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phone belonging to his 13-year-old daughter Abby, that melted in her hand 'She's done with Note 7s right now,' Zuis said of his daughter. A Samsung representative told KSTP that an investigation is underway. 'We want to reassure our customers that we take every report seriously and we are engaged with the Zuis family to ensure we are doing everything we can for them and their daughter,' the representative said in a statement.  Around 1,000 different parts from some 450 suppliers were needed for each Galaxy Note 7. Samsung acknowledged that it provided the specifications for the batteries, adding in its statement: 'We have taken several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again. The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture.' The firm, which is set to announce fourth-quarter and full-year results on Tuesday, has estimated the cost of the recall at $5.3 billion. But investors welcomed today's announcement with Samsung shares trading up 1.9 percent at 1.90 million won in Seoul in the afternoon. The firm has separately been caught up in South Korea's wide-ranging political corruption scandal, with prosecutors last week seeking the arrest of its vice-chairman Lee Jae-Yong on charges of bribery, embezzlement and perjury. Lee, who became Samsung's de facto head after his father suffered a heart attack in 2014, is accused of bribing Choi Soon-Sil, Park's secret confidante at the centre of the scandal, and receiving policy favours from Park in return. Samsung is the single biggest contributor to two non-profit foundations controlled by Choi, but a court rejected the arrest request on grounds of insufficient evidence.

Close share panel Image copyright AFP The chief executive of Taiwan's technology giant Foxconn has confirmed his company is considering setting up a new plant in the United States. Terry Gou told reporters the investment might exceed $7bn (£5.7bn). The investment by a major supplier of Apple Inc would be likely to generate thousands of jobs, if it goes ahead. The plans come after US President Donald Trump confirmed his "America First" agenda meant overturning international trade treaties. During his campaign, and since his election, Mr Trump had repeatedly threatened high import tariffs in order to encourage US and foreign companies to move production to the US. He singled out China as a significant cause of lost manufacturing jobs in the United States. Image copyright VOISHMEL Image caption Foxconn manufactures products for Apple among other global giants Foxconn - formally known as Hon Hai Precision - has most of its factories in China where it assembles Apple's iPhones. Last year, the firm took over Japanese electronics veteran Sharp and the display-making investment being considered in the US is thought to be under the new Sharp unit. The White House website, updated after President Trump's inauguration, makes clear that the new administration will pursue plans to alter trading relationships with Asian countries. President Trump has also announced he will be renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Canada and Mexico.

Amazon and Google always thrive in the fourth quarter as people get out their wallets for Christmas. Both companies – or in Google’s case, its parent group, Alphabet – are therefore expected to announce booming revenues in their fourth-quarter results over the next fortnight, with Alphabet going first on Thursday and Amazon the following week. But analysts are already looking beyond the simple question of how many cardboard boxes Amazon filled and how many searches Google answered. They’re wondering which company will win the battle to control your home. That battle is being fought by two carafe-sized cylinders from the respective companies. One is Amazon’s Echo, with its voice-operated “personal assistant”, Alexa; the other is Google Home, which responds to the phrase “OK Google”. Both are internet-connected, home-based devices which can be command to do things: give the weather forecast; play music; read out news headlines; update shopping lists; and control “smart” devices in the home such as light bulbs or power points. In theory, if a device can be linked to it, the Echo can control or monitor it, and keep you informed. And simply by saying “Alexa, add sugar to the shopping list”, users can keep up to date on house supplies and even purchase them directly. Amazon is in the lead, having launched the Echo in November 2014, two years before Google Home came out. Though Amazon has not – and does not – release sales figures for any individual item, investment bank Morgan Stanley estimates that 11m Echos had been sold by the end of November 2016; other estimates suggest a further 7m have been sold since. About 700,000 were estimated to have been sold in the UK and Germany, the only countries outside the US where it is available. The Morgan Stanley estimate would put an Echo in more than 8% of US households. This is a significant figure, especially compared with the best estimates for Google Home, which put its sales at less than a million since its launch in October 2016. Why should Google care about Amazon? Because voice is seen as the next big field for computer interaction, and the home is a far better environment for voice detection than the great outdoors. Research company Gartner reckons that by 2018, 30% of all interactions with devices will be voice-based, because people can speak up to four times faster than they can type, and the technology behind voice interaction is improving all the time. The risk to Google is that at the moment, almost everyone starting a general search at home begins at Google’s home page on a PC or phone. That leads to a results page topped by text adverts – which help generate about 90% of Google’s revenue, and probably more of its profits. But if people begin searching or ordering goods via an Echo, bypassing Google, that ad revenue will fall. And Google has cause to be uncomfortable. The shift from desktop to mobile saw the average number of searches per person fall as people moved to dedicated apps; Google responded by adding more ads to both desktop and search pages, juicing revenues. A shift that cut out the desktop in favour of voice-oriented search, or no search at all, would imperil its lucrative revenue stream. Amazon is copying one feature of Google’s success in smartphones: it is offering methods to connect and control smart devices via the Echo for free, rather as Google’s Android software was offered as a free platform for smartphones. There are signs it is paying off: Wynn hotels in Las Vegas announced in December that it would be adding Echos to all 5,000 rooms, for functions such as playing music and controlling curtains and blinds. That gained some notice, as much as anything because the life cycle of such hotels implies they will be there for a decade or so. Similarly, at January’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES), also in Las Vegas, commentators were struck by how many devices incorporated Alexa. And Amazon is even stealing into Google’s territory: some phones sold in the US from China’s Huawei, which uses Android, will incorporate Alexa rather than Google’s Assistant programme. Google’s natural reaction is to have its own voice-driven home system, in Home. But that poses a difficulty, illustrated by the problems it claims to solve. At the device’s launch, one presenter from the company explained how it could speak the answer to questions such as “how do you get wine stains out of a rug?” Most people would pose that question on a PC or mobile, and the results page would offer a series of paid-for ads. On Home, you just get the answer – without ads. What analysts wonder is: how can Home bridge that revenue gap? So far, Google hasn’t explained. Even if it can fend off the Echo, it may not be able to defend its core business. By contrast, the Echo’s benefit to Amazon is much clearer: it can make online shopping (at Amazon) a breeze, play music from Amazon’s paid-for subscription service, and generally act as a passive block on your using rival shopping sites – rather as Google cemented its dominance by being the default search engine on multiple browsers in the mid-2000s. Richard Windsor of Edison Investment Research suggests that time is running out for Google: “It has to act quickly, as Amazon is on the brink of becoming the industry standard for controlling smart home devices. “At CES, everyone was integrating with Echo, with Google Home and Apple HomeKit barely present.” Indeed, where are Apple and Microsoft, which also have their own voice-driven assistants in the form of Siri and Cortana? Although both can be used in the home – Siri on the iPhone or iPad, and to play content on the Apple TV set-top box, and Cortana on the Xbox games console – neither seems to be intent on the “home assistant” market. Phil Schiller, Apple’s vice-president of marketing, seemed to suggest recently that Apple wouldn’t follow Amazon and Google into offering a voice-only device: “Having my iPhone with me as the thing I speak to is better than something stuck in my kitchen or on a wall somewhere.” He also emphasised the importance of a visual display: “We still like to take pictures and we need to look at them, and a disembodied voice is not going to show me what the picture is.” Even so, there are persistent rumours that Apple has prototyped an Echo-like device in secret but is undecided on whether to release it. The company hasn’t commented. It could be ready to unveil something – or may never do so. Microsoft, meanwhile, is in more homes than the Echo via the Xbox, but isn’t trying to make itself a listening device linked to a shop. So, will we all be burbling away to thin air in a few years, asking how long our commute will take while our smartphones sit unused in the kitchen? Perhaps – though Ken Sena, a senior analyst at investment bank Evercore ISI, suggests that home-based voice assistants will never be used as widely as smartphones. According to Sena, they are not such a must-have. Yet, they were a hot Christmas present – and voice interaction is still in its early days, perhaps comparable to the smartphone market in 2005, when BlackBerry, Palm and Microsoft dominated. Or, it could be like the smartphone market now, effectively dominated by Google and Apple. But which? Alexa, can you see into the future?

Apple Looking To Facial Recognition In iPhone 8: KGI Analyst 22 January 2017, 2:00 pm EST By Athena Chan Tech Times The Evolution of iPhoneNow Playing Apple - Here's What You May Not KnowNow Playing KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says enhanced security features are expected in the rumored iPhone 8 and the 2017 iPhone lineup. Revamped biometric tech will come by way of better Touch ID and even facial recognition.  ( Justin Sullivan | Getty Images ) Advertisement Will the Touch ID security feature of the iPhone be replaced soon? A well-known analyst and forecaster of Apple's business moves has raised the possibility of Cupertino revamping its existing biometric and security features in 2017 iPhones. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says Apple might explore various new technologies such as better sensors and even a facial recognition system that it can incorporate into the latest installations of the iPhone. That includes the iPhone 8 and the mysterious iPhone X. The question is whether the Touch ID will be replaced completely. Recent predictions have stated that the new iPhones to be released later in the year will likely have remarkable features such as an embedded Home button, 5.8 inch "fixed flex" edge-to-edge display, wireless charging, and a glass body. Rumors regarding the iPhone 8 perhaps having augmented reality camera features also circulated alongside reports of possible advanced biometric capabilities. Adapting To Edge-To-Edge Design In the new report, Kuo believes that Apple may yet switch their current FCPB sensor to a film sensor to provide better sensitivity and user experience. As the new OLED iPhone is expected to have an edge-to-edge display, Kuo expects that it will also come with a flexible OLED panel. Under its film sensor, a metal structure will likely be placed for solid structural support. Touch ID And Facial Recognition Given the radical new design of the upcoming iPhones, Kuo expects the company to explore various ways to develop a new Touch ID technology to match the full screen. A likely result, Kuo says, is the placement of the fingerprint recognition "under panel" as compared to the current iPhones on the market with an "under glass" placement. The move not just complements the iPhone's new design, but also enhances the phone's security. Apple's interest in biometric tech, however, points to the company's likelihood of replacing the current Touch ID security feature with facial recognition technology. Recent bio-recognition patent applications of Apple provide clues that the company is more likely to develop a facial recognition technology rather than the initially expected iris scanner. Whether the company plans to completely bypass the Touch ID and rely solely on facial recognition is still unknown. The company's exploration of new security features is always welcome, of course. The Touch ID system, for instance, has been questioned about its merits as a viable security feature. While some believe that the system upped the security game of their iPhones, others find that the feature offers more risks than benefits. Though it is still uncertain whether the new iPhone releases will have enhanced Touch ID capabilities, facial recognition, or a possible combination, the move aims to enhance security for Apple users.

Leslie D'Monte AI is a branch of computer science but it is multidisciplinary: it has constant inputs from psychologists, linguists, roboticists, etc. Photo: iStock Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan is an assistant professor in the department of computer science and engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay. He specialises in artificial intelligence (AI) and is the only author from India who is part of an 18-member study panel of the Stanford University-hosted report titled Artificial Intelligence and Life. Kalyanakrishnan’s expertise broadly fits in the area of machine learning. Called reinforcement learning, it defines what actions software agents should take to maximize a certain type of reward after learning from reward and punishment. In an interview, he urges people to be more optimistic about the things AI can do rather than be obsessed with the fear around AI machines. Edited excerpts: How was the Stanford AI report conceived? How did you get involved? In the last 5-10 years, the public has been forced to take notice of AI. You do searches, for instance, and get the information you want. You can talk to your phone using Apple’s Siri. There is so much intelligence in your car. Everywhere, intelligent software is assisting you in your lifestyle in a very noticeable way. The common man’s perception is that AI is taking away jobs. Jobs that people used to do about 10 years back have been replaced either partially or even fully in some cases by software and hardware developments. This triggered the conversation, which led to experts being asked about their opinion of where AI is heading and what can be done about it. In the last few months, there have been some alarmist views, even by physicist Stephen Hawking. Moreover, even a person like Elon Musk, who is responsible for taking technology forward with his ventures like Tesla and SpaceX, has expressed similar sentiments—that things could go awfully wrong once we have AI doing actions that human beings traditionally have done. Eric (Horvitz, a computer scientist and technical fellow at Microsoft) has been with Microsoft Research and is primarily responsible for this report. He decided that we needed a more sober assessment of AI—not based on emotions but one that is more rigorous and scientific. We will have a study panel every five years. This is the first one. I was chosen by Peter (Peter Stone, professor at the department of computer science, University of Texas) because the study panel was looking at diversity in age, gender and geography. This came together in May 2015, and we were given a year to do this. As a group, we agreed that it is true that AI is game-changing, that it is moving at a fast pace. Hence, we did not forecast beyond 2030, because it is not scientific to do so when there is so much uncertainty about the concept. Can you list some of these uncertainties? Look back to 1995. I don’t think it was possible way back then to predict accurately some of the things that we have today. The Internet has happened, so have smartphones and social networks. It’s the nature of science and technology which makes it difficult to predict beyond a certain period. There are just too many variables. What was your contributions to the AI report? My contribution was more to define AI. We take intelligence for granted in human beings. We expect people to be able to do certain tasks, to answer questions meaningfully etc. So what are the operating principles that define intelligence? How is it constructed? What are its mathematical foundations? We have asked these questions earlier too, and even in the 70s we had automata (a machine which performs a range of functions according to a predetermined set of coded instructions). For instance, you still have churches where clocks do specific tasks (for example, birds chiming) when their gongs strike midnight. The confluence of software and mathematics really took place in the 1950s when computers became available. We had the Eniac (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) which was built during the war (World War II), and it became possible to build computer systems that could exhibit intelligence. So technically speaking, the first such computer systems were aimed at helping soldiers during the War—used to calculate things like the trajectory of a missile; planning logistics, etc. This explains why DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) has been funding computer science in general and AI for a long time. But the pioneers of AI have also been thinking about AI in scientific terms. Scientists like Alan Turing, who can be considered to be the fountainhead of AI despite the fact that he did not have access to real hardware, was one (such, who was), thinking about writing a programme to play chess. So what exactly is AI? The term was coined only in 1956 in a workshop (Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence) put together by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon and Nathaniel Rochester. So you can think of AI as a branch of computer science but it is multidisciplinary: it has constant inputs from psychologists, linguists, roboticists, etc. You know intelligence when you see it. But how do you get an artificial agent to show intelligence? Most people would consider a machine to be endowed with AI if it performs like a human being. You can think of examples like Google search or Google Maps. Computers can play chess, which was the holy grail of AI, and now even beat grandmasters. We think of intelligence as a spectrum that is constantly being propelled forward. And AI is what can do this. In some sense, AI is this desire to replicate intelligence in hardware. It is also, in a strange sense, the sum total of what an AI researcher is doing—something in robotics, NLP (natural language processing), etc. AI does not have a rigid definition. Hence we went with (Nils J.) Nilsson’s definition in the AI report (AI is that activity devoted to making machines intelligent, and intelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment). What does the AI concept comprise? The broad architecture of an intelligent agent is one that senses the environment, which does some amount of thinking, and then takes actions in the real world. If you consider sensing, there is the whole area of Computer Vision, which tries to make sense of objects we see. We, then, have the field of speech processing that has to do with audio. When you go to actuation, you have fields like robotics, haptics, etc. AI also comprises machine learning, knowledge representation and logic. Humans typically make changes to their behaviour as they learn from experiences. So if the experience that a programme undergoes somehow changes its behaviour, you can say that the programme is applying machine learning. Now we have data-driven machine learning. Consider the case of hospitals gathering patient data—vital parameters like blood sugar level, age, gender, blood pressure, etc. Now let’s presume the hospital has collected this data for, say, 1,000 patients and diagnosed diabetic patients from this lot. A machine learning algorithm can then sift through this data and learn a predictor and predict whether a new patient (whose body parameters are available) is diabetic or not. Similar is the case with Google search that has moved from also displaying irrelevant links to using machine learning algorithms that have refined this task over the last few years. The technical base for designing machine learning systems comes primarily from streams like probability and statistics. Then we have NLP, which is the most natural. By speaking natural languages that is quite different from the language that computers use to communicate (1s and 0s—bits and bytes), NLP has got to a state when you can take a shot at machine translation. The basic building blocks for NLP comprise actual models of languages. The linguistic hierarchy of language begins with syntax, moving on to semantics (study of relationships between words and how we construct meaning) and later, pragmatics (e.g. you can use sarcasm, puns—typically where you need an understanding of culture and context). Anyone dealing with NLP has to know these branches. What about Deep Learning? Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) aim to simulate the human brain. They can be used to map inputs to predictions. There are standard learning algorithms to train ANNs based on data. Neural networks have been around for almost three decades but it was very difficult to train large and deep (with more layers) neural networks. Technically, they get stuck in the so-called Local Minimum (defined as the best solution to a problem within a small neighbourhood of possible solutions as opposed to the concept of ‘global optimum’, which is the optimal solution when every possible solution is considered). Ironically, you do need ANNs with many layers. Deep Learning helps us to successfully train larger ANNs. Will true AI ever be achieved? This has divided researchers over the decades. Most people in the AI community subscribe to the view that it does not really matter if machines are exactly replicating what human beings can do, as long as we do things that are intelligent and of value. For example, we have software that can fly an aircraft—very differently from how a human being would do it but it is doing it nevertheless. What are the challenges? Explaining AI to the public itself is a challenge. That said, can inputs be automatically learnt or combined in ways that can give higher level abstractions, to make the task of prediction easier? In the context of vision, the inputs to computer vision systems is just images (matrix of 0s and 1s). But deep learning algorithms are able to abstract things out like edges, boundaries, locations of objects, etc. You can have a deep learning system to autonomously drive a car. The software agent needs to reason about stop signs, etc., (and) not only about camera images; it has to learn a host of features from scratch. The other challenge is that hardware needs to match the pace of development in software. The brain also uses less energy than the chips that we are building today, which are simulating our neurons using a different architecture that generates a lot of heat. Hence, there is a move to develop specialized hardware using a neural architecture as opposed to the traditional Von Neumann architecture. If this becomes a reality a decade from now, we will be able to do a lot more with neural networks than we can now. Not only does a neural network need to be good at its task, it should also be energy efficient. There is a lot of scare-mongering around AI. What is your perspective on this issue? People are driven a lot by what they see in movies. Part of the common person’s concern is around the Frankenstein that will do nasty things. The fact is that AI is beginning to work in very specialized tasks like controlling an airplane or driving your car. It’s hard to think of any general AI machine that can do all of these tasks in unison—clearly something that humans excel at. As far as AI machines are concerned, this is certainly not on the horizon for at least the next 15-20 years. This scare is unfounded. But the fear that certain types of jobs will vanish because AI (software bots and machines) will do it more efficiently is genuine. Policy makers should prepare themselves for this, and proactively retrain and reskill the people who will be affected to help them cope better with the situation.

Photo: Bloomberg Computing devices and smart gadgets are set to evolve further with sleeker designs, better security and innovative features in 2017. Here’s a glimpse of how some technology companies are going about the task and trends like big data and security are aiding this evolution. What next for Apple’s productivity push? Having mended bridges with the likes of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Microsoft, and forged partnerships with the likes of Cisco and Deloitte, Apple is in the midst of making its most aggressive push into the enterprise ecosystem. These partnerships take care of the software side of things, but the conundrum remains with the hardware. There is a definite potential of cannibalization within the computing device line-up, with the MacBook Airs, iPad Pros and MacBook Pros fighting for a common demographic, for the most part. Apple will also have to contend with some amount of criticism in 2017, with the underwhelming upgrades to the MacBook Pro line-up—this at a time when Microsoft flexed its muscles with the Surface Studio. Nevertheless, the iPhone remains as solid as ever for enterprise users. Though arguably, the first time ever, Microsoft has started to beat Apple at the innovation and design games, but just how they follow it up in 2017 will matter a lot. Photo: Reuters Microsoft’s Surface gambit: Revive the PC market? At a time when personal computer, or PC, shipments have been steadily declining, Microsoft seems to have taken it upon itself to set the benchmark in the ecosystem. And in the process, also show off what it is capable of. The Surface Studio all-in-one (AIO) with the Pixel Dial joins the Surface Pro and Surface Book portable Windows convertibles, and is indeed revolutionary. The 28-inch PixelSense display is believed to be the slimmest of its kind, and has 63% more pixels than a 4K TV. With prices starting $2,999 (Rs2,00,000 approximately), it isn’t going to fly off the shelves. Though arguably, the first time ever, Microsoft has started to beat Apple at the innovation and design games, but just how they follow it up in 2017 will matter a lot. Flexing of the muscles aside, the real utility will now need to stand out—and that holds true for the entire laptop and convertible market. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Ford Motor Co. are collecting the cellphone location data of as many as two million Boston city residents; the idea is to create near-instant urban mobility patterns which would otherwise have taken years to collect, decipher and work on. Photo: Bloomberg Big data: It’ll be bigger While there is considerable focus on smart cities, public transport and smarter infrastructure, there remains an ever-increasing need for data to make these systems work. For example, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Ford Motor Co. are collecting the cellphone location data of as many as two million Boston city residents; the idea is to create near-instant urban mobility patterns which would otherwise have taken years to collect, decipher and work on. Big data will be ever so critical for corporations, governments and also for research, and this is what will drive productivity, innovation and collaboration. Pixel has shown just how good Android can be. Google’s Pixel hardware game: A new innings With the Pixel phones, there has been a constant emphasis on the ‘Made by Google’ aspect. It is clear that the software and services major wants to get into the hardware game, on its own terms. And so it has, wielding greater control over the successors to the Nexus smartphones. Finally, Android as a platform is shining through—unhindered, unwrapped and uncluttered. Pixel has shown just how good Android can be, but Google needs to fix bigger problems—the world is still buying Android phones made by the likes of Samsung, Motorola and a whole bunch of Chinese brands, and they have no control over that—customization, lack of software updates and more. Do we see an even bigger Pixel smartphone line-up, covering more affordable price points? AI2, a new system developed by researchers at MIT, uses machine learning to flag potential cybersecurity threats and attacks. Photo: Getty Images Security: Artificial Intelligence (AI) to prevent cyber-attacks? In today’s world, cybersecurity is managed by a combination of humans and machines, with the latter usually configured by the former, and there remains genuine room for error. This is where the researchers from the MIT, perhaps, have a solution for the future—a new system called AI2. It uses machine learning to flag potential security threats and attacks. The human element remains, but the new system can actually scan and flag a lot more data than any human can. Dell XPS 13 offers a 360-degree hinge for multiple productivity. Dell’s ultimate ultrabook becomes flexible The Dell XPS 13 is perhaps the best ultrabook in the Windows laptop ecosystem. Earlier this month, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, the company unveiled an upgrade with newer Intel processors as well as more powerful specifications in general. According to a press release from the manufacturer, the product offers a 360-degree hinge for multiple productivity and viewing options using Continuum, 15 hours of battery life and excellent clarity with an amazing QHD+ (5.7M pixels) InfinityEdge touch display—another first for a 2-in-1.
