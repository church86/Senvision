ADVERTISEMENT Early adopters of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have had a big change to get used to with the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack. This wasn't made any easier by the new Lightning connection timing out and stopping music from playing. Users of the Lightning EarPods have complained the headphones weren't responding after a while. Reports said the buttons stopped functioning, meaning it was impossible to pause or play music, turn it up or down, or access AI personal assistant Siri.

Apple has obliged with the release of iOS 10.0.2. The new update, according to Tim Cook's company, has three main fixes: the headphone bug, a fix to stop the photos app from crashing, and another that stopped some app extensions from working. It "addresses an issue that could prevent headphone audio controls from temporarily not working," the release notes about the update say. When iOS 10 was introduced by Apple at the start of September it billed the update as one of the biggest it had ever made to the operating systems of iPhones and iPads. The biggest difference turned out to be the introduction of layers of AI to some applications. ADVERTISEMENT Maps, Messages and Photos now include Apple's AI and offer users personalised options. Photos can, for instance, scan images and categorise them in the gallery by people and places involved. Messages undoubtedly had the biggest overhaul in the iOS. The app now lets users send full screen animations and effects, and a dedicated app store was introduced for Messaging apps.

Home About Contact Home > Mac administration, macOS > iCloud Desktop and Documents in macOS Sierra – The Good, The Bad and the Ugly iCloud Desktop and Documents in macOS Sierra – The Good, The Bad and the Ugly September 23, 2016 rtrouton Leave a comment Go to comments As part of the iCloud services in macOS Sierra, Apple is offering a new way to store your files in iCloud – synchronizing the contents of your account’s Desktop and Documents folder with iCloud Drive. When you enable the option to store files from your Desktop and Documents folder, the contents of your Desktop and Documents folder are moved (not copied) from your home folder into iCloud Drive. Those folders will no longer appear in your home folder.   That means that your Desktop and Documents folder no longer are stored in your home folder. Instead, they and all their contents are now stored in iCloud Drive. For more details on this, see below the jump. In reality, the Desktop and Documents folders folders themselves have been moved to a new location inside your home folder, where they’re invisible to the average user but still provide a place to sync files between the Mac and iCloud Drive. The new location is as follows: ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs   The Good The virtue of this idea is that, as you enable iCloud Desktop and Documents on your various Macs, you get a unified Desktop and Documents experience. As you add files to those directories on one machine, all of your other machines should get updated with the same information. You can also access the files from the iCloud web interface and the iCloud Drive app on your iOS devices, in the event that you’re away from your Mac(s) and need to get something that is stored in the Desktop or Documents folders on your Mac(s).   iCloud in this sense is serving as the authoritative source of “truth” for your files and your various Macs are checking in and updating files on themselves as needed. When all of this works, it looks like magic and all your files are everywhere you need them. When all of this works. What happens when it doesn’t?   The Bad Currently, Apple provides 5 GBs of storage space for free for iCloud users. That 5 GBs of storage includes storage for your iCloud email, your iCloud backups for your iOS device(s), your iCloud Photo library and iCloud Drive. If you need more than 5GBs of storage space, you have to pay for it.   Considering that most folks likely have more than 5 GBs of files stored in their home folder’s Documents directory, let alone their Desktop folder, there are immediate issues with enabling iCloud Desktop and Documents syncing if you’re not paying Apple for sufficient iCloud storage space. As an example of this, lets try adding a VMware VM to the Documents folder then turn on iCloud Desktop and Documents syncing. VM is 11.55 GBs in size Available iCloud space is 5 GBs   I immediately ran out of space on iCloud Drive and was prompted to upgrade.   To its credit, iCloud was smart enough to figure this out before it tried to upload the VM and did not actually try to upload the VM to iCloud Drive. It also allowed me to move the VM unharmed to a new location.   The Ugly At this point in my testing, I decided that iCloud Desktop and Documents was interesting but because of storage limitations, it just wasn’t going to work well for me unless I paid Apple far more money for storage than I wanted to. I then did the following: 1. Opened System Preferences 2. Selected the iCloud preference pane 3. Clicked the Options… button next to iCloud Drive 4. Unchecked Desktop & Documents Folder At this point, I received a warning that the documents on my Desktop and in my Documents folder would only be visible in iCloud Drive.   5. Clicked the Turn Off button on the warning dialog message.   At this point, I received a message letting me know that my documents are in the Desktop and Documents folders in iCloud Drive and that I could copy or move them back.   6. Clicked the OK button on the message. Sierra then showed me that my Desktop and Documents folders were back in my account’s home folder. Great!   They were completely empty. What!?!?!?!   When you turn off the Desktop & Documents Folder feature in iCloud, Sierra recreates empty Desktop and Documents folders in your home folder. It’s on you to copy or move your files back from iCloud Drive. However, that assumes that all of your files and folders made it to iCloud in the first place. What if they didn’t? Hopefully they can still be found in the Desktop and Documents folders in ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs. If they’re not, hope you had other backups because those files and folders may just be completely gone. Conclusions Based on the results of my testing, I have no plans for enabling iCloud Desktop and Documents syncing on any of my Macs for the foreseeable future. Leaving aside that Apple isn’t offering enough storage space at prices I want to pay, the results I saw from my testing of the synchronization process did not inspire my trust in it. It did give me an insight into why Apple chose to remove support for portable home directories (PHDs) in Sierra. The havoc that could be caused by two separate synchronization processes trying to sync the same set of files, especially when portable home directories were using a two-way sync process, would be breathtaking to behold. The only certain result would be that data loss would occur. Kudos to Apple for at least foreseeing that result and removing the possibility of PHDs and iCloud Desktop and Documents fighting with each other for file sync supremacy.

I eventually found them in ~/Library/iCloud Drive (Archive) and moved them back. Great way of Apple to increase their revenues having people purchase more room to store the Desktop and Documents Folder on their servers. Alex September 23, 2016 at 5:09 pm Reply So far I have found running Sierra like running El Capitan except I am not sure what Apple did to the Preview.app. I use to be able to fill out .pdfs and save them and email them back to person that created them for contractor work and they had no problem reading them, but now I fill them out and send them back and the only thing the other party sees is the signature and nothing else. Luckily I didn’t update my MacBook Air and will have to use that until Apple comes up with a fix to this problem. Charlie Nancarrow September 24, 2016 at 5:08 am Reply So actually the Desktop and Documents DON’T get moved, but get symlinked into the com.apple.clouddocs folder and then the original location gets hidden? When turning off iCloud doc and desktop sync, Apple should just leave the files where they are and turn off their hiding and advising you of such — Like when they give you the option to keep local copies of contacts etc when you turn off the iCloud feature for that feature. I don’t quite understand why they get hidden anyhow, when they actually don’t get moved. Guest September 24, 2016 at 12:20 pm Reply The solution does seem unusually messy. The command-line interface is not fooled and can see that ~/Documents and ~/Desktop still exist. What Finder does is simply window-dressing, obscuring the reality from the user. They did not even bother to use the Unix file flags to hide the directories (like they do with the user library), but deployed a new extended attribute instead, meaning that only Finder can work with this. It baffles me even more that Apple decided to move existing documents upon disabling iCloud Drive into the above-mentioned ‘~/Library/iCloud Drive (Archive)’, even though they are technically located in ~/Documents and ~/Desktop while iCloud Drive is active. Given that ~/Library is hidden by default, I suspect that this will raise even more questions. All around a poor job. I expected that this new feature would be trouble, the moment they announced it. Daniel O'Donnell September 26, 2016 at 4:43 pm Reply Good summary of the problem(s) and how to deal with them. dpodgors@amfam.com September 26, 2016 at 7:03 pm Reply So under configuration profile in restrictions, under the functionality tab, why wouldn’t just uncheck “Allow iCloud documents & data”? Stephan September 27, 2016 at 6:18 pm Reply Linked by Gruber at Daring Fireball. Nice job Rich! Bob Thedino (@bobthedino2000) September 27, 2016 at 6:31 pm Reply As someone else has pointed out it is worth clarifying that the Desktop and Documents folder do not actually get moved, they remain in the user’s home directory /Users// but are hidden by the Finder. The entries you found in ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/ are just symbolic links to the real, unchanged, locations of those folders. MB (@mayerbalser) September 27, 2016 at 10:13 pm Reply Alex – as far as your PDF problem is concerned. If the PDF was created using a any Fujitsu Scansnap, it will destroy your existing PDF Files in the manner you describe. They issued several warnings not to upgrade as it might ruin existing PDF files. See http://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/computing/peripheral/scanners/topics/topics20160926.html Sigivald September 27, 2016 at 10:51 pm Reply Considering that most folks likely have more than 5 GBs of files stored in their home folder’s Documents directory, let alone their Desktop folder I think you might be overestimating what “most folks” do with their computers, especially those directories (where, say, iTunes media aren’t). Power users and developers, sure, that being “most of the people you’d have to ask about this or reading this right now”. But most folks don’t – I think – even know what VMWare is, for instance. “Joe Macbook User”, though, might have a gig of school or work files, maybe. Some memes they saved off of Facebook (maybe – lots of people seem to just Share them to “save” them). Perhaps an app installer or three lying around on the Desktop (or not, if they just use the App Store, which is very likely). 5 GB is actually a lot of space for non-media files for a whole lot of users. Jiří Fiala October 1, 2016 at 10:07 pm Reply On the contrary – non-technical users have no idea what they put where, nor how much space is occupied or how to find out. When I fix my friends’ Macs, in routinely able to salvage tens of gigs of space without deleting something of value. Roger Dodger September 28, 2016 at 3:13 am Reply In my experience with Beta and after beta, turning off Desktop and Documents Folder syncing with iCloud leaves a folder in ~/iCloud Drive (Archive), not in ~/Library. Not sure if I misunderstood or mis-read. All items were there though. Jeff Willner September 28, 2016 at 7:03 pm Reply Even though I had more than enough space on iCloud, I had tons of problems (and error messages) trying to copy my files back from iCloud to my computer after turning off iCloud desktop and docs. Finally gave up and restored from a backup I created just before enabling the feature. Not sure that I will ever trust iCloud as the repository for anything that is important to me. Yossi M Olaya October 1, 2016 at 10:01 am Reply any idea how to make the Desktop and Documents folders visible in Finder? I’m intelligent enough to understand they are in iCloud, I just don’t like having half my stuff in the home folder window and my other half in the iCloud folder, and therefore I have to open two finder windows. So far I’ve created symlinks but I don’t like that approach! fly October 6, 2016 at 8:27 am Reply I don’t suppose there is a way to view the contents of the Mobile Documents folder in finder??? SO annoying Apple. Thanks. Paul Coppens October 23, 2016 at 1:03 pm Reply Same problem here. I switched it on at some point then realising I didn’t have enough space. Didn’t want to buy more than 5 GB. Switched it off again and then got the message needed to upload all before able to switch off. But I had 60 GB. Was able to switch off after all after downloading my docs again to my Mac. However it seems my 5 GB is still full and my folder on my Mac (iCloud Drive) is empty. Not sure now how I am able to release the bigger part of my 5 GB. Em Raisun October 25, 2016 at 9:33 am Reply Oh my god, I switched off the cloud sharing and it stole my desktop. Then I went to iCloud in Finder to retrieve my desktop and all the folders are there but they’re empty. I want to cry. What do I do now? My time machine wasn’t on either. No trackbacks yet.

Hackers discovered the issues, saying that Apple weakened backup security with iOS 10. But Apple is already on the case and plans to issue fixes for it. DON’T MISS: iPhone 7 review According to Forbes, well-known Russian forensic company, Elcomsoft said that cracking the logins for backups stored on a Mac or PC is considerably easier now. If that name sounds familiar, that’s because it’s believed that Elcomsoft helped hackers crack the Apple ID accounts of several celebrities in 2014, just a few days ahead of Apple’s iPhone 6 announcement. The company found that Apple was using a weaker password protection mechanism for manual backups via iTunes on Mac and PC. Using CPU acceleration, Elcomsoft could potentially guess backup passwords 40 times faster when compared to cracking iOS 9 with a speedier GPU tool. Using an Intel i5 CPU, the task was incredibly faster – an “astonishing 2,500 times faster,” as Forbes puts it. The computer would try 6 million passwords per second compared to 2,400. That lowers significantly the amount of time you have to wait for a computer to guess the correct password and access a backup data file. “We discovered an alternative password verification mechanism added to iOS 10 backups,” Elcomsoft’s Oleg Afonin wrote in a blog post on Friday. “We looked into it and found out that the new mechanism skips certain security checks, allowing us to try passwords approximately 2500 times faster compared to the old mechanism used in iOS 9 and older.” Apple, meanwhile, issued a statement acknowledging the problem. “We’re aware of an issue that affects the encryption strength for backups of devices on iOS 10 when backing up to iTunes on the Mac or PC,” a spokesperson said. We are addressing this issue in an upcoming security update. This does not affect iCloud backups. We recommend users ensure their Mac or PC are protected with strong passwords and can only be accessed by authorized users. Additional security is also available with FileVault whole disk encryption.” And yes, you totally should protect the iTunes backups of your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch with a password. That’s the only way to encrypt the iTunes backup.

(If you don’t have an iPhone, be afraid; they know who you are.) The constant requests reminded me that a little over three years ago I wrote a column basically breaking capitalism down to a competition between savers and spenders, winners almost literally taking all. Now, as I did then, let me first say to all the lawyers, nitpickers, compliance people and ten or twenty (I lost count) regulatory bodies that can’t wait to fine me: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITTION TO PUCHASE OR OWN APPLE STOCK. IT IS MERELY AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN IF ONE SAVES MONEY IN ANY NUMBER OF PLACES VERSUS BUYING CRAP ONE WON’T CARE ABOUT IN 15 MINUTES! (Whew.) As I was saying, it is my belief that capitalism can be broken down into those who save and those who spend. As I said then, spenders always have enriched and always will enrich the savers. My example back in 2013 (you’re welcome, oh one person who listened to me) was that if you had bought $500 worth of Apple stock instead of $500 worth of Apple stuff (iPhones, watches, etc.) over the previous ten years, you would have had at that time around $60,000. The annoying update requests from Apple — which I always ignore for a week or two — caused me to wonder (picture a thought bubble over my head) what that number would be today. So … I checked. According to Morningstar, AAPL (the stock) is up around 77 percent since early 2013, near the time I wrote that piece. Now, is the point that I am brilliant and if I write about a stock you should buy it? Well, yes — I’m kidding now, very red-faced compliance guy … you guys are so easy. Actually, NO, that is not my point. Once again, my point is very simple: In this country and in other free-market capitalistic (yeah, right) societies, the savers are subsidized by the spenders. If you had purchased Apple stock in 2003 as per my original article, today that $500 per year investment would now be worth around $108,000. Even if you had started saving the day after my 2013 article, today your $1500 investment would be worth around $2655, which is way better than a sharp stick in the eye — or the more likely drawerful of phone or gadget carcasses you likely now have. Finally, in an effort to put a bow on this journalistic (a stretch, I know) gift, I bring you the following: We all like stuff. Period. End of sentence. We all know that stuff is a bad investment. Don’t believe me? Ask your friend who still drives that yellow Hummer he (and you know it’s a he) had to have back in 2007. How’s that bad boy holding its value? Adding a year’s delay before purchasing each new car, phone, TV, couch, exercise gadget du jour, Beanie Baby, Pet Rock, purse (oh yeah, I went there) and/or any other must-have consumer goods will not cause you to lose your already tenuous social status. What it might do, though, is allow you to add to your for sure tenuous savings and help your confidence level.

By any objective metric, Apple’s streaming music service is a success, what with more than 17 million subscribers attained in just a little over a year. But Apple isn’t a traditional company and, in turn, it’s not often held to a higher standard than most. That said, some have pegged the rollout of Apple Music as something of a disappointment. In addition to early functionality problems and a myriad of UI choices, Apple Music still lags behind Spotify in terms of overall subscribers. Not too long ago, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek hinted via Twitter that his company now boasts more than 40 million paying subscribers. All the more impressive is that Spotify is growing at a faster clip than Apple Music, despite the latter’s reliance on exclusive releases from big name artists like Drake and Frank Ocean. DON'T MISS: One of the iPhone 8’s hottest new features was just unveiled by another company Apple, though, is in it for the long haul and with the recent release of iOS 10, introduced a massive overhaul to the Apple Music experience. Commenting on where Apple thinks the music industry is headed, Apple Music chief Jimmy Iovine and other Apple Music bigwigs sat down for a far-ranging and interesting interview with Buzzfeed. As far as Apple’s music ambitions are concerned, Iovine said that while Apple has no interest in becoming a music label, it has no plans to slow down its pursuit of securing exclusives from A-list artists. “We put a lot into this, we’ve had some real successes, and we always hold up our end of the relationship,” Iovine said. “We’re feeling our way around and seeing what works … Every time we do [an exclusive], we learn something new.” One of the more interesting aspects of the interview focused on Apple’s strategy regarding Apple Music’s redesign. According to Apple, one of the goals with the design was to appeal more strongly to older and international users, hence the focus on a “cleaner interface with larger images and text…” It’s also worth highlighting why Apple believes its selection of algorithmically generated personalized playlists are more effective than what Spotify has to offer: years and years of old iTunes data. If you gave high ratings to a song or album in your old iTunes library, or just played it a lot more than others, you’ll find that behavior reflected in your My Favorites Mix. Meanwhile, the My New Music Mix algorithm serves recently released songs — as well as songs that Apple Music knows you haven’t played before — that the service’s music experts have flagged as similar to others in your taste profile. Apple Music executives suggested even more personalized playlists will follow in the series; but only after prototypes have been vetted, with all possible outcomes — intentional and otherwise — given careful consideration. Make sure to check out the full interview via the source link below. Apple hasn't been too forthcoming regarding its somewhat nascent music streaming service so there's a lot of interesting tidbits worth digesting.

Business Insurers Offer Cash, Discounts For Fitness Trackers Apple Watch Richard Vogel/AP Aetna will ask some of its large employer clients if they would like to subsidize Apple Watches for employees as part of their wellness programs. The company is working on wellness apps that can be used on the watch, iPhone or iPad. Aetna will ask some of its large employer clients if they would like to subsidize Apple Watches for employees as part of their wellness programs. The company is working on wellness apps that can be used on the watch, iPhone or iPad. (Richard Vogel/AP) Mara Lee Contact Reporter Aetna is working on writing apps that can be used on iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches to encourage customers to take their medications, seek support groups for their diagnoses, or pay their premiums with Apple Wallet. The apps will be available in early 2017. In preparation, Aetna announced Tuesday that it will offer subsidized Apple Watches to employees and large-employer clients that want to integrate them into wellness programs. Those companies may also subsidize "a significant portion" of the Apple Watch Series 1's $269 cost, Aetna said. Individual customers will also be offered the chance to buy the watch at a discount, the company said, if they choose Aetna in the upcoming open enrollment season. Aetna is the first U.S. insurer to subsidize Apple Watches, but other major insurers incorporate less expensive wearables, such as Fitbit or Misfit, into their wellness programs. Those can cost $100 to $150. Cigna offers Fitbit and Misfit wearables to customers at 25 to 50 percent off retail, as well as discounts for wireless scales and blood pressure and glucose monitors. The company studied 600 prediabetic, morbidly obese participants, offering health coaching by phone to all participants and fitness trackers to a smaller group. About 60 percent of those with devices continued past two calls, while only 20 percent of those without it continued. On average, the group wearing fitness trackers walked 3 miles and performed moderate activity for 49 minutes a day. The study did not ask the other group how much they exercised. Aetna CEO Responds To Senators' Accusations STEPHEN SINGER The chief executive officer of Aetna Inc. says that "marketplace reality" is pushing the company to exit many public health care exchanges and dismissed criticism of the company by a group of U.S. senators as "unfounded accusations." Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini wrote to the senators who said Aetna... The chief executive officer of Aetna Inc. says that "marketplace reality" is pushing the company to exit many public health care exchanges and dismissed criticism of the company by a group of U.S. senators as "unfounded accusations." Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini wrote to the senators who said Aetna... (STEPHEN SINGER) Cigna spokesman Joe Mondy said that incentives for using wellness coaching and/or wearables include about $750 in premium discounts, and cash or health savings account funds. UnitedHealthcare offers wellness programs including wearables to more than 100,000 people in more than 40 states, including Connecticut. Employers give the devices for free to workers and spouses on the insurance plan and if they meet certain goals they can receive up to $1,500 a year for their health savings accounts. UnitedHealthcare Spokesman Will Shanley said some employers are reporting more than 90 percent participation. If at least 60 percent of the employees meet walking targets — employers only see aggregate data — the amount the employers' health insurance premiums may rise in a single year is capped at 6 percent. Senators Question Aetna's Obamacare Pullout STEPHEN SINGER Five U.S. senators asked Aetna Inc. Thursday to explain its exit from many Obamacare exchanges, telling CEO Mark Bertolini they are troubled by the decision. The insurer's pullback, they said, appears to be linked to the Justice Department's lawsuit against Aetna that blocked the company's purchase... Five U.S. senators asked Aetna Inc. Thursday to explain its exit from many Obamacare exchanges, telling CEO Mark Bertolini they are troubled by the decision. The insurer's pullback, they said, appears to be linked to the Justice Department's lawsuit against Aetna that blocked the company's purchase... (STEPHEN SINGER) A clinical trial published in the Journal of American Medicine found that adding a wearable device doesn't necessarily provide a weight-loss advantage, however. The results of the study of 471 young adults over two years found that participants who had a wearable device lost less weight (7.7 pounds) than those who used used conventional counseling (13 pounds), although both groups successfully lost some weight. Both groups had six months of group counseling and diet advice, and both groups had improvements in body fat, fitness, amount of exercise and eating patterns. Aetna plans to provide the Apple Watch at no cost to its own nearly 50,000 employees. The company, which offers bonuses for meeting certain health targets, such as sleeping at least seven hours a night, will not require that the data be shared to prove the goals are being met. "We are incredibly excited to use iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch to create simple, intuitive and personalized technology solutions that will transform the health and wellness experience for our members," said Mark Bertolini, Aetna chairman and CEO. "This is only the beginning — we look forward to using these tools to improve health outcomes and help more people achieve more healthy days."

By Jake Smith for iGeneration | September 27, 2016 -- 22:02 GMT (15:02 PDT) | Topic: Apple Image: Jason Cipriani / ZDNet Insurance giant Aetna announced on Tuesday it will subsidize the Apple Watch for some of its customers and employees, as it looks for them to live a healthier lifestyle by tracking and analyzing their fitness data. One month with the Apple Watch: Pain, joy, and daily experiences The Apple Watch Sport edition has been strapped on my wrist for a month and for the most part it has exceeded all of my expectations. It's even better now that I realized I was wearing it wrong. Read More Aetna said the Apple Watch program will begin this fall to "select large employers and individual customers" during open enrollment season. While it didn't say how much of the Apple Watch it plans to subsidize, Aetna says it will offer monthly payroll deductions to make covering the remaining cost easier. Aetna will make the Apple Watch available to its 50,000 employees at no cost as part of the company's "wellness reimbursement program". Further, Aetna is developing its own iOS apps to remind customers to take their medicine, refill prescriptions, and contact a doctor. The apps, working across all of iOS, will be available in early 2017, the company says. "We are thrilled that Aetna will be helping their members and employees take greater control of their health using Apple Watch," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "Aetna's new initiatives will be a powerful force toward creating better customer experiences in health care, and we look forward to working with Aetna to make them successful." The deal is big for Apple, as health and fitness are one of the key selling points of the wearable. At the company's September event, Apple released watchOS 3 with several new fitness features.

Blige, Clinton interview clips face ridicule online Mary J. Blige attends Harper's Bazaar's celebration of "ICONS By Carine Roitfeld" on September 9, 2016 in New York City. (Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images Associated Press Sign-Up for our Entertainment Newsletter  Sign-Up LOS ANGELES (AP) — A pair of clips teasing Mary J. Blige’s interview with Hillary Clinton on her upcoming Apple Music show “The 411” isn’t winning over social media users. The teaser featuring the R&B singer crooning Bruce Springsteen’s “American Skin (41 Shots)” before clasping hands with Clinton was mocked online after it was released Tuesday by Apple. The moment, and Blige’s words, are meant to be inspiring: “If an officer stops you, always be polite, and never ever run away. Promise Mama you’ll keep your hands inside. Is it a gun? Is it a knife? Is it a wallet? This is your life. It ain’t no secret. It ain’t no secret, no secret my friend. You can get killed just for living in your American skin.” Instead, thanks to Blige’s all-in sincerity and Clinton’s miraculously straight face, the impromptu song is almost too awkward to watch. Inae Oh of Mother Jones wrote in in a story titled “Someone Please Explain What the Hell Is Going on With This Mary J. Blige, Hillary Clinton Interview” that the clips “created far more confusion than the excitement Apple likely intended.” Springsteen wrote “American Skin (41 Shots)” about the 1999 police shooting death of Guinean immigrant Amadou Diallo. “The 411 with Mary J. Blige” is set to debut Sept. 30.

PETE WILSON @NewsmanPete The 4th Annual Jackson Apple Festival Band Show once again drew a large crowd to Jackson High School's Alumni Stadium this past Saturday afternoon, September 24. The Jackson High School Marching Ironmen participated as well as seven visiting bands from Southern and Central Ohio. The event is held in conjunction with the Jackson Apple Festival and all eight bands later participated in the festival's Grand Finale Parade that evening.

The event was non-competitive and all bands had the opportunity to perform several numbers. Each band perceived a large performance trophy which was adorned with a large apple on the top to symbolize the Apple Festival. Following all the performances, it was also announced that the Batavia Bulldog Band and its contingent had won the Spirit Award.

Resend activation e-mail Scientific Method / Science & Exploration Want an Apple Watch? For some Aetna customers, it’ll soon be covered Apple “thrilled” to partner with Aetna and turn devices into medical hubs. by Beth Mole - Sep 27, 2016 10:21 pm UTC Login to bookmark 115 Two current-gen Apple Watch Sport models. Andrew Cunningham On Tuesday, health insurance giant Aetna announced that it’s starting a new app-based health program that will exclusively rely on Apple products—namely, the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. As part of the program, Aetna will subsidize Apple Watches for select customers as well as offer the smartwatches at no cost to their own 50,000 employees beginning in early 2017. The news from Aetna, which covers about 23 million people nationwide, may please its Apple-loving customers. But no one will be as happy as Apple, which has recently pushed for its devices to be fashioned into medical hubs. Earlier this year, the company unveiled CareKit, an open source platform for creating healthcare apps. In a joint statement with Aetna, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the following: We are thrilled that Aetna will be helping [its] members and employees take greater control of their health using Apple Watch. Aetna’s new initiatives will be a powerful force toward creating better customer experiences in health care, and we look forward to working with Aetna to make them successful. In a statement to Ars, Aetna spokesperson Ethan Slavin said that Aetna will be working directly with Apple to develop a suite of healthcare apps for Aetna customers. “Apple will have employees devoted to providing support to Aetna on this initiative,” he wrote, and “Aetna will also have a dedicated employee unit focused on this collaboration.” Slavin was mum on whether the apps would be developed using CareKit, however. The iOS-exclusive apps aim to streamline healthcare through mobile devices, with integrated features including: Care management and wellness, to help guide consumers through health events like a new diagnosis or prescription medication with user-driven support from nurses and people with similar conditions. Medication adherence, to help consumers remember to take their medications, easily order refills and connect with their doctor if they need a different treatment through their Apple Watch or iPhone. Integration with Apple Wallet, allowing consumers to check their deductible and pay a bill. Personalized health plan on-boarding, information, messaging, and decision support to help Aetna members understand and make the most of their benefits. Aetna will have the apps ready and start covering Apple Watches in early 2017. For now, Aetna said it will make the Apple Watch available to just select “large employers and individual customers.” It described the subsidy as covering a “significant portion” of the watch, but Slavin wouldn’t say exactly how much. Whatever costs remain can be paid off through monthly payroll deductions. If the program takes off, it could buoy Apple Watch sales, which have slumped. Sales dropped by 55 percent in the second quarter of 2016, from 3.6 million watches sold to 1.6 million. Apple isn’t the only device maker trying to get into health programs. Fitbit, Inc., recently started “Fitbit Group Health,” which partners with insurance companies and others to get its fitness trackers into corporate wellness programs.

Word, Excel, and PowerPoint form the industry standard office suite Which Office Suite Is Best for You? Which Office Suite Is Best for You? You'll be pressed to find an occupation that doesn't require word or number processing of some sort. And you may wonder, is Microsoft Office really the best solution? Here are your options. Read More , and that’s just what everyone expects to use. But it’s time to give iWork another chance. Many long-time Office users will be unwilling to transition away from the apps they’re so used to working with. Whether you’re an Office veteran or a complete newcomer to these types of apps, iWork may deserve another chance. Let’s take a look at why. 1. It’s Free This might not matter if you get to use Office for free 6 Ways You Can Use Microsoft Office Without Paying For It 6 Ways You Can Use Microsoft Office Without Paying For It Read More through your university or workplace, but to freelancers, hobbyists, and anyone else who uses these kinds of apps on a regular basis, this could be a pretty big deal. A new copy of Microsoft Office Home and Student 2016 is $100, which is a significant amount of cash for something you probably don’t need 5 Good Reasons Why You Should NOT Buy Office 2016 5 Good Reasons Why You Should NOT Buy Office 2016 Should you buy the standalone package version of Office 2016? We present our case why we think you shouldn't and show you what you can do instead. Read More . A 12-month subscription to Office 365 will actually cost you $100 per year, which can really add up. Of course, Office 365 does offer you access to a number of other apps, including Outlook, Publisher, and Access, but these are niche apps that many people don’t need anyway. Ads by Google iWork comes with every qualifying Mac purchased after October 2014 for free. It’s hard to beat that. If your Mac is older and you need to download the suite from the App Store, you’ll pay $20 per app for a total of $60, still cheaper than Office. Most iPads and iPhones get iWork for free, too. 2. Cleaner Interface Word, Excel, and PowerPoint are very powerful tools, and their interfaces are absolutely jam-packed full of options and menus. If you’re a power user, this can be a good thing; you have quick access to all of the myriad settings you could want. But the majority of users don’t need all of the options that are available. Managing references, text elements, and mathematical equations aren’t common concerns among most office suite users. I’d be willing to bet that at least 95% of Word users have never needed to adjust the hyphenation zone. iWork gets rid of a lot of this clutter in favor of a cleaner interface, which eliminates distractions and provides a more peaceful productivity environment. As with many Mac features, this contributes to increased ease of use Drinking the Kool Aid: 8 Reasons People Love Their Macs Drinking the Kool Aid: 8 Reasons People Love Their Macs When you can buy a laptop for under $500, and a Chromebook will satisfy most people's computing needs, why do people insist on spending well over $1000 on a Mac? Read More . The top of the Pages window, for example, has Insert, Table, Chart, Text, Shape, Media, and Comment buttons. That’s pretty much everything you need for word processing. Both Numbers and Keynote are similarly sparse when it comes to menubar options. You can see in the comparison shots above and below just how much cleaner the iWork apps are. Seeing the Office apps next to them makes it obvious just how much clutter Microsoft’s apps have. If you’re thinking to yourself “But I always need to adjust the Style settings in Word!” then you might not be a good candidate for switching to iWork. There is a sacrifice in power that you’ll make for these cleaner interfaces. But for the majority of people, the tools available in the iWork apps are sufficient, and this makes them easier to use. There are many other options available through the menus, so it’s not like you’re giving up every customizable option. Just most of the ones you don’t need. 3. iCloud & Mobile Integration There are tons of great cloud storage services out there, but iCloud has the advantage of being deeply integrated into every Apple product, from software to hardware. Being able to quickly and easily save your office documents to iCloud What Is iCloud Drive & How Does It Work? What Is iCloud Drive & How Does It Work? If you have updated your iPhone or iPad to iOS 8, and your Mac to OS X Yosemite, then you're ready for Apple's iCloud Drive. But what is it, and why should use it? Read More is a handy feature that can save you time if you come to rely on it. By keeping all of your documents from Pages, Numbers, and Keynote saved in iCloud, you can work on them from any computer connected to the internet. You can even work on them from your iPhone, or non-Apple devices via iCloud.com. Having access to mobile versions of these apps is also a big benefit. You can use Microsoft Office for free on your 9.7″ iPad, but on a Mac it requires an Office 365 subscription. Apple’s office productivity suite may be less powerful, but it’s also more financially viable if you don’t need all that power. The mobile versions of iWork apps are also free provided you have a recent device, and they’re well-optimized for mobile work. Even writing on your phone isn’t too bad How You Can Type Easier and Faster on Your iPhone How You Can Type Easier and Faster on Your iPhone This isn’t the first thing I’ve written on an iDevice, but it’s the first time I’ve chosen to do it when I’ve had other options. Read More . Using an iPad or iPad Pro is even better, though. 4. Collaboration and Sharing Once you upgrade to macOS Sierra What's New in macOS Sierra? The New Features Coming to Your Mac What's New in macOS Sierra? The New Features Coming to Your Mac OS X is dead, long live macOS. Read More , iWork is able to support real-time collaboration between colleagues via iCloud. This means you’ll be able to easily work on a document with a number of other people, much like you can currently do with Google Drive apps How to Easily Collaborate on Google Drive with Online Annotation How to Easily Collaborate on Google Drive with Online Annotation There are specialized annotation web apps available that integrate with Google Drive and make communicating with others about your document easier. We look at the best annotation tools for Google Drive. Read More . This may not be a big deal to many, but if collaboration was the one thing tying you to Google’s solution then it could make all the difference. iWork already has some cool sharing features built in. The Share menu lets you share iCloud links or send the document via Messages or Apple’s built-in Notes app Thinking of Switching From Evernote to Apple Notes? Here's How Thinking of Switching From Evernote to Apple Notes? Here's How Apple has a free notes app, and it received a rather substantial overhaul with iOS 9 and El Capitan. But should you ditch Evernote for it? That depends. Read More . Again, these might not seem like a big deal, but if you work with a lot of people who use Macs, you’ll likely appreciate it. 5. Microsoft Office Compatibility Using anything besides Microsoft Office always comes with the worry about compatibility. How will it deal with DOC and DOCX files? This used to be a big count against using anything besides Office. iWork apps have come a long way in their compatibility, and can now open, edit, and save files in standard Office formats 9 Rare Office File Formats You Have to Know 9 Rare Office File Formats You Have to Know Have you ever come across strange file formats in your office suite? We'll give you a quick primer on rare, yet useful office file types and what you can use them for. Read More . While the default is still the iWork file extension (PAGES, KEY, NUMBERS), you can save files in DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, and PPTX, as well as a few others like PDF, CSV, and HTML. While you may encounter an occasional difficulty with formatting, you aren’t likely to run into any serious problems. You don’t have to worry about your colleagues who use Microsoft Office having difficulty with your files. Will You Make the Switch? If you haven’t tried iWork in a while, I strongly recommend that you give it a shot in the near future. Unless you’re a serious power user of Microsoft Office, you might find that the cleaner interface and the better integration with the Mac operating environment makes it a winner! Do you use iWork? Or will you be sticking with Office? What made you decide either way? Share your thoughts in the comments below!

If I ever had to switch for all the reasons written above, I would very happily switch to Google Apps. Reply Dann Albright October 19, 2016 at 11:02 pm Yes, Google Apps is also an option. I haven't been super impressed with their apps, though; I'm not sure exactly what it is. I do use them on occasion, but the online limitations and interfaces just don't do it for me. Reply one9712745 September 29, 2016 at 3:29 am I remember previously when I used iWork-iCloud integration during my uni masters days back somewhere in 2011-2012. Back then it was a 'wow' factor, & I jumped in. Saved lots & lots of references & articles for my thesis. But then they 'revamped' iCloud WITHOUT any warning whatsoever, and I lost most of my references. And it happened to many, just google it. Yes I should have had copies on local hard drive, I've learnt. My biggest gripe was that I've emailed them for help, and only got 'We regret for your inconvenience and go this webpage for troubleshooting' which didn't help. Or perhaps I'm living outside US, which may be not important commercially. Reply Dann Albright October 19, 2016 at 11:02 pm Yeah, losing reference material is rough. That's why I always used Endnote and backed everything up. :-) Sorry to hear that, though . . . updates can be unpredictable. Reply Fischi September 28, 2016 at 2:37 pm I like the Apple Office suite, but it is quit unfair and also a little bit bluffing to use the OLD Microsoft Office 2011 for your screenshots as there exist a very newer one Microsoft Office 2016 for Mac. Not really good journalism ... Reply anon September 28, 2016 at 9:24 pm They did not talk about 1 TB free storage which comes with Office 365. Also at the cost of around $80 per month, you get five TB space with five license. Did I add Skype credits to send SMS or call someone over internet? Reply Dann Albright October 19, 2016 at 11:04 pm Getting storage space with Office 365 is one of the perks, but you do also get iCloud storage. It's not a huge amount, but I don't think many people are really in the position of needing more cloud storage at the moment. There's just so much free storage out there that paying for it seems a little ridiculous! Reply anon October 27, 2016 at 3:13 pm First your title is incomplete and because article is directed to noobs and it must be explicitly mentioned there. Don't generalize your opinion. Fair point many people don't need more space. Define what you do you mean by 'many'? Who really comes in that category? These days I see noobs uploading videos to YouTube. They must want to back up the original copies. You are a journalist please cite your sources before speaking your mind. Please conduct a survey to see amount of space people desire in their device. Didn't you notice the Apple had bumped amount of store present in iPhone. Open your eyes. Also you are forgetting that reliability of MS Office has been an industry standard. No questions there. I appreciate your honesty in the comment below. But don't you think it is unfair to misjudge something at your standpoint. You can always get a 30 day trial version before making your opinion about it. Dann Albright October 19, 2016 at 11:03 pm That's a fair point. But because I have iWork, I haven't felt compelled to buy Office 2016! Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Here’s how to enable dark mode on the Apple TV to make your light-night TV escapades more enjoyable. RELATED ARTICLES How to Set Your Apple TV to Automatically Turn Your Television or Media Center On How to Use Your iPhone or iPad as an Apple TV Remote Dark mode is a new feature that was introduced in tvOS 10, so you’ll need to make sure your Apple TV is up to date first. Then, to enable it, start by opening up the settings app on the home screen. Select “General” Scroll down a bit to “Appearance” and select it. After that, the theme will change to a darker color, going from “Light” to “Dark”, as Apple calls it. You can now go back to the main screen, where it will appear dark as well. The bad news is that apps are completely separate from the Apple TV’s menus, so if there’s an Apple TV app that has a particularly blinding white theme that you wish you could make darker, that’s something you’ll have to take up with that specific app developer. In the mean time, though, you can at least make the menus of your Apple TV more bearable, and many apps are introducing dark mode to go along with this sleek new look.

At first glance Apple's iPhone 7 appears identical to its predecessors, headphone jack aside, but look closer and you'll find a wide range of enhancements from more grunt under the bonnet to support for faster mobile broadband speeds. While these will please some iGadget fans, others will be won over by the iPhone 7's multimedia overhaul. When lightsabers clash you can see and hear the iPhone 7's multimedia improvements.   Last year's iPhone 6s inherited the same screen and speakers as the iPhone 6, except that the 6s added support for Force Touch so it can tell how hard you're pressing the screen. This year the screen on the new iPhone 7 is 25 per cent brighter and can also display a wider range of colours. Shine on Apple chief Tim Cook speaks at the launch of the iPhone 7 in San Francisco. Photo: Bloomberg The screen's increased brightness is noticeable but not striking – it's barely enough to make a difference when it comes to overcoming outdoor glare when reading in direct sunlight. Take the phones back inside and you'll notice that the iPhone 7's image highlights are a little more vivid and pure whites look a little warmer, with the iPhone 6's whites seeming to have the slightest of blue tinges in comparison. This is assuming that both handsets have their brightness cranked up to full and Auto-Brightness disabled. Turn Auto-Brightness on and they look identical in a brightly lit environment. Advertisement Take the phones into a dark room and the iPhone 6 actually looks a little brighter, as the iPhone 7's Auto-Brightness appears to be slightly more aggressive. This might be a ploy to help extend the battery life, as the screen is one of the biggest culprits when it comes to sucking juice. If you're watching a movie like The Force Awakens on the iPhone 7 in bed at night with the lights off, you'll want to kill Auto-Brightness and crank it up for the picture to look its best. Even then the improvements are subtle – lightsabers look a little more striking, as do Stormtroopers' uniforms, while the orange in BB-8's paint job is a bit more vivid. A visitor tries out an iPhone 7 on the first day of sales at the Apple Store in Berlin. Photo: Getty Images Living colour More important than brightness in terms of picture quality is the iPhone 7's support for DCI-P3 wide colour gamut, which you'll already find in the 5K iMac and 9.7-inch iPad Pro. This basically means that the screen can display more vivid colours and a greater range of fine colour variations, but only if the content supports it. This "Display P3" test image contains the WebKit logo embedded, visible on the iPhone 7. Photo: WebKit colour gamut resource page The red test image above, from the WebKit colour gamut resource page, reveals the difference. It's a "Display P3" test image with the WebKit logo embedded in such a way that it's only visible on wide colour gamut screens like the iPhone 7. Below you can see what the hidden logo should look like. Even if you drop the brightness on the iPhone 7 the logo still stands out clearly in the picture above, because the background red (shown in purple below) is a particular red which older iPhones – and most other devices – simply can't display so they choose another red. On an iPhone 6 the red of the background and the red of the logo appear identical, so the logo is invisible. A version of that image using a purple background colour so you can see the WebKit logo on a normal screen. Photo: WebKit colour gamut resource page Content providers like Netflix are starting to take advantage of wide colour gamut as part of their support for Ultra HD, but the problem is that this content is aimed at Ultra HD televisions rather than pocket-sized smartphones. At least for now, the Netflix iOS app doesn't support wide colour gamut so an Ultra HD show like Marco Polo doesn't offer richer colours on the iPhone 7 apart from the benefit of the brighter screen. Wide colour gamut is open to all iOS developers, Instagram has pledged support and so have some game developers. Listen up Tip the iPhone 7 on its side to watch a movie and you'll immediately notice the benefit of true stereo sound, thanks to the fact that the earpiece above the screen now acts as a second speaker on the opposite end of the phone to the original speaker alongside the Lightning jack. When you're watching a movie, the soundtrack now appears to come from the middle of the screen rather than off to the side. During lightsaber duels, you can hear the sound shift with the combatants as they move across the screen. The handset automatically flips the speakers when you flip the screen, so the left and right channels always come from the correct side of the phone. You can also hear the stereo separation when you play music so, if you tend to lie your phone on the table with the base pointing at you, you'll want to get in the habit of spinning it around so it faces you side on. You might even stand the phone up on its side, but surprisingly Apple's Music app doesn't support landscape mode. Home theatre buffs might scoff at the thought of watching your favourite movies on a tiny screen, but the iPhone 7 is certainly a step up from its predecessors when it comes to keeping a portable cinema in your pocket.

Sales aren't keeping pace with expectations, and that has some big names like Motorola, Huawei and LG opting not to release any new models this year. In a watered-down field, let's compare our top picks of the smartwatches you can buy today. In this version of our Smartwatch Comparison Guide, we're including six smartwatches – some new, some old: Apple Watch Series 2 Samsung Gear S3 Apple Watch Series 1 Huawei Watch Motorola Moto 360 (2nd-gen) Pebble Time The last three are year-old (or worse) smartwatches, and the Series 1 Apple Watch is only a minor update on the early 2015 model. That leaves the Apple Watch Series 2 and Gear S3 as the only truly new products. A waning smartwatch space indeed. Pebble Time is the sketchiest inclusion in this bunch, mostly because it has a follow-up launching within the next month or so. If we deem Pebble 2 a worthy successor, we'll update this guide once it hits retail. Size Apple's greatest feat with the Watch may be that it doesn't look like something that belongs on the wrist of a juiced-up WWE man-hulk. While Samsung is doubling down on oversized male-jewelry this year, Apple has cemented its device's status as the smartwatch that doesn't look overly huge on either men's or women's wrists (though its thickness does still make it protrude a bit). For simplicity's sake, we left the smaller 38 mm Apple Watch out of this visual. The 39 x 33 mm device is, in many cases, going to be the best choice for women's wrists. There's also a smaller version of the Moto 360, measuring 42 x 42 mm, which I prefer over the larger version on my (not especially small) wrist. Build The Apple Watch Series 2 ships in three different builds: aluminum (cheapest), stainless steel (middle ground) and ceramic (high-end). The Series 1 Apple Watch only ships in cheapo aluminum. Water resistance All the watches have some sort of water resistance, but only the Apple Watch and Pebble can support swimming, protecting against depths of up to 50 m or 30 m, respectively. Only the Apple Watch Series 2 has built-in swim tracking, so you can see how those laps add up. Default band materials Looking only at the default bands that ship with the watches, these are your options. Interchangeable bands You can change the bands on all the watches, but Apple used a proprietary connector, so you'll need to either buy a band made especially for the Watch (there are plenty of third-party options on Amazon if you want to save money) or pick up an adapter to use with standard bands. The rest of the watches play nice with standard bands: 22 mm for all but the Huawei Watch, which uses an 18 mm connector. iPhone compatibility Samsung keeps saying the Gear S3 (and last year's S2) will be compatible with iPhones at some point, but we're still waiting for that. Everything else works with Apple's handsets, though Android Wear watches lose a little bit of functionality when paired with an iPhone vs. an Android. Android compatibility All but the Apple Watches work with Android phones. Display size The larger of the two Moto 360 models has the biggest screen in this bunch, despite the "flat tire" cut-off point at its bottom. We left out the smaller Apple Watch, which has a 1.32-inch screen (46 percent the size of the larger Moto's), and the smaller Moto 360 with its 1.37-inch display (77 percent the size of its big bro's screen). Display resolution The Apple Watches have the sharpest screens, by a wide margin. The unpictured 38 mm Apple Watch has 340 x 272 (326 PPI) resolution, while the 42 mm Moto 360 goes with 360 x 325 (263 PPI). Display type AMOLED (or OLED) displays are the standard for wearables, though Motorola goes unconventional with an IPS. Pebble Time uses e-paper: a similar effect on the eyes as e-ink, but altogether different tech. Touchscreen That also makes Pebble the only one without a touchscreen. Display material The steel and ceramic versions of the Apple Watch, along with the Huawei Watch, give you ultra-strong sapphire displays. Everything else is Gorilla Glass or Apple's similar Ion-X glass. Always-on display Apple has yet to add an always-on display option to the Watch. Before you get worked up over this, consider that this omission probably allowed Apple to use a smaller battery, and therefore make a smaller watch. Scrolling input The Apple Watch uses its twisting Digital Crown as an alternative to swiping the screen for scrolling through lists and zooming in and out of photos. Me-too Samsung pounced on a similar feature, as you can twist its bezel to do the same kinds of things. Battery These are the manufacturers' estimates, used with the always-on display option turned off (the lone exception being Pebble, which always has its screen on). About the only advantage Pebble has over its multitouch rivals is that its battery can last up to a week. That's the tradeoff for its lower-powered, barebones nature. Cellular Only the Frontier variant of the Samsung Gear S3 (not pictured, that's the Classic variant you see) has built-in cellular data. The rest will need a phone around at all times to do much of anything. GPS The Apple Watch Series 2 and Gear S3, though, can track your location without a paired phone. Note that there's an alternate version of the Moto 360 ("Sport") that does have GPS. Pedometer All of the watches have some sort of built-in pedometer functionality, as well as supporting third-party fitness tracking apps. Heart-rate tracking All but Pebble have built-in pulse monitors. There's at least one add-on strap accessory for Pebble that will add this, but it isn't available yet. Mobile payments The Apple Watch supports Apple Pay, and the Gear S3 will support Samsung Pay (including the MST-based part, which simulates the swiping of a credit card). Processor Pebble, with its more rudimentary user experience, is the only one rocking a single core chip under the hood. Reminders Last year Samsung baffled us by not supporting the ability to create reminders or calendar events, but the Gear S3 is supposed to finally solve this smartwatch basic. Pebble has third-party apps that can tick this box, but nothing integrated into its core software. Phone calls In case you're a big Dick Tracy fan and don't mind looking like a tool in public, you can hold a phone conversation on your watch using the Apple Watch, Gear S3 or Huawei Watch. Software Both versions of the Apple Watch run watchOS 3, the Gear runs Samsung's own Tizen and it's Android Wear for the Huawei Watch and Moto 360. Apple has the app selection lead, by a wide margin. Release As we mentioned at the top, three of the watches are from last year. The Apple Watch Series 1 is nearly a 2015 watch too, with the only change being its dual core processor. Samsung will be the last out of the gates when the Gear S3 starts shipping on November 18. Starting price Apple was wise to throw that Series 1 Apple Watch in there to tempt customers who don't care enough about smartwatches to throw down more than US$300. Compared to Series 2, it's only lacking GPS, water resistance and a super-bright display, making it a solid alternative for $100 less than its Series 2 counterparts. And keep in mind that these prices are the entry levels for Apple's 38 mm Watches. The 42 mm ones (pictured) start at $399 for Series 2 and $299 for Series 1. At $350, the Gear S3 is a pretty expensive watch – and it's possible some wireless carriers will charge more for the LTE-enabled version of the Frontier variant (though AT&T is asking the same $350).

Blige's interview with Hillary Clinton on her upcoming Apple Music show "The 411" isn't winning over social media users. The teaser featuring the R&B singer crooning Bruce Springsteen's "American Skin (41 Shots)" before clasping hands with Clinton was instantly mocked online after it was released following the presidential debate Tuesday by Apple. Another clip showcased Blige telling Clinton that "a lot of people in my community think Obama was blocked in congress because he was black." FILE - In this June 1, 2016 file photo, Mary J. Blige attends "The Wiz Live!" Photo Op held at the Directors Guild of America in Los Angeles. A pair of clips teasing Blige's interview with Hillary Clinton on her upcoming Apple Music show "The 411" isn't winning over social media users. The teaser featuring Blige crooning Bruce Springsteen's "American Skin (41 Shots)" before clasping hands with Clinton was mocked online quickly after it was posted Tuesday, Sept. 27 by Apple.(Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File) "How are you going to do what he wasn't able to do?" the "No More Drama" and "Real Love" singer asks Clinton. Inae Oh of Mother Jones wrote in in a story titled "Someone Please Explain What the Hell Is Going on With This Mary J. Blige, Hillary Clinton Interview" that the clips "created far more confusion than the excitement Apple likely intended." Maeve McDermott of USA Today said "thanks to Blige's all-in sincerity and Clinton's miraculously straight face, the impromptu song is almost too awkward to watch." Springsteen wrote "American Skin (41 Shots)" about the 1999 police shooting death of Guinean immigrant Amadou Diallo. Apple is billing the interview as "an intimate conversation" featuring Blige "like you've never seen her." ''The 411 with Mary J. Blige" is set to debut Sept. 30. ___ Online: http://apple.co/The411 Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Incase today announced 12 new Apple Watch bands that are available now, while Belkin has taken the wraps off of a new classic leather band in various colors that will be available soon. Incase’s new bands are all either in the nylon NATO style, similar to Apple’s own nylon offerings and other third-party options like what we went hands-on with earlier this year, or leather. The nylon Apple Watch bands are available in four different colors: black, anthracite, deep red, and blonde. As expected, they come in 38mm and 42mm sizes, as well. In terms of pricing, Incase’s nylon bands cost $39.95, which is less than Apple’s own nylon offering. Additionally, Incase today announced a lineup of leather bands for the Apple Watch. The leather bands are available in 38mm and 42mm sizes and black and brown color options. You can get your hands on Incase’s leather bands for $59.95, again cheaper than Apple’s own leather options. Belkin today announced its first Apple Watch band, though it’s still listed as coming soon. Belkin’s offering is made of leather and is available in black, gray, and tan. Keeping with the trend, the bands come in at $59.99. We reported earlier this year that Apple was working with some third-party manufacturers on Apple Watch bands, including Incase. It’s unclear, however, if Apple had a say in these bands or if it will pick them up for selling in its own retail stores. Currently, Apple only sells its in-house bands and Hermès bands, but given that the company sells third-party iPhone accessories, we wouldn’t be surprised to see third-party Apple Watch bands make their way to retail stores. The only difference with bands, however, is that there are more SKUs to keep up with. Belkin’s new Apple Watch bands are listed as “coming soon” for $59.99. Incase’s new nylon and leather bands, however, are available now for $39.95 and $59.95, respectively.  Guides Apple Watch View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Alex Fitzpatrick @alexjamesfitz Sept. 27, 2016 SHARE Spencer Platt—Getty Images A driver uses a phone while behind the wheel of a car on April 30, 2016 in New York City. Critics say smartphone makers aren't doing enough to prevent road fatalities A lawsuit filed against Apple after a fatal texting-while-driving collision in Texas raises an interesting question about smartphone manufacturers’ liability in such incidents. Namely: Can Apple, Samsung, or other such companies be sued on the grounds that they don’t do enough to prevent drivers from getting distracted by calls, texts and other notifications? It’s an important issue, given that more than 3,100 people were killed in distracted driving incidents in 2014, according to government data. (Drivers can be distracted by their phones but also by other passengers, food, and other factors.) Several legal experts we spoke with say Apple is unlikely to be liable when it comes to texting-while-driving incidents. “To say that an iPhone, when it’s being used improperly, or being used in an irresponsible manner, is responsible for the injury in this case is just too much of a stretch,” says Gail Gottehrer, partner at Axinn Veltrop & Harkrider LLP and technology litigation expert. “If you think about it, then you would have manufacturers being responsible for all sorts of distractions. For example, all too often you drive past somebody who’s reading a book on the steering wheel. Does that mean that distraction is the source of an accident if it happens, so you would go back and sue the book publisher?” Still, Mark Geistfeld, Sheila Lubetsky Birnbaum Professor of Civil Litigation at The New York University School of Law, believes Apple and similar firms have a responsibility to explore ways to cut down on distracted driving. “The way the issue is being framed is that manufacturers don’t have to worry about this, flat stop, and that’s simply incorrect,” he says. “They’re under an obligation to search for cost-effective ways to do this. If such a fix becomes feasible, then they’re obligated to adopt it.” One such technological solution might be for smartphone makers to disable or limit a device’s functionality when it’s traveling at driving speeds. Modern phones are aware of how fast they’re traveling, thanks to their internal accelerometers and GPS chips. Indeed, Apple has long held a patent related to this approach, though it isn’t clear if it has developed the idea. Apple did not respond to TIME’s questions about the patent or the Texas case. Of course, there’s no guarantee that a phone is being used in a potentially dangerous way simply because it’s traveling at high speeds. Perhaps it’s being used by a passenger in car, for instance, or while on a train. Jennifer H. Arlen, Norma Z. Paige Professor of Law at The New York University School of Law, says that makes texting-while-driving cases a “very good place for liability imposed directly on the person who misuses [a phone], and perhaps criminal statutes that enhance the penalties on people who have serious accidents while texting and driving.” (Indeed, the driver in the Texas case was found guilty of negligent homicide; Texas has no statewide law banning texting while driving.) Apple and other smartphone manufacturers are also developing systems that tie Siri and other voice control systems directly into vehicles’ infotainment system. Apple calls its system CarPlay, for Android devices there’s Android Auto. Whereas many states have laws against using a handheld device while driving, there are often exemptions for these so-called “hands-free” systems. (They’re often seen as safer, though research disputes that.) These systems involve different liability circumstances because they’re expressly designed for use while driving — but they also show safety warnings meant to remind users to pay attention to the road. Another fix, though a much longer-term one, could be self-driving cars. After all, there’s no harm in using your phone if you don’t need to drive your own vehicle. Still, fully autonomous cars are still years, if not decades, away. The autonomous technology we have now largely still requires drivers to be ready to take over at a moment’s notice, despite being marketed with terms like “Autopilot,” as is the case with Tesla vehicles. Perhaps the most promising and immediately available solution are apps that, when enabled, automatically reply to incoming calls and texts with a message to the effect of: “I’m driving, I’ll call you back later.” In some ways, it’s surprising that Apple and other smartphone makers largely fail to offer such apps or settings by default. For now, that functionality remains optional, all while many people accept the risk that comes with distracted driving. The problem may only be fixed, then, when drivers realize just how dangerous that can be. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

It really is as simple as copy-and-paste—assuming everything is configured correctly. Read on to learn how to make sure you’re set up to use Universal Clipboard. Universal Clipboard lets you copy text and graphics from one Apple device to another Before you get started, make sure your Mac, iPhone, and iPad are new enough to take advantage of Universal Clipboard. Compatible Macs 2012 or newer iMac Early 2015 or newer MacBook 2012 or newer MacBook Pro 2012 or newer MacBook Air 2012 or newer Mac mini Late 2013 Mac Pro Compatible iOS Devices iPhone 5 or newer iPad Pro 4th generation iPad iPad Air or iPad Air 2 iPad mini 2 or newer 6th generation iPod touch You need to sign in to the same Apple ID on all of your devices, and make sure Bluetooth is turned on. Also make sure your devices are all on the same local network, too. Update: TMO did more testing, and while Apple says Universal Clipboard requires Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, you don’t need a network connection at all. Your devices only need to use the same Apple ID and have Bluetooth turned on. Fire Up Handoff Universal Clipboard is part of Handoff, so we’ll need to make sure that’s turn on for all of your devices, too. To enable Handoff in macOS Sierra, do this: Launch System Preferences Select General Check Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices Enable Handoff in macOS Sierra’s preferences to use Universal Clipboard To enable Handoff in iOS 10, do this: Tap Settings Select General Tap Handoff Enable Handoff iOS 10’s Handoff setting needs to be enabled, too, for Universal Clipboard Now you can select and copy text, photos, and graphics from Web pages on your iPhone, for example, and paste them into documents on your Mac. You can also copy and paste between your iOS devices, like your iPhone and iPad—and if you have multiple Macs using the same Apple ID you can copy and paste between them, too. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: Handoff, iOS 10, macOS Sierra, tips, Universal Clipboard 4 Comments Add a comment TheBenFNC September 27, 2016 … I don’t have that preference on my Mac, running Sierra… September 27, 2016 at 4:39 EST PM Snaab4 September 27, 2016 I also don’t have that preference. I have the late 2009 iMac, the oldest iMac on which Sierra runs. May my problem be that I also have an older version of Bluetooth (Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR) that doesn’t support Handoff? September 27, 2016 at 6:16 EST PM Chuck Yadmark September 27, 2016 2011 iMac, no. I was under the impression had to have Bluetooth 4 which the 11 does not have. So I was a little surprised by this article and was hoping I was wrong, but the article is wrong. September 27, 2016 at 6:22 EST PM jasontaylor September 28, 2016 Does anyone know how this works with Clipboard managers? ie. If you save copy multiple things on your iOS device will it continue to populate your clipboard manager history as it would if you were on the macOS?

This tech giant is giving Apple a run for its money CBS News 9/27/2016 aimee picchi © REUTERS Apple CEO Tim Cook shows the new MacBook during an Apple event in San Francisco, California March 9, 2015. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith (UNITED STATES - Tags: SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS) - RTR4SNE7 When it comes to computers, consumers have consistently ranked Apple (AAPL) at the top of the list. But now another computer maker is rising in consumers’ estimation -- and giving Apple a run for its money -- according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index. The runner-up is Samsung, the Korean manufacturer that among many other things produces laptops, Chromebooks and monitors. In many cases, the Samsung products are considerably less expensive than Apple’s. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 109.95 -0.04 -0.04% Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN ▼ 404.56 -15.52 -3.69% Sanofi SA SNYNF ▼ 81.85 -0.95 -1.15% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 756.40 +9.91 +1.33% Samsung, however, has garnered negative attention this fall for its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, which included batteries at risk for overheating and catching fire. It’s possible the fallout will expand into Samsung’s computer line if consumers start viewing the company as less consistent as a result.© Provided by CBS Interactive Inc. Play Video Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall ordered The latest PC satisfaction ratings represent the views of more than 3,500 consumers in the second quarter,  before the Galaxy issue became known. “It’s interesting because Apple has had to contend for a few years with Samsung coming on strong,” said ACSI director David VanAmburg. “We’ll see what happens next year after the fiasco with the 7.” Apple is holding onto its crown -- for now -- as the top-rated computer maker with consumers. It received a customer satisfaction score of 84, but Samsung was close behind with an 83. Samsung climbed five points from a year earlier, while Apple’s score was unchanged. The third-rated computer maker is Amazon (AMZN), with a score of 80. While consumers view Amazon favorably, its products are slightly more specialized, such as its Kindle e-book reading devices and Fire tablets, rather than serving as full-fledged computers. Apple also beat out Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP (HPQ), Lenova and Toshiba, with the latter two scoring at the bottom with ratings of 76. “If there’s any product out there perceived to be equal to or very close to another in terms of quality but at a better price, that will certainly create attention and boost that satisfaction level overall,” VanAmburg said. “There are other players in the space, but they aren’t known for the same quality [as Apple], like an Acer.” On the software side, the big winner was Microsoft (MSFT), which has scored with its release of Windows 10, VanAmburg said. The company jumped five points to reach a score of 80 for 2016. “We’ve seen Microsoft over the years hit or miss with all their Windows updates, and they had a bright spot when they came out with 7, then they had some rough waters,” VanAmburg said. “Now we’re seeing a nice big jump on the shoulders of a pretty popular new release of Windows.” TVs and video players are also getting better reviews from consumers this year, rising five points to a score of 87. The reason? A sharp decline in price and the introduction of plenty of appealing features. “A lot of it is about new technology: flat screens, HDTV and the maturing of technology to the point where prices really drop,” VanAmburg said. “People are saying, ‘These are amazing TVs and not very expensive.’” Go to MSN Home More in Money 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money What Trump's win could mean for older Americans CBS News 30 things you should never buy without a coupon GOBankingRates 6 brand mascots that actually existed in real life Business Insider 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney Up Next 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from CBS News The cheapest U.S. cities for renters CBS News Stop overspending on these 5 things CBS News 6 gorgeous tiny homes you can build with no training CBS News CBS News View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

When iOS 10 launched, the name of Apple’s music discovery playlist had changed to My New Music Mix and was joined by a second playlist that wasn’t discussed at WWDC – My Favorites Mix. Both Apple Music playlists are updated weekly. Spotify didn’t have a favorites mix of its own until today when it responded with Daily Mix, a daily playlist featuring tracks that users mark as favorites as well as new music. According to Spotify: As your music taste evolves, so will your Daily Mix. In fact, the more you listen, the better your Mixes will become – offering an effortless music experience based entirely on your personal listening habits. Don’t like that new discovery? Simply “ban” a tune to remove it from future playlists. If you love it, be sure to “heart” the hit to add it to your collection. Spotify’s Daily Mix adds some nice touches that differentiate it from Apple Music’s My Favorites Mix. I like the idea of a more frequently updated daily mix, but I wonder whether adding new music to the mix makes sense in this context. One of the benefits of a favorites mix is knowing you will like everything played. Adding new music potentially undermines that. Daily Mix is currently available on iOS (in the latest update to the iOS app) and Android only. Spotify says other platforms will be added soon.

Aetna today announced a new initiative to revolutionize members’ consumer health experience by combining the power of iOS apps and the unmatched user experience of Appleproducts including Apple Watch, iPhone and iPad with Aetna’s analytics-based wellness and care management programs. Beginning this fall, Aetna will make Apple Watch available to select large employers and individual customers during open enrollment season, and Aetna will be the first major health care company to subsidize a significant portion of the Apple Watch cost, offering monthly payroll deductions to make covering the remaining cost easier. In addition to the customer program, Aetna will provide Apple Watch at no cost to its own nearly 50,000 employees, who will participate in the company’s wellness reimbursement program, to encourage them to live more productive, healthy lives. With support from Apple, Aetna is planning several iOS-exclusive health initiatives, starting with deeply integrated health apps for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch that will significantly improve the ability of consumers to manage their health and increase healthy outcomes. The initial solutions under development are among the first health apps designed for multi-device use. “We are thrilled that Aetna will be helping their members and employees take greater control of their health using Apple Watch,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook. “Aetna’s new initiatives will be a powerful force toward creating better customer experiences in health care, and we look forward to working with Aetna to make them successful.” Source: Aetna Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend Apple’s fitness guru talks Breathe app and bringing meditation to your wrist Breathe: Apple’s new Watch app to encourage breathing exercises Apple’s boss talks Watch potential at European startup conference Apple’s new T1 chip that drives MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar runs “eOS”, a variant of watchOS Related Topics Apple, Apple Watch, Health, News Rowan09 The Apple Watch can be Apples next big thing.

Did you workout, did you hit your walking goal, did you hit your standing goal. Okay you get cheaper rates. Oh you didn’t hit your goals you get charged more. When my doctor told me they could import my fitbit data and provided to my insurance as well I told him sure how much will you pay me. I dont trust insurance companies and believe there is a hidden agenda. These companies are for profit and not for charity in the USA. I personally would opt out. My data is worth more than a free watch IMO. Chris Wagers Why is this a bad thing? Why not charge less for people that try to live healthy? I would love to save some cash this way. Might even help people get healthy and save money. Just my opinion. Antzboogie Well said websyndicate my health information is mine and only mine. Its not going to be sold or held ransom. Chris Wagers That’s cool. They could have a good health practice price and another price. This way everybody has a choice. websyndicate Personally I can afford my tech without making deal with the devil. Why not just try to get healthy without subsiding your metics. Think of it like this is someone wants you successful more than you want it there is something wrong with that picture. They have a hidden agenda and that’s what I dont like about it. Chris Wagers Yea they are getting something out of it. The more healthy you are the less theoretically they have to pay out to take care of you. I don’t have Aetna so either way right now it doesn’t benefit me. George Insurance companies can all burn in hell.

Sep 27th 2016, 9:10 PM 23,283 Views 27 Comments Share18 Tweet Email3 Image: Associated Press TECH GIANT APPLE has reportedly completed a merger of its Luxembourg-based company with Apple Distribution International, which is located in Cork. The move will result in a lot of operations overseen by the Luxembourg division of Apple shifted to its Cork headquarters, including the notable iTunes music service. Earlier this year, Apple was granted planning permission to build on at its site in Hollyhill, Cork and announced plans to hire up to 1,000 more staff for its Irish operation. A statement sent to developers by Apple said that the company’s Cork offices will soon be in charge of iTunes and the relocation of services will be complete in early 2017. The statement said: Apple has been operating in Ireland since 1980 and now employs nearly 6,000 people. As we continue to expand our operations in Cork, we are moving our iTunes business there and will support content stores for more than 100 countries from our campus at Hollyhill. The iTunes branch of Apple has been managed by its Luxembourg office since 2004, however, in recent months the office has closed. Tax fallout Last month, the European Commission ordered the Irish government to recover illegal state aid given to Apple. It is claimed that Ireland gave the tech company €13 billion over the span of a decade. Source: European Commission It was claimed that Ireland allowed the company to pay a tax rate of only 1% on its European profits that were routed through its Irish operation in 2003, with that figure dropping as low as 0.005% by 2014. In 2011, the Cork-based Apple Sales International recorded a profit of €16 billion. Less than €50 million from this was allocated to the Irish branch, with the remainder assigned to the head office, which paid zero taxes. The Irish government has decided to appeal the decision handed down by the European Commission.

The teaser, which debuted after the first presidential debate with Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump on Monday night, featured the R&B veteran in the interviewer's seat, asking Clinton, "A lot of people in my community think Barack Obama was blocked in Congress because he was black.

The song was released in the wake of Amadou Diallo's murder by a police officer in February 1999. The 23-year-old immigrant from Guinea was shot at 41 times (he was struck 19 times) in his Bronx apartment by four plainclothes New York City police officers, who were acquitted of all charges in 2000, according to the New York Times. The white cops believed he was grabbing a gun though it turned out to be a wallet.  Jay Z Releases Song About Police Brutality After Philando Castile & Alton Sterling Shootings: Listen Scroll through headlines of the past few years, and cases of police brutality remain constant. Just this month alone, a 40-year-old unarmed black man named Terence Crutcher was killed by a white officer, who was later charged with first-degree manslaughter. Disturbing footage was recently released of the moments leading up to the fatal shooting of another unarmed, 43-year-old black man named Keith Lamont Scott, who was fatally shot by police who believed he had a gun and posed an "imminent physical threat," per The Associated Press.  Springsteen's "American Skin (41 Shots)" was widely perceived as controversial upon its debut in 2000 at a June 4 show in Atlanta, the New York Times reports. Springsteen went on to perform the politically charged song at subsequent shows at New York's Madison Square Garden, which caused the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association to call for New York City officers to boycott Springsteen's shows.  Whether watching Springsteen or Blige sing the line "You can get killed just for living in your American skin," the song's message still remains relevant.

Video 10 tablets for under $500 For the first time since 2008, the year Apple released the second version of its now iconic iPhone smartphone, the company chose not to release initial sales numbers for the phone within a few of days — or even weeks — of a new iPhone launch.  In July, 2008, for example, Apple said it had sold a million iPhone 3G phones, three days after the device went on sale. Again, in 2009, the company announced iPhone 3GS sales numbers three days after its launch. And in 2010. And 2011. And 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. But not this year. More than two weeks after the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus was listed for preorder on Sept. 9, Apple still hasn't shared any official sales numbers. Why wouldn't Apple announce iPhones 7 sales? Prior to the iPhone 7 launch, expectations were high for sales of the new phones, at least for some. For example, Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray and Angelo Zino, a financial analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence, predicted shipments of more than 13 million for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus combined during the first weekend after launch, according to USAToday.com. That number would have been right in line with the numbers Apple reported for iPhone 6s and 6s sales during its first weekend of availability. So what's going on? And why would Apple finally break its iPhone sales-reporting trend? I reached out to Apple for comment, and a spokesperson directed me to a statement the company provided to Reuters in early September: "As we have expanded our distribution through carriers and resellers to hundreds of thousands of locations around the world, we are now at a point where we know before taking the first customer preorder that we will sell out of iPhone 7," Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet said. "These initial sales will be governed by supply, not demand, and we have decided that it is no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers."  That answer doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense, because Apple could have said the same thing about the last few iPhone releases. It is notable that Apple issued the statement before the iPhone 7 was available for preorder, though. Another reason why Apple might have decided to stay mum: It suspected it would sell fewer iPhones right after launch in 2016 than it did last year. If so, that would be the first time since the iPhone first launched in 2007 that Apple didn't set "a new record" in sales during the three days following a new iPhone release. Apple doing damage control on iPhone 7 sales?  Apple's been under fire during the past year or so for falling behind rivals such as Samsung in innovation and "wow factor." In April 2016, the company reported its first year-over-year revenue loss in 13 years. iPhone sales represent nearly two-thirds of Apple's business, and revenue associated with the company's flagship product declined 18 percent year over year during the first quarter of 2016. Of course, the iPhone is still one of the most popular phones in the world, and the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are backordered for weeks in Apple stores and with the major U.S. wireless carriers. In other words, lots of folks are still forking over dough for iPhones. (I purchased an iPhone 7 Plus.) If Apple did finally break its streak of outselling the previous generation iPhone every single year, issuing a press release without the now-familiar "new record" would simply be an acknowledgement of a drop in overall iPhone sales. And that would crank the dial on the Apple critics who've called the company out in recently years for a slow innovation. Apple's investors also wouldn't likely celebrate such an announcement. It's unclear how many new phones Apple sold following its iPhone 7 announcement, but if it had outsold the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, it's difficult to envision any good reason why it wouldn't have reported those numbers  — even if it already said it wasn't going to.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Common MacOS Sierra Problems And How To Fix Them Posted: Oct 8 2016, 8:00am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Oct 8 2016, 2:30pm CDT, in News | Apple     The wait is finally over and Apple has recently released the final version of macOS Sierra with Siri and battery saving features. Here is a list of common problems faced by mac users while installing macOS Sierra and while using it along with their solutions. macOS Sierra is finally available to the mac users. It is filled with new enhancements and new features contributing to a smoother experience, but some users have been facing certain problems. The following are ways to deal with common macOS Sierra problems. Common problems faced and reported by macOS Sierra users and their remedies. Don't Miss: The Best Black Friday 4K HDR TV Deals 1. Mac App Store Shows macOS Sierra as “Downloaded” When you go to the Mac app store and witness that the macOS Sierra has been marked as downloaded, this means that you either installed the GM build or the beta version. In order to download the final version of this operating system, you have to eliminate the existing “Install macOS Sierra’ installer files from your connected hard drive or your Mac. After you have deleted the installer files, return to the Mac App Store and you are bound to be able to install the final version. 2. Wi-Fi Problems Whenever a new operating system is updating there are bound to be issues regarding the internet connection and the Wi-Fi. The macOS Sierra is no different; many users have been facing problems regarding their internet connection. They complain that webpages, in addition to downloads, load at a slow pace. First it should be made certain that there are no issues with the router and that ISP is giving a proper internet connection. If these two problems do not persist then, deleting the Wi-Fi preferences and starting afresh is an option. To carry this out open finder on your MAC and choose ‘Go’ from the top menu and select library (the Alt key has to be pressed while the menu is open, this enables the visibility of the Library option).Then go to preferences/system configuration. Delete the files below and then reboot your router or MAC. com.apple.airport.preferences.plist com.apple.network.identification.plist com.apple.wifi.message-tracer.plist NetworkInterfaces.plist preferences.plist 3.The macOS Sierra Upgrade Shows “An Error Has Occurred” Or “Failed to Download” This is a rather common issue and many users have been facing it. To deal with this problem, delete the existing macOS Sierra installer and re-download it. In order to carry this out, open the Launchpad and a half-downloaded ‘Install macOS Sierra’ sporting a question mark will be visible. Delete that file, reboot your Mac and try the download process again. 4. Not Enough Space to Install It gets on your nerves when the installation of the macOS Sierra is interrupted because there is not enough space to install the new operating system. At least 8GB of free space is required on your Mac for the installation of macOS Sierra. So space should be made by the deletion of all unnecessary files, apps and junk files. After this kind of cleaning up is carried out, if the problem still persists try installing the new operating system in Safe Mode. In order to install the macOS Sierra on safe mode turn off you Mac by pressing down the Power button until it shuts down. After that, switch it on again and when the startup sound becomes audible, press down the shift key. When the Apple logo becomes visible, let go of the Shift key. The Mac should now be in Safe Mode. The installation of macOS Sierra should be continued after that is done. 5. Installed Apps Show ‘Damaged and Can’t Be Opened’ Error If after the update to the macOS Sierra is done and a ‘Damaged and cannot be opened’ error is witnessed when trying to launch an app. It should be made sure that the app has been updated to the latest version. If the problem continues even after updating the app to its latest version. Delete it from the Mac and reinstall it. If none of this works then the cache should be cleared. To do this open Finder. Select ‘Go’ from the option menu and choose ‘Go to Folder’. Enter ~/Library/Caches into the text box. Eliminate the files from all the folders. Then repeat the same process for /Library/Caches (without the ~ symbol). Reset the PRAM by restarting your Mac and holding down Cmd + Option + P + R keys. After all this if there is still an issue present, then the faulty app should be launched while the Cmd + Option keys is being held. 6. iCloud Error and Authentication Issues During the setup process the system asks to enable some features which depend on the iCloud such as Storage Optimization and desktop and iCloud documents.This can be skipped but many users have complained that iCloud continuously pops up for the authentication or an error is displayed. The ‘Error connecting to iCloud ’popup or ‘This Mac cannot connect to iCloud because of a problem with....’ may be seen. These issues can be fixed by opening the Apple menu and selecting System Preferences. Select iCloud and then choose ‘Sign Out’. After that reboot the Mac and open the iCloud preference pane again. Sign in into the iCloud account. 7. macOS Sierra Installation Freezes or Crashes  A very common problem reported by the macOS Sierra users is that the Mac freezes while the installation of macOS Sierra.There are some ways to fix this issue. The first thing that should be done is the uninstallation or the disablement of any antivirus software that is present on the Mac. As they might interfere with the installation. After that ensure that a proper and reliable internet connection is available. Next, the macOS Sierra should be installed in Safe mode. To carry that out, the Mac should be switched off by holding the Power button until and unless it shuts down. After that, the device should be turned on and when the startup sound becomes audible, the shift key should be held down. When the Apple logo becomes visible, the Shift key should be released and the Mac should be now in Safe mode. Now macOS Sierra installation should be continued 8. Logitech Mouse Lag issues in Sierra Mac OS The users of Logitech-branded are mice are very disappointed after the update to macOS sierra. This is because due to broken compatibility a series of issues are now occurring in the accessories. These issues include lagging response times and even no response is observed on some of the customizable buttons. These issues are due to the lack of compatibility between macOS sierra and the Control centre app by Logitech. The 3.9.3 version which is the latest release by Control Centre app does point out that the M705’s forward and back buttons are not functional. In addition scrolling was also giving problem. Therefore sad it may be you just have to wait for Logitech to give another update which will fix the issue.

However, companies that have offered an Apple Watch with the hope of getting people to be more active and healthy have to prove wearable devices and wellness programs meaningfully change consumer behavior, which has often worked better in theory than in practice. “These types of technologies can really help to facilitate behavior change, but the devices themselves are not what drive behavior change,” said Dr. Mitesh Patel, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. “What drives behavior change are engagement strategies.” Starting next year, Aetna will give an Apple Watch to its employees for free as part of its wellness program, the insurance company said Tuesday. Aetna also will subsidize a “significant portion” of the Apple Watch cost for some large employers and groups that contract with Aetna for health insurance services. Aetna will pair the Apple Watch with specific apps that can help its employees and other Aetna members refill their medications or pay their bill through Apple Wallet. The price of most Apple Watches starts around $300. Buying the average smartwatch for all 50,000 employees would cost Aetna roughly $15 million, or about 2% of Aetna's second-quarter profit, but it's not clear if Apple gave Aetna a discount for bulk purchasing. Aetna spokesman Ethan Slavin said the company is not releasing financial terms of the agreement. Apple did not respond to interview requests. Slavin said there are no strings attached to the Apple Watches. Aetna's wellness program is “completely voluntary,” and employees don't have to do anything to be eligible for the watch, he said. Aetna has a reimbursement component within its wellness program, but no details were provided. Beyond the marketing ploy of Aetna's investment in Apple Watches is the assumption that smart devices will incentivize people to improve their health. Other health insurers have bought into that idea. UnitedHealthcare is offering fitness trackers for free to some of its small and medium-sized employers. Yet there is wide skepticism that wellness programs improve health and lower costs. And many health policy experts believe if wearable devices and fitness trackers are used in wellness programs, behavioral economics should shape the incentives. For example, Patel and his colleagues recently conducted a randomized controlled trial with people who wore wearable devices that counted steps. They found that people were more likely to be physically active if the financial incentives were “framed as a loss.” In this case, the most active participants were those were given an upfront amount of $42 but lost $1.40 every day they did not complete their goal. “The way you design and deliver your incentive is really, really important,” Patel said.

 'Bendgate' is still causing headaches for iPhone 6 users two years later Steve Kovach Sep. 27, 2016, 3:18 PM 7,986 facebook linkedin twitter email print The iPhone 6. Steve Kovach/Business Insider Apple appears to be aware of faulty touchscreens on some iPhone 6 units, even if it isn't saying so publicly. And the two-year-old "bendgate" controversy is likely to blame. According to a report by Motherboard's Jason Koebler, Apple's technical support Genius staff at Apple stores have been told about the so-called "touch disease" issue that causes the iPhone 6 touchscreen to stop working. Genius staff were told to replace the screens if they're still under warranty, according to the report. Apple hasn't publicly acknowledged the faulty touchscreens on the two-year-old model of the iPhone 6. The problem appears to be related to the bending issue that affected some iPhone 6 units. Over time, the bending can allegedly damage the touchscreen so that it becomes unusable. The iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 are made from a strong kind of aluminum alloy that prevents bending, so they shouldn't have the same "touch disease" problem. Apple did not respond to requests for comment.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Electronics Apple is aware of iPhone 6 ‘touch disease,’ but refuses to discuss it Apple is aware of iPhone 6 ‘touch disease,’ but refuses to discuss it By Joel Hruska on September 27, 2016 at 2:43 pm Comment The iPhone 6’s so-called ‘touch disease‘ is a well-known issue within Apple — the company simply doesn’t want to discuss it. That’s according to Apple store employees, who claim that they’ve been informed by both their own supervisors and the company’s internal repair tracking system to be aware of the problem, which can affect both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, but is much more common on the latter. The new report comes courtesy of Motherboard, which helped break the initial story. The problem is related to the iPhone 6’s flexibility and a decision Apple made to remove the underfill from between the touch ICs, which control the touchscreen’s function, and the grid of solder joints that connect these chips to their motherboard. Typically underfill is used to strengthen the connection between the chips and the board, and to ensure that the solder won’t crack. Combine a more flexible device with the lack of underfill, and you’ve got a recipe for disaster. The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are not currently believed to suffer from this problem. The touchscreen ICs. Photo by iFixit According to the Apple employees, Apple’s backend system is now designed to immediately lock out repair options for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and to inform customers that their only way forward is to pay a $329 replacement fee if the customer is out of warranty. At first, early phones with a problem allowed for a display replacement under warranty, but this is no longer the case. Apple no longer even allows for a screen replacement in the company’s internal system, suggesting the company knows the problem is in the logic board. Apple’s official response? Nothing at all. The company has refused to acknowledge or even confirm the issue, despite the fact that unofficial research indicates this is a problem that affects a high percentage of iPhone 6 Plus devices. The standard iPhone 6 is much less likely to have a problem, but it’s not issue-free. And there have been reports of devices failing that have been kept in a hard case for their entire operating lives. At least one of the employees Motherboard spoke to informed them they were quitting the company partly because they were tired of telling iPhone 6 Plus owners they had to pay out $329 for a replacement. Touch disease can be repaired by swapping out the ICs themselves, and some repair shops will fix broken devices for around $200 — less expensive than a full iPhone 6 Plus, but still far too much money for a problem Apple should’ve anticipated. Removing the underfill from a chip is extremely unusual; it’s designed to be used for a reason. This kind of attitude might’ve been more permissible when smartphones aged quickly and a two-year-old device was begging for the garbage bin. Today, they’re likely to last a good deal longer. The iPhone 3G I bought in 2009 wasn’t very useful by early 2012. My iPhone 5c, in contrast, has aged much more gracefully. As smartphones have become more capable, they’re also aging more slowly (apart from the typical lithium-ion battery degradation, which still sucks). Plus, with the major American wireless carriers, now you can “pay off” the phone and then enjoy a lower monthly bill, something that wasn’t nearly as easy to pull off several years ago — so the incentive to hold onto a perfectly serviceable device is even stronger than it used to be. Apple is already facing a class-action suit for its touch disease issues. But the company seems to think it can stonewall, wave the iPhone 7, and convert customers without any damage to its brand or name. This behavior is ridiculous, given the the entire problem is Apple’s fault to start with.

Summary⎙ Print Despite the 10-year siege, iPhone mobile devices still make it into the Gaza Strip, where there is a high demand among the citizens who pay large amounts of money to own smartphones and keep up with technology. Author Mohammed Othman Posted September 27, 2016 TranslatorSahar Ghoussoub The official price of the phone was set at almost $650 in the United States, but Ahmed bought it for 5,000 Israeli shekels (around $1,333) from a Palestinian cellphone dealer, who himself got it from Saudi Arabia where it is sold at around 2,700 Saudi riyals ($720), since there are no Apple stores or official agents for the company in Gaza. Ahmed said he did not mind paying this sum for the device given its sophisticated features compared to other smartphones. “I bought the iPhone 7 as it is the newest Apple phone and it is everyone’s dream to buy the latest smartphones upon their release. I was an iPhone 6 user and I was eagerly waiting for iPhone 7 to discover its new features and upgrades,” he told Al-Monitor. The Israeli blockade on the Gaza Strip that has been ongoing for about 10 years now has not stopped new technologies and the latest smartphones from entering Gaza upon their release. Cellphone dealers in Gaza took advantage of the hajj season, when pilgrims travel to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and the phone dealers ask them to bring back the new iPhone, while many smartphone techies have been looking forward to purchasing the new device. Mahmoud Hijazi is the owner of a cellphone store in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood in northern Gaza City. He told Al-Monitor that he had received five iPhone 7 devices through some pilgrims who brought them from Saudi Arabia on their way back home from pilgrimage. “I paid about 4,000 shekels [$1,070] for every device including a percentage for the pilgrims. Pilgrims either buy the device with their own money to sell them inside Gaza, or they agree with some traders who pay them in advance to purchase the devices in Saudi Arabia,” Hijazi said. Hijazi and other traders sell the iPhone 7 for 5,000 shekels (about $1,333) in Gaza, which is a high price given the limited number of units in the Gaza Strip. “This is our chance to make a significant profit because once the device is officially launched in the Palestinian market by the Jawwal telecom company, the profit margin will be very low,” Hijazi added. “Despite the excessive price of the smartphone, some people still buy it, especially the iPhone and smartphone techies, who sometimes borrow money to purchase the device. Meanwhile, affluent traders have no problem to buy the new cellphone,” he said. Technical expert Mahmoud Abu Ghosh believes the fast introduction of modern communications equipment to the Gaza Strip demonstrates a large public demand among Gazans for modern technology. He told Al-Monitor, “For example, some have been using the iPhone 6 for some time now, and when the iPhone 7 was launched they immediately started searching for it because they know its value and its features. In light of the high demand for the iPhone 7, the traders were forced to bring it into Gaza, even if through smuggling means, as they wanted to meet the demand of their customers and they were sure they would reap high profits by selling it.” Abu Ghosh pointed out that some Palestinian traders who travel to and from the Gaza Strip through the Israeli Erez/Beit Hanoun border crossing are bringing in the iPhone 7 among their personal belongings, as each person is allowed to legally bring three cellphone devices. He said that the price gap between the iPhone 7 global price and its price inside Gaza is due to the commission for the pilgrims bringing back phones, the customs duties that may be imposed at the airport in Cairo or the Egyptian Rafah crossing if the pilgrims are caught trying to smuggle in more than three phones, in addition to the traders’ exploitation of the lack of supply and the high demand on this device in the Gaza Strip. In fact, the last group of pilgrims returned to Gaza on Sept. 24 after which the Rafah crossing was closed again, as it is only open for a few days a year. There are no specific figures on the number of iPhone 7 devices that entered the Gaza Strip in September, but its widespread promotion has pushed low-income smartphone techies to borrow money to buy the iPhone 7, while other Palestinians, including dealers, were able to afford them. Obsession with modern technology in the Gaza Strip seems to have no limits, despite the Israeli blockade. The iPhone 7’s introduction to Gaza only a few days after its global launch is the best proof of that.

Desert dining: Fall flavors awaken in the east valley By Pamela Bieri, Special to The Desert Sun 12:34 p.m. PDT September 27, 2016 Banana nut crepe available at The Bistro. (Photo: Submitted) Autumn officially began last week. In most places, fall is more dramatic when both temperatures and leaves suddenly drop. But in the desert, it’s marked by a gradual cooling down, spiked by a few days of triple digit temps, then longer periods of 70-degree days and cooler evenings. But throughout the Coachella Valley, chefs bring fall flavors to awaken the taste buds – Brussels sprouts, kale, curries and apples, pomegranate, butternut squashes, cider-brined meats, tart cherries, spiced yams, cashews and caramel. Here are some delicious options in the east valley. Fantasy Springs Resort Casino You can catch executive chef Freddy Rieger weekly on the local CBS station offering cooking tips and demos in a brief segment after the evening news. The lovable Italian-German chef with his New Jersey accent always signs off with “Fahget about it” and a wink, as he pushes his finished plate towards the camera. Rieger oversees five diverse cuisine restaurants and the Special Events Center at Fantasy Springs Resort Casino. He and his creative culinary team offer new fall dishes from three of the restaurants: New tuna taco sliders from POM Restaurant wraps perfectly grilled tuna and fresh vegetables inside corn tortillas, drizzled with a creamy, spicy chipotle sauce.

Morgan's heritage apples come from artisan farmers of the Apple Valley just west of the greater Palm Springs area at the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains. This area’s unique late summer climate ripens these heirloom varietals to a perfect balance of bright tartness laced with sun-kissed sweetness, along with exceptional crisp texture from cool nights.

Solano’s house salad always changes with the seasons. It’s now reflective of the Pacific Northwest fall bounty of mixed greens, blueberries, green apple wedges, glazed walnuts and feta cheese, with a blueberry vinaigrette. The Autumnal seasonal salad blends the tastes of baby Swiss chard, kales and sweet potatoes with dried cranberries, toasted pumpkin seeds tossed with apple cider vinaigrette. New entrees are the Apple Pork Tenderloin in an apple-Dijon marinade and finished with a sage demi-glace.  Pecan-crusted Sand Dabs filets are tempting with a chardonnay butter sauce.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Rumor: Nvidia and Apple may reunite for future Mac GPUs by Eric Frederiksen  1:30 PM on September 27, 2016 Nvidia and Apple might be getting back together after a couple years apart. According to a report from Bloomberg, a job description for a position with the green team (since revised) offered candidates the potential to "help produce the next revolutionary Apple products." That's not the only  smoke from this rumor, though. According to Bloomberg, a total of three listings for software engineers at Nvidia directly reference the Mac, Apple, and macOS, suggesting that the company's relationship with Apple may be expanding. While all of the listings have been revised, they originally said the position would require "working in partnership with Apple" and writing code to "define the shape and future" of Mac graphics software. These rumors arrive against an interesting backdrop. AMD has been Apple's sole provider of GPUs for the last few years, even as Nvidia has achieved dominance in the PC graphics card market. Apple has included Nvidia chips in its products in the past, but the last Mac with Nvidia inside was the mid-2014 MacBook Pro, as far as we're aware. Neither Apple nor Nvidia have made any official announcements regarding their future relationship. Apple may be adding Nvidia chips to its products as another choice for power users, or this rumored relationship could be a total shift from one exclusive supplier to another. It's even possible that Nvidia is simply working to make a bid for Apple's attention, rather than staffing up for an already-signed agreement. If there is indeed something brewing between Nvidia and Apple, it could mean big things for Mac users. If Apple is bringing Nvidia products in alongside AMD's, buyers will have more choice in Mac graphics than they have in a long time. A total shift from AMD to Nvidia products, on the other hand, would be a hit to one of AMD's more lucrative exclusive deals. Either way, we'll be waiting to see whether Nvidia graphics chips make an appearance in the next round of Mac refreshes.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is news of the tech company making it hard for an iOS 10 jailbreak to be released. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Wednesday. Source: Apple iOS 10 Jailbreak: Apple users hoping for an iOS 10 jailbreak are out of luck, reports Neurogadget. Hacker group Pangu has been working on an iOS 10 jailbreak, but now its hard work has gone to waste. This is due to AAPL releasing iOS 10.0.1 shortly after iOS 10 came out. This has set hackers back and it will take them time to create an iOS 10 jailbreak tool for the the new version of the mobile operating system. New Beta: Apple has released the second version of its macOS Sierra 10.12.1 beta to developers, MacRumors notes. The new beta is listed as build “16B2333a” and it comes about one week after the first beta of macOS Sierra 10.12.1 was released. It can be downloaded from the company’s Developer Center and via the Software Update feature in the Mac App Store. The new beta is more focused on fixing bugs found in macOS Sierra than it is in introducing new features. Three New Patents: Apple has been granted three patents by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, reports AppleInsider. The first patent is for an “electronic device with mapping circuitry” that uses the various sensors in mobile devices to create a depth map of an area around a person. The second patent is for a mechanical keyboard with touch capabilities. It describes a system where users could use keys for touch motions instead of having to use a trackpad. The final patent is for an optical connector. This would be a laser-based system that would allow users to connect accessories to devices, such as a keyboard to an iPad, without a physical connection. It also wouldn’t rely off of Bluetooth and could consume less power.

X What is this? Sponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen When a child celebrates a birthday, parents often bring in sugary snacks to share with their classmates, but that tradition is changing at a number of Edmonton schools. Twenty-one schools in Edmonton are part of the APPLE initiative, aimed at encouraging active living and healthy eating; 15 are in the public school system, while six are in the Catholic district. St. Kateri Elementary in the southeast part of the city is an APPLE school. Story continues below The school has parents sign a commitment to providing nutritional foods for their children. St. Kateri also celebrates birthdays and holidays differently. “We encourage parents to bring in healthy snacks – rather than cupcakes, sugars, cakes and things like that,” Kindergarten teacher Nicole Carignan said. “Because there are so many allergies to nuts and things like that, fruits and vegetables are the healthy choice.” READ MORE: 8 mistakes you’re making when packing lunch for your kids  At snack time, Carignan’s students pull out lunch-kits packed with apple slices, yogurt, cucumbers and carrots. If parents want to do something other than bring a healthy snack to celebrate a special occasion, they’re encouraged to donate a birthday book to the school – one their child can read with classmates. If parents miss the reminders in the newsletters and agendas and bring in something unhealthy, the teachers can improvise. “That child is excited to bring that in,” Carignan said. “So, we might just cut the cookie up to allow the child to distribute it and then just educate the parent afterwards in saying: ‘Thank you so much for bringing something in, but next time let’s consider something healthier’ and explain why.” READ MORE: Alberta isn’t helping kids make healthy food choices: report  It’s an initiative parents are largely on board with. “That is the way it should be,” Jimmy Phul said. “The alternates that we have, the veggies and the apples and fruits and stuff, that’s the best way to go.” “I love being part of an APPLE school,” Laura Anderson added. “I think there’s way too much sugar in our diets anyway.” Even the kids are warming up to the idea. “I like healthy food,” Grade 1 student Annabelle Harasym said. Her mom says less sugar means a sweeter child. “I’ve noticed a huge change in my daughter,” Meghan Harasym said. “When she comes home from school, she’s actually happy.” A nutritionist explained that behavioural change makes sense. “Refined sugars and carbohydrates release very quickly into the bloodstream so that can cause hyperactivity,” Christal Sczebel with Pure and Simple explained. “It’s also a big immune suppressor.” Still, she says treats should never be outlawed completely. “I don’t think deprivation or restriction is good at all,” Sczebel said. “That can create a poor relationship with food.” © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

 IBM adds Apple's Swift to Cloud BI Intelligence Sep. 27, 2016, 2:54 PM 3,068 facebook linkedin twitter email print This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers.

This could encourage enterprise developers to build apps using the language, giving Apple an opportunity to improve its enterprise presence. The addition of Swift was made possible by Apple’s decision to open source its programming language in December last year. This gave Apple’s enterprise partners like IBM more options to better personalize consumer-facing applications and better leverage cloud computing in deployment.  The high-level programming language rose to prominence in the developer world due to its ability to make it easier for iOS app developers to design and create apps for iPhones, iPads, and other Apple devices. The addition of Swift means that developers who already use Swift to build apps for Apple’s products can now use the same language they would for the server side apps that these programs depend on, according to Computerworld. Giving developers the option of building apps for iOS that work with Linux could encourage more businesses to buy Apple’s devices. The ability for businesses to more easily personalize their own enterprise apps could then help bolster Apple's hardware sales, particularly for its struggling tablet segment. Over the past eight years, developers have flocked to create mobile games as smartphones became a mainstream consumer device. Technological evolutions including faster processors, larger screens, more input points, and better overall graphics capabilities, combined with dropping prices, brought the ability for gaming via smartphone to audiences larger than ever before. While mobile gaming apps using an up-front paid downloading model, wherein consumers paid a typically nominal fee to download an app, flourished in the early days of mobile gaming, the deluge of apps led to a change in monetization strategy. More apps started using the free-to-play (F2P) model, wherein a consumer can download an app for free, and is then later monetized either via in-app purchases or in-app advertising. Since that transition, most consumers have been conditioned to expect quality mobile gaming apps for little or no cost. Jessica Smith, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile gaming that examines how the mobile gaming market has been affected by the transition to F2P monetization. It also takes a close look at how saturation in the mobile gaming category, combined with the standard F2P model, has led to numerous issues for developers, including spiking marketing costs, the premium on acquiring users who will spend heavily within a game (called whales), and the impact that it's having on mobile gamers who do not spend in-app. The report then identifies innovations in mobile app marketing and engagement that seek to alleviate the issues of F2P and inadequate monetization in the fact of mounting marketing costs. BI Intelligence Here are some key takeaways from the report: The mobile gaming app market is so big it makes other app categories seem small by comparison. Mobile gaming apps accounted for 20% of active apps in Apple's App Store in March 2016, according to AppsFlyer. That’s more than double the second most popular category, business apps. It's only going to keep growing as quality smartphones become more accessible and more consumers look to their smartphones for gaming. In the US alone, 180.4 million consumers will play games on their mobile phones in 2016, representing 56% of the population and a whopping 70% of all mobile phone users, according to estimates from eMarketer. This quick growth is resulting in numerous growing pains. Saturation in the market has led to the dominance of the free-to-play (F2P) monetization model, which in turn has led to sky-high marketing costs. As marketing costs for mobile gaming apps has skyrocketed, so has the tendency for apps to focus on the very small segment of players who spend money in-app. This has resulted in game mechanics that optimize the amount of money being spent by this small user group, which can often alienate the large swath of users who do not spend money in-app. There are numerous new solutions coming to market that offer developers and publishing houses a diverse selection of monetization models which combine in-app purchases with other methods. In full, the report: Sizes up the current mobile gaming app market and its future growth trajectory. Examines the role of free-to-play (F2P) games in the greater mobile gaming ecosystem. Identifies the major threats and opportunities inherent in the current mobile gaming market and in peripheral markets such as marketing. Explains the current monetization conundrum wherein the vast majority of revenue comes abysmally small segments of mobile gamers. Presents new approaches and solutions that can help mobile gaming apps monetize without alienating swaths of mobile gamers.

Despite your Apple Watch being completely capable of going in the water, there are still a few things to keep in mind. Note that this article is about Apple Watch Series 2 and newer only. Please refer to this article should you want to learn about water resistance of the original Apple Watch or Apple Watch Series 1. The confusion of water resistance ratings Apple clearly says that Apple Watch Series 2 has a water resistance rating of 50 meters under ISO standard 22810:2010. Yet, immediately after saying that, the company releases its liability by saying Apple Watch Series 2 “may be used for shallow-water activities like swimming in a pool or ocean. However, Apple Watch Series 2 should not be used for scuba diving, waterskiing, or other activities involving high-velocity water or submersion below shallow depth.” If you wanted to go 60 feet under water with your Apple Watch, then you may think about it twice, because despite that 50 meter rating, your Apple Watch would most likely not be able to withstand the pressure. This is extremely confusing to me, even after spending a fair share of time researching what that ISO standard 22810:2010 actually means. The best information I could find regarding those confusing water resistance ratings came from Wikipedia: “For example, a watch marked 30 metres water resistant cannot be expected to withstand activity for longer time periods in a swimming pool, let alone continue to function at 30 metres under water. This is because the test is conducted only once using static pressure on a sample of newly manufactured watches.” In short, that 50 meter rating is BS! You’re totally fine surfing, swimming, or playing in the pool with your watch, but don’t even think about going urchin fishing with it. How to prepare for going in the water with your Apple Watch Technically, you don’t have anything to do before going in the water. You can just get in the shower or jump in the pool without paying attention to your watch, and it would be perfectly fine. However, Apple has introduced a new feature on Series 2 models called Water Lock that allows the speaker to eject water that may otherwise get stuck in the speaker hole. This feature can be really useful in making sure that your speaker doesn’t get muffled by stagnating water. This feature has to be manually enabled, and it can be done in one of two ways. 1. You can start a Swimming workout on your Apple Watch. This will automatically lock the screen to avoid water droplets from mimicking taps on your screen while you are in the water. Once you get out of the water, you can turn the Digital Crown clockwise, and the speaker will emit a series of sounds destined to push the water out of the speaker hole. This is quite ingenious. 2. If you do not want to start a Swimming workout, you can always use the Water Lock feature manually by swiping up on your watch face to reveal Control Center and tapping on the icon that looks like a drop of water. When you’re done, you can turn the Digital Crown to unlock the watch and have the speaker eject the water. Again, you do not have to do that, but this is the best way to go about it. Rinse it off Most pools contain chemicals that can be pretty harsh on the materials used in Apple Watch. Likewise, salty water from the ocean can accelerate corrosion of your watch. For these reasons, proper care after going in the water is highly recommended. The best way to do that is to simply rinse your Apple Watch under fresh water after going in the pool or in the ocean. Personally, I just take a shower with my watch after going surfing and make sure to rinse the watch off profusely to get as much of this salt out of the watch as possible. Speaking of taking a shower with your watch, Apple recommends “not exposing Apple Watch to soaps, shampoos, conditioners, lotions, and perfumes as they can negatively affect water seals and acoustic membranes.” Keep that in mind. Use good ol’ common sense When it comes to electronics (or just about everything is life), common sense can go a long way. If you’re not sure whether you should wear your Apple Watch for a specific nautical activity, then do some research, or just don’t wear your watch at all. Better safe than sorry! It’s also worth noting that most bands don’t fair very well in water. The Sport and Nylon bands would be perfectly fine. However, anything made of leather is definitely a no-go. If you know you’re going to go out swimming, maybe swap your band before jumping in the water. What other advice to you have? If you’ve been using your Apple Watch in the water and have specific advice to share, please feel free to do so in the comments section.

Dubbed the "Apple of China," Xiaomi is known for its high-quality Android smartphones that are up to par with the California-based tech company's own devices. However, it gets its nickname because the Chinese smartphone maker can be seen as an Apple copycat. And nothing proves this more than the upcoming launch of its new flagship smartphone. On Tuesday, Sept. 27, Xiaomi unveiled the Mi 5s and Mi 5s Plus, taking more from Apple than how it names its smartphones. The company actually beat Apple at its own game and put its fingerprint sensor under the glass on the new Mi 5s phone. Xiaomi calls this feature its new "ultrasonic" home button, and it does essentially the same thing Apple may be looking to achieve. The tech consists of embedding the sensor underneath the glass of the smartphone and releasing ultrasound waves that go through the glass to read a finger when it is placed on the sensor. Ultrasonic scanning technology is said to be the most accurate when it comes to reading fingerprints since dirt or other particles don't interfere when the finger is placed. We can't know for sure what Apple has in store for its next iPhone, but rumor has it that it is planning on removing the home button. Instead it might hide the fingerprint reader to have Touch ID integrated into the display so that the smartphone has a completely smooth top surface without any grooves. This was something many thought the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus would bring with it, but Apple might be saving this major redesign for its 10th anniversary phone next year. Apple has two patents pending regarding moving its Touch ID fingerprint sensor under the display; however, this doesn't mean that Apple will be applying the tech to its home button the next time around. Since Xiaomi now beat Apple to it, it remains unknown if the fingerprint feature will make a huge splash here in the States. But chances are it still will, especially since Xiaomi smartphones are not sold in the United States and it will take this idea one step further by integrating it deeper. It's important to note that Xiaomi's reader is just under the glass, not on the actual display. There is still an indent where the home button would be, but now the user now only needs to apply pressure directly on the glass to have their fingerprint scanned. Besides using an "s" in its name and this Apple copycat fingerprint feature, Xiaomi's Mi 5s is completely a different smartphone from the iPhone. The Mi 5s and 5s Plus also differ from the Mi5 by featuring a metallic and not glass body along with its 2.5D glass front. The Mi 5s has a Snapdragon 821 processor, either 3 GB of RAM with 64 GB of storage or 4 GB of RAM with 128 GB of storage, and a 3,200 mAh battery. It has a 5.15-inch 1080p display, with its best feature being its cameras. The smartphone has a 4-megapixel front-facing camera with an 80-degree wide-angle lens and a 12-megapixel Sony IMX378 CMOS sensor for low-light capture. The Mi 5s Plus has a 5.7-inch screen with a 4-megapixel front-facing camera and a 13-megapixel rear camera with optical image stabilization. It comes with either 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage or 6 GB RAM and 128 GB of storage, and has a 3,800 mAh battery. The Plus has its fingerprint scanner located on the back of the device. The Xiaomi Mi 5s starts at 1,999 yuan ($300), whereas the Mi 5s Plus starts at 2,999 yuan ($345). Preorders start on Sept. 29 in China.

Honeywell is launching the newest entry in its Lyric line, announcing the Lyric T5 Wi-Fi Thermostat today, which comes compatible with Apple HomeKit and Amazon Echo out of the box. That Apple HomeKit functionality means Siri voice control, along with support for Apple’s new Home app in iOS 10. It’s also compatible with Honeywell’s Lyric app – which has been freshly updated, the company notes. Honeywell is looking to hit a lower price range with this thermostat as well, pricing it at $149. Aside from Echo and HomeKit functionality, one of the major draws of the Lyric T5 will be its geofencing capabilities. Using the geofencing feature and your smartphone, the Lyric T5 will be able to tell when you leave the house along with when you’re on your way back, adjusting the temperature accordingly to save on energy costs. Just as well, the Lyric T5 ships with an auto changeover mode, which can determine on its own whether the house needs to be cooled or warmed, keeping temperatures steady. In contrast to geofencing, you’ll also be able to set up a seven-day schedule or, of course, change the temperature manually by using the face of the thermostat. In addition to those smart features, the Lyric T5 uses a smart alerts system, which can draw your attention to a host of things, including filters that need to be changed, extreme temperatures within the home, and excessive humidity. If that sounds like something you’re interested in picking up, Honeywell says the thermostat will be launching in October and will be available at select retailers and online.

This new update came with dozens of improvements, changes and new features, some of which users aren’t even aware. Changes were made to iMessage, Siri, Photos, Notes and more. Here are some of these updates and how to use them. iMessage The most changes were undoubtedly made to iMessage, Apple’s built-in instant messaging service. How to install iMessage Apps Apps specifically created for iMessage can be found in the App Store, which can be easily accessed from iMessage by tapping on the App Store icon, then tapping the four dots on the bottom left corner of the screen, then tapping the “+” Store icon. Some of the iMessage apps include JibJab, Fandango Movies, ESPN, The Weather Channel and MsgMe TicTacToe. iMessage stickers are also available for purchase, which are various sets of images, similar to emoji, categorized by themes. Some popular sticker sets are Star Wars Stickers, Angry Birds Stickers, Disney Stickers and KIMOJI Stickers. Other new features in iMessage include being able to doodle text messages and 100 new— and bigger— emoji. Creating handwritten messages allows users to draw or write their own messages on their touchscreen or to choose from default doodles in iMessage. To access this feature, turn your phone horizontal, with rotation lock turned off, which will cause the handwriting window to appear. To create fun animations using Digital Touch in iMessage, tap the heart icon next to the text box in iMessage. Users can import a photo to draw on, or draw their own message, which the recipient can watch as a live drawing. These animations auto-delete unless specifically kept. Emoji are not only bigger with iOS 10, but iPhone can now detect words in messages and suggest replacing them with emoji. After the sender has typed a message, tapping the emoji keyboard button will highlight words that could be replaced with emoji. Typing a message and holding down the send button will activate bubble and screen effects. Bubble effects— Slam, Loud, Send With Gentle and Invisible Ink— will appear and show up in the selected message and will appear for the sender and recipient. Voicemail transcriptions When stuck in a meeting or another place you can’t check voicemails, iOS 10 now has a feature that transcribes voicemails so they are readable like emails or texts. Siri Updates to Siri have made it possible for users to call an Uber or Lyft and make a phone call with WhatsApp. Simply hold down the home button and give the command. Siri also has the ability to announce incoming calls when users are listening to music or when their device is connected to a speaker system. To activate this feature, go to Settings > Phone > Announce Calls. NEVER MISS A STORY!

Aetna will be providing its 50,000 employees with Apple Watches at no cost and subsidizing the cost for large employers and individual customers through a new healthy living initiative. Beginning this fall, Aetna will make Apple Watch available to select large employers and individual customers during open enrollment season, and Aetna will be the first major health care company to subsidize a significant portion of the Apple Watch cost, offering monthly payroll deductions to make covering the remaining cost easier. In addition to the customer program, Aetna will provide Apple Watch at no cost to its own nearly 50,000 employees, who will participate in the company’s wellness reimbursement program, to encourage them to live more productive, healthy lives. Aetna also says it is developing software for its initiative with the help of Apple that will work across the Apple Watch, iPhone, and iPad to encourage and reward healthy living for its workforce. The company outlined four areas of focus for the initiative which is rather impressive: Care management and wellness, to help guide consumers through health events like a new diagnosis or prescription medication with user-driven support from nurses and people with similar conditions. Medication adherence, to help consumers remember to take their medications, easily order refills and connect with their doctor if they need a different treatment through their Apple Watch or iPhone. Integration with Apple Wallet, allowing consumers to check their deductible and pay a bill. Personalized health plan on-boarding, information, messaging and decision support to help Aetna members understand and make the most of their benefits. Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke positively about the effort: “We are thrilled that Aetna will be helping their members and employees take greater control of their health using Apple Watch,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Aetna’s new initiatives will be a powerful force toward creating better customer experiences in health care, and we look forward to working with Aetna to make them successful.” The effort between Aetna and Apple follows the recent debut of the second generation of Apple Watch with the faster Series 1 models and more capable Series 2 models. Apple Watch Series 1 features the same design and features as the original Apple Watch and includes a dual-core processor to make it overall snappier. Apple Watch Series 2 (review) also features the faster dual-core processor as well as swimproof water resistance, swim tracking, GPS, and a brighter display. [Update: We’ve heard a few more details about Aetna’s Apple Watch program on background since publishing. It sounds like Aetna employees will receive $130 toward the cost of the Apple Watch, plus up to $200/year through Aetna’s wellness reimbursement program for personal expenses like gym memberships and fitness tracker purchases. This brings the total to $330 in a given year which means that it likely isn’t as simple as picking your preferred model and receiving it for free. In other words, it doesn’t sound like Aetna is buying a ton of Apple Watches and distributing them to interested employees. Apple Watch Series 1 retails from $269 while the more capable Apple Watch Series 2 retails from $369.] Guides Apple Watch View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Apple is reportedly building a Siri-based smart home device to rival Amazon's Echo. The project—designed to control appliances, locks, lights, and curtains via voice activation—has entered prototype testing, Bloomberg reports. In an attempt to stand out from other smart speakers like the Echo and Google's upcoming Home device, Cupertino is using more advanced microphone and speaker technology. It may also employ facial recognition to help identify who is in the room or a person's emotional state, according to Bloomberg. The unnamed product—what would be the company's most significant hardware release since the Apple Watch—is expected to include iPhone-like Siri commands. Users could, for instance, ask the device to read emails, send text messages, post to social media, and stream music. Bloomberg also tipped the integration of mapping data, allowing the hub to inform owners of the best time to leave the house to beat traffic. An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the rumors and speculation. The tech titan first showed interest in home automation more than two years ago, with the introduction of HomeKit, which lets gadget makers link their smart home devices to iOS. Tell Siri to "get ready for bed," for example, and HomeKit-linked devices could make sure the garage door is closed, the thermostat is lowered, and the lights are dimmed. Cupertino engineers are reportedly testing the Echo rival in their homes right now—a common practice by Apple before launching new products, Bloomberg says. //Related Articles Why You Won't See an 'Apple Echo' Google's Home device, meanwhile, is expected this year; look for more details at the company's Oct. 4 event in San Francisco. Earlier this month, Amazon introduced a cheaper Echo Dot speaker for $49.99—$40 less than the original model, which arrived in March. Like its taller Echo sibling, the Dot gives access to Amazon's voice-powered personal assistant Alexa. Editor's Note: This story was updated at 1:25 p.m. Eastern with a response from Apple.

According to Bloomberg, the move is aimed at moving HealthKit away from a platform to record health and fitness data to something that provides actionable information. For example, one new app is a sleep tracker, which shouldn’t be all too surprising given the refresh that Apple’s watch app received with iOS 10. With the iPhone, you can now set your alarms based on how long you’d like to sleep, and iOS 10 does do some rudimentary sleep analysis by attempting to detect when you’re asleep by your phone activity. The other appears to be a new type of fitness app that analyzes how your heart rate falls to its resting level to judge your level of fitness. While these apps will have a measurable benefit to you, Apple is also aiming to make HealthKit usable for medical diagnoses. With all that data, the company sees a big opportunity to gain a foothold in the $8 trillion global healthcare industry. Related: Apple WatchOS3 Review Apple already has the know-how to do so. Earlier this year it acquired Gliimpse, a startup that aims to bring together separate medical databases and store them in a central location. But the hardware won’t change, both due to strict FDA regulations on medical devices and a desire to focus on features that benefit the most consumers — a heart-rate monitor over a glucose meter, for example. It is unclear if these new features are part of early work for iOS 11, or just snippets of what we can expect longer term from Apple. In any case, given Apple’s heavy focus on this area, it looks like what we’ve seen so far concerning well-being in iOS 10 is only the beginning.

The last decade of Mac keyboard evolution Could it be magic, now? The last decade of Mac keyboard evolution By Kane Fulton Peripherals   Apple's type machine rolls on Shares Making magic takes time, you know Some say Apple perfected the keyboard in 2007. We're not one of them, which is why we've spent more money than we care to think about getting my supple digits accustomed to different Mac keyboards throughout the years. The Cupertino, California-based firm pulled off a one-two sucker punch in 2015 by launching not one, but two new keyboards for the first time in eight years. Both the 12-inch MacBook and the new Magic Keyboard have proved divisive affairs with their low-slung keys, shallower than your average reality TV star. The question is: are Apple's keyboards getting better, or worse? Let's look back at offerings we've owned in the last decade-plus, in addition to glossing over Apple's latest Magic Keyboard. How many made it into our list of the best keyboards in the world? This article has been updated for TechRadar's Mac Week. This year marks not only the 10th anniversary of Apple's MacBook, but the triumphant return of macOS. So, TechRadar looks to celebrate with a week's worth of original features delving back into the Mac's past, predicting the Mac's future and exploring the Mac as it is today. Prev Page 1 of 12 Next Prev Page 1 of 12 Next Apple Wired Keyboard (2003) You can almost imagine the 2003 version of Apple's Wireless keyboard in a modern art exhibition next to Tracey Emin's bed. "Here lies a keyboard with the crumbs of a thousand lunches visible though its transparent base", a totally plausible sign could read. Transparent cases were the norm for Apple back in 2003, following its iMac G3 and PowerMac G3 computers of the era, and this keyboard looked pretty cool at the time. It packed the standard features you'd expect from a full-sized wired keyboard, including two USB ports and full-size number pad. Although nowhere near as satisfying to type on as today's mechanical keyboards, its spongey keys offered more travel and resistance than your average membrane keyboard and made for a curiously fulfilling typing experience. Comfort rating (5 being most comfortable): 3.5 Travel rating (5 being deepest): 5 Prev Page 2 of 12 Next Prev Page 2 of 12 Next Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad (2007) Like an accountant in a Bugatti, Apple's wired aluminum keyboard both oozes cool and can help you do your tax returns, thanks to its numeric keypad. Flatter, lighter and generally miles better looking than its 2003 predecessor, its 40 centimeters of sturdy metal build quality also make it a formidable weapon in the wrong person's hands. Perhaps surprisingly, it remains Apple's most recent wired keyboard following the company's decision not to refresh it in 2015. Which is just as well, as its comfortable keys, handily located USB ports (one on either side) and compact nature make it a treat for the fingers and the eyes. Comfort rating (5 being most comfortable): 4 Travel rating (5 being deepest): 3 Prev Page 3 of 12 Next Prev Page 3 of 12 Next Apple Wireless Keyboard (2007) Toting a similar design to Apple's other 2007 aluminum keyboard (you know – the wired one), Apple's Wireless Keyboard repositioned the arrow keys and removed the number pad to create a compact classic. So good, it was even worth raiding the bottoms of drawers for eight years to find re-chargable batteries with remaining fizz. The Wireless Keyboard was so popular that early iPad cases literally bent over backwards to accommodate it. In 2012, this editor backed a Kickstarter-funded case called the TypeCover that transported both an iPad and wireless keyboard at the same time. It was expensive and rubbish, but it worked, and showed the lengths people were prepared to go to carry around their favorite hunk of metal. Comfort rating (5 being most comfortable): 4 Travel rating (5 being deepest): 3 Prev Page 4 of 12 Next Prev Page 4 of 12 Next MacBook Air keyboard (2011) Call time; we have a winner. For us, the 13-inch MacBook Air remains the king of Apple keyboards. It's hard to put a finger – what's that, a typing pun? – on just what makes it great. Is it the subtle curvature of the Air's chiclet-spaced keys, which possess a near-perfect amount of just-shallow-enough travel? Or perhaps it's the spacious and comfortable aluminum wrist rest that aids you as you type. It could even be the way the keys wobble like an excited jelly. Because perfection is boring, we'd like to see a new version of the 13-inch MacBook Air's keyboard, one with larger key caps and increased stability (like the Magic Keyboard) but possessing the same amount of travel and style. Apple, if you're listening, I have three words for you: redesigned MacBook Pro. Comfort rating (5 being most comfortable): 5 Travel rating (5 being deepest): 3 Prev Page 5 of 12 Next Prev Page 5 of 12 Next Retina MacBook Pro keyboard (2013) Like a parent loving both children but having an unconscious preference for one over the other, this editor in particular has always preferred the Air's keyboard over the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro. Despite offering a similar amount of travel and having the same sized keycaps, there's a subtle, but noticeable rigidity in the Pro's keys that makes typing slightly less fluid than on the Air. It's likely down to the Retina's chunkier profile under the keyboard and overall weightier feel. Don't get me wrong, the experience isn't a bad one: it's just the Pepsi to the Air's Coke; the McDonalds to its Burger King – the Van Damme to its Schwarzenegger. Likeable and popular, but no classic. Comfort rating (5 being most comfortable): 3.5 Travel rating (5 being deepest): 2 Prev Page 6 of 12 Next Prev Page 6 of 12 Next 12-inch MacBook keyboard (2015) So this is, er, where things get a bit awkward. As we noted in our review of the 12-inch MacBook, you'll have no trouble typing on it for short-ish periods of time. Silly (and wrong) people sometimes mock Macs for being "expensive Facebook machines," but in the case of the new MacBook, it's only somewhat justified. This is one of the ultimate laptops for browsing the web and doing social media stuff, bashing out short quips to friends and typing out invites to UV bangle-littered foam parties. But not so much for serious productivity – the 1mm of travel afforded by the keyboard's Butterfly mechanism is simply too low for comfort when it comes to bashing out long documents. Wrist cramp sets in, inaccuracies creep into work and you'll have a miserable time finding a USB-C keyboard –mainly because few, if any, exist yet. Comfort rating (5 being most comfortable): 2 Travel rating (5 being deepest): 1 Prev Page 7 of 12 Next Prev Page 7 of 12 Next Apple Magic Keyboard (2015) Six keyboards in and we've arrived in the present, as illustrated by Apple's new Magic Keyboard hiding in a plant pot. What do you mean "why?" Leaf me alone. It was with some nervousness that we read the release detailing the new accessory, which on the plus side doesn't house Apple's Butterfly mechanisms under its keys. At the same time, its "low-profile scissor mechanism" sounded ominous – would it be as unsuitable as the 12-inch MacBook for blistering typing sessions? Spoiler: we used the Magic Keyboard to type this very article, and it was a mighty pleasurable (and pain-free) experience. However, Apple's 2007 Wireless Keyboard this is not. The keys are much shallower (around 1mm versus 2007's 2mm), and typing feels somewhere in-between that keyboard and the 12-inch MacBook's. You really have to try it for yourself. A nice touch over the 2007 Wireless model is its flatter profile. In the absence of a battery compartment, your wrists sit at a lower and more natural angle, which allows them to rest more comfortably on the desk – a bit like they do on the MacBook Air's keyboard. So, that's that. If you want to check out some foliage-free images of Apple's Magic Keyboard, then click on ahead. Comfort rating (4 being most comfortable): 4.5 Travel rating (5 being deepest): 2 Prev Page 8 of 12 Next Prev Page 8 of 12 Next Magic Keyboard: packaging The Magic Keyboard comes in a typically snug packaging set-up from Apple. Would you expect anything less? Prev Page 9 of 12 Next Prev Page 9 of 12 Next Magic Keyboard: size versus 2007 Wireless It fits snugly into the back of the 2007 Wireless keyboard, too. This is arguably Apple's most portable keyboard yet. Prev Page 10 of 12 Next Prev Page 10 of 12 Next Magic Keyboard: On switch Pairing the Magic Keyboard to your Mac is as easy as connecting it via the supplied Lightning cable and turning it on using the button above. Within a few seconds you'll get a message saying that you can disconnect the cable. Wizard-worthy stuff, indeed. Prev Page 11 of 12 Next Prev Page 11 of 12 Next Magic Keyboard: side view The new Magic Keyboard is thinner, shorter and much lighter (0.5 pounds versus 0.7 pounds) than the 2007 Wireless keyboard. It truly is a portable keyboard this time around and would make a fine companion to the iPad Pro or the Mac Pro.

Complete List Of Phones Releasing In 2016 By Susmita Baral @sushbaral On 09/27/16 AT 2:34 PM Close Since the official iPhone 7 announcement, fans of Apple smartphones have been anxiously awaiting the new devices. The iPhone 7 (4.7-inch display) and the iPhone 7 Plus (5.5-inch display) were sold out and backordered during pre-orders, prior to the in-store launch of the smartphones. “iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus dramatically improve every aspect of the iPhone experience, reaching a new level of innovation and precision to make this the best iPhone we have ever made,” Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, said at an Apple event earlier this year. “The completely redesigned cameras shoot incredible photos and videos day or night, the A10 Fusion chip is the most powerful chip on any smartphone while delivering the best battery life ever in an iPhone, and an entirely new stereo speaker system provides twice the sound, all within the first water and dust resistant iPhone.” What makes the device to appealing — aside from its user-friendly interface and sleek design — are the handful of changes that come with it: a redesigned home button, no headphone jack and a dual lens camera (one wide angle lens and a second telephoto lens; both 12 MP). And for those who have a clumsy streak in them, the device is splash and waterproof. Related Stories iPhone 7 Shipments Could Come Early Should you get an iPhone 7? Its backordered status and the retired headphone jack may be a deal breaker since it eliminates the option to charge your phone and use your headphones simultaneously. For those in the market for a smartphone, then here are four other devices launching this year to consider if you’re willing to part ways with iMessage. Samsung Galaxy Note 7: While this device rolled out in August, it will be relaunched after the South Korean company halted sales of smartphone in 10 countries over battery issues. Those who do not own a Note 7 can finally purchase the device and not worry about the battery. Moto Z Unlocked (Oct. 2): The unlocked Moto Z is available for preorder on Amazon. Called the “most innovative phone” of the year by BGR, the device boasts 30 hours of battery life and the modular phone can be turned into a movie projector or even a boom box. The Moto Z, Z Play and ZForce Droid are already on the market. Pixel & Pixel XL (TBD; Rumored Oct): Google has two new devices coming out — one boasting a 5-inch display screen and another with a 5.5-inch screen. The new generation of Google smartphones may lose the “Nexus” name altogether, with current rumors hinting at “Pixel” and “Pixel XL” for the new names, Business Insider reports. These devices will reportedly have a headphone jack, a USB-C port and will be really powerful. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Or The MacBook Pro 2016? Analyst Says Both MacBooks Are Hitting The Scene In October 27 September 2016, 1:44 pm EDT By Vamien McKalin Tech Times Apple - Here's What You May Not KnowNow Playing Fascinating Facts About Steve JobsNow Playing The MacBook Pro and MacBook Air could be the next major Apple products to hit retail stores in the coming weeks. We've read and heard about several rumors about these devices, but this new one appears to hold some weight.  ( Justin Sullivan | Getty Images ) Advertisement Apple is on a roll right now with the release of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Both devices have found success at retail, but the company is not stopping there if a new report is to be believed. It's been awhile since we've heard anything solid about Apple's Macbook line of computers. We've come across several rumors, with some claiming the device will come with a secondary OLED display that is designed to highlight the function keys. As we sit and wait for Apple to officially talk about what it plans when it comes down to the Macbook Pro and Macbook Air, we have to contend with another round of rumors from the mill. According to Rhoda Alexander, an analyst from IHS Securities, Apple's intention is to launch the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air in October this year. The report came from Forbes, which means this rumor should carry a lot of weight behind it. Alexander went on to state that production on both devices began during the second calendar quarter of 2016. Now, such news might sound great to some, but there's a huge drawback here, which leaves us to wonder if this rumor is even on track. Should Apple decide to launch both the new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air in October, then it simply means the devices won't come with Intel Kaby Lake inside, especially since the rumor claims production has already begun. Alexander herself appears to agree with this sentiment that, "given the timing of the start of production, inclusion of [Intel's] Kaby Lake chip appears unlikely." This doesn't give us any real information on what Apple is planning. However, it does give the impression that the chances of seeing Kaby Lake inside the new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air are quite slim at this point. As it stands, Intel Skylake may be the road Apple is traveling on. Maybe the company doesn't see a huge performance increase with Kaby Lake that is worth going after. Furthermore, the company might be interested in keeping costs down by going with an older architecture. One of the latest rumors also suggests that the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air would both come with a trackpad that supports Apple Pencil. This would make a lot of sense, as it would give Apple device users another means of using the Pencil. Right now, the Apple Pencil is only usable on the iPad Pro.

The Galaxy S7 Edge was the phone to set the tone early this year, and its unveiling at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona signaled a commitment to continue being edgy. For a company that can be persistent in pushing its various visions to see what ultimately sticks, the curvy strategy appears to be a winner. In what ways is sometimes unclear, anecdotally speaking, since there are no real metrics measuring engagement, only sales figures to indicate the device’s popularity. The Galaxy S7 Edge reared back into the spotlight — at least somewhat — because of the Galaxy Note 7 recall. Anytime one of your flagship handsets is considered unexploded ordinance and called out singularly on an airplane before takeoff, you have a public relations nightmare. These days, only Samsung and Apple (Bendgate, et al) could emerge from such a fiasco more or less unscathed. Time will tell. No such issues have afflicted the S7 Edge, which continues to hum along as the ‘safe’ bet for Samsung and consumers who may prefer the device’s form factor. The device I’ve had a lot of time with the S7 Edge since it launched in Canada in March, and I took it as an opportunity to let the edged display grow on me, if it could. I like curves as much as the next guy, but the practicality of the edged display and the interface it harbours has always left me feeling like something is missing. With the Galaxy S6 Edge last year, that missing element was obvious — the interface did next to nothing of any intrinsic value. Samsung poured much more into it this year, offering numerous shortcuts and contextual information, which I’ll get to a little further down. What truly helped the company’s standing with this device was what could be viewed as a corrective approach; one that brought back the microSD card slot and water-resistance that was abandoned last year. It also slightly curved the back edges, contouring the device on both sides for better handling. The glass back remained the same fingerprint magnet it has always been. Curiously, though, white and blue were abandoned in Canada, with black, silver and gold the preferred options instead. With Samsung choosing to harmonize the chipset with the Note 7 by using the same Snapdragon 820 in both Canada and the United States, the S7 Edge was the opposite. Only the U.S. variant had Qualcomm’s chip, whereas all others used Samsung’s own Exynos 8890 octa-core processor. Whether there was a significant difference in performance wasn’t patently obvious to me. Then there was the camera. A less protruding lens certainly helped, but it was the internals that were to make a difference. With a wide f/1.7 aperture lens and superb image sensor that included larger micron pixels, the S7 Edge was poised to become one of the shooters to beat. It has earned its keep in my books, offering some of the best composition I’ve seen in Auto mode to date. The software Samsung has wisely chosen to continue the process of dialing back its previous software excess and gimmicky nonsense, and focus on lessening TouchWiz’s impact on Android to make navigation that much easier. The settings probably benefit the most from that because the layout is simpler (though I prefer how it was done on the Note 7), save for the visual elements that make it appear different. Of course, that wasn’t really the focus here. The edge interface was, and by stripping down on the other side, it rained an abundance of features to the edge to make it more of a general usability go-to. For me, at least, this required self-training and the will to try it, even when it didn’t seem necessary or prudent to do so. That’s generally not a good start for any piece of software, but it isn’t even the biggest issue. Third-party support, or lack thereof, has been the gaping hole that keeps this interface from turning a corner to become something indispensable. Much of what’s available is driven by Samsung and its partnerships. There’s a decent level of choice, yet the pickings are still slim. Take the Tasks Edge screen, for instance. In theory, it’s a sound idea — create shortcuts to specific app functions. Except, in practice, it’s limited to core apps and little else. The lack of support from others could be rationalized for any company that isn’t Samsung, but when you’re at the top of the heap, it’s logical to assume developers would want to play ball. Any sort of grace period for that is effectively over after six months on the market. Where are the cool task shortcuts for apps like Sonos, Gmail, Spotify or Instagram? Instead, it’s the Edge Panels that make up most of the outside support, where some developers have been offering their own apps specifically tailored to the interface. Most cost something, ranging in price from $1 to $2, and include panels specific to popular apps, like WhatsApp, Spotify, SoundCloud, Facebook Messenger, Twitter, Netflix and TuneIn. It’s nice to see tools like these emerge, though it’s not clear how well they’re selling or how many are using them. The always-on display that was first seen in Motorola’s devices, was on by default, displaying the date, battery level, time, and basic notification icons in plain white text on the black display. A low-powered way to constantly have contextual information at hand, I found it to be useful enough to never turn it off. It just would’ve been nice if more context could be added to the notifications with a simple tap. The camera Gallery The 12-megapixel rear camera would have seemed like a step backward with a lower megapixel count, but the truth was that this turned out to be a noticeable upgrade in many ways. Larger micron pixels and a wider f/1.7 aperture lens were a big one-two punch in letting in more light for better images in low-light and night situations. I’m a bigger fan of the Pro mode for the manual controls, but there are few smartphone cameras I’ve tested that can shoot this well in a variety of settings in Auto mode. In Pro mode, it only gets better. It certainly doesn’t hurt that it takes seconds to launch the camera, focus on a subject and snap a photo. Double-pressing the home button launches it in only 0.7 seconds. Fast focusing seems almost immediate, and snapping a photo can be done with the camera icon or by pressing either of the volume buttons. At the time of its launch, the S7 Edge obliterated the iPhone 6s in low-light performance. Now, with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus having answered back, the fight has gotten more interesting. To me, the LG G4 was the best overall camera of 2015, but the S7 Edge has earned that crown so far, especially in Auto mode. Competition is fierce, though. The LG G5, HTC 10 and even some other emerging phones stepped up this year, and Apple is only the latest to do so. The fact that the flat Galaxy S7 and Note 7 use the exact same camera means the performance of the S7 Edge is not exclusive to this one device. That’s all good for synergy from Samsung’s perspective, but it doesn’t make the camera the most distinctive feature here. That goes to the edged display. As it stands…   There’s an irony about the S7 Edge in that it is probably more popular than its flatter sibling, yet is much harder to find a good case or screen protector for it. The curved glass already makes it more delicate. Forget a long drop shattering the screen, a short one of less than two feet on a hard surface is enough to crack it. That goes for the back of the device, too. Fast Charging and wireless charging help lessen the impact of the battery drain, which is nice when dealing with a 3600mAh non-removable battery inside. Even six months later, the device can last for a full day, though standby life has taken a hit along the way. I could leave the phone alone for two days and it will be completely dead. Why, I’m not sure, because there shouldn’t be anything going on in the background. Not that I’m shocked. One of Samsung’s shortcomings is that its batteries don’t always hold up extremely well over time when usage is regularly above moderate. I’ve generally found iPhones do a better job, though Apple does have the advantage of optimizing its own operating system and hardware. For Samsung, this phone is part of a wider ecosystem it wants consumers to embrace. The new Gear VR headset is compatible with the S7 Edge, thanks to an adapter that works with the microUSB port. The S7 Edge works just fine with the  camera, as it does with the Gear Fit2, Gear IconX and Gear S3 smartwatch. At the time of launch, the S7 Edge was $1,100 outright. Today, it’s about $100 less through the carriers. Even on two-year contracts, the device is regularly $400 or more. Samsung is now selling it outright and unlocked for $850. By the time its successor comes next spring, headphone jacks may continue to disappear and USB-C could be further cemented as the next industry standard, making the S7 Edge feel older than it really is. Related: Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge review: An act of refinement Mike Lovell Why not mention it no longer is running the latest version of Android and probably won’t until spring? Seems like an important detail to leave out. JD Because it’s not relevant Patrick O’Rourke I tend to agree. I feel like it’s pretty standard and well known that only Nexus devices have access to Nougat. Android update issues are more than a problem for just the S7. Mike Lovell Well, if sites like this one are going to give up on taking companies to task for their lack of updates, I guess it will not be a problem (for the companies). Just because it is a bigger problem than just Samsung, it does not mean it is not still a problem (for the user). This is an article about what it like to own a device over time. Update expectations are part of the experience for all users. The audience for this site is pretty broad as it is not only tech experts that read the biggest mobile site in Canada. I can not agree, but thank you for your response. Patrick O’Rourke Fair enough. We’ll keep that in mind in the future. I’ll also talk it over with our team because I think a more in-depth story specifically delving into Android’s update issues might be more suitable for discussing a serious but still widespread issue like that. JD Sites like this aren’t even a blip on Samsung’s radar. Don’t like Samsung’s/Android’s update policy just vote with your wallet. Patrick O’Rourke Perhaps Samsung global, but we’re Samsung Canada’s go-to Canadian tech news outlet. http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/09/21/samsung-canada-note-7-recall-statement/ JD Well then… I expect more of you guys. Patrick O’Rourke In what respect? panzival The outright price of the S7e is $850, not $1000 (as per the Samsung website). $650 if you trade in an old phone. Jamma If he says that the people might not buy an iPhone..lol Ted K Thanks for pointing that out. We’ve edited the story to reflect the pricing options. Zbiba Just a small thing, but the edit wasn’t complete: “At the time of launch, the S7 Edge was $1,100 outright. Today, it’s about $100 less through the carriers.[…] Samsung is now selling it outright and unlocked for $850.” Should be 250$ less not $100. I like the idea of these 6 months later articles, but as some have stated the update problems have to be addressed somewhere. I got my S6 6.0.1 update a month ago, which actually means it was 10 months after its initial release… And that’s not right. Ted K Thanks for your feedback. The $100 refers to what the carriers have done with pricing, whereas the price directly from Samsung is $250 lower, as you noted. Zbiba Ohhhh yeah you’re right! My bad completely misread the thing. Jamma33 I have no problem with my S7 Edge six months later. I’m still amazed how long the battery last. Switched to the Note 7 but we all know what happened there 🙁 so went back to S7 Edge. Was thinking I should try something else but the camera and 4K videos on the S7 edge is second to none. People are amazed at how good it looks and can’t believe a phone camera can do that and I’m talking hardcore Apply folks. I know people who switched from iPhone to buy the edge after seeing the pics…Oh lets not talk about the screen. Apple retina LMAO. Sorry Mobilesyrup I just take your reviews with a grain of salt…just always Apple this and that…SMH Ipse Same here…I would also add that for those on MM, having THEMES (and by that I mean REAL black ones, that help the AMOLED screen save power) is a huge plus. Not sure if Foogle will ever add dark mode properly implemented. Using a fast wireless charger I top up mornings and evenings and can still keep it in the sweet 30-80% sweet spot. I do agree with the case/screen protector comment…it’s almost impossible to find the right combo. Patrick O’Rourke Sorry you feel that way about our reviews. We’re fans of good products, whether they’re iOS or Android. Check out our V20 and Note 8 review if you’re interested in reviews of stellar Android devices. Eric Rabell Hey Patrick, the Note 8 isn’t out yet 😉 Great review, I completely agree with bringing Apple into the mix considering it is the most popular smartphone ever. Take comments like Jamma’s with a grain of salt. How are you supposed to compare to other products without mentioning other products? Patrick O’Rourke In my defense, the Note 8 may never come out after this fiasco 😉 Arman Wish V20 had an Amoled screen. Zbiba I also think bringing Apple into the mix is a necessary thing to do. iPhones are the best selling phones every year, and will probably be for a while. They may not be the best, but they do provide a great overall experience for people looking for that kind of experience. I’m personally an Android only user, and I don’t see myself switching ANYTIME soon, because there are some elements of iOS that I simply can’t stand (the biggest one being how closed it is) Patrick O’Rourke I agree, especially considering even Samsung wants it’s devices directly compared to Apple’s smartphones. Both manufacturers are competing in the high-end space. apuri This review is for the S7 Edge, but all the pics are of the S7. Maybe he isn’t even basing this on an actual edge variant. This article…..meh. Mobilesyrup has definitely dropped in quality over time. Connor Something has changed, can’t quite put my finger on it. h2oflyer Possibly why Daniel Bader left. This site just churns out ads and doesn’t seem to care about it’s reputation. Patrick O’Rourke From where we stand at MobileSyrup, nothing has changed since Daniel’s departure. In fact, we have a much larger team now and are producing at least three times the amount of interesting features and videos at an increased level of quality. We value our community, so if there are certain topics or stories you’d like to see covered more, feel free to reach out to me via email at patrick@MobileSyrup.com. apuri Patrick, First of all, Id like to say thanks for engaging with your readers. Its not common enough. Secondly, Id like to just say that I have undoubtedly noticed the increase in content on the site, but the difference is that it not as passionately delivered like some ex-author’s big pieces who have left MobileSyrup (MS). That is not to say that none of the team is passionate, rather that thorough works are not as elaborate and emotion filled. There aren’t good video reviews paired with written reviews. I wasn’t a HUGE fan of Bader’s work, but I can’t deny that his talent has developed immensely during his time at MobileSyrup. I have been a reader of MS since its launch – in fact, I even contacted Ian to advertise on the site (with no response) – but there is no doubt that MS is in a rut and could use some changes. Patrick O’Rourke Interesting perspective for sure. I think we likely have different definitions of what it means to be passionate about a story, but we’ll definitely keep your comments in mind in the future. Patrick O’Rourke The photos? They’ve certainly changed 😉 apuri Thanks for updating those. And I also appreciate you guys checking in and updating the post. JD Heavily agree. Its like I’m reading a Canadian version of BGR but at least they brought in fresh blood like Rose that knows what she’s talking about Patrick O’Rourke Sorry you feel that way. What would you like to see discussed more in our “Six Months Later” series next time? Patrick O’Rourke Photos have been switched around, sorry for the confusion! The story is indeed about the S7 Edge. fred The main issue with the Edge is the Edge display. It’s a gimmick and doesn’t bring any added value, while making cases harder to fit. JD It feels good in hand to hold but yeh in use it doesn’t help Eric Rabell I don’t think you’re understanding the point of the edge display. It’s not designed to be a gimmick like last year’s model. This year you have a larger battery, larger screen size AND software to go with it. I can 100% see the added value for 100$ fred Larger screen and larger battery I get it. But the edge display is still a gimmick, I’d rather have a non-edge display. Eric Rabell And that’s why they released two phones. One for you – with the smaller and flatter screen, and one for me – with a larger battery and screen. That’s the game, don’t make one phone that only 50% of the population wants. Make two so everyone is happy. That’s why apple has three phones fred I don’t think more than 1% of the users want a curved display after they spend more than 1 day with it. Except bragging that you have a curved display, there is no benefit. They should have released two flat devices. Eric Rabell Although it is a niche market, it’s a top-seller phone and I’ve never seen anyone return it at a level-A store, where I work. Try it and if you don’t like it, that’s fine 🙂 fred You don’t seem to understand. People keep it because of the larger screen and battery. Not because of the curved screen. Also, it’s very hard to return a phone (you must have used less than 50 MB and very few minutes). Eric Rabell Not sure who your comment is for but you are right. Please note that the return policy is 14 days after the date of purchase. Sales people do not understand how return policies work with the new rules so: If you CANCEL with the company within the first 14 days, if you use more than 50 MB, 30 texts or 30 minutes they will charge you a first and final bill. If you do not use more than those limits, they will not charge you a first and final bill. Returns or exchanges are unaffected by those usage limits but you only get 14 days. It’s in your paperwork but most people misinterpret what it means 🙂 KiwiBri LOVE this camera. The reason I bought this phone. Great daily battery life and also fast charging is awesome. Thanks Samsung. Now just get Nougat out for it please 🙂 jellmoo I still like my S7 edge well enough. I have no real complaints about the device. The battery life is good, though it will occasionally get a weird wake lock and drain faster on stand by than it should. The phone is responsive enough, takes great pictures and has a great screen. The only thing that really holds me back from loving it is the software. Samsung has come a long way, don’t get me wrong, but it’s still just trying to do too much. It has too many features that just seem half baked, or are answers to problems that don’t exist. I’d much prefer a cleaner version of Android, rather than the kitchen sink approach of Samsung. JD They would be stupid to get rid of the headphone jack. Just because other companies do stupid things (like get rid of the SD card or removable battery[im hoping the latter makes a come back in the S8])doesn’t mean Samsung has to. Here’s there chance to be a market leader and not a follower of what Apple does (they’ve lost their way clearly, and it’s not the first time. Can they find their way back is the question). The ridiculously poor standby drain? Don’t blame Samsung blame Google for their ever more intrusive background data mining. Eric Rabell I disagree. Getting rid of unnecessary or old components has been extremely common in the tech world. When we moved from VHS to DVD EVERYONE threw a fit because everyone has VHS and not enough people has DVD. We then got rid of HDDVD in order to use Blue-Ray instead. Don’t even get me started on Floppy disks – or as kids call them, ‘3D printed ‘save’ icons”. If Sammysung was to get rid of a feature that we love, we will let them know through the lack of sales and increase in complaints. THat’s how we got the S7 and S7 edge with SD card and water resistance. Embrace change 🙂 aaron I just got this phone and I get a lot of compliment on the design whenever I pull out my phone. Arman Its $800 if you buy it from eBay unlocked and brand new. Not sure how the warranty would work though since its coming from US!? Bizzarosupes One thing about the S7 Edge… I would suggest to be wary about taking advantage of the wireless charging feature. Both the charge pad and phone get warm, which in turn causes that glass back to crack. Happened to mine.. h2oflyer I had the same situation with my S7 and the regular wireless charging pad. The fan never came on during fast charging and the charging pad and phone got very warm. Took it back to Best Buy for an exchange and none of the fans worked on the regular charging pads. Had to switch to the wireless charhing pad with stand to get a working fan. The cooling fan is supposed to run when on fast charge….charger and phone run cooler now. Samsung does make some great products ,but their QA seems iffy. jay i bought the phone two weeks ago after that apple disaster. was waiting for apple to announce a new iPhone which i would like but Samsung gave me a good deal. 760$ including tax. when it comes to updates i am not sure why they are important? i just use a different launcher and good. put a new theme on the phone and again it feels different. if someone looking for a new phone that is the one to get. maybe is the budget tide get the iPhone 7 which is still good.

The new beta with build code 16B2333a is said to come with performance improvements, among others.  According to MacRumors, Apple is seeding macOS Sierra 10.12.1 beta to developers starting this Tuesday. The release of the new beta comes just six days since the first beta was rolled out and exactly a week after the official new Mac OS was released to the public.  Though the release note of the new macOS Sierra beta has yet to be available, MacRumors reports the developer beta comes with under-the-hood performance improvements, bug fixes and other implementations to address the issues identified with the first beta.  The first beta came with Photos support for the Portrait feature of the iPhone 7 Plus dual-lens camera system that was introduced in the iOS 10.1 beta.  Just like the first beta with build code 16B2327e, the second macOS Sierra beta is expected to be rolled out to public beta testing program members in the coming days.  Related Stories Apple Rolls Out macOS Sierra Beta 10.12.1 New MacBook Air, MacBook Pro Set For Release Next Month, Analyst Claims Another Galaxy Note 7 Explodes In New Incident Report Apple’s latest operating system for its Mac devices is said to offer a lot of new useful features to users. The Independent reports the natural landmark-inspired OS adds Siri to Mac devices, making it easy for users to send Messages and emails, perform quick searches and ask about time via voice command.  The new OS also comes with Apple Watch integration, so users can remotely unlock their Mac devices using the Auto Unlock feature on their smart timepiece. However, the Independent explains this feature is only available to watchOS 3-running wearables and more recent Macs.  Another useful feature that macOS Sierra brings to Mac devices is deeper iCloud integration. This pertains to how users can retrieve files they saved in the Documents folder of a specific device using any of their other supported devices.  Other features that are part of the macOS Sierra update include Safari-based Apple Pay, Picture-in-picture mode, the Universal Clipboard, storage optimization and many more, as per Gizmodo.

Prominent blogger Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo gave an object lesson in a post describing the disappearance of all his home Mac Desktop and Documents folders thanks to a bug. Here's what happened. By Robin Harris for Storage Bits | September 27, 2016 -- 17:59 GMT (10:59 PDT) | Topic: Storage Getting lost in the clouds. (Image: Robin Harris) Josh Marshall, prolific editor of Talking Points Memo -- one of my favorite public affairs pubs -- is a dedicated Apple customer: three Macs, an iPad, and an iPhone. He liked Apple's idea of keeping his Desktop and Documents folder contents in iCloud, so he enabled it. That was a mistake: . . . the operating system had decided to sync the iCloud version of my work computer desktop to my home machine -- not realizing they were two different computers. Seeing that something very wrong had happened I tried to uncheck the checkbox that started the process. There was a message that told me that it wouldn't erase the documents I'd already synced to iCloud. (Cool, I'd hope you wouldn't do that, Apple.) So I said okay. When I did that everything disappeared. So all the files on my Desktop were gone. All the files in my Documents folder were gone. [Bolding his.] Yikes! In theory, it should be simple to coordinate the backup of folders from several Macs to iCloud: each has a unique Apple serial number and a unique MAC address. Either should be enough to identify individual machines. iCloud isn't attempting to meld two versions of the same file stored on different machines. It is simply saying all the Desktop and Document files from Machine A are stored -- as are all Desktop and Documents files from Machine B. Different machines, different folders, different copies stored on iCloud. Kid stuff. From his conversations with Apple support, Marshall deduced that This was clearly an emerging issue, one they'd heard about from other users and one they didn't have a clear solution to yet. For Marshall, Apple's tech support was very helpful, but he was forced to wipe the system, then do a clean install of macOS Sierra, and restore his data from a Time Machine backup, a process that can take many hours. He recovered his data, but not the time he spent fixing the problems. The Storage Bits take Apple is a client-centric company. For the most part, that is a good thing. But as its tortured history with online services attests, Apple often runs into trouble when integrating devices across networks. I have no doubt that Apple engineers will figure out the problems with Sierra's new iCloud storage features. I expect they may also update their beta testing to take into account multi-device users like Marshall and me. When it comes to new Apple storage features, I'd recommend doing what datacenter managers do with mission critical products: wait six months -- and a couple of updates -- for the bugs to get worked out before using them. Sadly, Apple has shown, time and again, that niggling issues like data integrity and data protection just don't rank very high in the product requirements matrix. Until that changes, be safe, not sorry: backup critical data locally and to a cloud provider. Courteous comments welcome, as always. legal showdown FBI vs. Apple could make or break Silicon Valley The FBI scores a game-changing win in the battle between tech firms and law enforcement over device access, setting legal precedent that may never be undone.

All iPhone and iPad users need to be aware of what's at stake. By Brandon Vigliarolo | September 27, 2016, 9:47 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Apple iOS 10 has only been out for two weeks and a major security flaw has already been discovered: locally stored encrypted backups can be hacked with relative ease. The discovery was made by Russian cybersecurity firm Elcomsoft when updating its Phone Breaker software for iOS 10. The flaw is contained in Apple's chosen password verification method and makes it possible to bypass several important security checks. "2,500 times faster compared to the old mechanism" More about IT Security The 20 biggest tech disasters of all time Interview with a hacker: S1ege from Ghost Squad Hackers Subscribe to TechRepublic's Cybersecurity Insider newsletter Elcomsoft has been creating tools to crack iOS encryption for years, and in previous versions Apple's encryption has limited the amount of password attempts that could be made: Even with GPU acceleration iOS 9 could only be hammered 150,000 times a second. SEE: Mobile Device Research: 2016 security trends, attack rates, and vendor ratings for smartphones, tablets, laptops, and wearables (Tech Pro Research) Here's where things get shocking: the iOS 10 flaw allows 6 million attempts to be made per second—without GPU acceleration. At that speed, Elcomsoft says, hackers would only need to leave their software running for two days until the odds of success approached 90 percent. The particular risk There's just one particular kind of backup that's at risk: a local encrypted one done through iTunes. When users opt to do a full backup their keychain data is stored as well, which is what hackers truly want access to. Keychain is Apple's storage system for passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal information. It gets encrypted along with the backup, but if the password can be guessed the entire thing can be decrypted—including the keychain. SEE: An insider's look at iOS security (TechRepublic) Elcomsoft said that the only way to acquire a local encrypted backup is by gaining access to the computer it's stored on. That means laptops and desktops are the weak links. How to stay secure IT professionals should take this opportunity to review both company and BYOD device policies, as well as auditing them for compliance. Be sure that hard drives are encrypted with FileVault or other software and that the ability to remotely wipe missing computers is enabled. Apple is aware of the flaw and has said it's working on a fix. Users should be directed to update their devices as soon as a newer version of iOS is available, and they should also replace their old encrypted backup. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Security firm Elcomsoft discovered a serious flaw in iOS 10's backup encryption. The flaw makes cracking secured backups 2,500 times easier. If a locally stored encrypted backup is cracked the keychain can be decrypted as well, giving a hacker access to credit card information, passwords, and authentication tokens. The only way for hackers to gain access to vulnerable backups is to access the machine they are stored on. Now is the time to audit Apple computers for encryption compliance and other security measures. Cybersecurity threats evolve quickly. Stay one step ahead by subscribing to our newsletter.

Head to a local orchard to load up on your favorite varieties. Now that we’ve officially transitioned into fall, it’s time to get into the spirit of the season—even if the warm weather won't cooperate. From corn mazes to apple picking, here are some ideas to put you in an autumn frame of mind. Half Moon Bay Art & Pumpkin Festival Nothing says fall quite like the appearance of a certain popular orange gourd, and Half Moon Bay’s world-famous festival celebrates the pumpkin like no place else. Monday before the event, the Safeway World Championship Pumpkin Weigh-Off pits (gigantic) gourd against gourd to determine the world’s heavyweight pumpkin champion. The winner and runner-ups are on display during the festival, Oct. 15-16, which features other pumpkin- and harvest-themed attractions. Corn Maze Adventures If giant pumpkins aren’t enough to, ahem, squash your fall cravings, how about a huge corn maze? Located just over 20 miles southwest of Sacramento, Cool Patch Pumpkins’ huge corn maze is over 40 acres and open through Oct. 31. The Lazy P Farm corn maze in Winnemucca, Nevada, is smaller at just six acres, but there's a fun twist: Its Flashlight Maze evenings let brave visitors, or those with a particularly impressive sense of direction, attempt to navigate the maze in the dark on Friday and Saturday nights. Lazy P’s maze is scheduled to open Oct. 1. Fall Foliage You don’t need to hightail it to New England to experience the colorful splendor of fall’s annual fireworks show. Plenty of tree-rich spots in the West put on their own stunning displays in nuanced shades of yellow, red, and gold. Even California has something to offer. Click the following links for suggestions: Readers’ top spots in California, Oregon, and Utah | Northern California viewing points | Fall color road trip in Utah And check out California Fall Color’s regularly updated Fall Foliage Map for peak viewing times in the Golden State: Harvest in Wine Country For a different kind of fall color showing, look no further than your nearest wine country. The leaves on the vines take on autumn’s brightest hues, reminiscent of the maroons and golds you’ll find in your glass. Harvest usually begins in late summer, but events last through October. In California, consider checking out the Paso Robles Harvest Wine Weekend, Oct. 14-16, or the Sonoma County Harvest Fair, Sept. 30-Oct. 2. See wineries in action at the two-weekend Crush Festival in Lake Chelan, Washington, Oct. 1-2 and 8-9. Apple Extravaganza Like pumpkins, apples are a sure sign of autumn’s entrance. Enjoy them every which way at Apple Hill in Placerville, California, an idyllic home for dozens of farms and apple orchards. In Washington state, BelleWood Acres in Lynden is a u-pick paradise with multiple varieties and a train that takes visitors through the orchards. Take home gobs of sweet Jonagolds from nearby Apple Creek Orchards, which opens Oct. 1. Or skip the snacking and picking, and go straight to sipping with a refreshing cider tour. Click here for some stops to include, mostly in Oregon, Washington and California. Mendocino Mushroom, Wine, & Beer Festival On the Northern California coast, earthy mushrooms are the harvest of the season during the annual Mendocino Mushroom, Wine, & Beer Festival. From chanterelles to candy caps, all manner of wild funghi spring from the moist forest floors of Mendocino County. The festival, Nov. 4-13, honors these flavorful treasures with 10 days of activities, including mushroom hunts and wine-paired tasting menus. San Francisco’s Annual Literary Festival Sunny fall days in San Francisco don’t always feel particularly of the season, but any bibliophile knows that a good book can cozy things right up. During the annual LitQuake Festival, Oct. 6-15, books, and all things literary, get top billing. The festival’s final event, LitCrawl, is essentially a bar crawl with a literary bent. Fans flock from one venue to another in the Mission to listen to thematic readings by journalists, poets, and novelists.

Waarom je Google Allo wilt gebruiken De reacties op de nieuwste communicatie-app van Google zijn verdeeld. Hier lees je wat de reviews je niet vertellen. Mike Elgan Internationaal 27 september 2016 Delen         0 Reacties Bewaren Moet je Allo van Google installeren? Jazeker! Als berichtenapp is het nieuwe Allo van Google niet geweldig. Om kort te gaan, de functionaliteit onderscheidt zich nauwelijks van welk app dan ook die al jaren bestaat. Maar er is een reden waarom je Allo elke dag zou moeten gebruiken: artificial intelligence. There are dozens of messaging apps, and each has its own unique list of features. For example, iPhone users may feel compelled to choose between Apple's iMessage, which recently gained the ability to run iMessage apps, and Allo for iOS. So for the sake of understanding Google's new messaging service, let's talk about how iMessage compares with Allo. Why iMessage is better than Allo Apple's iMessage service and Messages apps are generally more elegant, polished and appealing to use than Google's Allo. A range of recently launched features make iMessage fun, such as "invisible ink," "gentle," "loud" and "slam" effects. Allo, on the other hand, has only the ability to make text larger or smaller, a feature Google calls WhisperShout. (You use WhisperShout by dragging your finger up or down from the send button.) Mac users have a desktop version of Messages, which integrates seamlessly into the mobile versions. I use iMessage via my MacBook Pro, iPad and iPhone. Unfortunately, you can use Allo on just one phone. Strong encryption for messages between two iMessage users is default and automatic, making iMessages more secure because no explicit action is required to gain full benefit of the end-to-end encryption. Edward Snowden says: Don't use Allo. With Allo, users need to choose end-to-end encryption by using an Incognito mode. Google had previously said it would store only some user messages on its servers, but changed its tune by launch time, saying the company will store all messages unless actively deleted by users or initially sent in Incognito mode. In reality, that means most users will leave all messages on Google's servers forever, and those conversations will be available to law enforcement, the NSA and possibly hackers some day. On the plus side, Google uses the Signal Protocol for end-to-end encryption while two Allo users have an Incognito conversation, which is very good encryption. Also: While you can manually delete conversations you have with other people, you can't delete conversations you have with Google's Assistant. Because stored data is necessary for Assistant customization, Google doesn't give you Assistant or Smart Reply features in Incognito Mode and doesn't let you delete Assistant conversation data, to the best of my knowledge. Finally, Apple's entire approach to communication is very clear, while Google's is muddled. Apple has three properties: email (Mail), Facetime (video and voice calling) and iMessage (messaging). Nobody's confused about any of this. Google, on the other hand, has two cloud mail clients (Gmail and Inbox), three voice and/or video apps (Google Voice, Hangouts and Duo) and two messaging apps (Hangouts and Allo). And most users aren't sure which, if any, are defunct or soon to be phased out. Why Allo is better than iMessage While you can achieve the equivalent of ephemeral messages with iMessage by installing one of several apps, the option for self-destructing messages is built in to Allo, but only in Incognito Mode. When you enter into Incognito Mode, the default is set for the message to self-destruct in one hour, but you can change that to any of several times within a range of five seconds to one week. You can also set the message to never expire. Google Assistant will do searches within a chat. Apple's iMessage is for Apple hardware and operating systems only. But Google's Allo runs on both Apple platforms and Android. So iPhone and Android users can use Allo to chat with each other without resorting to SMS.

Back to MediaTemple Hosting Wordpress Grid VPS NEW! Blog Home News Tips & Tutorials About Made on (mt) From WordPress to Apple News, Instant Articles, and AMP September 14, 2016 Apple: Send us your content in our special format and we’ll make it available in Apple News and more people will read it and be happy with your brand… wink wink. Google: Link up this JavaScript library and format your content in this special way, and we’ll hook you up in search results… wink wink. Facebook: Format your content in our special way and send it over and it will load super fast and people will love it and be happy with your brand… wink wink. Me: Hey, whatever you want. As long as… It’s not very much work The content’s canonical home is my website I just want people to read and like CSS-Tricks. Ideally I can monetize on (good, curated) sponsored content that makes its way to all these channels anyway. WORDPRESS → APPLE NEWS There is a WordPress plugin: Publish to Apple News. It formats your content automatically into the “Apple News Format” (which is actually JSON!). But in order to actually publish that JSON to Apple News, you’ll need to sign up as a News Publisher. It’ll probably take a little time to get approved, but I imagine any halfway decent blog will be. I’ve seen some pretty garbagey stuff on Apple News so I don’t think the standards are very high. I think it took about a week for CSS-Tricks. Once you’re approved, you manage everything through the iCloud website. You can add team members, upload branding images, set up the advertising, see analytics, and things like that. What you really need in there is your API Key information, which is under Channel Info > API Key. You put those values in the WordPress admin under Settings > Apple News. This settings area also offers a good amount of control over the design of the page. Fonts, colors, spacing, ads, etc. Once you have the plugin configured and you’ve published some articles, you’ll see them in the Apple News dashboard in the WordPress admin. All goes well, you’re on Apple News! ISSUES I’VE RUN ACROSS WITH WORDPRESS AND APPLE NEWS Sometimes I get the error There has been an error with the API. Please make sure your API settings are correct and try again: INVALID_DOCUMENT, INVALID_DOCUMENT and it’s not entirely clear why. Sometimes I even get an error about my API key that makes even less sense. That article just doesn’t go to Apple News. It strips some HTML tags. Namely <pre> and <code>, which can make reading an article with code blocks a litttttle awkward. I’d love to have those turned into something like <p style="white-space: pre; font-family: mono-space;"> and <span style="font-family: mono-space;"> respectively (assuming that’s allowed), but I’m not quite sure how to go about that in a smart way that isn’t altering the core plugin. As a pretty niche site, I don’t see a heck of a lot of audience for CSS-Tricks on Apple News. The past month shows <300 unique viewers and <800 total views. I imagine a big time publisher that is a default choice when setting up Apple News does pretty well. I know I like reading big sites through Apple News. I guess that makes me feel better about the fact that I haven’t been able to figure out how to enable advertising yet. Every time I try to do “Step 1” which is “Enable iTunes Connect” it fails and takes me to the iTunes Connect podcast area with no error or information about what happened. There isn’t really a validator for the Apple News format. Other than that the JSON needs to be valid of course. You can preview articles though, through the official News Preview app. I found this a little tricky to get going. The plugin offers downloads of the .json files for your articles, but if you attempt to drag-and-drop them onto News Preview, you’ll get an “X” and zero useful feedback. I’m not sure how much of this was vital to get it going, but I… Upgraded to Xcode 8 (beta) Renamed the article-xxxx.json into article.json Put it in a folder with all references images at the same level Opened the simulators first, then opened Apple News and went through the basic intro onboarding steps That seemed to work: WORDPRESS → INSTANT ARTICLES There is an “official” plugin for WordPress and Facebook Instant Articles as well: Instant Articles for WP. I found it a bit confusing and ultimately went for Simple Facebook Instant Articles, which simply creates an RSS feed that Facebook can digest into Instant Articles. Like Apple News, you need to Apply for Instant Articles. I was denied the first couple of times I applied, because just like Apple News, my <pre> and <code> tags were being stripped which caused a discrepancy in what appears on the web and what makes it over to Instant Articles. That’s why I ended up switching to the “Simple” plugin, which didn’t strip those, and apparently are perfectly acceptable. Applying involves sending over 5 articles for review and waiting about a week. You can monitor that and do all your IA setup right from your Facebook page under Publishing Tools > Instant Articles. ISSUES I’VE RUN ACROSS WITH WORDPRESS AND INSTANT ARTICLES It took me a little bit to even understand how Instant Articles worked. How do I see them? How do other people see them? I would go to the CSS-Tricks Facebook page (on mobile, Instant Articles, and Apple News for that matter, are mobile device only things) and click a link and it would just load the website. Facebook has an iOS app called Facebook Pages Manager that allows you to preview articles in IA: Maybe it just took a little time or something, but eventually it start working for me. Facebook must do some kind of URL matching like “Does this link I’m about to go to have a matching valid Instant Articles page? Yes? Show that.” The design options are more limited, but I guess that’s because IA works across more mobile platforms than Apple News does. You basically have your choice between Georgia and Helvetica Neue and picking some colors. I haven’t sunk a ton of hours into it, but so far I’ve found the advertising integration very confusing. Every article I have warns me: Default Audience Network Ad Template is Being Used: No custom Ad Template was specified, therefore the article is using the Default Audience Network Template, which allows for automatic ad placement. You can always set up your ad template or disable automatic ad placement to clear this warning. Refer to Ads & Analytics in the Instant Articles documentation for more information. Manually inserting ad code doesn’t stop that error, although I was able to get an ad to show up by manually copy and pasting ad code into the article. I think the “automatic insertion” is probably the way to go if I could get that working. Or altering the RSS plugin to insert some specified code somewhere in the article. WORDPRESS → AMP Automattic themselves have created the official plugin for AMP: AMP for WordPress. AMP is similar to AN and IA in that it’s a special format. AMP is different in that you don’t have to move that format over to anyone else’s system. It just lives on the web as a URL just like the actual article. With this plugin installed and activated, all your articles can have /amp/ appended to the end of the URL and be served up as a valid AMP page: That makes this the easiest of the three to get going. That screenshot above though is on a desktop browser, which isn’t really where Amp is used. Like the others, it’s more of a mobile thing. Google will be (is?) indicating Amp pages in search results. It looks like this: I took that screenshot by using this search URL that Google shared in their announcement. And a GIF of it working:   ISSUES I’VE RUN ACROSS WITH WORDPRESS AND AMP When I was first testing Amp, the plugin seemed to work flawlessly. Any article I looked at with /amp/ at the end of the URL would load right up seemingly without error. But most articles on CSS-Tricks wouldn’t indicate they were Amp pages in the SERPs, and indeed would just load the normal website. A few pages did work though. It turned out that the pages that didn’t work were failing validation. The little tiny dumb little error is that I use <pre rel=""> tags and Amp doesn’t like those rel attributes. I shouldn’t be using those like I do, but alas, I do. I had to write a custom sanitizer in order to remove those rel attributes and get the pages validating. This is exactly the kind of thing I wish I knew how to do in the Apple News plugin in order to get the <pre> tags working at all. It’s also similar to what the the official Instant Article plugin offers as Custom Transformations. THE ARGUMENT IS MUCH DEEPER THAN I PRESENTED AT THE OPENING OF THE ARTICLE I’m aware of that. If I was the Washington Post (or some other big time publisher), the decision to publish in these formats is a much more nuanced choice. They have quite the balancing act to figure out: What will they lose in web traffic and thus web advertising sales? What will they stand to gain in platform-specific views and the advertising sales there? How much effort does it take to do this truly well? What would they stand to gain by an equal amount of effort put into improving the native web experience? What do they stand to lose if they do nothing? These are nearly impossible questions to answer. That’s why it feels like a decently-smart move to go with sponsored content and a low-effort-ish, publish-everywhere, web-first system. Author Chris Coyier Chris is a web designer and developer. He writes about all things web at CSS-Tricks, talks about all things web at conferences around the world and on his podcast ShopTalk, and co-founded the web coding playground CodePen. More posts by Chris Coyier Chris Coyier September 14, 2016 Share: Previous Article Next Article Comments chriscoyier I mentioned that the Apple News plugin didn’t support <pre> tags… that was a big enough problem that I talked to the team behind the plugin and we ultimately got it working. I submitted a pull request: https://github.com/alleyinteractive/apple-news/pull/228 – which shhhhooould make it into the next version. Tadeusz Szewczyk (Tad Chef) It’s sad to see that a blogger who became famous with covering web standards now recommends proprietary formats by large corporations. Just when you thought Microsoft’s IE, Adobe Flash and the likes have been a good lesson… chriscoyier Uh OK, I’m sorry I make you so sad. I write on my *website*, which is just chock-dang-ol-full of web standards. That’s where it’s always been and always will. People can read my site over RSS. Another open standard. Lots of people do. Now it goes out over other distribution channels as well, some of which use open standards (like AMP), or ask for content within the syntax of an open standard (like Apple using JSON and Markdown). Those will come and go, the web will remain. Like the [indie web](https://indieweb.org/) says: Your articles and status messages can go to all services, not just one, allowing you to engage with everyone. Tadeusz Szewczyk (Tad Chef) The Web will remain but how open will it be when even people like you support and promote walled gardens? Carlito I don’t think the comparison between proprietary publishing formats with IE and Flash is fair. The issue is not necessarily with proprietary formats or apps but with the developers/designers who choose practices that aren’t future-proof. Many developers simply disregarded standards and multi-platform compatibility when they built sites and apps primarily for IE and Flash. They chose to forego alternatives that complied with web standards. These proprietary publishing formats don’t get in the way of web standards as it was possible to do with IE and Flash if you weren’t careful. They’re more like add-ons than boxed-in frameworks — you don’t have to compromise SEO, web standards, or future-proofing. The only issue I see is that these formats add yet more layers that developers have to keep up with. It would be great if we only had one common format these companies could use for their services. Perhaps HTML will solve this problem in the future. Tadeusz Szewczyk (Tad Chef) Right now they may be “add-ons” but once enough people are trapped they will become “standard” dictated by the gatekeepers. Jeremy Dawes Interesting read. Seems like the AMP are worth figuring out at least and were it not for the sample code in the posts some complexity is removed. Kasey Moore Great article Chris, brave new world! Your site seems to rely a lot less on ads for revenue but for those who do (like me) these new formats are quite scary. As far as I can tell, AMP seems most open to using existing ad setups while Facebook and Apple are very restrictive. What do you think? Stromwandler a very nice article.

Image: Connor McKenna The iPhone 7 Plus ups the game in smartphone photography. But, asks John Kennedy, will it cost DSLR enthusiasts a night’s sleep? In three generations of iPhones that in shape and design are quite similar, the iPhone 7 series looks familiar but represents a big leap forward. When Apple revealed the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones earlier this month, a lot of focus went into the removal of the traditional headphone jack and Phil Schiller’s use of the word “courage” for doing so was roundly derided afterwards. This is perhaps unfairly so because the context was Apple’s tradition of being first to jettison things like the floppy disk. It was a technological design thing. Schiller was not ruminating on battlefield courage or the courage of existing on this planet in adverse circumstances as many people outside of the rarified confines of Silicon Valley do. Ultimately, the removal of the headphone jack is one of those chapters of Apple history that will be quickly forgotten about and absorbed just like the move to the Lightning connector or the removal of VGA ports from laptop computers. The world moves on. What I was most excited about was the potential of the device as the next best thing to being an actual DSLR camera. Schiller was quite clear on stage that the iPhone 7 Plus – with its dual-camera system, zoom and forthcoming depth-of-field capability – would not be a DSLR replacement, but would give users many of the capabilities. Another curious innovation would be the taptic feedback on the new home button. And, of course, the loss of the precious headphone jack. Look and feel The iPhone 7 generation comes in two sizes – a 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and a 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. Both devices come in five finishes: gold, rose gold, silver, matte black and the shiny new jet black. Apple’s latest iOS operating system was launched just a few days before the new phones hit the shops, bringing nice new capabilities such as more functions in the lock screen, an update to Messages and other apps like Photos, Maps, Music and News, as well as an all-new Home app for the internet of things world. At first glance, the iPhone 7 Plus looks identical to the 6 and 6s generations of iPhone. Obviously, the biggest change is the disappearance of the headphone jack, but when you hold it you will also notice a new antenna design that distributes the antenna to both ends of the device. Turn it around and you will notice the dual-camera system, which is unlike anything Apple has put on a phone. When you touch and interact with the device, the taptic engine is immediately apparent, from when you tap the home button or fingerprint sensor to interaction with functions in apps. My favourite has to be the timer in the Clock app which clicks satisfactorily as you adjust the time and is reminiscent of the combination lock on your bicycle. Nostalgia, eh. Helped by the wider colour gamut, the screen feels much brighter and immersive. In this way, games feel much more vivid and noisy and photographs are brighter and more sharper thanks to the new A10 Fusion chip. The iPhone 7 also comes with two stereo speakers on the front, making it much louder than the iPhone 6. Specs Image: Connor McKenna The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus both feature an entirely new camera system that comes with optical image stabilisation and a larger f1.8 aperture and quad-LED True Tone flash. There are now six lenses behind the main 12MP camera and on the front there’s a 7MP FaceTime HD camera that also boasts image stabilisation. The iPhone 7 Plus comes with the new dual-camera set-up and allows users to digitally zoom up to 10x, which sets it apart from competing smartphones. The iPhone 7’s Retina HD display is 25pc brighter. The most visually arresting feature of the new phone is the brightness of the screen, which also embodies Apple’s 3D Touch capability. The iPhone 7 Plus comes with a 5.5-inch Retina display and 1920 by 1080 resolution while the iPhone 7 features a 4.7-inch Retina display at 1334 by 750 resolution. Powered by the A10 Fusion chip, which is five times faster than the A8 that came on the iPhone 6, the iPhone 7 has also doubled its storage capacity across the board to 32GB, 128GB and 256GB configurations. That missing jack Most commentators have hit out at Apple for bothering to remove the audio jack, claiming any space-saving is minimal. The logic, however, is the jack’s removal frees up space for other things, most notably two stereo speakers on the front to make the device’s volume twice as loud as the iPhone 6s. While there have been reports that one of those speakers is an empty grille, I can’t argue with Apple’s claims that, in term of decibels, it is quite impressive. Using the Lightning-connected headphones that came with the device, I did not notice any loss in quality whatsoever. Apple also thoughtfully included an adapter that allows you to continue to use your trusty old headphones and I have to say listening to audio or watching videos with my own pair of cans through the adapter was fine. I still didn’t notice any decrease in quality. But the diminutive size of the adapter means that it is guaranteed to go missing at some point, unless you keep it attached to your headphones. I had a brief chance to try out the new Apple AirPods, the wireless headphones that come in a little white box like Tic Tacs. It is an impressive sensory experience. You can use one of the AirPods on its own and when you put in a second it immediately detects your ear and both start working in concert. Tap either AirPod twice and it launches a Siri search. The AirPods will have a five-hour battery life and the charging case – which has a nice little heft to it so it won’t get lost in your pocket or handbag – can store up to 24 hours of energy. Will the audio jack be missed? It is a 57-year-old technology and, judging by how fast Apple is removing it, it won’t be mourned for too long. I suspect other manufacturers like Sony and Samsung will also remove audio jacks and replace then with USB-C connectors. The camera The morning sky ablaze. Image taken on iPhone 7 Plus I love photography and I take a good picture, but I have never really had the time or the inclination to learn all the technicalities around things like white balance or apertures or all that jazz. The truth is, most people don’t and won’t. For Apple to make bold claims that its phone is almost as good as a DSLR – while well-intentioned – is still misleading and I’m sure most photographers who are masters of their craft will have a thing or two to say. But you can’t get away from the fact that the iPhone 7 Plus takes sharper and brighter images because the A10 Fusion chip does all that technical work for you. This is also mainly due to the 25pc increase in colour gamut. For lovers of the selfie craze, the fact that the flash is actually built into the HD display of the screen means even brighter pictures in low-light conditions. Apple has increased the camera sensor at the front from 5MP to 7MP, which pushes the envelope in the specs war alright. El Dinger, the cat. The zoom feature on the iPhone 7 Plus takes a little getting used to but it is certainly an improvement that makes it feel like you are using a DSLR rather than actually having one. It is quite smooth and you control it on a dial on the screen to get from 1x all the way up to 10x for photos and 6x for videos. The two cameras work in concert to get the best attributes of both and give you an outstanding picture. The depth-of-field feature is coming as a software update before the end of the year, and I don’t really understand why Apple didn’t bring it to the device right away. This will help users achieve the bokeh effect possible on DSLRs at present. Only one other smartphone maker, Huawei, has already brought a phone to market with this capability of focusing on an object in front and blurring out the background. Waterproofing Image: Connor McKenna The iPhone 7 Plus and its iPhone 7 sibling are designed to be water-resistant. Ostensibly to protect the device from spills and splashes, you can dunk it in a container of water for up to half an hour and it will still function. While I resisted the temptation of putting it in vat of craft Irish cider just for the thrills, opting instead for a jug of water, there is just something unnatural about putting a perfectly good phone in liquid. I didn’t really leave it in the water for long, opting instead for the AV team to experiment on its underwater durability. All I can say is it is still working perfectly. The processor Every year, Apple brings out a new device and announces the most advanced and powerful chip ever in a smartphone. The A10 Fusion chip carries on this tradition. It is a CPU with two high-performance cores that are 40pc faster than the A9 in the iPhone 6s, and two high-efficiency cores that run about one-fifth of the power of the high-performance cores. There is a whole untold story about the electronics aspect of what Apple does and I hope the tech giant sees the sense of telling it one day. Overall, the new processor delivers a graphics performance that is understood to be 50pc faster than the A9 chip and over two times the processing performance of the iPhone 6. What this means is crisp and fast processing and bright, impressive visuals on the screen. But how perfect is perfect? Most users won’t be able to discern these speed increases. Where you really notice it is in the battery. The new processor enables up to two more hours of battery life on the iPhone 7 and one hour extra on the iPhone 7 Plus. Verdict: 4 stars out of 5 Image: Connor McKenna I have to say I was very impressed with the battery life, which keeps pace with the Apple Watch throughout the day despite having larger screen. The size of the iPhone 7 Plus definitely takes a bit of getting used to, especially since I previously used the iPhone SE which is about the same size as an iPhone 5s. While iOS 10’s launch ahead of the new generation of smartphone’s physical arrival means that familiarity blurs the newness slightly, the new devices are a good exemplar for the new OS. I for one am not fazed by the disappearance of the headphone jack. Apple quite helpfully packs a little adapter if you want to still use traditional headphones. I think all the whining about the decision to use the Lightning connector will go away, especially when the Android brigade starts manufacturing USB-C devices that also jettison the old headphone jack. That said, if you are relying on the headphone adapter, keep it affixed to your headphones because, otherwise, you are certainly going to lose it. The water resistance isn’t something I was looking for but having cycled in dense downpours, it is a plus. The A10 Fusion processor makes this a blisteringly fast device, and this is very noticeable in apps and with the camera, while the wide colour gamut gives images a sense of reality that is hard to ignore. The dual camera makes picture-taking flawless and the camera takes notably better photos, especially in low light. All in all, while the iPhone 7 Plus looks identical to the previous two generations, under the hood it is a monster. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are available in silver, gold, rose gold and the new black finishes in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB models starting at €779 Related: Apple, iPhone, photography, smartphones, reviews Editor John Kennedy is an award-winning technology journalist. editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Companies Blackberry squished: former industry leader will no longer make mobiles 29 Sep 201634 Shares Hiring Now Be part of a globally successful team Join us to create the technology of tomorrow Help develop the future of sales and trading One of Europe’s best IT workplaces Gear Apple plans dual camera system for next iPhone generation 8 Aug 201658 Shares Gear Apple says iPhone 7 Plus devices won’t be available in shops Friday 15 Sep 201633 Shares SUBSCRIBE TO OUR E-ZINE Sign up to receive weekly alerts bringing the best of Siliconrepublic.com straight to your inbox.

We covered the iPhone 7 via an unboxing video with a glance at some of the device’s top features, but now we’ll take a closer look at the new Lightning EarPods versus the old EarPods with 3.5mm headphone jack. Sound Quality If you’ve ever used EarPods, you’ll know exactly what to expect with the new Lightning EarPods. Sound quality is the same on the new EarPods as it is on the old versions. I wasn’t able to discern any noticeable differences when comparing the sound of both sets head-to-head in a blind test. Some people may disagree with this, sound is highly subjective after all, but I’m sticking with my belief that the sound quality, if not exactly the same, is too close for my 35-year-old ears to differentiate. EarPods are serviceable listening tools — good enough for a pack-in, but probably not worth buying separately. @JeffBenjam Strictly EarPods? They sound the same to me. Bad. — Quinn Nelson (@SnazzyQ) September 27, 2016 Video walkthrough Subscribe to our YouTube channel for more videos Build Quality The build quality of the new Lighting EarPods is almost exactly the same. The same white shiny plastic is found on the earbuds, along with the same inline remote connected via the same rubber wire enclosure. However, there are two notable differences between the Lightning EarPods and the regular EarPods with the 3.5mm headphone connector: The Lightning connection replaces the 3.5mm connection. This is the most obvious change. It means that new EarPods will only work with Lightning-enabled devices like iPhones, iPads, and the iPod touch (but not iPod nano). Inside the Lighting connector housing is a tiny digital-to-analog converter (DAC), which was revealed during a teardown by a Vietnamese website last week. The Lightning EarPods are a little over three inches longer than the old EarPods with 3.5mm headphone jack. You’ll also notice that, unlike other Lightning cables and adapters, Apple’s new Lightning EarPods have a rubber gasket at the end of the cable where the Lightning connection is. Do you think Lightning EarPods sound better, worse or exactly the same as the 3.5mm version with inline remote? — Jeff Benjamin (@JeffBenjam) September 27, 2016 It’s unclear as to why Apple has incorporated this gasket, but it could be there as a way to protect the small DAC housed within. You’ll notice that the same gasket is found on Apple’s Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Jack Adapter, which we’ll talk about next. Notice the rubber gasket above where the DAC is housed Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Jack Adapter Apple has included a Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Jack Adapter inside every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus box. Many seemed to doubt Apple’s willingness to include such a dongle along with the iPhone 7, but it proved that it was eager to help ease the transition from the old 3.5mm standard. The tiny Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Jack Adapter The Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Jack Adapter is extremely tiny, measuring just a hair over three inches in length. On one end of the adapter is a female 3.5mm jack, and on the opposite end, a Lightning connector. This adapter allows users to connect older headphones to Apple devices lacking 3.5mm headphone jacks. If you own several pairs of legacy headphones, you’ll probably need more than one adapter. Apple sells these adapters for $9.00 on its website, and you can find similar adapters on Amazon. Because Apple sells the adapters so cheap, I’d recommend paying an extra dollar or two for the real thing versus a third-party offering. Using Lightning headphones on older devices Can Lightning EarPods be used on iOS devices other than the iPhone 7? Absolutely. Even devices that have the 3.5mm headphone port can use Lightning-enabled headphones. For example, I was able to listen to music on my iPhone 6s and my 12.9″ iPad Pro using the Lightning EarPods. The old plastic EarPods case vs the new cardboard case And Lightning EarPods aren’t the only Lightning-enabled headphones available on the market. Jordan rounded up a list of Lightning and wireless headphones, and you can find more listed on Amazon. Can you use Lightning headphones and 3.5mm headphones at the same time? If you have a device with both a Lightning port and a 3.5mm headphone port, you may be curious about what happens when you use two pairs of headphones on the same device. You can plug both devices in with no issue, but you will only be able to hear music on one device at a time. Two EarPods plugged in simultaneously The device that you plug in last gets priority. For example, if you’re listening to Lightning EarPods on your iPhone 6s, and you plug in a pair of Audio-Technica ATH-M50xs using its 3.5mm headphone jack, the Audio-Technica’s will handle sound output, and the Lightning EarPods will go silent. What about using the Square Credit Card Reader and other 3.5mm headphone jack peripherals? 3.5mm dongles like the Square Credit Card Reader work fine The Square Credit Card Reader works perfectly fine when connected to Apple’s Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Jack Adapter. Square even notes this as you go about setting up the Square Reader for the first time within its app. Conclusion As controversial as the decision to nix the 3.5mm headphone port was, the Lightning EarPods don’t seem to inspire much debate. It’s the same run-of-the mill pack-in that we’ve grown used to over the years, except it features a different type of connector on the end. What do you think? Do Lightning EarPods sound better or worse? Are you adjusting to life without the 3.5mm headphone port, or do you sorely miss it?

These headphones contain Apple’s new W1 wireless chip, the same chip that will appear in the company’s upcoming, and highly-anticipated, AirPods.

Few outward-facing changes were discovered in the first beta, but it does include Photos support for the new iPhone 7 Plus Portrait feature introduced with the iOS 10.1 beta. Any new features that are discovered in the second 10.12.1 beta will be listed below. macOS Sierra is a significant update that brings features like Siri support, a new storage optimization option, cross device copy paste, auto unlocking with the Apple Watch, and more.

Sonos speakers are coming to Apple's physical and online retail stores. The Play:1 and Play:5 wireless speakers, as well as Sonos Boost, are on sale now in the US via Apple.com and will be posted on global sites in the coming weeks. Starting Oct. 5, the speakers will be in Apple stores, too. As an added bonus (and possible holiday re-gifting idea), those who buy a Sonos system at Apple through Dec. 31 will receive a free three-month Apple Music gift card. //Related Articles Sonos Readies First NYC Flagship Store The move comes after Apple Music launched on Sonos sound systems worldwide earlier this year, allowing users to add up to six family accounts, so everyone in the house can stream their favorite tunes through the smart speakers. Simply select "Add Music Services" on any Sonos controller app, scroll down to Apple's icon, and log in. Apple Music debuted last year, promising subscribers access to their own MP3 collection, along with millions of streaming tracks and Internet radio stations. It currently has 17 million paid subscribers to Spotify's 40 million. Sonos, meanwhile, added Amazon Prime Music to its list of compatible streaming services last year, joining Spotify, Pandora, and Google Play Music.

Apple Music's partnership with Frank Ocean resulted in one of the three major labels curbing the practice of exclusive releases to single streaming services (because of an inspired trick), but to Apple's Jimmy Iovine, it's all been a learning experience -- and one they're going to keep "feeling" out. "We put a lot into this, we've had some real successes, and we always hold up our end of the relationship," Iovine said in a recent interview with Buzzfeed. "We're feeling our way around and seeing what works… Every time we do [an exclusive], we learn something new." What they did learn by striking a deal with Ocean -- releasing video album Endless to fulfill his Def Jam deal, followed by the long-anticipated "proper" album Blonde, via his own imprint -- was that Ocean's label group, Universal Music, did not seem to appreciate its disruptiveness. UMG's Lucian Grainge reportedly took umbrage to the move and informed label heads that Universal was done with streaming exclusives on one platform. Iovine, who co-founded Interscope Records, a division of UMG, has signaled that Apple Music will continue its pursuit of exclusives with the other majors, Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group. "It's Apple's show," he told the site. "As long as Apple's asking me to do what I'm doing, I'm gonna keep doing it." Asked whether he felt digital services were shooting themselves in the foot by relying on exclusives as a key enticer for new subscribers, Iovine urged patience, suggesting that it could eventually be common for people to pay for more than one service (like they do with TV streaming). "A year from today could look extremely different from what it looks like right now," he said. Video is another big initiative for Apple Music, and on Monday night it announce a huge "get" for the first episode of Mary J. Blige's series The 411: Hillary Clinton. Watch a teaser for the show, coming Sept. 30: Like you’ve never seen them before.@MaryJBlige sits down with @HillaryClinton.#The411 Coming September 30th.https://t.co/hbaWqfjJcp pic.twitter.com/P2qpm3h3Pm— Apple Music (@AppleMusic) September 27, 2016   You Can Call Me Al(gorithm) Apple Music recently announced it had 17 million subscribers, compared to Spotify's 40 million. The recent changes to Apple Music brought on by iOS 7 have been well documented, but the addition of two new personalized playlists -- My Favorites Mix and My New Music Mix -- shows that it's paying attention to one of its chief rivals' core strengths: customized, algorithm-based playlists. The fact that the new playlists are algorithmically generated is a first first for Apple Music, which since launching 14 months ago has instead relied on human curators (and the influential Beats 1) for discovery. Apple claims a potential advantage over Spotify in playlisting because in addition to taking into account a users’ listener history on Apple Music, the service also looks at years of iTunes data. "If you gave high ratings to a song or album in your old iTunes library, or just played it a lot more than others, you’ll find that behavior reflected in your My Favorites Mix," the report explained. Apple said more personalized playlists are coming. The revelation comes as Spotify continues to develop and expand its slate of customized-for-you collections. On Tuesday (Sept. 27) the Sweden-based service announced a new, continuously updated series of playlists called Daily Mix, which combines frequently played songs with potential new favorites.

Apparently, the Jet Black color isn’t the easiest to manufacture, and Apple has run into various production problems that still haven't completely been ironed out. DON’T MISS: One of the iPhone 8’s hottest new features was just unveiled by another company Well-connected Apple insider Ming-Chi Kuo said in a note to investors obtained by Business Insider that mass-producing large quantities of Jet Black iPhones is still problematic for iPhone. The Jet Black iPhone model suffers “from a low casing production yield rate of 60-70%” according to Kuo. That means suppliers are producing a lot of metal shells that don’t meet Apple’s quality standards. It’s not clear what the problems are, but it’s certainly not surprising to hear that Jet Black iPhones are harder to make than any other color. The analyst also pointed out a second factor affecting Jet Black iPhone availability: Jet Black is the most popular choice for consumers. A preorder survey conducted by the firm showed that Jet Black iPhones accounted for 30-35% of preorders worldwide. In China alone, almost 50% of iPhones 7 preorders were Jet Black. "The survey offers an insight into iPhone buyers’ tendency to choose models that are aesthetically different from the 6S. Popularity of the Jet Black version indicates that consumers prefer an alternative to the traditional metal finish," Kuo wrote. The survey also showed that 50% of preorders went to the iPhone 7 Plus. Overall, Kuo believes that Apple will sell fewer iPhone 7 models in 2016 than iPhone 6s units in 2015. The analyst said Apple could sell 70 million to 75 million iPhone 7 units this year, up from his previous estimate of 65 million units.

Now, BuzzFeed News sat down with Apple execs Jimmy Iovine, Zane Lowe, and Bozoma Saint John to talk about their experiences within the first year. It starts off with Iovine talking about the goal for Apple Music. He says they wanted to make it easier for artists to release music and for users to have access to music. “That’s the only thing that we know how to do coming from where we’re coming from,” he said. “You use all the tools you have to do that.“ Iovine has used exclusive content to differentiate Apple Music from other streaming services. Since its launch, Apple Music has gained exclusive streaming rights to Drake, Britney Spears, Frank Ocean, and many others. Though, not everyone is on board with what they’re doing. Artists like Kanye West, or Spotify even has spoken out against the idea. Regardless, Iovine says that Apple holds up its end of the deal when it comes to relationships, but is still working out other exclusive deals with labels like Sony Music Entertainment or Warner Music Group. “We’re feeling our way around and seeing what works … Every time we do [an exclusive], we learn something new.” He added that Apple Music would move forward with its pursuit of exclusives from other partners, such as Sony Music Entertainment and the Warner Music Group, noting, “It’s Apple’s show. As long as Apple’s asking me to do what I’m doing, I’m gonna keep doing it.” In the end, Iovine admits that nobody really knows where the music industry will be in a year from now. “A year from today could look extremely different from what it looks like right now,” he said. Zane Lowe, lead of Beats 1 explained that Apple Music has become a safe place for artists to come and release their music. Lowe says it’s not just Beats 1, but is a combination of many other things in the service. “I think Apple Music is the place that helps artists tell their stories. It’s where artists can come and feel comfortable,” Lowe said. “And that’s not just on Beats 1, it’s through the releasing of their records, it’s through our editorial, through content, all sorts of ways.” Bozoma Saint John, head of global consumer marketing for Apple Music explains the thought process and reasoning behind changes for Apple Music. Saying that the team asks, “How are you actually interacting with your music? What are you going to it for? How can we better serve that up?” With iOS 10, Apple Music underwent a major overhaul. Iovine explains that a lot of the changes were built upon — in some cases subtracted from — what they originally introduced. He teases that there are some things they’re working on nobody is going to expect. “We were too ambitious in the beginning — we probably put too much into it,” said Iovine. “But we’re getting there now, one foot in front of the other, and the stuff we’re creating I don’t think anyone is gonna see coming.” If you’re interested, the full piece can be found here.

Anyone can create stickers without no coding experience and users can download them through the built-in Messages App Store. In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to obtain, use and manage Messages stickers like a pro and spruce up your messaging game. Stickers 101 Before we get started, here are some commonly asked questions about stickers in Messages, how they’re created and distributed and more. What are the system requirements for stickers? Sending and receiving stickers requires an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with iOS 10 or later. macOS Sierra users can receive, but not send or download stickers because Messages for the Mac lacks a built-in App Store. Non-iMessage users receive stickers as MMS image attachments. What types of stickers are there? Stickers can be: Static or animated Paid or free Bundled with apps/games or distributed standalone Do I need to pay for stickers? Many high-quality sticker packs will cost you some money. That’s especially the case for branded sticker packs like Disney and Star Wars, for example. People who are reluctant to buy stickers needn’t worry as there are plenty of free sticker packs available in the App Store to get you started. Who can create stickers? Just about anyone can create stickers without any prior coding experience. How are stickers made? Static stickers are made from a set of image files in PNG, JPEG or GIF format that you can create in image editing programs such as Pixelmator and Adobe Photoshop. Animated stickers are made in Apple’s Motion app as APNG or GIF files. To create and submit sticker packs, you will need a Mac and a developer account with Apple, plus know your way around Xcode 8 which you’ll use to turn individual images into a sticker pack that’s ready to submit to the App Store. A great starting point to familiarize yourself with the whole sticker creation process is Apple’s Creating Stickers for iMessage webpage. How are stickers distributed? Stickers are distributed as downloadable sticker packs in the App Store. Sticker packs can be standalone downloads or bundled with apps and games. Standalone stickers put an icon on your Home screen and can be normally re-downloaded through the App Store’s Purchased section like any other iPhone or iPad app. Standalone sticker packs are labeled with “Only for iMessage” in the App Store. Bundled stickers are distributed as part of apps or games and don’t have their own Home screen icon. Removing a container app/game from the Home screen also uninstalls its underlying sticker pack(s). Apps bundled with stickers are labeled with “Offers iMessage App” in the App Store. Any installed sticker packs can be managed via the Messages App Store’s Manage tab. Can I receive stickers if I don’t have them installed? Your friends and family can send you stickers that you do not have installed on your device and they will be displayed normally, and vice versa. You must, however, install a sticker pack before you can send any of its stickers. If you’d like to, you can easily download the underlying sticker pack right from any received sticker in the conversation. Can non-iMessage users and older devices see stickers? Static stickers sent as is to non-iMessage users (folks on Android or other non-Apple platforms) are delivered via MMS as image attachments. Animated stickers are also delivered via MMS to non-iOS 10/macOS Sierra devices but appear for the recipient as static images that don’t animate. A sticker cannot be attached to a specific bubble for contacts who don’t use iMessage. Stickers you stamp on chat bubbles or photos load one after the other for iOS and Mac users who haven’t upgraded yet to iOS 10 and macOS Sierra. How to download sticker packs Sticker packs can be downloaded in the Messages App Store. You can browse featured sticker packs, see all stickers packs in the store, browse sticker packs by category and use the search feature to find ones you wish to add to your chats. In addition, it’s easy to download stickers your friends send you in conversations with just a few taps. Dowloading stickers other people send you When someone sends you a sticker you don’t have installed in Messages, you can easily see its originating sticker pack and download it from the App Store with a few taps. Downloading stickers sent alone in chats 1) Open Messages on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch and tap a conversation in the list which contains a sticker you would like to download. 2) If a sticker was sent standalone and not stamped on chat bubbles, tap and hold it, then select “From [STICKER PACK]” in the popup menu. 3) You’ll be taken to the sticker pack page in the Messages App Store. Tap the Buy or Get button to download the sticker pack to your device for use in Messages. Downloading stickers from chat bubbles 1) Open Messages on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch and tap a conversation in the list which contains a sticker you would like to download. 2) If a sticker was stamped on top of a chat bubble, photo or another sticker, tap and hold it, then choose Sticker Details in the popup menu. 3) On the next screen, tap the View button next to the sticker pack you’d like to download. 4) The sticker pack’s listing on the Messages App Store pops up in an overlay. Tap the Buy or Get button to download it to your device. As the screenshot above tests, a “Sticker by” label may appear below the chat bubble for stickers not installed on your device. Tapping the hyperlinked name of the sticker pack instantly takes you to its page on the Messages App Store. Downloading stickers in Messages App Store 1) Open Messages on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch and tap a conversation in the list or create a new one. 2) Tap the Apps button (it resembles an App Store icon) to the left of the text entry field to access the Messages app drawer. 3) Hit the App Shelf button in the bottom left corner (it resembles four ellipses in a grid). 4) Tap the Store button. 5) The Messages App Store appears in an overlay, allowing you to: Browse featured sticker packs Browsing sticker packs by category See all sticker packs in the App Store Find specific sticker packs 6) When you find a sticker pack you wish to use, tap the Buy or Get button to grab it. If this is a bundled sticker pack, it will be downloaded along with its container app/game. To have Messages automatically use any sticker packs bundled with apps/games you download, set the toggle Automatically Add Apps under the Messages App Store’s Manage tab to the ON position. As you download or update apps, their sticker packs appear under the New and Updated heading of the Manage tab so you can instantly see both your recently added sticker packs and those that have been updated with new content. The Manage tab’s title and the Store button in the Messages App Shelf will use a badge to denote the number of iMessage Apps and stickers that have been updated. Browsing Featured sticker packs Tap the Featured tab to see a list of stickers, iMessage Apps and other downloadable content for Messages that was hand-picked and curated by Apple’s editorial team. Seeing all sticker packs in the App Store To browse all of the stickers that are currently available in the Messages App Store, tap the Categories tab, then tap the All Stickers sub-category. Browsing sticker packs by category To narrow the listing to a specific category, tap a desired category in the list of built-in sticker categories on the Messages App Store: Animals & Nature Comics & Cartoons Eating & Drinking Emoji & Expressions Fashion Gaming Kids & Family Places & Objects Apple may add new sticker categories over time. Finding specific sticker packs Then tap the magnifying glass icon in the top left corner of the Messages App Store to find a specific sticker pack you want. Include the word “sticker” to make your query more relevant (i.e. “Star Wars stickers”, “summer stickers”, “sports stickers” etc.) and to exclude iMessage Apps and other unrelated content from your search. With your favorite sticker packs downloaded, it’s time to learn how to use them. How to use stickers in conversations 1) Open Messages on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch and tap a conversation in the list or create a new one. 2) Tap the Apps button (it resembles an App Store icon) to the left of the text entry field to reveal the Messages app drawer at the bottom of the interface. 3) You can now: Select a previously used sticker in Recents Choose a specific sticker from one of your installed sticker packs Both methods are described right below. Picking a sticker from Recents By default, the app drawer displays your recently used stickers, iMessage Apps and other third-party Messages content you have downloaded to this device. Swipe left or right to flip through your recently used stickers and other third-party content installed on this device until you find a recently used sticker you’d like to send. Tap the sticker to send it standalone in a thread or tap and hold to peel and stamp it on top of chat bubbles. To take your Recents fullscreen, tap the arrow pointing upward in the lower right corner. While in fullscreen mode, you can also tap a sticker to send it or tap and hold to peel it, which will exit the fullscreen mode so you can drop the sticker in your conversation. To cancel dragging the sticker, drop it on the Messages status bar at the top. Selecting a specific sticker pack To choose a specific sticker pack, tap the App Shelf button in the bottom left corner which looks like four ellipses in a grid. You can now swipe between pages of downloaded stickers and other third-party Messages content. Tap a sticker pack to see its stickers, then tap a desired sticker to send it, or tap and hold to peel it and stamp it on top of chat bubbles. To browse the chosen sticker pack fullscreen, tap the arrow pointing upward in the lower right corner. 4) Use stickers in conversation in four different ways: Send it in a standalone message Stick it to a bubble Stamp it on a photo Place it on another sticker You can also rotate and resize a sticker before it’s sent. Sending a sticker in a thread Just tap a sticker to add it to the conversation. You can accompany the sticker with an optional message before you tap the Send button. Placing a sticker on top of a bubble You can peel a sticker and stick it anywhere on the chat bubble: just tap and hold a sticker, then drag it over any chat bubble in your conversation and let go. Stamping a sticker on top of a photo Tap and hold a sticker you wish to use, drag it over a photo in the conversation and let go. The sticker must be dropped within the photo’s boundaries. Rotating a sticker Tap and hold a sticker you wish to use and drag it over a bubble, photo or another sticker in the conversation, but don’t let go. Tap and hold with another finger, swipe up or down to rotate a sticker, then let go. Resizing a sticker Tap and hold a sticker you wish to use and drag it over a bubble, photo or another sticker in the conversation without letting go of the finger. Now tap and hold with another finger anywhere on the screen and drag left or right to resize a sticker, then let go to release it. How to delete stickers from conversations Any stickers stamped on top of chat bubbles, photos or other stickers in the conversation can be removed at any time by following the instructions below. 1) Open Messages on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch and tap a conversation from which you’d like to remove certain stickers. 2) Scroll within the conversation to find a chat bubble, photo or another sticker that you stamped a sticker on top of, then tap and hold that sticker. 3) Tap Sticker Details in the popup menu. 4) A new screen pops up, listing all of the stickers stamped on the selected item. Swipe a sticker you wish to remove from the conversation, then tap Delete. Unfortunately, deleting a sent sticker doesn’t remove it on the recipient’s end. To delete a sticker that was sent as a standalone message (tapped rather than peeled), you’ll need to use a different method which is described further below. Deleting stickers sent standalone If you sent a sticker as a standalone message, delete it like you would a chat bubble. 1) Open Messages on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch and tap a conversation in the list. 2) Tap and hold a message bubble with a standalone sticker you’d like to delete, then choose More in the popup menu. 3) Tap the Delete button. 4) Tap Delete Message in the popup menu to confirm the operation. The standalone sticker will be removed from your chat. How to reorder your sticker packs 1) Open Messages on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch and tap a conversation in the list. 2) Tap the Apps button to the left of the text entry field. 3) In the Messages app drawer, tap the App Shelf button in the bottom left corner that looks like four ellipses in a grid. 4) Tap and hold any icon until the icon start shaking, then drag the icon to a new position and let go of the finger. To move the sticker pack to another page, drag its icon to the edge of the App Shelf and wait a moment until a new page swooshes into view, then drop the icon onto a desired position. 5) Press the Home button to finish reordering the icons. How to delete sticker packs you no longer need You can delete sticker packs in two different ways: Delete standalone sticker packs from the Home screen or through the Manage tab of the Messages App Store. Delete bundled sticker packs independently of their container app in the Manage tab of the Messages App Store or delete the container app itself. 1) Open Messages on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch and tap a conversation in the list. 2) Tap the Apps button to the left of the text entry field. 3) In the Messages app drawer, tap the App Shelf button in the bottom left corner that looks like four ellipses in a grid. 4) Tap the Store button. 5) The Messages App Store appears in an overlay. Tap Manage to continue. 6) To uninstall a sticker pack, slide its switch to the OFF position. Bundled sticker packs like Canva, Alto’s Adventure and Jetpack Joyride can be disabled and re-enabled at any time as long as their container app is installed on your device. 7) Tap Done to finish making the changes. Standalone sticker packs you delete are instantly removed from the Manage tab. Disabling sticker packs which are bundled with apps/games won’t remove them from the Manage tab when you flip their switch to the OFF position. This lets you re-enable any bundled sticker packs through the Manage tab as long as their container app is still installed on your device. Delete sticker packs even faster: tap and hold an icon in the Messages app drawer and hit the “x” in the upper left corner to remove the sticker pack from Messages. Deleting a bundled sticker pack won’t automatically remove its container app from the device. However, deleting an app or game that came with sticker packs will also remove its stickers from Messages and delete the sticker pack from your device. How to re-download sticker packs You can re-download sticker packs at any time through the App Store’s Purchased section in the case of standalone sticker packs. Bundled sticker packs don’t appear inside the App Store’s Purchased tab, but will re-appear in Messages once you re-download the app or game that package it. Re-downloading standalone sticker packs Like third-party keyboard, standalone sticker packs are packaged as native apps that you can re-download at any time through the App Store’s Purchased tab like you would any other app. 1) Launch the App Store on your device and tap the Updates tab. 2) Tap Purchased at the top. 3) Find a sticker pack in your list of previously downloaded or purchased items, then tap the cloud icon to re-download it to this device. Or, use the Messages App Store’s search to find and re-download the sticker pack. Re-downloading bundled sticker packs Because bundled sticker packs are packaged inside app/game binaries, they don’t show up in the App Store’s Purchased section. Not to worry: re-downloading the actual app or game in question will also re-add the switch for its sticker pack to the Messages App Store’s Manage tab so you can easily toggle it. In addition to the regular App Store, the Messages App Store can also be used to find your previously downloaded apps and games with bundled stickers. And that’s all, folks!

I actually learned a couple things in there Y2J I’d just like to point out that while you are promoting your own app, you actually commented on the article then did your self-promotion, and I personally appreciate that. So many people just spam comment sections advertising their own crap and don’t actually contribute to the conversation. It’s the little things lol. Anyways, gonna give your app a try now! c0nath Thank you so much for trying the app. I see the promotional comments everywhere, too and I tried not to be like those. Writing this comment myself felt a bad at first, but since my iOS dev efforts aren’t for profits, that made me feel a little better. So did you – thank you. Y2J I tried it out and I really like it! I think it’s a really cool concept and well thought out. I have one question/suggestion: is there any way to make it so if you upload a GIF, it still stays animated instead of becoming static? I’m not sure if that’s possible, but I think it’s the only thing missing c0nath Thank you so much for the feedback. I’m already working on animated stickers and will be adding GIF/APNG support through an update. Agneev Mukherjee This article just made my day, still going into my Reading List though.

Rumours, UK release date, price, specifications and features The iPhone 7 is hot off the production lines, but that hasn't stopped gadget lovers from speculating about a new model by JASPER HAMILL 27th October 2016, 10:37 am Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments Apple fans are a mixed up bunch. On the one hand, they are fiercely loyal and wouldn’t even dream of sullying their lives with products from their fave firm’s inferior competitors. We took a brand new iPhone 7 and threw it down the toilet to see if it is waterproof Getty Images 1 But even when they finally get their hands on the latest iGizmo, they find themselves dreaming of a dalliance with a newer, younger model. And so, despite the fact the iPhone 7 has just been released, we'd care to bet a few fickle Apple fans are already wondering what the fruity firm's next gadget will be like. Of course, we can't really answer that question with any certainty at this stage, but we can certainly give you a few ideas about to expect when the next iPhone rolls out of Apple's Cupertino headquarters. Here's what we think the next iPhone might be like (but don't hold us to it). New IPhone 7 video offers side-by-side comparison with IPhone 6s When will the iPhone 8 be released? This is a fairly easy question, as iPhone tend to come out in September every year. Next year will be the 10th anniversary of Apple's first smartphone, so you should probably expect a massive change. The tech giant will probably have something big up it's sleeve - and we're not just talking about the larger iPhone Plus models. Woman strips and covers herself in car oil to win a new iPhone What will the iPhone 8 be called? Good question. If Apple follows its recent naming scheme, it'll be called the iPhone 7S. But that seems unlikely when it's such a big release, so we're suggesting it'll just be called iPhone. Apple has form on this, having called its third tablet "The New iPad" to simplify its name. It has been claimed the Apple iPhone 8 will come in three different 'flavours'. Apple unveils waterproof and wireless iPhone 7 with no headphone jack How much will it cost? Again, we're going to bet it'll be roughly the same cost as the iPhone 7, which is slightly more expensive than last year's model after the pound took a Brexit bashing. So that's about £599 for the basic model and about £719 for the larger Plus model. Can't stop constantly checking your phone? This handy iPhone hack will help you break the habit What features will the iPhone 8 have? Frankly, we don't know. There are rumours it will have a new OLED display, which will be an improvement on the current screen. It's also expected to ditch the home button once and for all as well as introducing wireless charging. We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

 The 'Apple of China' just released phones with technology rumored to be in the next iPhone Antonio Villas-Boas Sep. 27, 2016, 11:41 AM 78,415 facebook linkedin twitter email print The "Apple of China" just came out with two phones with "embedded home buttons," a similar feature that's rumored to be in Apple's 2017 iPhones. The ultrasonic home button on Xiaomi's new mi 5s smartphone. Xiaomi/YouTube On Tuesday, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi showcased the capacitive "ultrasonic" home buttons on its new devices, the Mi 5s and Mi 5s Plus, in a new video. It's a similar concept to the capacitive ultrasonic technology Apple is looking into for its own iPhone home buttons, as shown in these patents discovered by Patently Apple in April, which gives us an idea of what it would look like and how it would work. Home buttons with ultrasonic technology, which essentially means embedding a fingerprint sensor under the smartphone's front glass panel, come with two main benefits over the current-gen optical scanners used in the iPhone 7. For one, Apple says ultra-sonic technology is the "most accurate" for reading fingerprints. It also describes how ultra-sonic technology is less affected than optical scanners by dirt and residue from your finger. Ultra-sonic technology works by emitting ultrasound waves through glass when a finger is placed on the sensor, and the sensor reads the "alteration in wave patterns of your fingerprints," according to Apple's patent. Rumor has it that embedding the home button underneath the front glass surface will make for a completely smooth surface on the 2017 iPhone that's uninterrupted by the dips and grooves from the current home button. It's said to complement the phone's "all-glass display," where the entire front surface comprises of a display without borders or bezels. However, unlike other rumors about the 2017 iPhone, Xiaomi's phones have a recessed home button, much like the home button on the iPhone 7. The iPhone 7's home button. TechDaily/YouTube Note, however, that there's no indication in Apple's patent that the company would specifically use ultra-sonic technology in the 2017 iPhone. Additionally, whether or not Apple will use capacitive ultrasonic technology in the iPhone's home button is still purely speculation. We'll likely learn more about Apple's plans for the 2017 iPhone, which is said to be a radical design departure compared to past iPhones, as we get closer to next September.

By Jason Murdock September 27, 2016 17:31 BST OSX Trojan used by suspected Russian hacking team exposed by Palo Alto Networks TarDisk A notorious cyberespionage group with suspected links to Russian intelligence has developed a complex piece of malware designed to infect computer systems running Apple OSX, according to cybersecurity researchers at Palo Alto Networks. The hackers, dubbed Sofacy Group by the California-based experts, have been given many titles over the years by analysts including Fancy Bears, APT28 and Pawn Storm. It is the same group believed to have infiltrated the Democratic National Committee (DNC) earlier this year. In an in-depth blog post, Palo Alto explained how the Trojan – called 'Komplex' – does not exploit an Apple security flaw but instead takes hold via extremely targeted spearphishing tactics. In this instance, the malware was used to infect victims in the aerospace industry. The payload is purposefully designed to hide in a 17-page Russian-language PDF document that describes the Russian Federal Space Program's projects between 2016 and 2025. According to the researchers, it appears legitimate on first inspection and will even open on the Mac's 'preview' mode. Once the intended victim opens the link to the PDF, the file is capable of downloading additional files to the infected machine, executing and deleting files and interacting with the system shell – which is a user interface used to access the operating system directly. While reverse engineering the Komplex payload, the researchers said they noticed a number of coding overlaps including similarities with an OSX Trojan revealed by BAE systems last year that relied upon an alleged security vulnerability in MacKeeper software. Referencing the highly-targeted nature of the attack. Ryan Olson, intelligence director at Palo Alto's Unit42 cybersecurity team, told Information Week: "The person who received this file was expecting to get this file." He added that the hackers typically use Windows tools and that this is the first major strain the firm has analysed that targets OSX. However, at least one other major security team has uncovered evidence that the state-sponsored group – which has targeted everyone from the German parliament to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) – has infiltrated Apple devices in the past. Sofacy Group targeted users via spearphishing, experts saidPalo Alto Networks Crowdstrike, which probed the initial DNC cyberattack back in July, previously said that Sofacy has developed a slew of exploits since its inception in the mid-2000s including specific malware for Linux, OSX, IOS, Android and Windows phones. "[Fancy Bears] has been responsible for targeted intrusion campaigns against the aerospace, defence, energy, government and media sectors," said Dmitri Alperovitch, CTO of CrowdStrike, in a recent blog post. "Its victims have been identified in the United States, Western Europe, Brazil, Canada, China, Georgia, Iran, Japan, Malaysia and South Korea." In a blog post, the Palo Alto team said the development of the Trojan showcases a "continued evolution" toward multi-platform attacks. "The Sofacy group, also known as APT28, Pawn Storm, Fancy Bears, and Sednit, continues to add to the variety of tools they use in attacks," the researchers noted. "In this case, targeting individuals in the aerospace industry running the OS X operating system."

Zach Epstein BGR NewsSeptember 27, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share When Apple unveiled its new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus earlier this month at its bug press conference in San Francisco, it was immediately clear that the larger iPhone 7 Plus model is the star of the show this year. Both new phones are impressive, of that there is little doubt. But the bigger iPhone packs a class-leading new dual camera setup that is arguably the best smartphone camera the world has ever seen. Among the new features shown off by Apple was a "portrait mode" setting that creates a "bokeh" effect on photos similar to what you might see in photos captured by a DSLR. In fact, Apple has mentioned DSLR cameras a few times when discussing the new iPhone 7 Plus camera. Is it fair to mention Apple's new dual lens camera system in the same breath as a DSLR, or is Apple just overhyping its latest iPhone? It's time to find out. DON'T MISS: One of the iPhone 8’s hottest new features was just unveiled by another company First of all, let's briefly recap the nifty new tech Apple used in its iPhone 7 Plus camera. In a nutshell, the phone includes a standard 12-megapixel wide-angle camera and a second 56mm telephoto camera positioned right next to it. This accomplishes two main things: first, the user can tap a zoom button to switch to the telephoto lens as the primary camera, which effectively provides 2x optical zoom on a smartphone camera. That in itself is pretty awesome, but Apple's upcoming iOS 10.1 update also includes a new feature called portrait mode. Portrait mode allows the user to capture a photo that uses the wide-angle lens as the primary lens, but also integrates depth data from the secondary telephoto lens to keep the subject in focus while blurring the background. The resulting photo features the appearance of a photo that was captured by a DSLR camera. The question is, does the quality of these portrait mode photos actually approach DSLR quality or is this just a gimmick? The answer, it would appear, lies somewhere in the middle. Portrait mode is hardly just a gimmick, but the quality of photos captured by the iPhone 7 Plus doesn't really compare to the quality of photos taken on a DSLR camera. Reddit user "xenonsupra" posted a comparison shot that does a good job of illustrating the differences in a single pair of pictures. Here's a shot captured by the iPhone 7 Plus with portrait mode (beta) enabled: rs77on9More And here's the same shot from a Nikon D800: bc9te3oMore The difference is significant — check out both full-size images at this link. There's no question that the photo from the 7 Plus is impressive, but there's simply no way to achieve DSLR levels of clarity, color reproduction and light in a tiny little smartphone camera module. The iPhone 7 Plus gets closer than any phone camera has before it, but the technology still isn't quite there. Want to see a more extensive comparison?

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Halfway done: Apple Valley water reclamation plant 50% complete Tuesday Sep 27, 2016 at 9:02 AM Sep 27, 2016 at 9:02 AM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — The subregional water reclamation plant under construction at Brewster Park is approximately 50 percent complete, according to Victor Valley Wastewater Reclamation Authority spokesman David Wylie. Wylie told the Daily Press construction on the subregional, which will be capable of producing one million gallons of recycled water per day, is scheduled to be completed in August. “Water should flow to the Apple Valley Golf Course approximately at the same time as the completion date,” Wylie said. “The crews are currently working on the masonry at the primary building and underground piping throughout the project site.” Crews began installing 470 feet of purple pipe near the golf course, along Rancherias Road, about three weeks ago, according to Wylie, who said new, permanent asphalt will be laid within the next three weeks. In March, that purple pipe will be connected to an existing pipeline near the corner of Highway 18 and Rancherias; the existing pipeline leads directly to the subregional plant, Wylie said. In a video presented at last week’s State of the Town address, VVWRA General Manager Logan Olds said water for the facility will come from residences and businesses within the town. Solids in that water will then be separated at the facility before the water moves on to be used for outdoor irrigation at the golf course and various parks within the community. “The benefit to reusing the water produced from this facility,” Olds said in the video, “means that we are not taking additional water supplies either from the delta or from the groundwater to water those parks and golf courses.” VVWRA broke ground on the facility last September, and town officials have touted its use as a crucial part of Apple Valley’s “sustainable future.” It remains unknown, however, if the town and VVWRA will end up in a legal battle upon completion of the facility. The town’s water provider — back when it was named Apple Valley Ranchos Water Company — contended in a 2014 letter that implementation of the project “would constitute a duplication of service” and harm both “Apple Valley Ranchos and its customers.” Liberty Utilities officials told the Daily Press last week they have not threatened to sue the town over the project; however, that same letter — penned by Kevin Brogan of Hill, Farrer & Burrill LLP — said that both the town and VVWRA would be subject to “substantial liability … if Apple Valley Ranchos is forced to litigate the issue, which it hopes it will not have to do.” In response at the time, the town “debunked claims” listed in Brogan’s letter and Town Attorney John Brown said the effort “appears to be an attempt to stop the project and deprive the public of millions of dollars in grant funding” for the project. VVWRA has received $21 million in grants for the project — and for a twin facility in Hesperia — which accounts for 26 percent of the nearly $81 million cost for both sites, according to a previous Daily Press report. Nearly $13.2 million is set aside to help fund the project within the town.   Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254. Follow him on Twitter @DP_MatthewCabe.

Chinese Company OnePlus is hoping to change that however. You’ve possibly never heard of them, but with the help of O2, you should soon know the name very well. Who are they? OnePlus is a China-based company. The smartphone manufacturer was founded in December 2013 by Pete Lau and Carl Pei. Why haven’t I heard of them before? Up until earlier this year, OnePlus handsets were only available via a cumbersome direct-to-consumer online invitation-only system. Effectively this meant a lot of the brand’s visibility relied on word of mouth and people not being lazy when it came to buying mobile phones. Seemingly not a great way to do business, OnePlus has abandoned that model. So, now what? In the UK, OnePlus are partnering O2 exclusively and the company’s smartphones will be ranged across O2’s UK stores.

The first phone to feature in this partnership is the OnePlus 3. It will be available both online and in-store from Thursday, September 29. Prices start at £28 per month. That includes 500MB of data and no upfront cost. Alternatively you can pay £35.50 a month for unlimited minutes and texts with 3GB of internet. The phone is also available to buy off-contract. Better yet, if you have an issue with the phone you will be able to go directly to the O2 store where they will assist you on the matter. Is it any good? OnePlus pride themselves on releasing powerful smartphones at lower-than-expected prices.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Health Photos Video Search Search Hillary Clinton serenaded by Mary J Blige in strange Apple Music advert September 27, 2016 19:31 IST By Twitter/ Apple Music Close Embed <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.in/tv/embed/41408" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> Rnb singer Mary J Blige has inadvertently become the butt of jokes after serenading presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton. The No More Drama songstress burst into song in a preview for her sit-down with the Democratic candidate on her Apple Music show, The 411. In a teaser clip posted to Apple Musics Twitter page, Blige is seen singing passionately about race and police brutality with her eyes closed as a stoic Clinton watches. The song features the lines: If an officer stops you, always be polite and never ever run away, Promise mama youll keep you hands inside. Is it a gun? Is it a knife? Is it a wallet? This is your life. It aint no secret/you can get killed for living in your American skin. At the end of her impromptu performance the 45-year-old reaches for Clintons hand and searches her eyes for answers. There is no denying the intense moment as the politician initially struggles to respond to the display. The clip aired hours after Clintons first televised debate with Republican candidate Donald Trump in her race to claim the White House. Bliges one-to-one singing session divided fans caught up in election fever. While some applauded her for using her platform to evoke change, others claimed that the intense moment was cringeworthy. The most awkward video on the internet....Why Is Mary J Blige singing to hillary, one critic claimed. The intimate one-on-one interview with Clinton is the first episode of Bliges show The 411 and will air on 30 September. Another clip shows her asking the former first lady how she intends to rectify the problems facing America if she makes office. Back in March, the long-time Democratic supporter, debuted her single, Strength Of A Woman, during a Clinton fundraiser. She also performed at President Obamas inauguration back in 2008.

The strategy appears to be paying dividends for the service as Drake’s Views album has become the first album to hit one billion plays on Apple Music. Views was initially released as a timed exclusive for Apple Music. Views was first made available to Apple Music subscribers on April 29th. It remained an Apple Music exclusive for less than a week as the album arrived on Spotify and other services just five days later, but when you’re as big as Drake, making fans wait five days for your new music can prove to be quite hard. The announcement that his album is the first to hit one billion streams on Apple Music comes straight from Drake himself who posted a picture with Apple CEO Tim Cook, Apple Music head of content Larry Jackson and senior vice president of internet software and services Eddy Cue. All of them are grouped around a plaque which commemorates this big milestone. To celebrate the achievement, Drake has released a “visual companion” on Apple Music that’s called Please Forgive Me. It’s a short film that stars Drake with songs from Views serving as the soundtrack. 🍏🍎 Thank you to everyone.

By James Billington September 27, 2016 17:03 BST Close Embed Feed iPhone 7 review: Return of the king or time to hand over the crown? IBTimes UK <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/20834" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> Apple's new Jet Black colourway for the iPhone 7 was something chief design officer Jony Ive pored over during its unveiling, getting fans excited about going back to black. However, for those trying to order the glossy option it's been about as hard to find as its headphone socket as suppliers are finding it difficult to manufacture. So what's wrong? It's clear from the lack of availability that Apple is finding the new finish, which uses a completely new manufacturing technique, a tricky customer to make and have come across some unexpected issues. According to Mac Rumors, industry analyst KGI says there's a global shortage of the Jet Black models as the high-gloss finish is failing to meet Apple's standards, resulting in a number of handsets rolling off the assembly line needing to be scrapped. It's reported that "30-40% of units do not pass Apple's quality standards and must be retooled," said Ming Chi-Kuo of KGI. The new Jet Black finish was described in detail during the launch with Ive oozing about the new nine-step process from rotational 3D polishing to anodization and an ultrafine iron particle bath to create a seamlessness between materials for a "pristine mirror-like surface". The iPhone 7 Plus shows off the Jet Black, high-gloss finish.Apple Within hours of the iPhone 7 unveiling however, fineprint was found on Apple's product page alerting consumers that the new finish is prone to scratches and it's advised it should be used with a case. Pre-empting the popularity of the Jet Black option and the potential for another scandal like Antenna Gate or Bend Gate seen with previous launches it could be a case of Apple protecting itself from imminent backlash. So, in the quest for shiny glory, it appears Apple may have misjudged how tough it is to produce this new high-gloss chassis. IBTimes UK got some hands-on time with the Jet Black model at Apple's headquarters in London and can confirm the Jet Black finish feels likes a completely different phone to the aluminium backed rest of the range. It looked very slick and felt great in the hand but ironing out those manufacturing issues is essential, which is why impatient consumers are better off biding their time. With reports of some Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus units trickling into stores they're slowly finding their way to consumers but the race to unveil by 7 September seems to have put a strain on suppliers.

Vine Report HOME U.S. SCIENCE/HEALTH WORLD ENTERTAINMENT TECH LIFE&STYLE Subscriptions Home TECH iPad Mini 5 release date, rumors: big changes coming, cancellation rumors still exist Jude Abastar Sep 29, 2016 9:15 AM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (REUTERS/Toru Hanai)The Apple iPad Mini is held up for display in front of an Apple Store in Tokyo, Japan. If Apple makes the crucial decision of continuing the iPad Mini line of tablet devices, then there has to be major changes with both hardware and software for the next iteration, the iPad Mini 5. There are stories all over the web that the fifth-generation smaller sibling of the iPad is no longer hitting store shelves due to the prospect of Apple marketing the more fancied iPad Pro, but are these stories really true? For the most part, the root of the cancellation rumors of the iPad Mini 5 is the simple fact that Apple does not talk about its upcoming devices. The truth is no single word has come out of the mouths of anyone from the company saying that the device has met its production end. However, it also holds true that Apple has not confirmed that the iPad Mini 5 is indeed in existence and is being developed. Notwithstanding all the final curtain rumors, there still is hope that the iPad Mini 5 will eventually get a release for the simplest of reasons — a lot of people still want one. According to Macworld, the current version, iPad Mini 4, was released in September of last year with major changes and improvements compared to its predecessor. And with that in mind, this year's version has to be equipped with major upgrades as well. This is probably the reason why Apple isn't really in a rush to make an announcement since it wants the new tablet to be on top of other midrange tablet competitors. A couple of months back, renowned analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the Cupertino-based company is expected to release three new iPad models next year, but the sad thing is there seems to be no emphasis on the inclusion of the iPad Mini. Well, this could mean one of two things: first, it's because the iPad Mini 5 will be released this year and not next year, or second, maybe the device is really no longer in Apple's plans.

Britta O'Boyle16 November 2016Phones Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment The rumour mill loves an Apple story. It doesn't matter if it's so far fetched it will never see the light of day, or whether it is something that might actually happen, it churns them all out anyway. With the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus having both now launched, and no sign of the iPhone 7 Pro, all heads have turned to the next iPhones. Next year's models will mark a decade since the launch of the original iPhone so you can only imagine how much of a twist the mill will be getting its knickers in over the coming months. Here is everything that has been speculated about the 2017 iPhones so far. Remember to take everything with a pinch of salt because as usual, absolutely nothing has been confirmed, nor will it be until late next year. Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: Name Expected to be called iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus Traditionally, the next iPhones should be called the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, but given they are the anniversary models, we suspect Apple will move straight to iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, skipping the incremental upgrade models. That's the assumption we are making for the sake of this feature anyway. There has also been talk of a third iPhone, though it currently doesn't have a name. Apple iPhone 8 Pro anyone? Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: Release date 6 September is our educated guess for a launch date Pre-orders expected to start on 8 September if 6 September launch happens The Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus both launched on 7 September 2016, while the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus debuted on 9 September 2015. Both launch events were a Wednesday, both were two days after Labor Day in the US and both were the last day of consumer electronics show IFA, which Apple notoriously never attends. If Apple follows the same release pattern, the next iPhones could be announced on Wednesday 6 September 2017. Labor Day is on 4 September and IFA will run from 1 to 6 September in 2017, meaning a 6 September launch date would allow Apple to steal back some of the limelight from its competitors who do attend the Berlin show.  We are just guessing for now, but if we are right, we'd expect pre-orders to start on 8 September, and the devices to hit shelves on 15 September. Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: Design All-glass model has been rumoured Entirely different design to iPhone 7 expected Premium ceramic model for 10th anniversary? The Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus brought a few changes to their design over the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus. The antenna bands on both were removed across the rear, the headphone jack was removed in favour of Lightning only and stereo speakers, and new colours were introduced in the form of Black and Jet Black. The Plus model also offers a dual-lens camera setup on the rear. The iPhone 7 Pro, which has yet to see the light of day, was rumoured to feature the same Smart Connector found on the Pro line of iPads and a dual-camera. Of course the dual-camera ended up appearing on the Plus model, as we mentioned, but the iPhone has yet to see a Smart Connector. There haven't been any substantive rumours surrounding the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus's design as yet, though an all-glass model was thrown about the speculation field. Glass would at least allow for wireless charging, a feature that has also been rumoured for the next iPhones. We wouldn't be surprised to see a premium ceramic finish for the 10th anniversary iPhone though. Apple used the material for its Series 2 Apple Watch Edition model and OnePlus has previously used ceramic as a finished for its X device. It could be that Apple launched the Jet Black iPhone this year as a test bed to see how people took to a glossy device, with the aim to introduce a more premium option next year. The Wall Street Journal reported that the 2017 iPhone will look totally different to the iPhone 7. Apparently the Touch ID fingerprint sensor will be built into the display because Apple's design chief, Jony Ive, wants the iPhone to look like "a single sheet of glass". We'd expect the headphone jack to remain missing, the stereo speakers to remain intact, and we'd also expect a dual-lens set up on the rear of at least one of the devices.   Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: Display Same size screens expected, plus addition 5.5-inch model Edge-to-edge OLED display reported Resolution increase rumoured We'd expect the Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus to stick with the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes, as to go smaller would encroach on the iPhone SE's territory and well, much larger would basically put the iPhone in iPad mini land, almost. As we said though, there has been talk of a third iPhone, which is thought to be 5.5-inches too. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities claims the third device will have a redesigned OLED display, while the others will have an LCD display. The Wall Street Journal claims Ive is considering a curved, edge-to-edge OLED screen for the 2017 iPhone. A few years ago, a rumour like this would have been dispelled almost immediately, but curved displays on smartphones have become popular over the last couple of years so it's not too surprising to hear Apple might also be considering this route. No doubt 3D Touch will be included in next year's devices in some form too, probably more advanced than it is currently and we'd also love to see Apple Pencil compatibility, at least on the Plus model.  Will Apple up the display resolution for the iPhone 8 models? Who knows. A 2K AMOLED display was reported for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but it never appeared so perhaps Apple was holding out for the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, or the iPhone 8 Pro if Kuo's predictions are accurate.  A Quad HD resolution on a 5.5-inch display would put the pixel density at 534ppi, compared to the iPhone 7 Plus's current 401ppi, while the smaller model would offer 635ppi, compared to 326ppi. A switch to AMOLED would also deliver a greater contrast ratio for brighter, punchier colours. Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: Camera Hoping to see same capabilities across both models Two 5.5-inch models expected to have dual camera Smaller model predicted to miss out on dual again Apple's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus both offer great camera capabilities, like the iPhones that have gone before them. The iPhone 7 has a 12-megapixel rear snapper, while the iPhone 7 Plus has a dual camera setup with two 12-megapixel snappers, one wide angle and the other telephoto. Both devices have a f/1.8 aperture, along with optical image stabilisation and a quad-LED True Tone flash. The front camera is 7-megapixels on both devices with an aperture of f/2.2. There haven't been many rumours to indicate what we might see on the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, but we'd like to see two models offering the same capabilities so a dual-setup on the both options would be welcomed. After all, opting for the smaller smartphone shouldn't mean losing out on some of the fun features. Smaller hands want to be able to create bokeh images too. That said, analyst Kuo believes the two larger phones predicted for 2017 will feature the dual-lens camera setup, while the smaller device will miss out, again. Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: Hardware A11 Fusion processor with embedded M11 motion coprocessor predicted Same storage options expected Wireless charging rumoured The new devices will no doubt come with a new processor, which if tradition dictates should be called the A11 Fusion with an embedded M11 motion coprocessor. We'd also expect the same storage models as the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, meaning 32GB, 128GB and 256GB, as well as the same colour options.  Of course, we'd love to see a bigger battery as always and it wouldn't be too surprising to see the Smart Connector introduced to the next iPhone, allowing for the transfer of both data and power at the same time. Whether we will see any other hardware additions on the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, like an iris scanner as found on the now-defunct Samsung Galaxy Note 7, will remain a mystery for now. As we mentioned though, wireless charging has been speculated after it was reported that iPhone manufacturer Foxconn is working on a new system. Apparently it will only be implemented if the yield rate can be deemed profitable though, and it's also been claimed the technology might only appear on the larger iPhone. Another report, also talking about wireless charging, has suggested the iPhone would be able to be charged from a distance of up to 15ft however. This is a technology being developed by Energous and there have been signs to suggest it is working with Apple, though no confirmation as yet. Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: Software iOS 11 Apple always launches its new iPhones with the latest software build, which is always previewed at WWDC in June. For the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, the software will be iOS 11, though we currently know nothing about what it might bring with it. Like every yearly software update, there will be several new features and functions but we will have to wait a few more months to find out what some of these will be. Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: Conclusion Nothing is certain at the moment, except for the fact that Apple will launch a new iPhone, or iPhones, probably in September next year and these models will mark a decade since the original iPhone. Whether the anniversary will mean a whole new design for the iPhone is not yet known, but we can expect it to offer power enhancements and a new software build at the very least. We wouldn't be surprised to see a standard and Plus model again, as well perhaps a premium, or special edition anniversary model or finish that we think will be ceramic. For now, keep checking back as we will update this feature whenever we see a new rumour appear or a new leak. Apple iPhone 7 vs iPhone SE: What's the difference?

hypebot digital music and the music business Home D.I.Y. Music Tech Social Media Music Biz More News MusicThinkTank Never Miss A Beat! Stay Connected With Hypebot.com « Is Live Music About To Have It's Own Napster Moment? OneRepublic Ventures Into Virtual Reality Today | Main | A Streaming Service's Metamorphosis: Radical.FM Founder Shares His Startup Journey » Apple Music Best Practices For Musicians: They Updated, So You Should Too As a kind of followup to their earlier 'best practices' piece, The Daily Rind takes use through the updated Apple Music iOS 10 interface, with an refresher on the best practices to adopt with this new interface. ______________________________ Guest Post by Tricia Arnold: Senior Director, Retail Marketing on The Orchard's The Daily Rind Last week, Apple released its new iOS 10 and with it, the new version of Apple Music we’ve been waiting for. Never ones to wait when we can dive in full steam, we’ve gone through its sleek new interface and updated our Apple Music Best Practices accordingly. These tips are as fresh as the new app. Images Don’t be a microphone — make sure your artist images are updated. Any artist for which an image has not been submitted appears on the service as a microphone. To get yours up there, use The Orchard Workstation’s Artist Builder tool. Select the correct artist profile and upload your images using the following naming convention: Gallery1Image1.jpg, Gallery 1Image2.jpg, and so on. This is key; improper naming will mean your images are not supplied to Apple. Note the following image specs carefully: Artist Images 1200×1200 pixels minimum size (2400×2400 recommended, but do not upscale) 72 dpi minimum 1:1 aspect ratio (square) JPG or PNG file type RGB colorspace Artist Gallery Images 1200 pixels on the shortest side (2400 pixels recommended, but do not upscale) 72 dpi minimum No restrictions to aspect ratio JPG or PNG file type RGB colorspace Once uploaded, please notify your client manager and send them this completed iTunes Image Submission Form. This is the only way they will know they are there, so do not forget this step! Of course, all images should be clear and of the highest quality possible. They should not be advertising any content, pricing or website, or include any iTunes or Apple logos. If you prefer to share your images with us through an FTP, please contact your client manager. Connect Guess what? Connect has come out of hiding. No longer hidden on another page, Connect is now more integrated into artist pages and the “For You” section of the service. Now more than ever, Connect is a great way for artists to communicate directly with their fans right in the service. Think about engaging content fans will want to see — snippets of new tracks, candid backstage or tour bus shots, behind-the-scenes videos, cool playlists, you name it. If your artist is not yet set up to use Connect, you can contact your client manager and we’ll get you a verification form to fill out. Once Apple has processed the verification, the email addresses assigned as administrators to the artist page will receive an email directly from Apple with further instructions for activating the Connect profile. You can start posting by following these handy instructions from Apple and referring to our FAQs — have fun! Videos Finding videos on the all-new Apple Music has never been easier. If you’re making a video, you should consider sending it to Apple Music too. What’s more, you can do this directly via The Orchard Workstation. The new Apple Music offers many more video feature opportunities, so let your client manager know when you’re delivering priority videos. Toolbox A good resource to use for all your iTunes and Apple Music marketing needs is their handy Toolbox. It’s a one-stop shop for badges, links and widgets. Be sure to bookmark it for easy access for all your iTunes and Apple Music marketing needs. Linking You can drive traffic to both iTunes and Apple Music. Remember that the links pulled from iTunes now open in Apple Music by default. If you want to link to the iTunes store, the easiest way to obtain the correct link is by searching for the artist, album or song in Link Maker. Be sure to use the drop-down “Media Type” menu under the search bar to indicate the service to which you want to link. If you’re linking to Apple Music (not iTunes) in your Facebook, a cool playlist widget is automatically embedded. If you are a part of Apple’s affiliate program and would like to use your affiliate token, access Link Maker through your PHG Console instead. Click on Tools, scroll down to General Tools and click on Link Maker. This will ensure the links you create include your affiliate token. Social Media If you’re linking to iTunes and Apple Music, be sure to tag their social media handles. The correct Apple Music social media handles are below: Apple Music on Twitter: @AppleMusic Apple Music on Facebook: AppleMusic Apple Music on Instagram: @AppleMusic As a reminder, Apple no longer uses “iTunes” social handles for any music social activity, so be sure to tag the handles above and specify “Apple Music” or use #AppleMusic in social media copy. Listen on Apple Music, Buy on iTunes The service may have a new look, but the marketing badges do not. The “Listen on Apple Music” and “Buy on iTunes” badges may be used in your marketing communications promoting content on either of the services, including email, digital advertising, apps, websites, etc. Download the “Listen on Apple Music” badge here and the “Buy on iTunes” badge here. Most communication should display either the Apple Music or iTunes badge but both may be used for certain high profile communications. Any usage of this kind would need to be approved by Apple Music. Messaging Be sure to use clear messaging when promoting your music on Apple Music or iTunes. When driving fans to Apple Music, opt for words such as “listen,” “hear” or “playing” rather than “stream” or “streaming.” When driving fans to iTunes, be sure to use clear wording that you are driving to the download store such as “Buy on iTunes.” You can combine the messaging, but you’ll want to distinguish the offers: “Listen to <artist’s> new song on Apple Music or buy it on iTunes.” Widgets Any music on Apple Music can be turned into a preview player that can be embedded on any website. To use this feature, copy and paste your playlist URL into this playlist widget generator; it will construct an embeddable widget with simple options to adjust the size to provide a good fit on any site, desktop or mobile. Please note! The playlist is sharing content that is behind the Apple Music pay-wall and will therefore only feature 30-second song previews of all the tracks in the playlist unless the user is a logged-in Apple Music subscriber. It’s a good way to give people a taste of your music to encourage them to check it out further. Sharing Okay, this one isn’t a Best Practice, but have you noticed that you can now send your recently played tracks on Apple Music via chat / text on your iPhone? Check out this fun new way to share all your latest jams with friends and loved ones (or to tell that ex what you really think of them).   Related articles How To Master Your Call-To-Action & Video Presentation On Facebook How To Claim Your Apple Music Connect Profile Now Revamped Apple Music, iTunes 12.5.1 Released - hypebot 8 Takeaways For The Music Industry From Wednesday's Apple Event - hypebot Apple Music Directs Independent Artists To CD Baby Apple Music Lacks A Core 5 Music Biz Stories You Missed Over The Long Holiday Weekend - hypebot Posted by Guest Post on 09/27/2016 in D.I.Y., Indie Labels, Marketing, Music Tech, Social Media, Streaming & Cloud | Permalink Comments Apple Music Best Practices For Musicians: They Updated, So You Should Too As a kind of followup to their earlier 'best practices' piece, The Daily Rind takes use through the updated Apple Music iOS 10 interface, with an refresher on the best practices to adopt with this new interface.

Apple maintained its year-ago score of 84 out of 100 in the survey, consisting of interviews with 3,500 customers chosen at random and contacted via email in June to share their experiences with recently purchased products like Macs and iPads. Samsung, in its second year of ASCI tracking, trailed just one point behind Apple with a score of 83 out of 100, a 6.4% rise compared to its 2015 score. Much like the smartphone category, the personal computer industry has become a race between Apple and Samsung for both market share and customer satisfaction. Apple and Samsung dominate market share in the tablet category, but the two companies take divergent views on the future of tablets. Apple continues to add laptop-like functionality to iPads, while Samsung sees tablets as additional devices for entertainment and browsing that complement—but not replace—laptops.Amazon, which manufactures affordable Kindle tablets but not traditional PCs, finished third in customer satisfaction with an 80 out of 100 score, while PC makers Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Toshiba rounded off the list with scores between 73 and 78. ACSI's scores are calculated using its so-called cause-and-effect econometric model, which it says is based upon survey-measured inputs of customer expectations, perceptions of quality, and perceptions of value. While Apple's customer satisfaction remains characteristically strong, many customers are getting impatient with the current state of the Mac lineup. Beyond the 12-inch MacBook, our own Buyer's Guide lists all Mac models as Don't Buy due to the lack of updates in several hundreds of days. iMac: 350 days. MacBook Pro: 497 days. MacBook Air: 568 days. Mac mini: 712 days. Mac Pro: 1,013 days. The latest word is that new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models with USB-C could launch as soon as October. Tags: Samsung, ASCI [ 197 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) Roobun 7 weeks ago apple makes computers? Rating: 59 Votes iMi 7 weeks ago Not surprising at all. iMac is by far the best desktop computer on the market, the MacBook is great, and hopefully new MacBook Pros will continue that trend. I would add a personal anecdote. I will never forget when Apple replaced a two year old notebook because it broke down for the 4th time. They literally called to say "We're sorry. This isn't the kind of experience we want for our customers." Then they asked if it would be okay to replace this machine with a brand new one - two generations ahead - and I said... Ah, yeah? Yeah, that would be fine. LOL Rating: 25 Votes chrismail627 7 weeks ago Pretty impressive how Apple stayed on top even with old hardware. Nevertheless, it really is time to refresh the Mac line. Apple cannot become complacent. Rating: 20 Votes TMRJIJ 7 weeks ago If they had given us new MacBook Pros, Samsung would be eating their dust right now.

If Samsung has reached this high in user satisfaction, Apple should definitely start focusing more on their Mac lineup if THEY want a high level of user satisfaction. Rating: 13 Votes randyhudson 7 weeks ago Put me in the 16%. Apple's new trackpads and keyboards suck. The quality control in the OS has been in decline since 10.9. They have removed discrete graphics from mac minis.

Travel News & Deals National park photo ops: Head for the very back to snap a photo of this Alaska train TRAVEL Travel News & Deals It's an apple upgrade in Oak Glen after two drought-starved years Apple upgrade Los Angeles Times Growers and gift shop owners are thrilled that the apple crop has bounced back. Growers and gift shop owners are thrilled that the apple crop has bounced back. (Los Angeles Times) Chris Erskine The apples have bounced back in Oak Glen, one of Southern California’s premier growing regions. Trees are full and shops are full of fresh fare after two years of disappointing harvests tied to the drought. “We’re good,” Nina Foster, vice president of the Oak Glen Apple Growers Assn., said by phone.  “This year, we have a bumper crop.” The area’s traditional apple season runs from Labor Day to late November. Foster said that the mile-high town, 90 minutes from Los Angeles, enjoyed a very strong opening weekend and big crowds have been steady along the five-mile loop of orchards, shops, galleries and restaurants. Last weekend, a line 50 deep waited for barbecue at Los Rios Rancho, 39611 Oak Glen Road, and pick-your-own apple orchards and pumpkin fields were packed — though the apples seem to be having a better season than the pumpkins. A farming region dating to the 1860s, Oak Glen is a moist, cool pocket surrounded by desert. Its pioneer heritage is on display all year but peaks in September and October, with hayrides, festivals and cider mills. Hikers are encouraged to spend part of the day viewing the ponds and oak forests of Wildlands Conservancy, next to Los Rios Rancho. Another popular stop is Snow-Line Orchard, 39400 Oak Glen Road, which now offers a winery and tasting room. Directions from Los Angeles: Take the I-10 east. Exit Oak Glen Road. Left on Oak Glen Road for several miles to the loop of 30 stores, orchards and assorted other businesses.

(AP Photo/Richard Vogel) Share Written by Mike Murphy September 27, 2016 Earlier this month, Apple unveiled the new (and slightly improved) Apple Watch. The new version is waterproof and comes in new materials, but it still has roughly the same size, battery life, and screen quality. Even still, Apple is looking to bring new functionalities to the second version of the watch, according to a report from Bloomberg—some of which are rather difficult to believe. The Apple Watch has a battery life of about 18 hours, meaning that most people tend to leave their watches charging on their nightstand overnight. The watch even has a nifty feature that turns the watch into a tiny alarm clock as it charges. But according to Bloomberg, Apple is working on a way to use the watch to track users’ sleeping habits, which many other fitness trackers on the market do. However, those devices last for days at a time on a single charge. Given that the Apple Watch doesn’t last through the night, and also is considerably bulkier than the average FitBit or Jawbone tracker (and probably uncomfortable to sleep in), it’s not entirely clear how Apple intends to leverage the existing watch into something that could track sleep. If you were to use it as a sleep tracker, you’d need to charge it during the day, meaning you’d lose its other functions during your waking hours. That would seem to run counter to why you bought the device in the first place. (The company wasn’t immediately available for comment.) The report also suggested that Apple is working on other new software features for the watch, such as a fitness tracker that measures how quickly your heart rate rises and falls during and after exercise, as well as new applications for its health-tracking data system, HealthKit. Apple launched HealthKit in 2014, and has hinted in the past that it wants to use the information its wearables and smartphones can collect to inform doctors about their owners’ health. CEO Tim Cook has said the company would potentially be open to creating another wearable—not the Apple Watch line, but something simpler—that the company could run through government compliance tests, and could theoretically allow patients to share data from a personal device with their doctor. As Bloomberg points out, the global health-care industry is a roughly $8 trillion market. A slice of that could definitely help Apple with slowing iPhone sales and underwhelming reviews of its newest gadgets. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search
Sections Machines Discoveries Space Futures Gaming Earth Videos About en de es fr it nl pt The VICE Channels Share Tweet Motherboard Motherboard Watch Sections Machines Discoveries Space Futures Gaming Earth Latest Videos Documentaries Interviews Machines Discoveries Space Futures Gaming Earth Follow Motherboard Newsletter Image: Trent Dennison/YouTube Geniuses Say Apple Knows About iPhone 6 ‘Touch Disease’, Won't Admit It Publicly Written by Jason Koebler Staff Writer September 27, 2016 // 10:30 AM EST Copy This URL Earlier this month, I reported that the touchscreens of thousands upon thousands of iPhone 6 Plus devices are failing due to an engineering flaw. And while Apple the company has yet to publicly acknowledge that these phones are breaking under normal use, employees who work at Apple’s retail stores tell Motherboard that the company is well aware of the flaw and has left its in-store “geniuses” to be the bearer of bad news to customers. Two Apple store employees, one current and one who recently quit, contacted Motherboard after we initially published our story about iPhone 6 Plus touchscreen problems. They both told me that they have been informed both explicitly by their supervisors and subtly by the company’s internal repair tracking system that so-called “touch disease” is a known issue. I go into detail in my earlier story about what has caused iPhone 6 Plus touchscreens to stop working, but, essentially, an engineering flaw associated with “bendgate” allows the phone’s logic board to flex ever-so-slightly whenever the phone is pulled out of a pocket, or put into a case, or is dropped. After thousands of flexes, the phone’s two “Touch IC” chips become unseated from the logic board, causing the touchscreen to work intermittently or not at all. Often, the problem causes flickering grey bars to appear along the top of the device’s display. The flaw, which repair experts previously told Motherboard is due to a fundamental issue with the design of the iPhone 6 Plus, was fixed for the iPhone 6S. "They told employees they knew about the problem, but in a sense they’ve left us out to dry and take the brunt of the abuse." Apple’s in-store repair system uses an app called “Mobile Genius,” which requires geniuses to categorize each type of broken device that comes into a store. Phones with broken touchscreens, would be identified in a dropdown system as “Display -> Flickering/Flashing,” or a Multitouch issue, according to a former genius who quit the company earlier this summer. After selecting that option, “the system would immediately lock out any attempts for repair and, if the customer was out of warranty, would quote a $329 replacement cost,” the genius told me in an email. (Motherboard is withholding the identity of the current and former employees we spoke with because all Apple employees sign a nondisclosure agreement when they begin working at the company.) If you work for Apple and have information relating to iPhone 6 Plus touchscreen problems, please email me: jason.koebler@vice.com or use our SecureDrop. My PGP key is here and I am available on OTR as well. If this has happened to your phone and want to tell me about the experience, email me or tweet at me. “Standard operating procedure was, at first, to replace the display,” he said. “Most units were under warranty, so there was no real problem for the customer. Soon after, this practice was banned within Mobile Genius and the only option we were left with was a full unit replacement—an in-system pop up told us to not even ATTEMPT a screen replacement. Right then it was obvious that Apple knew that there was a problem and, having eliminated the possibility of the display being the issue, they knew it was the logic board chipset.” These are what the two IC Touch chips look like. Image: iFixit “Apple engineers were keenly aware of this trending issue, as Apple was very anal about making sure repairs were categorized correctly,” he added. “Furthermore, Apple has an in-house newsletter called RetailMe that they used to disseminate information. We were specifically instructed via this portal to replace devices exhibiting symptoms of Touch Disease.” Another current employee confirmed this account and told me his team was “informed it was a known issue.” He said that in his store, he regularly deals with customers who are angry that what seems like a simple screen issue will cost them $329 to get repaired. READ MORE: The Hell of Owning an iPhone 6 Plus With 'Touch Disease' “They told employees they knew about the problem, but in a sense they’ve left us out to dry and take the brunt of the abuse,” the current employee said, adding that he gets “low-key nervous about seeing an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus with any screen-related issue.” Out-of-warranty iPhone 6 Pluses can be replaced for that $329 fee, but the employees I spoke with told me that sometimes if a device is newly out of warranty, it can be replaced for cheaper or for free. They told me that individual Apple store managers are allowed to override the cost at any time, but said that corporate headquarters keeps track of which stores are replacing phones for free: “They take note of how often you do these overrides, and sometimes we have conversations about trying to limit them,” the current employee told me. "I’ve had to finesse my way through so many conversations and give people the runaround to try to keep them from getting mad at me" Dozens of articles have been written about iPhone 6 Plus touchscreen issues, and independent repair professionals who deal with the issue say it is by far the most common problem associated with iPhone 6 Pluses. Those repair professionals are also adamant that touchscreen problems are showing up on phones that have not been mistreated, dropped, or bent. There is currently a class-action lawsuit pending against Apple related to the issue, and more than 6,500 people have contacted the law firm that filed it. Still, Apple has said nothing publicly about so-called “touch disease,” which harms both the company’s customers and its employees. Apple did not respond to a request for comment to my original story or this one, including questions about the protocol detailed by the Apple employees Motherboard spoke to. “It puts me in a bad mood, having to look someone in the eye and say that their phone is out of warranty and it’ll be $329 to replace it sucks,” the current employee told me. “Part of the reason I’m looking for a new job is because of this situation. I’ve had to finesse my way through so many conversations and give people the runaround to try to keep them from getting mad at me.” Topics: apple, iphones, iphone 6 plus, Apple Geniuses, apple store, repair, Right to Repair, iFixIt, machines, short circuit Contact the author by email or Twitter.

Wang September 27, 2016 Aha. (Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP) Share Written by Amy X. Wang September 27, 2016 Playlists, playlists, playlists. Every major music streaming service these days is touting the originality of its personalized, curated content (however ironic that is). Spotify’s Discover Weekly feature, one of the first custom-playlist offerings to hit the market, has been applauded for its intricate algorithms that scrutinize users’ unique listening histories in order to recommend similar songs and artists. But Apple Music—though a latecomer to music streaming, having only launched last summer—may have a leg up, of sorts. And weirdly, that’s because of iTunes, the clunky, oft-hated music storage platform of the 2000s that so many people had to use when the most popular way to get music was in the form of digital purchases. In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Apple Music executives revealed that the (yes, potentially embarrassing) listening habits/histories of people who used to use the now-nearly-outdated platform are actually being carried over to Apple Music, in the form of its new playlists that came with the recent iOS 10 update: Apple claimed a potential advantage over similar algorithmically personalized playlists, including Spotify’s Discover Weekly and Pandora’s Thumbprint Radio: deep historical knowledge of individual users’ tastes and habits, based on years of data carried over from iTunes. If you gave high ratings to a song or album in your old iTunes library, or just played it a lot more than others, you’ll find that behavior reflected in your My Favorites Mix. One person on Reddit said Apple Music’s new playlist was “truly magical, it brought so much nostalgia, I actually wonder how it works,” prompting many to agree with him. Said Apple Music head Jimmy Iovine in the BuzzFeed News interview, “I don’t know how to do this any other way, except to help make really good music… That’s the only thing that we know how to do coming from where we’re coming from. You use all the tools you have to do that.“ Apparently, those tools include years of handy data collected from a different, older product. Any advantage to be victorious in the music streaming wars.

The new model has Apple HomeKit integration meaning you can control it using your voice and Siri, or through Apple’s Home app. It also packs in geofencing technology, so it can detect when you’ve left the house or are on your way home, based on the location of your smartphone. When the last person leaves for the day, the Lyric T6 will automatically switch to an energy saving mode and then kick into action when it detects you’re within a predetermined radius. Which Honeywell heating system is best for you? Evohome vs Voice controlled vs Single Zone Thermostat If you know you’re going to be in and out the house a lot and don’t want your boiler to be constantly stopping and starting, you can set seven day or daily schedules. You can also control the T6 when you're out and about and even on holiday via Honeywell's Lyric app. As long as you've got an internet connection, you can control the temperature of your home to help save money on energy costs. Because the Lyric T6 supports Apple HomeKit, it can be included in any of your ‘scenes’, so can, for example, come on the same time as some connected lights and a coffee machine when you get home so you can sit down and relax. It can also let you know if the temperature inside your home becomes extremely hot or cold and even learn heating cycles to automatically adjust the temperature without you having to worry. The Honeywell Lyric T6 is available now in two variants: the T6 has to be fixed to a wall while the T6R is a wireless version and can be placed anywhere around the home. Both are available online or through plumbing and heating installers. Sections Smart Home Honeywell What is Google Home, how does it work, and when can you buy it?

Here’s a breakdown: Story Continued Below ONC’s fight against fees, data blocking: It’s hard for the government to control private business practices, like fees for upgrades of already expensive EHR software. But ONC took a step to help doctors and hospitals help themselves prevent being handcuffed by health IT vendor practices. The answer: Contracts. HHS’s health IT office published a 56-page guide to contracting that addresses controlling data, fostering interoperability and host of other issues that at least some feel has hamstrung health IT from advancing. — ONC said “gag clauses” don’t promote good safety or security. “Nondisclosure provisions and other intellectual property protections should not be broader than reasonably necessary,” it said. — “The recommendations found in the guide also promote connectivity and protect against data being blocked — such as by unanticipated connection fees, restrictions on data exchange, or contract terms that prevent users from reporting and sharing information about the performance of their EHRs,” ONC head Vindell Washington and CMS acting administrator Andy Slavitt wrote in a blog post. Health IT Playbook: ONC also debuted a web-based guide to help doctors and hospitals with EHR selection, implementation and design, security, patient engagement and a host of other issues. In a world in which doctors raced to buy and start using EHRs, the Playbook can help address questions on health IT. More here from the ONC blog. — Without guidance, “Physicians can find it difficult to keep up to date on the changing requirements for and breadth of information on health IT,” said Steven Waldren, director of the American Academy of Family Physician’s Alliance for eHealth Innovation. A note from the president: President Obama signed a short letter proclaiming the progress, potential and — yes — even the need for more advances in health IT. Read the letter here. eHealth tweet of the day: Rep. Doris Matsui @DorisMatsui: Great news as we continue to transform the #HealthIT landscape and maximize the benefits of tech in healthcare! #NHITweek Retweeted ONC @ONC_HealthIT: Today we are launching TWO NEW tools to help clinicians & hospitals get the most out of #healthIT. http://ow.ly/zoWV304zmdj #NHITweek https://twitter.com/DorisMatsui/status/780464504622682112 Welcome to Tuesday Morning eHealth where there was no real mention of health care, Obamacare or candidates’ health during the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The closest ehealth mention we got was Trump's notion that a 400-pound hacker could have caused the hack of Democratic campaign officials. Is that who is behind all these health care breaches?

APPLE TAKING MORE STEPS INTO HEALTH: REPORT: Apple is interested in turning its fitness-tracking devices into software that will give doctors advice on how to best treat patients, according to a Bloomberg report Monday. “The system could chip away at two problems that plague the industry and have stumped other specialist firms in the field: interoperability — allowing data to be transferred from hospital to hospital across different databases; and analysis — making it quick and easy for physicians to extrapolate salient information from mountains of data,” Bloomberg’s Alex Webb reports. For what it’s worth: Apple has been lobbying Congress on “issues related to mobile devices and health, regulation of mobile medical applications, and privacy and health data,” since early last year, according to disclosure reports. GAO TO OCR: STEP UP YOUR GAME: The auditor hit HHS fairly hard Monday, outlining a number of areas it is lacking in oversight of the industry’s cybersecurity preparedness. The findings: HHS guidance doesn’t address how HIPAA covered entities can tailor security to target specific needs identified by NIST, HHS’s Office for Civil Rights hasn’t fully started a HIPAA audit program, and OCR doesn’t follow through to make sure issues it identified have been fixed. More for Pros here. The Hill’s reaction: HHS “needs to continue to implement the recommendations in this report as well as the new Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, which requires the department to give hospitals and doctors clear information on the best ways to safeguard patients’ information, and also to require the agency to make it clear who is responsible for dealing with the rising cyber-attacks against the health care industry,” Senate HELP Committee Chair Lamar Alexander, who requested the report last year, said in a statement. DISPATCH FROM FDA/CTA DIGITAL HEALTH TECH EXPO: FDA and the Consumer Technology Association held a get-together for innovators interested in exploring health products for consumers Monday. We were on hand and share some insights: New age oversight: FDA commissioner Robert Califf believes new technologies offer new challenges and new opportunities to verify the effectiveness of health care. Califf is enamored of the possibility of combining randomization and real-world data. “Dominant companies are using randomization, just as a normal part of business,” he said, referring to Google’s and Amazon’s practices of testing website tweaks randomly on consumers who visit. With the proliferation of EHRs and other health data, you could envision similar real-world testing. New oversight form?: Jeff Shuren, the head of FDA’s device center, mused about a new structure for software regulation: a pre-clearance of sorts for software modifications. A company with a solid record in a certain area might receive a pre-clearance, allowing it to push software notifications automatically without the need for regulatory approval. The company would still need to gather data about the effectiveness of the changes, just to make sure there weren’t any dangerous tweaks unleashed into the world. — Bakul Patel, the FDA’s digital health director, told Morning eHealth that the idea represents an attempt to think about how to structure regulation for a new, digital age. With software, he said, “the volume [of changes] is different, products are different, so does it make sense to think of it on manufacturer rather than product level?” — Health IT Now’s Robert Horne praised the idea, noting that the agency has been encouraging software modifications with other steps. “While we want to ensure that updates do not pose a risk to patient safety, requiring a full review means necessary software updates could be stalled for months,” he said. — FDA regulatory attorney Bradley Merrill Thompson: “I gather his idea is something along the lines of a company achieving a certification of competence to do certain validation testing or other quality assurance tasks, as a way to reduce the number of submissions for modifications. That’s actually a very clever thought.” HOUSE MOVES VA RECORD-SHARING BILL: As expected, the House passed via voice vote a bill (H.R. 5162) that allows the Department of Veterans Affairs to disclose certain medical information to non-VA providers that care for veterans. It now needs patient authorization to do under current law. Here’s one argument: “I think the VA just wants to come up with better numbers for interoperability and they are throwing out the Veterans right to privacy in an attempt to improve their numbers,” privacy and open-source advocate Nancy Anthracite wrote Morning eHealth. “The VA has a system for veterans to grant permission to share information. They need to promote its use, not do this.” ADVAMED WEIGHS IN ON UDI — AND ADVOCATES PROTEST: AdvaMed, the medical device trade association, has come out against including unique device identifiers in claims forms. AdvaMed made its argument in a Sept. 23 letter to HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell, arguing that including such data in claims forms wouldn’t serve billing purposes and would give providers and researchers an incomplete perspective on devices performance. Instead, the association prefers the inclusion of UDI data in electronic health records. Advocates aren’t happy: Ben Moscovitch of Pew Charitable Trusts said that EHR and claims data “are both essential to improve the data on device performance, and each provides significant and complementary benefits." — Rep. Bill Pascrell, another advocate, was not pleased. “Capturing the UDI on the claims form occurs downstream of device companies and requires nothing additional of device manufacturers,” he said. BLOCKCHAIN OF THE FUTURE: ONC has published all of the submissions to its call for how to use blockchain technology in health care. FITNESS TRACKER FOR CITIES: The Obama administration is giving $80 million in grants to study, among other things, technology “that will allow the city and public to instantly obtain block-by-block data on air quality, noise levels, and traffic,” according to a fact sheet. It could, in theory, provide real-time information asthma patients about air quality on their city block. Chicago has installed 500 outdoor sensors that aim to do just this. WHAT WE’RE CLICKING: The Wall Street Journal chats with HHS CTO Susannah Fox. Also from the Journal, tech companies are developing home diagnostic devices to help to capture vital signs of pediatric patients. New Jersey Senate panel moves on telemedicine bill. The Center for Connected Health Policy releases an updated breakdown of state telemedicine law. Tips, comments, suggestions?

Blige Sings Amadou Diallo Tribute During Apple Interview With Hillary Clinton News Desire Thompson @desire_renee | September 27, 2016 - 10:10 am Share < br />this article: CREDIT: Screengrab Mary J. Blige and Hillary Clinton are two people you wouldn’t put in the same room, but Apple Music did. Mary is seen singing to the Democratic presidential nominee in a teaser for their upcoming interview in an effort to be creatively political. READ Mary J. Blige Boards Season 3 Of ‘How To Get Away With Murder” Shared by Apple Music during the presidential debate Monday evening (Sept. 26), the interview will be part of a segment titled “The 411,” separate from her Beats 1 Radio show “Real Talk.” The minute-long teaser shows the legendary R&B singer covering “American Skin (41 Shots),” a song written by Bruce Springsteen in 2001, for the death of Amadou Diallo. The 23-year-old Guniea native was killed by NYPD officers Edward McMellon, Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy in 1999 when they fired 41 times at an unarmed Diallo in the Soundview section of the Bronx. A total of 19 bullets hit Diallo and he was pronounced dead at the scene. The officers were taken to trial on second-degree murder charges but were later acquitted, The New York Times reported in 2000. Springsteen continued to perform the song following the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012. During the teaser, Mary questions Clinton on the current state of racial injustice in America by asking, “Where do we go from here?” The creative efforts of Apple Music went over the heads of many, who found the idea of Mary “performing” for the politician quite awkward. https://twitter.com/WillieMac_Jr/status/780765875062378496 Mary J & Envy gotta report to the nearest bowl of rice. — the infaMOUSE (@Mouse_Jones) September 27, 2016 So ya'll just gonna let them turn Mary J into a CNN News Anchor huh??? — LeVelle Moton (@LeVelleMoton) September 27, 2016 The Mary J.

(AAPL) Amazon Echo is huge, Google Home is about to take it on, so where is AAPL’s Siri-powered speaker? By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Sep 27, 2016, 9:37 am EST     Popular Posts: The Next Thing Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Kill Apple Inc.

(AAPL) Angers New MacBook Pro Fans Yet Again Apple Inc. (AAPL) Could Launch Apple Glasses by 2018 View All Posts Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has had the opportunity to build a big lead in the smart home thanks to its stealthy approach of hiding Alexa in its Amazon Echo wireless speaker. With Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) on the verge of launching its own Google Home version, it appears Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will also soon join the fray. Source: Beni Krausz via Unsplash Reports have a Siri-powered prototype now in testing, and a mystery wireless device just hit the FCC for approval. Amazon Echo Is Stealing the Home Consumer technology giants like Apple, Google and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) had been seen as having a leg up on Amazon when it comes to the smart home. Their personal assistants — Siri, Google Now and Cortana — are integrated into their smartphones, tablets and PCs. That means a huge, mobile user base. Amazon has Alexa, but with no smartphone presence, its impact was limited. With the next big tech battle shaping up to be the fight to be at the center of the smart home — the hub that controls all those connected devices — Amazon was at a big disadvantage. Then it came up with the idea for the Amazon Echo. Has Apple Inc.’s iPhone 7 Lost Its Shine in Just a Week (AAPL)? The company integrated its Alexa personal assistant within a connected speaker equipped with an array of microphones. The Amazon Echo turned into an unlikely hit with consumers. Besides listening to and controlling streaming music, they can order products from Amazon, check the weather and they can control a large and growing array of smart home devices and appliances. All by voice, all without having to lift up a smartphone. And it’s not limited to the living room. Amazon Echo Success Draw Attention The success of the Amazon Echo caught everyone off guard. Early in September, AMZN announced Alexa had passed the 3,000 “Skills” milestone. That means 3,000 services or products that can be controlled using the Echo. That’s not just a big number — it’s big growth. The figure was tripled in three months and includes partnerships with a growing number of well-known companies. With its stealth approach, Amazon was suddenly in the driver’s seat in the race to be at the center of the connected home. Alphabet was the first to announce it was fighting back, with Google Home. Also a connected, voice-activated speaker. Waiting for Apple to Enter the Fray Apple has been mum on its plans. However, the rumor mill says AAPL is hard at work on its answer to Amazon. The latest is a report from Bloomberg that says a Siri-powered device designed to be Apple’s voice-activated smart home hub is now in the prototype testing phase. Adding fuel to the fire, MacRumors picked up on a submission by Apple to the FCC for approval of a mystery device. The wireless device carries identification numbers that don’t correspond to any current Apple products. Accompanying technical drawings hint at something with rounded edges that appears to be smaller than the Apple TV. Could it be the Amazon Echo competitor? Naturally, with Apple being Apple — that is to say, extremely secretive — we won’t know for certain if it’s working on an Amazon Echo competitor until the day it’s officially announced. It seems likely, though. Amazon is building up a big lead. It’s expanding the Echo product line with smaller and less expensive versions in an attempt to broaden its appeal, even as a growing parade of partners signs on. Alphabet is about to join the battle, just in time for the holiday shopping season. Siri is a successful and well-known voice assistant. The Apple TV is in millions of living rooms. The iPhone is the most popular smartphone in the U.S., Apple Music is one of the top music streaming services. Apple owns Beats (one of the best-known names in personal audio). HomeKit has been integrating smart device controls with iOS for several years. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Trying to Crack a Serious iOS 10 Security Issue Apple has all the pieces to build a killer, voice-activated speaker. With the success of the Amazon Echo and looming arrival of Alphabet, it has the motivation to do so. The only question is when. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology iPhone 7 Nope, drilling a hole won’t get your iPhone 7 a 3.5mm headphone jack Nope, drilling a hole won’t get your iPhone 7 a 3.5mm headphone jack A prank video on TechRax shows how to drill a hole in the iPhone 7 in order to get the headphone jack back and it has gone viral. By: Tech Desk | Updated: September 27, 2016 7:50 pm Apple iPhone 7: Drilling a hole will not bring back the headphone jack. With Apple iPhone 7, Cupertino has killed the beloved headphone jack. Apple got rid of the 100-year-old technology and now wants users to rely on the Lightning port based EarPods or the totally wireless (and pretty expensive) AirPods. But it seems some iPhone 7 users are convinced they can just drill a hole in their brand new phone and get the 3.5 mm headphone jack back. The reason: A prank video on TechRax shows how to drill a hole in the iPhone 7 in order to get the missing port back. The video which has gone viral with over 11 million views on YouTube alone, shows an iPhone 7 (matte black version that too) getting drilled with a machine at the bottom (where the new dual speakers are). Once the ‘3.5 headphone jack’ has been created, the person in the video puts on the older headphones and claims it is now working fine. Except it is not and that’s a ruined iPhone you’re looking at it. Sadly it seems people have fallen victim to this prank video. Some of the comments on the video mention how people tried this, and now there’s no sound coming out of their phone. One comment reads, “I tried this, and now there’s no sound coming out my phone.” Another says, “I tried exactly what you did, but there wasnt sound coming out of it. Please help.” One more comment reads, “Hello TechRax, I drilled the hole in it. The headphone doesn’t go all the way in. Do I need to drill deeper? Also my phone turned of because of low battery I think. I’m charging it for an hour now it doesn’t turn on, is this normal?” It is safe to say that this particular iPhone 7 is not coming back.  England 103/5 At Stumps On Day 2, Trailing India By 352 Runs Bigg Boss 10 November 17 Review: Swami Om Apologized From Mona Lisa Parliament Adjourned Amid Debate Over Demonetisation Issue Demonetisation: Select Petrol Pumps To Dispense Cash Up To Rs 2,000 Demonetisation: Here’s How It Affects Kerala Estate WorkersDemonetisation: Here’s How It Affects Kerala Estate Workers Miscreants Break Into SBI ATM In Odisha’s Nabarangpur District: Here’s What Happened Audience Reaction : John Abraham and Sonakshi Sinha Starrer Force 2 Gets A Thumbs Up Here’s What Supreme Court Said On Government’s Demonetisation Move Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Rules Out Roll Back Of Demonetisation Move West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal Protest Against Demonetisation Government Issues Fresh Guidelines On Withdrawal Norms: All You Need To Know Mamata Banerjee Demand Roll-back Of Demonetisation Within Three Days If Mulayam Singh’s Trust Is With Ram Gopal, I Am Also With Him: Amar Singh SYL Row: Amrinder Singh Seeks President’s Rule In Punjab Uproar In Parliament Over Demonetisation Debate: Here’s What Happened One user complained TechRax ruined their phone and when they took it back to the Apple Store, they obviously refused to fix it. Someone also said they tried putting back all the pieces of their iPhone 7 together and glued the hole. Obviously Apple will notice this bit and is unlikely to replace or fix the iPhone 7 without charging extra. Also read: Apple iPhone 7 review blog: Processing power is no issue, but there was a surprise And yes there are plenty of the comments on the video keep which claiming they tried this trick and now their old headphones work just fine on it, which is not true. One comment even claims they’ve managed to add a microUSB port on it. Then there are others mocking those who have managed to destroy their brand new iPhone 7 by falling for the prank. For all users of the iPhone 7, both current and potential buyers, these are the points to note. The iPhone 7 doesn’t have a headphone jack, and no you can’t bring it back. No, no, no. Live with it. Apple has given an adapter for Lightning to 3.5 mm headphones, just use that if you are desperate to try your older headphones. Also iPhone 7 is water and dust-resistant. That doesn’t cover liquid damage. Don’t think you can take this one for a swim just yet or dunk in a glass of beer or wine. Apple won’t cover any of that. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaDemonetisation: Misuse of bank account for black money deposit to invite govt action IndiaLong queues outside banks a ‘serious issue’, says SC on demonetisation BusinessUse indelible ink in banks keeping in mind upcoming bypolls: EC writes to Finance Ministry IndiaNavy rubbishes Pak Navy claim that it stopped Indian submarine from entering waters BusinessDemonetisation live updates: This is a required surgery done for a better India, says Venkaiah Naidu EntertainmentForce 2 movie review: John Abraham, Sonakshi Sinha film is Bond-Bourne rehash EntertainmentChris Martin parties with Shah Rukh Khan, Sussanne Khan and Sridevi's daughters, see inside pics EntertainmentIt's November 18, Salman Khan's wedding day, see pics EntertainmentIulia Vantur reveals what she had to sacrifice to live in India.

The touch-sensitive Home button on the iPhone 7 is likely intended as a stepping stone toward that goal, and an Apple patent published back in May described the technology Apple is most likely to adopt: ultrasonic imaging. Demonstrating that this is not just a concept but technology that works in the real world, Chinese brand Xiaomi has today launched a new phone that uses that exact type of embedded fingerprint reader. The mi 5s and mi 5s Plus both use an ultrasonic fingerprint reader built into the glass … Ultrasonic imaging of fingerprints not only allows the reader to sit beneath the glass, but is even more accurate than the capacitive sensor used in Touch ID. To help your finger locate the sensor, Xiaomi has put an indent in the glass, an approach seen in early iPhone mockups. Of course, Xiaomi’s reputation as an Apple clone-maker means that its latest handsets are designed to go head-to-head with the iPhone 7, most notably offering a very similar large-pixel 12MP camera with dual-tone flash, right through to a dual-camera setup on the mi 5 Plus – though Xiaomi has opted for a combination of color and black-and-white sensors rather than a wide-angle and telephoto lens. The display is also force-sensitive, allowing the company to emulate 3D Touch. One thing to note: Xiaomi’s implementation shows the reader beneath the glass, but not below the actual display – all the homescreen icons are above the fingerprint reader. So you do get an all-glass front, but not a full-height display. The video below is in Chinese, so we’ve jumped straight to the action, allowing you to see it in use. As you can see, this type of indented glass is the approach suggested in this mockup (created before we knew Apple was dropping the headphone socket) by Martin Hajek, though this one shows the display itself extending through the fingerprint reader. By the time Apple adopts it, we should all be used to the touch-sensitive Home button, making this a relatively minor adjustment.

Ministers for economic and financial affairs gathered for a two-day informal meeting in the Slovak capital, where they will discuss BREXIT, EU economic policies and the migration crisis. (AP Photo/Bundas Engler) The Dutch finance minister urged Apple on Saturday to "get ready" to pay up. Jeroen Dijsselbloem and his counterparts from other EU nations lined up behind a finding that the technology company owes billions of euros due to more than a decade of improperly low taxation. Apple's bill could reach 19 billion euros ($21 billion) with interest, and both the company and Ireland, Apple's European headquarters, are appealing the European Commission ruling. But as the last day of an EU finance ministers' meeting focused on ways to harmonize tax rules for multinational companies, Dijsselbloem told reporters that these "have an obligation to pay taxes in a fair way." "International tax loopholes are a thing of the past," said Dijsselbloem, who also heads the 19-strong group of nations within the EU using the euro currency. Apple will have to pay back taxes both in the United States and Europe, he added, "so get ready to do that." Philip Hammond, his British counterpart, said the EU was keen "to make sure that international corporations pay the right tax at the right place." "That's the fair way to do it, and we are going to make sure it happens," Hammond said. The Apple decision is only one of several faulting international companies - and the countries hosting them - for exploiting European exemptions to pay minimal taxes. Both Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler are contesting rulings handed down last year that they are each about 30 million euros ($33 million) in arrears. The European Commission hopes to have ready by fall proposals for multinational companies operating in the EU that tightens up rules on tax bases. Pushing back against U.S. criticism of the Apple decision, EU tax commissioner Pierre Moscovici on Saturday hailed U.S. investment as an "important driver of growth and employment in Europe." The commission ruling, he said, "is not a message that investors from U.S. companies are not welcome." While Ireland would reap a huge windfall from the extra money, it opposes the ruling because it has also benefited from the setup. Multinationals have such huge revenue that small countries can reap big gains even from low taxes, and they also gain from the jobs created. Other countries are expressing interest in any payout, however. Austrian Finance Minister Hans Joerg Schelling said Austrian, Italian and France tax authorities are following the case closely with the option of posting claims, and a senior OECD official attending the meeting suggested they could have right to do so. Angel Gurria, who heads the 35-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, cited the EU Commission ruling on Apple, saying it invited other nations that might have a claim "to come forward." Before turning to tax issues, the meeting focused on Greece. Ministers and senior EU officials in the Slovak capital urged Athens to speed up enactment of economic reforms so it can get its hands on the next batch of bailout cash before the end of October. Greece, which depends on the money due from the bailout to stay afloat, has recently fallen short of reform commitments, stoking concerns of a flare-up in the country's debt crisis. Because it hasn't delivered on the reform promises it has made, it can't yet get hold of the 2.8 billion euros ($3.2 billion) due from this current phase of its bailout program.

Thanks to Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc., students have this technology. Unfortunately, Jobs, 56, passed away Wednesday, Oct. 5, due to a rare form of pancreatic cancer. Anything with an “i” before it is Jobs’ doing. Jobs, who dropped out of college after only attending Reed College for six months, started Apple Inc. at an early age and created a totally new culture of technology, including the Mac, iPod, iTunes, iPhone, iTouch, iPad and iPhone. Students and faculty rely heavily on Apple products, especially Macs, for their majors and classes. Associate professor of art Theresa Harris, who teaches graphic design and typography, has been using Macs for a long time and believes they are necessary for her classes. “[Apple] is the industry’s standard,” Harris said. “It’s what over 95 percent of the graphic design industry and design field use as well as fields in video and animation. Everybody is an Apple fan. Jobs’ influence on the graphic design industry cannot be understated. He totally revolutionized the field.” Graphic design major Khalid Spry agrees with Harris when it comes to using Macs for his major. “His products will help me launch my business designing clothing.” As Harris said before, Apple products have been being used for the field of video and animation as well. Jobs was also the owner of the animated film company Pixar. Theatre & Cinema major Carlos Gomez works with Macs all the time for his major and says it’s essential that students can be able to use the technology at Western. “At Western, the Mac labs have been absolutely necessary for our cinema and digital animations majors, which seem to be expanding with the current entertainment industry,” he said. “Mac or PC?” has been a very popular question that has been asked in past years, and Gomez explains why Macs works better for his major. “Apple has the rights to use more powerful software in their computers,” Gomez said. “Apple has the rights to the big filmmaking software, like Final Cut Pro. Although software, like Adobe’s Premiere, is both for a PC and Mac, it was first created for Mac, so the brand trust is with Apple.” Macs have helped a lot of other majors, like journalism for laying out newspaper and yearbook pages, but Apple technology has also changed this generation as a whole. “[Jobs] connects with this generation in terms of music and the visuals and animation in the movies,” Harris said. “It’s a beautiful thing: The way he has this marriage between design and technology, and it just comes together in a wonderful package that is efficient and functions well. He made using technology an experience and made us all want to be a part of that culture.” Even though Jobs has passed away, Spry believes he will not be forgotten. “Steve Jobs will live on as long as you see the Apple mark.” This entry was posted in Features, Lifestyles and tagged death, Ipad, iPod, Legacy, Steve Jobs.

The call will be held at the standard time of 2PM PT/5PM ET, with the earnings release itself being sent out roughly thirty minutes before then. The earnings call will be important in that it can show how the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are doing as products. While Apple generally offers first weekend sales numbers for new iPhone models, the company said this year that it wouldn’t due to the supply contrasts surrounding the new devices. Many analysts, including KGI, expect that Apple will report slower iPhone 7 sales than it did iPhone 6s sales at this time last year, despite increased popularity of the iPhone 7 Plus and the Jet Black color. Last quarter, Apple posted revenues of $42.4 billion on sales of 40.4 million iPhones, 9.9 million iPads, and 4.2 million Macs. Below is the guidance Apple provided for its 2016 fiscal fourth quarter: This quarter, Apple is offering the following guidance: – Revenue between $45.5 billion and $47.5 billion – Gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38 percent – Operating expenses between $6.05 billion and $6.15 billion – Other income/(expense) of $350 million – Tax rate of 25.5 percent As always, stay tuned for full coverage of the conference call and please let us know what you think in the comments.

September 27 2016 at 03:00pm By Mae Anderson REUTERS A virtual map of Bryant Park is displayed on the screen as a man plays the augmented reality mobile game Pokemon GO by Nintendo in New York City. Picture: Mark Kauzlarich New York - Does Pokemon Go have a second act? The mobile phone app was an instant hit when it debuted in July. Crowds stampeded after a Vaporeon in Central Park and people fell off cliffs playing it in California. At an Apple event on September 7, Niantic CEO John Hanke said 500 million people had downloaded the game in just two months. It was the first mobile game to go mainstream in a big way since Candy Crush in 2014 or Angry Birds in 2012. It was also the first to incorporate augmented reality, a blending of the real and virtual worlds. But the buzz has decidedly cooled. Last Tuesday, the game ended its reign as the top-grossing US iPhone app after 74 days on top, replaced by Clash Royale, a popular battling game, according to research firm Sensor Tower. Twitter mentions of the game peaked at 1.7 million on July 11, five days after its launch, according to Adobe Digital Insights. That number had fallen by 98 percent, to 131 000, by September 7, when Apple featured it. Was it all a summer fever dream? While experts say the game is likely to remain popular for a while, it needs to evolve to have real staying power - just like its namesake digital creatures. “Almost anything of this sort is a fad,” says Steve Jones, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “I think we've seen the tapering off.” Down, but not out Of course, an enormous number of people still play the game. Research firm App Annie estimates 1 in 10 smartphone owners in the US are playing; in Japan, that number is 1 in 4. Those US figures are half what App Annie saw the week after the game launched -but to put them in perspective, they still reflect roughly the same user interest as Twitter or Pinterest. Pokemon Go has also been good at keeping people playing after signing up. Its 30-day retention rate is the second best on the Google Play store - behind Words With Friends, but ahead of other popular games such as Clash Of Clans and Clash Royale. “For a gaming app to be as big as a social network is unprecedented,” said Fabien-Pierre Nicolas, a spokesman at App Annie. “Right now, yes, they're losing a million players every week. But they get a million new players every week.” The longer users interact with the game, the more time a company has to figure out how to get money from them, Nicolas said. It took a year for some successful games like Clash Of Clans, Puzzle and Dragon to earn revenue of $1 billion, but Pokemon Go has already made more than $500 million in revenue in two months alone, according to App Annie. The game is free, but lets users purchase items in the game. Pokemon Go evolution But with social chatter dying down and a new smartphone game based on a beloved 1990s character - Super Mario Run - hitting app stores in December, Pokemon will have to reinvent itself. Kari Amarosso, a public relations manager at Arizona State University, started playing Pokemon Go with her 19-year-old son as a fun mother-son summer activity sparked by 1990s Pokemon-card nostalgia. They'd go to the mall or to meetups like one in Tempe, Arizona, where thousands of people walked around Tempe Town Lake capturing digital monsters. But the allure wore off after about six weeks, she said. “I lost interest or just plain forgot to play,” she says - and her son has stopped as well. “His route doesn't change much from work, to home, and he lost interest,” she says. Niantic has been trying to freshen things up. In September it introduced a “buddy” system, allowing users to pair up with a Pokemon to scoop up game currency called “candy”. It has also debuted an Apple Watch app and introduced a $35 wearable device, Pokemon Go Plus, which lights up and vibrates when you're near a Pokestop or a newly appeared Pokemon. Niantic did not respond to a request for comment. Hasn’t caught them all Jones suggests the company needs to do more to keep people interested - for example, by adding some kind of social element so that players can interact with each other. His two teenage sons, he notes, have grown slightly less enchanted with the game. “Young people are used to doing social media and there isn't really messaging as part of the game,” Jones said. There have been persistent rumours that Niantic plans to let players trade captured Pokemon with one another, although the company hasn't commented on that. The big challenge for Pokemon Go is to avoid the fate of Candy Crush, says Pace University marketing professor Larry Chiagouris. Created by King Digital, Candy Crush because a smash hit; Activision Blizzard subsequently bought King for $5.9 billion. But while people still play the game, the fervour around it has died down. When the game was at its peak, “you were getting invited to play Candy Crush every day” on Facebook, he said. “You don't get too many invitations to play Candy Crush anymore.” ANA-AP Like us on Facebook Connect with us on LinkedIn Hungry for more business news?

By Alistair Charlton September 27, 2016 13:55 BST Close Embed Feed iPhone 7 review: Return of the king or time to hand over the crown? IBTimes UK <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/20834" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> In a little under 10 years and with 11 generations of iPhone Apple has worked fans, journalists, investors, analysts and even itself into a corner. In this corner the product refresh cycle reigns supreme, yet consumer expectations of annual revolutions are quickly outstripping what is technologically possible. What began as a lusting desire for something new and exciting every time Steve Jobs or Tim Cook took the stage, has turned into a deafening, bellowing chorus of expectation; a demand for groundbreaking technology. The iconic debuts of the iPod, iPhone and iPad orchestrated by Jobs are still fresh in our collective memory, as is the witnessing, buying into and being a part of something genuinely new and exciting. But looking back now it seems obvious Apple wasn't going to keep up the momentum forever. The early days saw major new innovations with every annual upgrade; the App Store, 3G, a Retina display, Siri, 4G, a bigger display and Touch ID. Each of these gave consumers a reason to upgrade, investors a reason to be positive and journalists a reason to recommend each new iPhone as the best in the business. But then Apple's luck changed. The iPhone 6S brought the usual S speed boost but its new 3D Touch feature, where pressing the screen harder made apps and menu icons do more, felt misjudged. It was a poorly executed launch of a feature which is often as difficult to explain to new iPhone 6S users as it is for them to find themselves. In some apps pressing firmly does something, in others it doesn't. A year on and we can think of no shining example of when that feature alone made the upgrade from 6 to 6S worthwhile. Sales took a hit in 2016, but in Apple World that means 'only' 51 million iPhones were sold worldwide between April and June (compared to 61 million the year before), and the following three months fell from 47 million to 40 million. Massive figures, but when a country has two consecutive negative quarters we call it recession. What had begun as a lucky streak and evolved into a bulletproof winning formula, had begun to wane. The ding Steve Jobs wanted to put in the universe all those year ago was now appearing on the iPhone itself. Despite no major upgrade, the iPhone 7 still proved popular over its launch weekendReuters And so to the iPhone 7. Some said the fall in sales was due to consumers waiting for the 7 and its huge upgrades. But these hopes were not realised on 7 September, when a very familiar design painted in two new shades of black was revealed. The new models of 7 and 7 Plus have marginally better screens than their predecessors, better cameras, an improved Taptic Engine and water resistance. While all welcome, none of these is big enough to be the handset's unique selling point. None is the go-to answer to why you are handing over between £599 and £919 for a phone that looks like the one you already have. And yet the larger 7 Plus in the new 'hero' colour of Jet Black is sold out until November. This could be down to manufacturing problems as much as demand, but the daily queues at phone shops and chatter about 'the new iPhone' on trains and buses tell their own story. It's still the talk of the town. Sick of its own limelight Apple has, for the first time, opted not to reveal how many iPhones were sold during its opening weekend. A sign of weakness, of expected poor sales, or of a company fed up with the limelight burning into its retinas? Soon after former Burberry chief executive Angela Ahrendts took over as head of retail in 2013, Apple began to change. The Watch was launched quietly and in high-end boutiques to well-heeled shoppers with reservations; its flagship Regent Street store in London is undergoing a renovation so massive that it wasn't even open for the iPhone 7 launch; Apple's attempt to thrust gold versions of the Watch into high fashion has failed. The iPhone 7 proved popular with consumers, but the queues were smaller than usualReuters And what about the famous iPhone queues? For the Watch they were banned and for the iPhone 7 they were smaller than ever. A company the size of Apple can surely produce enough iPhones to satisfy the day-one masses, but it seemingly chose not to. Perhaps Apple now considers the queues unsightly? Formerly the domain of suspiciously wealthy teenagers, but in recent years taken over by people buying iPhones to immediately sell abroad for a quick buck. A stagnated market The queues, launches and media storm surrounding them is now a distraction to a company which just wants to get on with being the best in a challenging and stagnated market – a market which has advanced, matured and arguably honed in on perfection so quickly that meaningful updates and true revolutions are few, far between and, as some manufacturers are discovering, simply not wanted. Like a celebrity looking for a quiet retirement, no one can blame Apple for wanting to step out of the limelight and work on personal projects, spend more time with its family and finally do those store renovations. It will continue to pump out iPhones, iPads and Macs; hoards of fans will buy them with religious regularity and journalists will decorate them with stars. But the magic has been lost. It isn't just Apple. Samsung has the upper hand as far as design and innovation are concerned, but its desire to beat the iPhone to market backfired spectacularly when dozens of its flagship Note 7 exploded. Smartphone makers have reached a technological plateau from which they are struggling to progress. It seems right now the most difficult challenge they face is giving consumers the new, shiny and exciting products they desire, without merely keeping up with the competition and distracting them with gimmicks.

Why doesn't it cost 50 bucks a foot?" I would then spend a lot of time explaining that there were serious costs in design, shipping, administration, fees and more that all add up. Whenever I write about a nice piece of furniture, readers complain "why does it cost so much? I can get a knockoff much cheaper." © IHS Markit Now over on Quartz, a business website offshoot of the Atlantic that is usually pretty good, Mike Murphy writes that after taking apart a new iPhone and looking at its parts, it only costs $ 225 to build, a third of the $ 649 that Apple sells it for. He does go on to note: Although parts and labor aren’t the only costs that go into the total cost of making a product like the iPhone—there’s research and development, marketing, shipping, and packaging, to name a few—it’s surprising that Apple has spent relatively so much on a phone that many have found underwhelming, and at a time when the company’s sales are stalling. This is a conversation we have had before on TreeHugger, usually under the title On Knowing The Price Of Everything And The Value Of Nothing. Over on Core77, Rain Noe goes through the things that add to the cost of any product, from the designers, to the engineers, to the marketing team, to the fancy box, to the shipping, to the fancy stores and their employees, to the markup for the other retailers who sell the phone (they are not all sold in Apple stores). Rain Noe concludes: Now, do all of those costs eat up all of the $457 differential? Of course not. Apple is a fabulously wealthy company that enjoys a hefty profit margin on each of their products, and that's their right. It's up to them to set the price wherever they want it, and it is up to us as consumers to decide to buy their products or not. If Apple is successful, it is us who have made them so; if they become irrelevant, it will be us who have decided so. What I don't like is laypeople being misled into thinking that Apple enjoys a profit of $457 on each iPhone 7. That notion completely disregards the efforts of the hundreds or thousands of people who put in the time to make the product a reality. And why is this on TreeHugger? I am certainly not an apologist for Apple and its pricing; just yesterday I wrote about how one should break free of this vicious upgrade cycle and keep your old phone; see Why the best smartphone is the one you already have It is probably not the best example of the principle I am espousing. But the same thing can be said for almost every product or tiny home or prefab or chair that we show on this site, where, unlike the iPhone, most are short run, hand made, high quality using sustainable materials. But the same economic principles apply: there is a lot more than goes into every one of them than meets the eye. Oh, and the makers have to eat.

Sure, they’re the best in the world in each category Apple competes in, but unless you’re already locked into the Cupertino ecosystem, they’re honestly optional technology. You can listen to music on the move, play movies in bed, take your office on the road with you, and concentrate your entire life into a smartphone all without an iPod, iPad, MacBook, or iPhone. There are alternatives. Not so with Google. In its 18 years of existence, Google has grown from the world’s favorite search engine to the world’s favorite web browser, maps service, email client, mobile operating system, and online video depository. A billion people around the world now use each of Google’s marquee services: Chrome, Google Maps, Gmail, Android, and YouTube. According to Google’s numbers, that’s nearly a third of the global online population, and YouTube reaches more people between the ages of 18 and 49 than any US cable network. Now that it’s celebrating its own 18th birthday, a milestone of maturity among us mortal humans, it’s worth reassessing how deeply Google has integrated itself into our daily lives as they’ve grown more connected with each passing year. Every word I type lands in either a Google Doc or a Google Keep note I know this from my own experience, which is now so intricately bound with Google as to make me partially dysfunctional without the trusty, always-on services that the Mountain View company provides. Every word I type lands in either a Google Doc or a Google Keep note. The Chrome browser keeps my most essential bookmarks and settings synced across macOS, Windows, and Google’s own Chrome OS. Because I do so much of my work (and play) on the web, Google is my closest and most immediate ally. I’ve no idea how I would survive without Gmail or Google Maps. Yes, there’s Microsoft’s Outlook and Apple Maps, but neither is as polished as Google’s products, neither is as reliable or trustworthy. Every tech company aspires to reach the status that Google has achieved with myself and millions others: being an indispensable, practically inevitable part of everyday online life. Amazon and Facebook have come closest to replicating Google’s success, albeit taking markedly different approaches to how they make themselves essential, and Apple also deserves recognition for winning users over with the consistently high-quality integration of its hardware, software, and services. Google’s popularity is built on a foundation of quality and ubiquity But still, Google is the one. Google is the company whose apps we all rely on in some form or at some time. Even if you use Bing to search the web on Firefox, and you ignore Google Photos, Gmail, and Drive for Flickr, Yahoo Mail, and Dropbox, eventually someone will send you a YouTube clip, you’ll find the channel interesting enough to subscribe to, and you’ll be ensnared in Google’s incredibly wide net on the web. The thing that keeps Google relevant is a mix of the ubiquity and quality of its services. Where other companies have sought to keep users walled in, Google has pursued a strategy of being everywhere so that it no longer matters where its users are. It’s the same approach that Microsoft is now taking with its Office suite and various other online services, but it was Google that pioneered and perfected it. The device that defines our age will be an iPhone running Google services When I think about the device that will define our generation’s technology and the smartphone revolution, I picture an iPhone running Google services. The first time I understood the transformative power of smartphones was when a friend handed me his iPhone 3GS and I explored Google Maps on it. Perfect smoothness from Apple, incredibly useful information from Google. That’s been the core around which all of the past seven years of mobile development have been built. Even today, the first thing I do with a new iPhone is load it full of Google apps. Some of them, things like Google Translate and Google Keep, never get their due credit and attention, but they once again make my life better and Google’s position as everyone’s best online friend so much more secure. It may seem weird that Google is fixing iPhone users’ problems, but Google probably sees them as Google users who simply happen to be on iPhones. Maybe I’m being a little sentimental on account of it being Google’s birthday today. But I figure that sometimes it’s alright to just gush about the good stuff. Am I forgetting Google Buzz, Google Wave, Google Plus, and this summer’s spectacularly pointless Google Spaces? Not at all. I’ve seen Google make many mistakes, and I remain displeased with its continual tax dodging in Europe, a practice common among tech giants, but still unworthy of their stature and otherwise good repute. And yes, Google’s relationship with its users’ privacy tends to be rather a tense affair. Google is the company with real courage In spite of its failures and imperfections, I think Google is a force for good in this world. Beyond the practical benefits of its online apps and services, this company has been responsible for some of the wildest, most imaginative research projects in tech. Many of those moonshots have now been decoupled into parent company Alphabet, but Google did take a big chance with its Google Glass smart glasses in 2013, which were basically the fevered geek dream of its founders (and many tech fans around the world). That took a great deal more courage and conviction than Apple’s overblown headphone jack removal. I like that the world has companies willing to invest (and sometimes fail) in their vision of the future, and Google has always been a leader in that respect, with such efforts as Google Fiber, Project Loon, and Project SkyBender. For me, Google has made navigating the web easier and more pleasant. It’s made exploring foreign cities feel far less daunting. It’s facilitated instant online collaboration with my colleagues. It’s kept me sane while switching between dozens of review devices every year. And it’s done it all for free. With a little bit of effort, I can secure my privacy too, and so long as I remember to diversify by using alternative services like Dropbox, Telegram, and Tidal for at least some of my online needs, I feel pretty comfortable in my close and cozy relationship with Google. I live in a very Googly version of the internet and I'm happier for it. More From The Verge Sand's End Facebook won’t call itself a media company.

The company’s fourth fiscal quarter corresponds to the third calendar quarter. A press release will go out 30 minutes in advance of the earnings call. The earnings call will include early sales of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. As is its wont, Apple will not break down iPhone sales by model. Apple also said it would be no longer providing opening weekend iPhone sales going forward. Don’t keep your fingers crossed for Apple Watch numbers either: the Cupertino firm lumps wearable sales together with sales of the Apple TV, Beats products, iPod and Apple-branded and third-party accessories in the “Other Products” category. The company will allow anyone to listen to the conference call live via its website. A replay stream will be available for a few weeks. Live streaming uses Apple’s HTTP Live Streaming technology, which requires an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with Safari on iOS 7.0 or later, a Mac with Safari 6.0.5 or later on OS X v10.8.5 or later or a PC with Microsoft Edge on Windows 10. Apple’s guidance for its fiscal 2016 fourth quarter calls for the revenue between $45.5 billion and $47.5 billion, gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38 percent and operating expenses between $6.05 billion and $6.15 billion.

Most of the Macs currently shipping use either integrated graphics from Intel or discreet AMD chips, but that could change in the coming years. As first spotted by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Nvidia is seeking software engineers tasked with helping produce “the next revolutionary Apple products.” According to the job post, the role would require “working in partnership with Apple” and writing code that will “define and shape the future” of graphics-related software on Macs. Gurman writes: There are three current job listings on Nvidia’s database referencing Apple, with the latest one appearing last week. All three job listings for the Santa Clara, California-based company cite software development for the Mac, while one specifies an Nvidia Mac graphics driver team, pointing to the potential of Nvidia chipsets returning to the Apple computers. Nvidia and Apple both declined to comment. One of the ads is for a Metal and OpenCL software engineer who will be working within a team of exceptional and passionate engineers to implement and extend Metal Compute and OpenCL on the Mac. As Gurman hinted, Nvidia most likely needs these GPU experts and software engineers for developing macOS graphics drivers for some of its GPUs that could end up in future Mac models. Macs have always been dissed for slow and poorly supported graphics. indeedI, most of the high-end graphics cards are unavailable to Mac owners who crave graphics power and performance. Apple itself does not write its own graphics drivers and is reluctant to officially support the latest and greatest graphics cards for gaming. Here’s Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang discussing GPU technology’s capability and its role in artificial intelligent applications at the Nvidia GPU Technology Conference 2016 which kicked off on September 21 in Taiwan. While discreet Nvidia chips are unlikely to end up in future Mac notebooks due to space constraints, it would make sense to use them in a future Mac Pro model, higher-end iMacs and it could also make a nice fit for a next-generation 5K Thunderbolt Display with integrated graphics that the rumor-mill thought Apple was building at some point. Nvidia’s latest Pascal-based Tesla P4 and P40 GPUs feature improved performance and response time and can detect and sense images, texts and voices. These GPUs will begin shipping next month.

Follow TechnoBuffalo “Views,” the latest album from Drake, has become the first to surpass 1 billion streams on Apple Music. Drake announced the news on Instagram with a photo of him alongside Apple CEO Tim Cook, iTunes chief Eddy Cue, and Apple Music’s head of content, Larry Jackson. Apple gifted Drake a celebratory plaque to mark the milestone, which also serves as an advert for Apple Music. Drake has also released a 23-minute short film to accompany the album, which you can watch through iTunes or on an iOS device. Titled “Please Forgive Me,” the film follows Drake and girlfriend Fanny Neguesha as they attempt to steal a wealthy man’s fortune, according to MacRumors. Songs like “One Dance,” “Controlla,” “9,” and “Views” are all heard throughout. When it made its debut back in April, “Views” was exclusive to iTunes and Apple Music for five days before being made available elsewhere. During that time, the album sold a whopping 1 million copies, despite being free for Apple Music subscribers. Apple has secured a number of deals like this one in an effort to attract new subscribers to its music streaming service. It now has 17 million paying customers, according to the latest count, which is still some way off the 40 million subscribers boasted by Spotify Premium.

Ren weihong China’s Xiaomi aims for Apple’s iPhone with Mi 5S Plus smartphone launch Bloomberg September 27, 2016 Updated: September 27, 2016 04:18 PM Related Xiaomi targets China’s high-end market with expensive new smartphones Honor 8 review: Huawei’s premium smartphone at a budget price World’s top smartphone brands, Q2 2016 – in pictures China’s tech giants spread their wings abroad but keep share safe at home Huawei challenges Samsung and Apple smartphone domination Topics: Apple Smartphones Xiaomi took the wraps off its strongest contender yet to the iPhone, a 2,599-yuan plus-sized device with dual cameras and a pressure-sensitive screen that is less than half the price of Apple’s top-of-the-line model. With the 5.7-inch Mi 5S Plus, Xiaomi, once known as a purveyor of inexpensive but innovative phones, is taking aim at fans of premium devices. It’s the Chinese startup’s most powerful device, sporting one of Qualcomm’s speediest processors as well as 6 gigabytes of memory. With a screen that detects varying degrees of pressure – much like Apple’s 3D Touch – and 13-megapixel cameras, it stacks up well against the iPhone in the specifications department. Xiaomi needs a hit. It’s slipped behind Huawei and Oppo in a home market it once dominated, while efforts to make headway in Latin America and India have stalled. Samsung’s global recall of the Note 7 opens a window of opportunity not just for Apple, but also for Xiaomi to try and wrest market share away from the global leader. "We were aiming to challenge Samsung and Apple in camera capability. With the Mi 5S, I believe we beat both of them," co-founder and chief executive Lei Jun said at a launch event in Beijing at which it also introduced a 65-inch, 4K smart television. Apple is counting on the latest iteration of its flagship product to regain the top spot in China, its largest overseas market. But unlike in years past, the iPhone 7 offers little that resonates with Chinese consumers: no affordable models such as the SE or 5C, a radical redesign, or features that truly push the technological envelope. Investors speculate iPhone 7 sales may even lag last year’s, depressing its stock. The new iPhone does feature a water-resistant design, upgraded camera and faster processor. The larger Plus model sports a back-facing dual camera that allows for crisper images, particularly in low light. It also comes with a pressure-sensitive Home button that provides a vibrating sensation instead of a click. The bigger version goes for more than 6,000 yuan in China. Xiaomi is following Huawei and Oppo into the higher end of an intensely crowded Chinese smartphone market, encroaching on Apple’s traditional sweet spot. That will be key to shoring up margins as Xiaomi – which missed its 2015 sales target – continues to develop and put out products like TVs and robot vacuums in a gradually easing economy. "The price tag of the Mi 5S Plus made the device very competitive. With all the upgrades, the device is only a few hundred yuan pricier than the Mi 5. We think the new product will be very popular," said Nicole Peng, China research director at Canalys. The Mi 5S Plus and the smaller, 1,999 yuan Mi 5S go on sale September 29, though not in the US. The company, whose plethora of products include rice cookers, is preparing to enter the American market by employing the same online sales and social media marketing that helped the six-year-old company become China’s largest privately funded startup. While it has not specified when it will move into the US, the smartphone vendor is in a better position these days to launch an incursion onto Apple’s turf. In June, the Beijing-based company announced the acquisition of nearly 1,500 technology patents from Microsoft – a deal that may smooth potential legal tangles over intellectual property as it pushes abroad. Back home, Xiaomi’s taking another page from the US company. It aims to open hundreds of stores in coming years, adopting an approach that’s helped not just Apple but also local rivals like Oppo. "Xiaomi already has a strong online sales channel, but we are also trying hard to build our offline sales network so more customers can try out our products in real life," Mr Lei said. business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Xiaomi targets China’s high-end market with expensive new smartphones Honor 8 review: Huawei’s premium smartphone at a budget price World’s top smartphone brands, Q2 2016 – in pictures China’s tech giants spread their wings abroad but keep share safe at home More Technology Etihad’s new services strengthen Europe-UAE trade ties Virtual reality is all about the real world around us Jet-engine maker Rolls-Royce on cost-saving target but moutain still to climb Irish digital companies looking to establish roots in UAE MOST VIEWED Business | All Dubai worker faces overstaying fine after no plane ticket from employer Standard Chartered cuts 150 jobs in the UAE, may lay off more by year-end What happens if Dubai tenant stays in property without signing new contract on expiry?

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | September 27, 2016 -- 11:59 GMT (04:59 PDT) | Topic: iPhone Your iPhone 7 may be water-resistant, but try not to get it wet Apple When Apple unveiled that the iPhone 7 would be water-resistant, people's imaginations began to run wild, and they imagined a device that was totally impervious to water. The reality is that the device's water resistance is little more than an insurance policy against accidental water damage. See also: iOS 10 hidden secrets -- Cool new features you don't want to miss In an attempt to clarify things, Apple has published guidance about this new feature, and new owners would do well to familiarize themselves with this information before taking their phones on undersea adventures. Let's take a look at the guidance. First off, note that Apple calls the iPhone 7 water-resistant, not waterproof. There is a big difference. Note the word "accidentally" there. Apple is not recommending owners deliberately expose their iPhones to water. A lot going on here: Reference to "controlled laboratory conditions," so your real-world experiences may vary. Apple offers up a scientific definition for the water resistance. Points out that the water resistance might decrease with usage. If water damages your iPhone, you're on your own (although AppleCare+ does cover water damage) Now we have a whole list of don'ts (note how Apple specifically discourages deliberately submerging the iPhone), including stuff you shouldn't get in contact with your iPhone 7, such as insect repellent and hair dye. Now we come to all the aftercare you have to do after your iPhone 7 gets wet. Apple expects you to have cloths and fans to hand. If your Lightning port gets water in it, no charging your iPhone for at least five hours. Cool, new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus acc...

The iPhone 7 is water resistant and has a new camera, but it controversially ditches the headphone jack. By Alistair Charlton September 27, 2016 13:15 BST Close Embed Feed iPhone 7 review: Return of the king or time to hand over the crown? IBTimes UK <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/20834" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> Has a piece of consumer technology ever launched with more weight on its shoulders than the iPhone 7? For what feels like the entire year a steady stream of leaks and gossip slowly revealed a familiar shape. When the iPhone 7 finally arrived it was greeted with a sense of deja vu and even a tinge of disappointment. Why no design change? Isn't this just another S update? Is the camera really that much better? Where's the headphone jack? A first for Apple, the iPhone 7 is water resistant to one meter for up to 30 minutesIBTimes UK These are all valid questions, of course, but focusing too much on what the iPhone 7 is missing causes us to overlook what is left behind. We have had two weeks to ponder the iPhone 7 and a week to use it; here's everything you need to know. The iPhone 7 featured here was provided by Carphone Warehouse. Deals start at £42 per month. Yes, the iPhone 7 looks and feels a lot like the iPhone 6S and two-year-old iPhone 6. And yes, the design is starting to feel a little dated compared to what Samsung is producing at the moment. Give it a couple more years and the iPhone would likely switch from 'dated' to 'enduring classic' but for now it is simply less exciting than the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Note 7. Not bad by any means; the iPhone 7 is a practically-sized handset and everything is where you expect it to be (apart from that headphone jack). The iPhone 7 has the same design as the iPhone 6 and 6S, but no longer has a headphone jackIBTimes UK The plastic antenna lines cut through the aluminium body more discreetly than on previous models and the 7 weighs fractionally less than the 6S, but it is essentially the same design. iPhone 7: A new, motionless home button The most noticeable hardware change is the home button. It no longer moves at all and instead produced a haptic clicking sensation when you press it. There are three intensities of click to choose from but it doesn't work properly while wearing gloves. It feels weird at first, like the Apple Watch's tapping notification or the iPhone 6S and 7's 3D Touch screen – in fact, it's the same Haptic Engine making the clicks and buzzes. Pressing the home button is felt as strongly on the back of the iPhone 7 as it is on the button itself, kidding you into thinking you're clicking the whole aluminium back with your newly-found superhuman strength. The iPhone 7's home button does not move, but instead provides haptic feedback when pushedIBTimes UK It might seem a daft modification to make when the old home button worked fine, but for starters the new system helps earn the iPhone 7 its IP67 rating – which means it will survive a dip into a metre of clean water for up to 30 minutes. The Samsung Galaxy S7 is even more water resistant, but for safeguarding against clumsiness the Apple's rating is acceptable. Giving the home 'button' its click is just one of the Taptic Engine's tricks. It subtly taps and pulses when you interact with the user interface; notifications drop down with a thump, scrolling through the minutes of the timer app gives a series of clicks and the vibration to signal an incoming call is stronger and more dynamic than ever. We can see the Taptic Engine becoming an important part of future iPhones, much more so than the stillborn Force Touch. iPhone 7: Performance, storage and battery Inside, the iPhone 7 has an all-new, quad-core processor. It has the same basic architecture as processors used by Android phones, where two pairs of chips run at different speeds. In theory this means simple tasks are performed frugally by the low-power pair and more intensive tasks like gaming and video editing are handled by the more powerful duo. Apple has subtly changed the iPhone's antenna lines and rear camera bulgeIBTimes UK This, along with the faster animations of Apple's new iOS 10 software, makes the iPhone 7 feel like the fastest yet. Switching between applications is satisfyingly snappy and unlocking the phone with your fingerprint is near-instantaneous. Storage options are 32, 128 and 256GB, meaning every option has doubled since the iPhone 6S and Apple has finally ditched the feeble 16GB model. Unfortunately, a weaker pound in the wake of Brexit means prices have gone up across the board. The three versions of iPhone 7 cost £599, £699 and £799 respectively. Battery life has improved over the 6 and 6S, and despite some reviews stating the iPhone 7 failed to see out a full day without recharging, we usually saw between 25% and 40% left at the end of a full day. iPhone 7: Cameras The iPhone 7's rear camera has been upgraded with a new, brighter lens and optical image stabilisationIBTimes UK Also benefiting from a speed boost is the rear camera. It has the same 12-megapixel resolution as before, but a new f/1.8, 28mm lens with optical image stabilisation (OIS) makes for faster, brighter photos, more light hitting the image sensor at night and smoother video. The OIS (previously exclusive to the larger iPhone Plus) and brighter lens work to capture much more light in dimly lit settings without resorting to the (also new and improved) flash. The 7's camera can produce a better 'bokeh' effect than any to go before, blurring the background of images to make the subject pop. The iPhone 7 Plus' dual-lens camera will perform even better in this aspect once the iOS 10.1 software update arrives soon. The iPhone has always had an excellent camera and the 7 continues that legacy with aplomb. An increase from six to seven megapixels also helps to make the front camera one of the best around. iPhone 7: Display Photos look good when uploaded to Facebook and Instagram, but where they really shine is on the iPhone 7's own screen. It has the same 4.7in size and 750 x 1334 resolution as the iPhone 6 and 6S (and the same pixel density of 326 per inch), but is blessed with a wider colour gamut. It looks superb, noticeably better than before and so good that DisplayMate described it as "visually indistinguishable from perfect". High praise which we are happy to agree with. iPhone 7: Headphones Standard headphones cannot be plugged into the iPhone 7 - but an adapter is included to make them workIBTimes UK All of these updates are welcome but none stand out as the iPhone 7's unique selling point; it's best feature; the cherry on top. No one update is enough to provide a compelling answer to the question: "Why did you spend £799 on a new phone that looks like your old one?". Unfortunately, the iPhone 7 will be forever remembered as the phone that killed the headphone jack. There are three replacement solutions: The included EarPod earphones, which plug into the Lightning port An included adapter (also available from Apple for £9), which lets you plug other headphones into the Lightning port Bluetooth for wireless headphones and Apple's upcoming AirPods An adapter comes with the iPhone 7 so that regular headphones can be attached to the Lightning portIBTimes UK The first offer the same just-about-passable-because-they're-free sound quality EarPod users will be used to. They aren't all that good and the leak sound as badly as ever, but they work okay. The problem here is how you cannot charge and listen to music at the same time. The adapter is an unsightly but simply solution and works fine, although we found the in-line remotes of some headphones stopped working. Your own headphones are now iPhone 7 compatible, but the charging problem remains unless you spend £35 on an adapter. Bluetooth audio is undeniably the future and one we have embraced for several months now. It impacts battery life, but the upside of being cable-free is more than worth it. Paired to the Bose QC35s, the iPhone 7 worked flawlessly. Audiophiles know wired connections produce better music than Bluetooth, and although there's no perfect solution here these are relatively early days. Apple was branded mad when it stripped the MacBook of its DVD drive, but now it is considered normal. Give it time. Our verdict Apple iPhone 7 Having plagued Sony for years, the curse of smartphone stagnation is knocking on Apple's door. Given the rapid rate of progress over the last nine years it was inevitable that eventually the iPhone would become an annual evolution and no longer a revolution. The iPhone 7 is still one of the very best smartphones on sale today and it is of course the best iPhone for those who don't want the gargantuan iPhone 7 Plus. But it perhaps isn't worth buying if you already have the 6S. There is a strange mentality among technology reviewers and analysts that every new product must be leagues ahead of its predecessor and appeal unanimously to everyone owning the year-old model. But what about everyone who owns an iPhone 6, or an iPhone 5? As we write this we can even see an iPhone 3GS still going strong. For these people the iPhone 7 will be a spectacular upgrade which will see them through another two, three or even four years. Just because the iPhone 7 doesn't appeal to Apple die-hards who upgrade annually, is isn't automatically an inferior phone. Killing the headphone jack is a shock and a bit of a pain for now, but in two years' time no one will care. They will either adjust their charging habits or buy Bluetooth headphones and never look back. As an update the iPhone 7 is not a match for the 4, 5 and 6, but as a phone in its own right it is still every bit the match for Samsung.

Richard Drew/Associated Press   By Elizabeth Karmel Associated Press My grandmother, who lived with us when I was growing up, had a serious sweet tooth and would bake something almost every day. In the spring, it was coconut cream pie. In the summer, homemade ice cream and peach pie. And during fall apple season, she would bake this very simple apple cake and serve it warm with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. My mother and I loved this cake -- it's so simple, yet so satisfying and comforting -- and never thought to write it down before my grandmother died. For years, we searched her recipe cards to no avail until last summer when I was doing research for a new cookbook called "Steak and Cake." Happily, we came across a recipe card that looked like it might be the thing. I made the cake immediately and as my mother and I tasted it, we finally knew that we had found the one. Sometimes, the memory outshines the reality. But in this cake, it did not. As I was testing recipes for the cookbook, I added my grandmother's apple cake to 10 other cakes, some classic and some newfangled, for a neighborhood tasting the cookbook writer's version of a "cake walk." Everyone gravitated toward my grandmother's cake. I had to stop myself from adding a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter as I rarely make a cake without it, but I decided that I should preserve this cake just the way my grandmother made it. The batter is very stiff like cookie dough before you add the apples, but rest assured as soon as the apples give up their juice, the batter loosens and will bake beautifully. • Elizabeth Karmel is a barbecue and Southern foods expert.

They’re two brands that dominate their market. And now they’ve formed a tight bond, as Sonos has announced its speakers are now available to buy through Apple’s online and retail stores. The Play:1 and Play:5 are now available to buy through Apple.com in the US, but will be avaialble to buy from 468 Apple’s retail stores worldwide from October 5th. You should also see the speakers appear on Apple’s online store in “most markets outside the USA” between now and then. Which Sonos speaker is best for you? Play:1, Play:3, new Play:5 or Playbar? If high quality products and sound quality weren’t enough of an incentive, anyone who buys a Sonos speaker from any of Apple’s retail channels will get a free 3 month membership to Apple Music, even if you’re already a Music subscriber. Sonos says the best way to learn about its products is to actually listen to them and be guided through how they work. 140 Apple stores worldwide will have a demonstration area with the Sonos app running on an iPad Pro. Apple Music is available as a service to add through the Sonos controller app for iOS and Android and can give users access to exclusive content such as Frank Ocean’s latest album Blonde.

By Kim Tae-gyu Returning to Apple 12 years after an infamous departure in 1985, the late Steve Jobs started the famous "Think Different" commercial campaign on Sept. 28, 1997, to get greater public attention. Nineteen years later, questions arise as to whether the Palo Alto, California-based tech giant still "thinks different" with its legendary leader gone five years ago due to pancreatic cancer. Many experts reply in the negative because Apple has failed to produce any notable innovations of late. "In the 1997 ad campaign, Jobs praised the misfits, the troublemakers and the rebels because they change the world and push the human race forward by thinking differently," said a professor at a Seoul university. "Jobs lived up to his words since he was responsible for putting 1,000 songs in every pocket with the iPod and the Internet with the iPhone. Without Jobs, however, Apple could not achieve such feats. More problematic is that the firm is not likely to make any big achievements in the near future." He said that Apple makes money thanks to the legacy left by Jobs without creating something new as a future cash cow. Chung Chang-won, an analyst at Nomura Securities, said that Apple is now too big to maintain the maverick disregard for the mainstream as it has become mainstream itself. "Apple seems to be fond of rules and respects the status quo, the two features Jobs emphasized as non-innovators in the 1997 ad campaign. The iPhone 7 would be an example," he said. "The iPhone 7 is by and large just an upgrade from previous versions. Of course, Apple cannot show great products every year but I have not seen any great products over the past few years." Observers noted that in the past Samsung Electronics followed Apple but now the order is reversed as demonstrated by the iPhone 7 whose new feature is water and dust resistance, which was adopted by Samsung in 2014 for the Galaxy S5. In other words, Samsung has taken the driving seat in technological advances, something with which Jobs would not be happy. "I am using both the Galaxy phone and the iPhone. I don't know why the latter is so good compared to the former and why some are still craze about the iPhone," Chung said. A senior executive at a local start-up concurred. "If Jobs had been alive and in charge for the past five years, I think that Apple would have launched an all-new automobile, the iCar, or an innovative house, the iHome, while pushed ahead in promising areas such as artificial intelligence (AI)," he said. "But we have yet to see the iCar or the iHome and Google is a runaway leader in AI." Some watchers say that Apple's incumbent CEO Tim Cook, who is dubbed as a mirror image of Jobs, is not the right person to spearhead innovation in one of the world's most valuable corporations. Put otherwise, they say that Jobs vowed to make a dent in the universe but Cook is a corporate leader who prefers to make a dent in income statements. Jobs trusted Cook and entrusted the management of Apple to him. However, he once expressed reservations about his successor to his biographer Walter Isaacson, saying "But Tim's not a product person, per se." Jobs did not elaborate or at least Isaacson did not write more, but Jobs seems to mean that a product person is an innovation champion who moves forward with new products. By contrast, he appears to see Cook as an operations champion. One sure thing is that Cook reversed the philosophies of Jobs on a few points. Jobs mocked a big phone, a small tablet and a stylus. He disdained a large-screen phone because people cannot get their hands around it and mocked a small tablet, saying the iPad's 10-inch is the minimum suitable size. He also claimed god gave us 10 styluses ― fingers ― so that we don't have to invent a new one, which we would easily misplace. Cook and Apple's top decision makers ignored the three epic rants of Jobs and debuted big iPhones, the iPad mini and a stylus called the Apple Pencil soon after Jobs died. voc200@gmail.com Ji Chang-wook says shooting action-pac...

For the sake of technological and human advancement, we hope they do – and don’t repeat the Apple Watch fiasco… Anyways, while we’re currently in the dark even about the Aple car coming in just a few years, one designer ventured far into the future and thought a concept for the year 2076. Designer Ali Cam from Istanbul, Turkey, is taking a daring path by looking six decades into the future for the possible 2076 Apple Car. The year is not chosen randomly – it would be the Apple centennial and as such it would need great products. Cam appears to project Apple’s minimalist design philosophy to extremes over the next six decades, with sharp edges and very clear-cut surfaces. Cam’s 2076 Apple Car is actually very simple – from the profile you can see it as a sharp wedge, while the front end seems inspired by the firm’s computer mouse line. The door open in a futuristic way – a concealed part in the smooth top moves upward like a gullwing, and a reverse-hinged piece in the body swings out like on Rolls’ cars. Of course, six decades from now everything will be autonomous so the interior is just a lounge with couches front and back – and a holographic display to function as the infotainment system.

M Friday, Nov 18 2016 | Updated at 09:19 AM EST Stay Connected With Us F T R Opinion Academics Students Special Reports Sports Finance Tech Career College Video Sep 26, 2016 07:45 AM EDT By Vinay Patel, UniversityHerald Reporter iPad Air 3 Release Date, Specs & Rumors: The New Tablet Likely To Be Unveiled In First Quarter Of 2017? iPad Air 3 Release Date, Specs And Features: New iPad Coming Early 2017? (Photo : Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The recently concluded iPhone 7 unveiling event didn't quite turn out to be what avid Apple fans were anticipating it to be. While the Cupertino based tech firm unveiled the highly anticipated iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 2, the company remained mum regarding its line of tablet flagships, particularly the equally anticipated, iPad 3. That being said, optimistic fans hazard a guess that since Apple iPad 3 was a no-show during the iPhone 7 unveiling event that took place on September 7, the next likely timeframe for the device's launch could be sometime in the first quarter of 2017. The speculations stems from a recently released theory by acclaimed analyst from KGI Securities, Ming-Chi Kuo. Kuo claimed that Apple is likely to roll out three different variants of iPads in 2017 - the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and an economical 9.7-inch iPad. It's worth noting that Kuo did not include a variant for the last mentioned iPad on the list. This stirred conversations among gadget enthusiasts that this could be the long awaited iPad Air 3, MacRumors reported. Another reason why Apple could opt to launch the device in a "spaced-out" manner is the dramatically dropping sales of tablets in the wake of the recent onslaught of hybrid tablet's popularity. Likewise, the purported iPad Air 3 is expected to boast an array of awe-inspiring features, and if the device's 2017 release date comes to fruition, it won't be surprising if the purported device turns out to be at the top of every buyer's list as it is said to come with some killer features. The iPad Air 3 is expected to be powered by a robust A10 processor and a fresh iOS 10 out of the box. Moreover, it is likely to come with the minimum 64GB of internal memory. But that's not all! If rumors proved to be true, the iPad Air 3 will feature an AMOLED (active-matrix organic light-emitting diode) display with 2,048 x 1,538 resolution. In addition, it is said to be equipped with four-speaker audio system, and Apple support, ChristianDaily reported. Furthermore, iPad Air 3 is pegged to support the tech firm's Apple Pencil; however, those interested in getting their hands on the accessory will need to shell out some extra money.

Will Tim Cook replace Ron Dennis at Mclaren? In the Apple-Mclaren story, we wonder if Tim Cook could be the man to turn Mclaren around. And how is it that despite attracting iconic brands such as Honda, Fernando Alonso, and now Apple (possibly), Mclaren isn’t able to repeat its iconic performances. However, if Apple do get involved, let’s hope that their creative team comes up with something better than iMclaren! Also, is Apple’s main interest Fernando Alonso’s radio messages being available for download via iTunes? By the way, this podcast is already on iTunes, so here’s where you can subscribe. McLaren driver Fernando Alonso at Singapore GP. AP Also, is Fernando Alonso penning an autobiography? We love the Alonso 2.0 at Mclaren and let’s hope he publishes his funny radio messages, if nothing. And, our love for him shot through the roof after he declared that he wouldn’t be interested in Pokemon GO! As for Honda, they’ve expanded operations to supply to a second team in Formula 1 in the near future. Is this the real reason behind their expansion? Well, our investigative reports indicate otherwise. Oh and they also say that they’re ahead of Toro Rosso. While this claim may defy some logic, we try to prove their point. It's been a decade since Lewis Hamilton’s first ever Formula 1 test. In the podcast, we discuss his legendary career and hope that we don’t lose his talent to Hollywood or music. A Hamilton vs Vettel vs Alonso vs Raikkonen vs Verstappen battle would be stuff that dreams are made of. Would Liberty Media have the liberty to engineer such duels in the near future? We also bring focus to Anthony Hamilton’s views on Motorsport and how expensive Motorsport already is. How a draft selection policy would be good for the sport 1 but could be too cool for Formula 1 to implement. But, if drivers had performance targets, Kimi Raikkonen would’ve been shown the door this year. Formula 1 plans to exploit their gaming and gambling potential. In the podcast, we tell you who their Chief Gaming Officer could be, (but no points for guessing the one man most worthy of the Chief Gambling Officer for the sport.) Have you seen Daniel Ricciardo smile all by himself in pre-podium ceremony? We tell you the secret of his laughs. Shockingly (and boldly enough,) Ricciardo has rallied his support behind Nico Rosberg for the Drivers’ Championship title. We have a short piece of advice for the Honey Badger – beware of the trolls this week. Lastly, is the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix the Pastor Maldonado of GP circuits?

Home Industry Tech Apple iPad Pro gets new backlit keyboard; Logitech CREATE priced at Rs 9,995 Apple iPad Pro gets new backlit keyboard; Logitech CREATE priced at Rs 9,995 Adding to the growing number of accessories made for Apple, Logitech has officially unveiled its CREATE Backlit Keyboard for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro priced at Rs. 9,995. By: FE Online | Published: September 27, 2016 4:00 PM Logitech Create is a keyboard case for 9.7-inch iPad Pro with backlit keys and Apple Pencil holder (Logitech) Adding to the growing number of accessories made for Apple, Logitech has officially unveiled its CREATE Backlit Keyboard for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro priced at Rs. 9,995. The Create keyboard Case is a protective case with a backlit keyboard and an integrated holder for the Apple device in all in one lightweight toolkit. Ashok Jangra, Cluster Category Head, Logitech India and SWA said, “Create is like the Swiss Army Knife of keyboard cases.” He added that “It puts all the tools you need at your fingertips, and the keyboard charges through the Smart Connector so you can just set your iPad Pro into a typing position and go. It brings typing on the iPad Pro to a whole new level.” Logitech Create backlit keyboard, designed to work exclusively with Apple’s new Smart connector, is fully backlit along with an edge-to-edge layout. It automatically switches on and connects to the iPad Pro when it is placed in a typing position. The keyboard automatically goes to sleep after 8 seconds when not in use. There is no need for Bluetooth or any other form of extra connectivity. Since the keyboard drives power from the iPad Pro, there is no need for charging it ever again. There is a holder for the Apple Pencil which is integrated into the device which gives an easy access. iOS shortcuts help in accessing the home screen as well as using the internet. The option of adjusting display and sound controls are also present. The retail price for the Create Keyboard for the iPad Pro has been set at Rs 9,995. Apple which had launched the iPad Pro is a very powerful mobile device having a less than a 10-inch screen. Earlier than that the concept of the smart connector was introduced in its 12.9-inch iPad Pro for which Apple had unveiled its own keyboard but that didn’t go well with the consumers as was heavy and lacked backlighting. Logitech corrected those issues and is now selling the keyboard on its online platform. Please Wait while comments are loading...

So far, the service has not been particularly embraced by the healthcare providers around the world and has mostly been used for collecting data from devices like wearables and pucks placed in shoes. That may be about to change as Apple is building improved health record software better able to analyze and understand patient data. According to people familiar with Apple’s plans, the new health record software would be able to understand the implications of the patient data that it was storing. The suggestion is that HealthKit might be able to look at that patient data and offer a diagnosis. At the same time, Apple is also working on new health related apps for the Apple Watch. One of those apps is meant to track user sleep patterns with another app for gauging fitness levels based on the time it takes the heart to fall form peak rate to resting levels. The existing heart rate app is unable to interpret any of the data it collects. The issues that Apple has to overcome before its HealthKit can be used widely from hospital to hospital is interoperability. To facilitate this interoperability, at least in part, Apple purchased Gliimpse Inc., a company that has software able to pull electronic health records from different databases that aren’t in the same format and store them in one place. The goal is to not only help doctors and users find a diagnosis from mounds of health data, but to tie consumer more to Apple products and drive revenue. It’s unclear when the HealthKit updates outlined here might turn up as a product.

This iPhone SE deal could be perfect for you. You can now buy the iPhone SE (64GB) at Smartfone Store for just £389, which is £40 less than Apple’s R.R.P of £429. This iPhone SE features a 4-inch IPS Retina display, an A9 dual-core CPU, 2GB of RAM, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, a 1,624mAh battery, 64GB of storage, a 12-megapixel primary camera, and a 1.2-megapixel FaceTime camera. Buy Now: iPhone SE (64GB) at Smartfone Store for £389.99 What we said We gave the iPhone Se a 8/10 score, praising its compact body, great camera, excellent performance, and solid battery life. Here’s our verdict: “It may not be the most exciting phone Apple has ever released, but the iPhone SE will be a godsend for those who want a high-quality phone that isn’t massive." What owners say On Amazon, the iPhone SE (64GB) has a 4.7/5 score based on 44 user reviews. Users wrote: “The SE has much better battery life than my old 5 had, even when the 5 was new. It is also much faster and more responsive. I love the fingerprint reader and Apple Pay.” “Having had this for a while I can tell you that this handset is a worthy upgrade to the 5S. It is better in almost every single way – it’s rapidly fast – everything happens in a flash and a touch. It’s very stable, and I’ve had no crashes or lock-ups or glitches so far. The battery life is brilliant.” “I previously had an iPhone 5S. This, the SE, is faster, and has a better camera. Otherwise, looks and feels identical. I love the 4-inch form factor."

It’s rare to find a good deal on Apple products, so this iPhone SE is one to grab – a £40 saving is tough to come by. The iPhone SE is particularly exciting because it’s just 4-inches, which will suit Apple fans who weren’t keen on the upgrade to a 4.7-inch form factor. It’s also got a headphone jack, unlike the new (and controversial) iPhone 7. Better still, you’re getting a 64GB model here, so you probably won’t run out of storage space any time soon. By contrast, Amazon’s best price for the iPhone SE (64GB) is £464: Buy Now: iPhone SE (64GB) at Amazon for £464 All in all, we’d definitely recommend grabbing this deal: Buy Now: iPhone SE (64GB) at Smartfone Store for £389.99 Related: iPhone 8 Watch: iPhone SE review Have you spotted any great tech deals recently?

Andrew Ross Sorkin DEALBOOK SEPT. 26, 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Donald J. Trump spoke before the Economic Club of New York earlier this month. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times Should it come as a surprise that not one chief executive among the Fortune 100 has donated money to Donald Trump’s campaign? That was the news reported by The Wall Street Journal over the weekend after tabulating the latest donation disclosures through August. Mr. Trump’s supporters trumpeted, excuse the pun, the lack of donations from the nation’s largest companies as a badge of honor. Big business, they say, has failed the country, so why would their guy want its support? But the logic of this argument is backward. Mr. Trump has campaigned as a successful businessman, a brilliant negotiator and someone, as he said in his own words, who can “get along with people.” He has contended that his economic policies will unleash unheard-of levels of growth — as much as 6 percent. He plans to lower corporate taxes, remove regulations and allow companies to repatriate cash held overseas. Together, these policies sound like a C.E.O.’s dream. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story And yet here we are: Many of the most successful business people in the country refuse to support him — or do business with him, either. Advertisement Continue reading the main story This is not an opinion. In case there is any doubt, here is a list of companies that in the last two years have publicly severed or reduced business relationships with Mr. Trump, mostly over his inflammatory rhetoric: Macy’s, Univision, Comcast’s NBCUniversal, Serta, Disney’s ESPN, the PGA Tour, Nascar and Perfumania. Those companies, which have customer bases that include broad swaths of the nation that ostensibly look like the electorate, all said some variation of what Macy’s said: “In light of statements made by Donald Trump, which are inconsistent with Macy’s values, we have decided to discontinue our business relationship with Mr. Trump.” As this column has noted previously, virtually no big United States banking institution has done new business with Mr. Trump in years, in part because of his history of bankruptcies and his penchant for litigation. During orientation for new employees, Goldman Sachs specifically used to use Mr. Trump as an example of the kind of prospective client to avoid. Still, based on Mr. Trump’s policies, you would think that companies like Apple or Nike, which have railed for lower taxes and are pining to bring tens of billions dollars stashed abroad back to the United States, would be kneeling at the altar of Mr. Trump. (Apple’s and Nike’s chief executives have contributed to Mrs. Clinton.) Granted, there are his views on immigration and trade, which aren’t in sync with United States multinational companies that manufacture products abroad. But then again, Mrs. Clinton opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership too, so that doesn’t provide much of a choice. Jeffrey Immelt, General Electric’s chief executive, who employed Mr. Trump on “The Apprentice” when G.E. owned NBC, was asked by Vanity Fair about him over the summer. “The Donald Trump that I had a chance to work with, I found to be fun to work with,” he said. “The words? I can’t reconcile with anything I believe in, or that I think the country stands for or that the company stands for.” By the way, this was Mr. Trump’s reply last year to businesses that stopped doing business with him: “Macy’s, NBC, Serta and Nascar have all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country.” (I should note here that I co-anchor “Squawk Box” on CNBC, which is a unit of NBCUniversal.) In fairness, it is worth pointing out that only 11 C.E.O.s of the Fortune 100 donated to Hillary Clinton, according to The Journal. Mr. Trump does have support from some businessmen like Jack Welch, Carl C. Icahn and Wilbur Ross, among others. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But for a group that has historically leaned Republican, the absence of contributions is eye-opening, particularly since at least 19 of them gave to the other Republican candidates in the primaries. There is a good reason, wholly unrelated to political correctness, that the business community has not rallied around Mr. Trump’s economic plans. On its merits, that plan is expected to hurt the economy, according to nonpartisan economists. It is hard to find many serious economists, except a handful mostly advising his campaign, who say otherwise. According to the Committee for a Responsible Budget, a nonpartisan think tank that includes a list of luminaries from both sides of the aisle, Mr. Trump’s economic plan would add $5.3 trillion to our national debt. That compares with $200 billion as a result of Mrs. Clinton’s plan. “Both Clinton and Trump would increase the debt relative to current law— though Trump would increase it by an order of magnitude more, and Clinton’s plan would slightly reduce deficits if we incorporated unspecified revenue from business tax reform,” the committee wrote. None of this column is meant to suggest that Mrs. Clinton’s economic plan will usher in a new age of stupendous growth. It won’t. It doesn’t fully address the need for corporate tax reform, and it won’t bring many companies out from under the regulatory morass that they suffer. It won’t bring trillions of dollars back from abroad. Her plan is unlikely to pump up the economy much compared with the path that we are currently on. It is very possible some of her policy measures could even slow the economy. And finally — again — there is the issue of trade. A centerpiece of Mr. Trump’s economic agenda is renegotiating many of the country’s trade agreements. In a new report published by his campaign, Mr. Trump’s advisers suggest he would threaten, for example, to leave the World Trade Organization to get a better deal. “Without the U.S. as a member, there would not be much purpose to the W.T.O.,” the advisers wrote. There is no question that the country would be improved by better trade pacts, but Mr. Trump’s risky approach could start a trade war that could be disastrous for the country’s largest companies. And the uncertainty of the negotiations themselves could slow the economy and rattle our foreign neighbors; just look at the resignation of Mexico’s minister of finance for helping bring Mr. Trump there to meet-and-greet with the Mexican president. Other countries will want to avoid similar situations in which they could look like they are caving in to Mr. Trump. (By the way, for those who say, “Who cares about what happens to big businesses that outsource anyway?” think about all the money in all those 401(k) plans that is invested in them.) The Trump economic report cites the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group representing big business, and its complaints about regulatory burdens. The suggestion is that big business will back Mr. Trump, since he plans to reduce regulation. Yet it is hardly clear the Business Roundtable supports him. The organization has not endorsed either candidate, and its chief executive, John Engler, told The New York Times over the summer: “We’re just on the opposite side of Trump on trade and immigration.” Mr. Trump, the self-described great negotiator, may brush aside the views of the country’s leading business executives — but perhaps that is because he hasn’t been able to strike a deal with them. Correction: September 28, 2016 The DealBook column on Tuesday, about a relative lack of support for Donald J. Trump from other businessmen, misstated, in some copies, the period of time for which The Wall Street Journal tabulated donation disclosures. It was through August, not through Aug. 11. Correction: September 30, 2016 The DealBook column on Tuesday, about a relative lack of support for Donald J. Trump from other businessmen, misidentified one of the organizations that has curbed ties with Mr. Trump in the last two years. It is the PGA Tour, not the PGA of America.

Close share panel Image copyright Youtube Image caption Please - don't try this at home Got a new iPhone 7 already? Or are you hesitating because Apple lost that headphone jack and everyone's complaining about it? Fear not, apparently you can just drill a hole in the phone, plug in your old headphones and you're good to go. Of course this won't work - seriously, don't do it - but a hoax video on YouTube appears to have convinced some of the 10 million people who have now watched it that it will. Image copyright @TechRax Tech explainer videos are a big thing on YouTube, and more appear whenever Apple launches a new gadget or software update. Don't know how to switch this or that thing on or off anymore? Most likely someone has already made a close-up instructional film, with a friendly voice talking you through the process. Complaints about the absence of the headphone jack in the new iPhone also made it to Youtube in no time, and TechRax responded with "a very simply tutorial" - just drill a hole in it. Comments galore If the phone starts flashing "this is perfectly normal," says the friendly voice as he clamps his brand new iPhone into a vice. "This means you're on your way to getting a brand new headphone jack," he says, taking a power drill to it. He then plugs in headphones in the new hole and music begins to play, though rather obviously, through the speakers not the headphones. The man behind the video is a California-based Ukrainian called Taras Maksimuk, who says he specialises in "smashing technology for your pleasure". In other recent videos he has tested whether the iPhone will survive in a microwave (it doesn't) or five minutes in a bowl of nitrogen (also no). But his earphone jack video, posted on 17 September, seems to have been taken seriously by some of its 10 million viewers, with Maksimuk saying on Twitter: "Legit people complaining to me about them drilling the iPhone 7 for a headphone jack." On the YouTube video itself, there are plenty of comments - some too rude for a BBC screenshot - from angry users saying they ruined their phone and how much they hate the prankster. Image copyright Youtube Comments like this might be a joke, but there's a chance that just maybe some of the outraged people are serious, and actually did drill a hole into their devices. 'Drill a second hole to share' There are also those who appear to be in on the joke, and claim it worked just fine... Image copyright Youtube ... to others who give specific advice on how to improve the hack if you want to, say, drill a second headphone jack into your phone. You could then share your music with a friend or listen in stereo (don't even ask how that would make sense). Image copyright Youtube Hand-crafted HDMI Why stop at the headphones? A common complaint about iPhones is that you can't expand the storage with an external SD card as you can with many other phones. So why not just get out a proper blade and and hand craft that slot - problem solved? With a bit of careful carving skills you might even be able to add a full fledged HDMI port to connect the phone with your giant TV set. Image copyright Youtube The debate on the video goes back and forth on whether you could also use a gun to shoot the hole into your device, whether you should maybe wash the phone in bleach afterwards to clean away the metal dust, to ironic speculations why the phone won't switch on after the operation. The endless string of comments sucks you into something of a vortex. So let's give a last few words to a voice of reason, trying to tear into that delicate postmodern tapestry - by pointing out that it's maybe not that funny if some people actually ruin their phones as a result of that prank. Image copyright Youtube And once again, please don't try any of this at home.

PCs improved their customer satisfaction rating by 1.3% on the most recent American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) Household Appliances and Electronics report. The report includes survey data on desktop, laptop, and tablet computers in addition to televisions, household appliances, and computer software. Customer satisfaction for desktop computers remained unchanged with an index score of 81 (out of a possible 100). Tablets improved their score by 4% to an index of 78, one point higher than the laptop index score of 77. Laptop scores improved by 3% year over year. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the overall leader in customer satisfaction among manufacturers with an index score of 84, unchanged in the past year. Samsung Electronics weighs in at second place with an index of 83, up 5 points (6%) year over year. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) finished third with an index score of 80 (up 3%) on the strength of its Amazon Fire tablets. The biggest gain was posted by Acer which saw its index score jump 11% to 78. Claes Fornell, ASCI’s founder and chairman said: In an increasingly mobile world, smartphones are the biggest threat to PC sales, and tablets have not been the long-term panacea the PC industry was hoping for. Interestingly, the two companies that lead in smartphone satisfaction also lead the PC industry, although they have very different strategies regarding the future of tablets. Apple is targeting business customers on the go with laptop-like features for its iPad, while Samsung tablets occupy their own space as devices for entertainment and browsing — not laptop replacements. Customer satisfaction with computer software rose to an all-time high index score of 81. The boost is largely the result of a 7% boost in the index score for Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) which rose 9.5% to 80. Smaller software programs such as anti-virus and tax prep software improved 9% to an index score of 81. The top appliance makers in the 2016 survey are LG Electronics with an index score of 85 followed by Bosch and Samsung, both with a score of 84. Low prices and new, smart technology raised customer satisfaction to an all-time high of 87, up 6.1% year over year. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Methodology The ASCI Household Appliance and Electronics Report 2016 on personal computers, computer software, major household appliances, and televisions and DVD/Blu-ray players is based on interviews with 3,500 customers, chose at random and contacted via email between June 17 and June 30, 2016. Customers were asked to evaluate their experiences with recently purchased products of the largest manufacturers in terms of market share, plus an aggregate category consisting of “all other” — and thus smaller — companies in these industries. The survey data are used as inputs to ACSI’s cause-and-effect econometric model, which estimates customer satisfaction as the result of the survey-measured inputs of customer expectations, perceptions of quality, and perceptions of value. The ACSI model, in turn, links customer satisfaction with the survey -measured outcomes of customer complaints and customer loyalty.

Pascal Saint-Amans, who is leading the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s flagship Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, said that under the new OECD rules, most of the tax from US technology multinationals like Apple should be paid in the United States, not Ireland. But the European Union antitrust regulators last month ordered Apple to pay up to $14.6 billion in back taxes to the Irish government after ruling that a special scheme to route profits through Ireland constituted illegal state aid. Saint-Amans said that in transfer pricing terms, the bulk of the profit clearly belongs to the United States” rather than Ireland or any other European country, told journalists in Dublin. Transfer pricing, the setting of prices for the transfer of goods or services from one subsidiary to another which critics say is used to reduce tax liabilities in relatively high-tax countries, is a key target of the BEPS process. “My understanding is that the EU decision is based on a certain form of legalistic state-aid reasoning which is specific to the state-aid investigation. It is not a transfer pricing case,” he said. “What is extremely important is that these rules, these standards, be implemented consistently by everybody and that the state-aid cases do not undermine the standard, in particular, on transfer pricing rules,” he said. Saint-Amans said Apple’s tax planning in the period studied by the EU was “outrageous”, would not be possible under the BEPS rules.

(AP Photo/Richard Voge) Share Written by Mike Murphy September 26, 2016 The cheapest iPhone 7 retails for $649, but new research suggests it costs Apple roughly $225 to build one. Market research firm IHS Markit recently took apart the iPhone 7 to price out all of the individual parts that go into building the phone. According to its analysts’ research, those parts likely cost Apple about $220 to purchase, and about $5 to assemble. That means Apple’s newest phone only costs about a third of its price-tag, to make. That’s actually far more expensive than the last iPhone model. Even though the iPhone 7 looks a lot like its predecessor the 6S, it has a few costly technological enhancements on the inside. The new phone has a brighter, deeper display, a new haptic engine that provides a range of buzzes and taps when you get notifications, and its storage was upgraded from 16 GB to 32 GB. (Apple wasn’t immediately available to confirm IHS Markit’s cost estimates.) While Apple has spent more producing some phones in the past—the iPhone 6S Plus is currently the most expensive phone it’s ever built, at least until IHS takes apart the iPhone 7 Plus—the iPhone 7 is actually the most expensive flagship phone the company has produced, costing slightly more than even the original iPhone from 2007, at a time when the average smartphones were giant things with buttons and antennae. Although parts and labor aren’t the only costs that go into the total cost of making a product like the iPhone—there’s research and development, marketing, shipping, and packaging, to name a few—it’s surprising that Apple has spent relatively so much on a phone that many have found underwhelming, and at a time when the company’s sales are stalling. It’ll be interesting to see whether next year’s iPhone, rumored to be a complete overhaul, will be accompanied by a similar bump in cost.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 27 September 2016 | MYT 4:00 PM OECD official says EU-Apple ruling not precedent for future tax cases Under scrutiny: EU antitrust regulators last month ordered Apple to pay up to 13bil euros (RM60.1bil) in back taxes to the Irish government. — Reuters DUBLIN: A multi-billion euro back tax bill handed to Apple by the European Commission should not be seen as a precedent for future tax cases as it was based on state aid rather than tax law, the OECD official spearheading global tax reform said. European Union antitrust regulators last month ordered Apple to pay up to 13bil euros (RM60.1bil) in back taxes to the Irish government after ruling that a special scheme to route profits through Ireland constituted illegal state aid. Pascal Saint-Amans, who is leading the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's flagship Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, said that under the new OECD rules, most of the tax from US technology multinationals like Apple should be due in the United States, not Ireland. "(In) transfer pricing (terms), the bulk of the profit clearly belongs to the United States" rather than Ireland or any other European country, Saint-Amans told journalists in Dublin. Transfer pricing, the setting of prices for the transfer of goods or services from one subsidiary to another which critics say is used to reduce tax liabilities in relatively high-tax countries, is a key target of the BEPS process. "My understanding is that the (EU) decision is based on a certain form of legalistic state-aid reasoning which is specific to the state-aid investigation. It is not a transfer pricing case," he said. "What is extremely important is that these rules, these standards, be implemented consistently by everybody and that the state-aid cases do not undermine the standard, in particular, on transfer pricing rules," he said. Saint-Amans repeatedly said he could not comment on the merits of the Apple case as the commission has not yet published its full decision and because he was not an expert in EU anti-competition law. Saint-Amans said Apple's tax planning in the period studied by the EU, which he described earlier this month as "outrageous", would not be possible under the BEPS rules. But he said there was possible "friction" between EU anti-competition cases and global efforts to harmonise the taxation of corporations under BEPS. "What is happening with the commission decisions is that you have a picture of the past emerging as we are looking forward, and that makes things complicated," he said. The EU back tax bill was for the years 2003 to 2014 and referred to Irish tax rulings handed to Apple in 1991 and 2007. Saint-Amans said he was hopeful that the Commission would make clear that its rulings did not contradict the BEPS guidelines when it publishes the Apple ruling in full. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook has described the European Commission's ruling as "total political crap", while France and Germany have both backed Brussels on the decision. — Reuters You May Be Interested Grab to compensate for unsuccessful bookings Growth of 'gig' economy may change US labour market: Fed's Brainard Microsoft offers EU concessions over its US$26bil LinkedIn bid Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Tourists now prefer lodgings with Airbnb flavour, hoteliers told Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away advertisement Latest News US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Most Viewed in Tech Beware!

(AP) Does “Pokemon Go” have a second act? The mobile phone app was an instant hit when it debuted in July. Crowds stampeded after a Vaporeon in Central Park and people fell off cliffs playing it in California. At an Apple event on Sept. 7, Niantic CEO John Hanke said 500 million people had downloaded the game in just two months. It was the first mobile game to go mainstream in a big way since “Candy Crush” in 2014 or “Angry Birds” in 2012. It was also the first to incorporate augmented reality, a blending of the real and virtual worlds. But the buzz has decidedly cooled. Last Tuesday, the game ended its reign as the top-grossing U.S. iPhone app after 74 days on top, replaced by “Clash Royale,” a popular battling game, according to research firm Sensor Tower. Twitter mentions of the game peaked at 1.7 million on July 11, five days after its launch, according to Adobe Digital Insights. That number had fallen by 98 percent, to 131,000, by Sept. 7, when Apple featured it. Was it all a summer fever dream? While experts say the game is likely to remain popular for a while, it needs to evolve to have real staying power — just like its namesake digital creatures. “Almost anything of this sort is a fad,” says Steve Jones, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “I think we’ve seen the tapering off.” DOWN BUT NOT OUT Of course, an enormous number of people still play the game. Research firm App Annie estimates 1 in 10 smartphone owners in the U.S. are playing; in Japan, that number is 1 in 4. Those U.S. figures are half what App Annie saw the week after the game launched — but to put them in perspective, they still reflect roughly the same user interest as Twitter or Pinterest. “Pokemon Go” has also been good at keeping people playing after signing up. Its 30-day retention rate is the second best on the Google Play store — behind “Words with Friends,” but ahead of other popular games such as “Clash of Clans” and “Clash Royale.” “For a gaming app to be as big as a social network is unprecedented,” said Fabien-Pierre Nicolas, a spokesman at App Annie. “Right now, yes, they’re losing a million players every week. But they get a million new players every week.” The longer users interact with the game, the more time a company has to figure out how to get money from them, Nicolas said. It took a year for some successful games like “Clash of Clans,” ”Puzzle” and “Dragon” to earn revenue of $1 billion, but “Pokemon Go” has already made more than $500 million in revenue in two months alone, according to App Annie. The game is free, but lets users purchase items in the game. “POKEMON GO” EVOLUTION But with social chatter dying down and a new smartphone game based on a beloved 1990s character — “Super Mario Run” — hitting app stores in December, Pokemon will have to reinvent itself. Kari Amarosso, a public relations manager at Arizona State University, started playing “Pokemon Go” with her 19-year-old son as a fun mother-son summer activity sparked by 1990s Pokemon-card nostalgia. They’d go to the mall or to meetups like one in Tempe, Arizona, where thousands of people walked around Tempe Town Lake capturing digital monsters. But the allure wore off after about six weeks, she said. “I lost interest or just plain forgot to play,” she says — and her son has stopped as well. “His route doesn’t change much from work, to home, and he lost interest,” she says. Niantic has been trying to freshen things up. In September it introduced a “buddy” system, allowing users to pair up with a Pokemon to scoop up game currency called “candy.” It has also debuted an Apple Watch app and introduced a $35 wearable device, Pokemon Go Plus, which lights up and vibrates when you’re near a Pokestop or a newly appeared Pokemon. Niantic did not respond to a request for comment. HASN’T CAUGHT THEM ALL Jones suggests the company needs to do more to keep people interested — for example, by adding some kind of social element so that players can interact with each other. His two teenage sons, he notes, have grown slightly less enchanted with the game. “Young people are used to doing social media and there isn’t really messaging as part of the game,” Jones said. There have been persistent rumors that Niantic plans to let players trade captured Pokemon with one another, although the company hasn’t commented on that. The big challenge for “Pokemon Go” is to avoid the fate of “Candy Crush,” says Pace University marketing professor Larry Chiagouris. Created by King Digital, “Candy Crush” because a smash hit; Activision Blizzard subsequently bought King for $5.9 billion. But while people still play the game, the fervor around it has died down. When the game was at its peak, “you were getting invited to play Candy Crush every day” on Facebook, he said. “You don’t get too many invitations to play Candy Crush anymore.” Share with a friend or colleague Your e-mail address: Recipient's e-mail address: Message Related Articles Pokemon Go(es) for domination: Is Nintendo the next Apple?

The company has already assembled a pool of medical experts to help in the initiative.  ( Apple ) Advertisement Apple is reportedly beefing up its digital health technology as it aims to shift the current focus of its HealthKit solution from simple health tracking to a more expansive array of technologies that can track, store and analyze individual's activities ranging from walking all the way to breathing. This development came on the heels of the company's recent hiring spree targeting experts in the medical field. Apple has also begun tapping the expertise of the team behind a small company called Gliimpse. The company acquired this startup, which develops health record database technologies, early this year. The most tangible technology that Apple is said to be developing in relation to this move involves an electronic health record software, which would effectively centralize an individual's medical data. Related initiatives include hardware development, particularly biometric sensors in the Apple Watch. Tech Times has also previously reported that Apple could be making a new wearable baked by its health unit. This is part of the move to develop applications that can collect user health data. For example, there is the case of a health app that can measure fitness levels based on a person's heart rate. Apple has a similar app to date but it is only concerned with measurement while the new app will be capable of analyzing collected data. Overall, Apple now appears committed to expand its HealthKit so that it becomes a tool that improves diagnoses, not only helping consumers but also medical professionals. This goal rests on a capability to provide accurate and high-quality data, allowing Apple and its HealthKit to take advantage of the highly fragmented landscape of health recording in the United States. One should remember that the company has been very vocal about the immense opportunity in the healthcare industry. "If you drive for a while and your car gets too hot, it says pull over. If you need an oil change, it says check your oil. What's the equivalent for the body?" Cook declared last May. "Health is a huge issue around the world and we think it's ripe for simplicity and a new view." Aside from app and hardware development, Apple is also heavily investing on research. For example, the Swimming Activity app in Apple Watch Series 2 was developed using research data that covered more than 1 million swim hours. Research is also augmenting Apple's sensor development, which could take years to develop. There are those who believe that Apple is likely to concentrate more on the software side as the manufacture of medical sensors requires certification from the Food and Drug Administration.
