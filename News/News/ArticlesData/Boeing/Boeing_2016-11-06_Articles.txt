Share & Embed Air Force Electronic Warfare Upgrade to F-15 Designed to Help Fighter Stay in Front of Chinese J-10 Kris Osborn 11/07/2016 / Originally published onWarrior The US Air Force is vigorously upgrading the 1980s-era F-15 fighter by giving new weapons and sensors in the hope of maintaining air-to-air superiority over the Chinese J-10 equivalent. The Air Force is reving up electronic warfare upgrades for its F-15 fighter as a way to better protect against enemy fire and electronic attacks, service officials said. Boeing has secured a $478 million deal to continue work on a new technology called with a system called the Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System, or EPAWSS.  “This allows the aircraft to identify a threat and actively prosecute that threat through avoidance, deception or jamming techniques,” Mike Gibbons, Vice President of the Boeing F-15 program, told Scout Warrior in an interview a few months ago.   These updated EW capabilities replace the Tactical Electronic Warfare Suite, which has been used since the 1980s, not long after the F-15 first deployed. The service plans to operate the fleet until the mid-2040’s, so an overhaul of the Eagle’s electronic systems helps maintain U.S. air supremacy, the contract announcement said.  Boeing won the initial contract for the EPAWSS project last year  and hired BAE Systems as the primary subcontractor.  Overall, the US Air Force is vigorously upgrading the 1980s-era F-15 fighter by giving new weapons and sensors in the hope of maintaining air-to-air superiority over the Chinese J-10 equivalent. The multi-pronged effort not only includes the current addition of electronic warfare technology but also extends to super-fast high-speed computers, infrared search and track enemy targeting systems, increased networking ability and upgraded weapons-firing capability, Air Force and Boeing officials said. “The Air Force plans to keep the F-15 fleet in service until the mid-2040’s.  Many of the F-15 systems date back to the 1970’s and must be upgraded if the aircraft is to remain operationally effective. Various upgrades will be complete as early as 2021 for the F-15C AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar and as late as 2032 for the various EW (electronic warfare) upgrades,” Air Force spokesman Maj. Rob Leese told Scout Warrior a few months ago.  The Air Force currently operates roughly 400 F-15C, D and E variants. A key impetus for the upgrade was well articulate in a Congressional report on the US and China in 2014. (US-China Economic and Security Review Commission --www.uscc.gov). Among other things, the report cited rapid Chinese technological progress and explained that the US margin of superiority has massively decreased since the 1980s. As an example, the report said that in the 1980s, the US F-15 was vastly superior to the Chinese equivalent – the J-10. However, Chinese technical advances in recent years have considerably narrowed that gap to the point where the Chinese J-10 is now roughly comparable to the US F-15, the report explained. Air Force and Boeing developers maintain that ongoing upgrades to the F-15 will ensure that this equivalence is not the case and that, instead, they will ensure the superiority of the F-15. Among the upgrades is an ongoing effort to equip the F-15 with the fastest jet-computer processer in the world, called the Advanced Display Core Processor, or ADCPII. “It is capable of processing 87 billion instructions per second of computing throughput, translating into faster and more reliable mission processing capability for an aircrew,” Boeing spokesman Randy Jackson told Scout Warrior. High tech targeting and tracking technology is also being integrated onto the F-15, Gibbons added. This includes the addition of a passive long-range sensor called Infrared Search and Track, or IRST. The technology is also being engineered into the Navy F-18 Super Hornet. The technology can detect the heat signature, often called infrared emissions, of enemy aircraft. “The system can simultaneously track multiple targets and provide a highly effective air-to-air targeting capability, even when encountering advanced threats equipped with radar-jamming technology,” Navy officials said. IRST also provides an alternate air-to-air targeting system in a high threat electronic attack environment, Navy, Air Force and industry developers said. The F-15 is also being engineered for additional speed and range, along with weapons-firing ability. The weapons-carrying ability is being increased from 8 up to 16 weapons; this includes an ability to fire an AIM-9x or AIM-120 missile. In addition, upgrades to the aircraft include adding an increased ability to integrate or accommodate new emerging weapons systems as they become available. This is being done through both hardware and software-oriented “open standards” IP protocol and architecture. The aircraft is also getting a “fly-by-wire” automated flight control system. “Fly by wire means when the pilot provides the input - straight to a computer than then determines how to have the aircraft perform the way it wants - provides electrical signals for the more quickly and more safely move from point to point as opposed to using a mechanical controls stick,” Gibbons explained. Along with these weapons upgrades and other modifications, the F-15 is also getting upgrades to the pilot’s digital helmet and some radar signature reducing, or stealthy characteristics. However, at the same time, the F-15 is not a stealthy aircraft and is expected to be used in combat environments in what is called “less contested” environments where the Air Force already has a margin of air superiority over advanced enemy air defenses.  For this reason, the F-15 will also be increasing networked so as to better support existing 5th-generation platforms such as the F-22 and F-35, Air Force officials said. The intent of these F-15 upgrades is to effectively perform the missions assigned to the F-15 fleet, which are to support the F-22 in providing air superiority and the F-35 in providing precision attack capabilities, Leese said. “While these upgrades will not make these aircraft equivalent to 5th generation fighters, they will allow the F-15 to support 5th generation fighters in performing their missions, and will also allow F-15s to assume missions in more permissive environments where capabilities of 5th generation fighters are not required,” Leese added. Gibbons added that the upgrades to the F-15 will ensure that the fighter aircraft remains superior to its Chinese equivalent.    “The F-15 as a vital platform that still has a capability that cannot be matched in terms of ability to fly high, fly fast, go very far carry a lot. It is an air dominance machine,” Gibbons explained.   Kris Osborn can be reached at Kris.Osborn@Scout.com.

Lufthansa and International Airlines Group both plan to cut back on new aircraft purchases in the coming years. But Boeing and Airbus will be just fine. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Nov 7, 2016 at 4:40PM Last week, two of the largest European airline companies -- British Airways parent International Airlines Group (IAG) and Deutsche Lufthansa (NASDAQOTH:DLAKY) -- announced plans to reduce their aircraft spending. Under pressure due to high labor costs, the strong dollar, and vicious competition from budget carriers, both companies want to save money by keeping older planes in service while bringing in some used aircraft. Obviously, this isn't good news for Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus (NASDAQOTH:EADSY). Both aircraft manufacturers certainly preferred the order frenzy of a few years ago. Nevertheless, these moves by airlines to reduce capital spending aren't quite as disastrous for Boeing and Airbus as they may appear to be on the surface. Order deferrals by Lufthansa and IAG won't hurt Boeing and Airbus too much. Image source: Boeing. What the airlines are doing Last Wednesday, in conjunction with Lufthansa's Q3 earnings report, CEO Carsten Spohr stated that the company was looking to buy more used aircraft in the coming years. This would allow it to reduce its capital expenditures after 2017. Spohr explained that the combination of low fuel prices, new programs to extend the useful lives of existing aircraft, and good availability on the used aircraft market makes it a great time to pivot away from buying new aircraft. He said that Lufthansa was particularly interested in buying used aircraft for short-haul routes. Meanwhile, at an investor meeting on Friday, IAG announced plans to reduce capital spending over the next five years by 1 billion euros. It will do so by extending the lives of the British Airways Boeing 747 and Boeing 777 fleets, squeezing in 52 more seats on some 777s that will be used for leisure routes from Gatwick Airport and buying more used aircraft -- for both short-haul and long-haul routes. Narrowbody backlogs are huge Efforts by Lufthansa and IAG to reduce spending on narrowbody aircraft won't hurt Boeing at all -- both companies use Airbus A320-family planes for short-haul routes. However, Airbus doesn't have much to worry about, either. It has a backlog of roughly 5,500 firm orders for A320-family aircraft. That represents more than 10 years of output at today's production rate. Airbus plans to increase A320-family output over the next few years, but even at the peak production rate of 60 per month, it would take eight years to build that many planes. Airbus has a massive order backlog for the A320neo family. Image source: Airbus. Thus, if a few dozen orders are deferred, it won't impact Airbus' production plans. If anything, it could be helpful by opening up scarce A320neo slots over the next several years. Furthermore, the austerity moves at Lufthansa and IAG are largely a response to expansion by European budget carriers like Ryanair, EasyJet, and Norwegian Air Shuttle. Boeing and Airbus are happy to sell lots of new 737s and A320s to those up-and-coming carriers, even if it means selling fewer to established airlines. Widebodies will be replaced eventually In the widebody market, order backlogs tend to be shorter. Thus, deferrals are more likely to negatively impact production. However, Lufthansa is making most of its adjustments on the narrowbody side of its fleet. With a large number of aging four-engine A340s and 747s in its fleet, Lufthansa probably wants to take delivery of the Airbus A350 and Boeing 777X aircraft it has ordered to replace them. Lufthansa still wants to retire its aging 747-400s relatively soon. Image source: The Motley Fool. IAG subsidiary British Airways seems more interested in keeping older widebodies in service and buying used widebodies. As a result, it is reviewing its orders for Boeing 787s and A350s between now and 2020. Fortunately, those models have longer backlogs than the A330 and 777 families, which haven't been selling as well recently. Boeing is nearly sold out on the 787 until 2020, while Airbus' A350 backlog stretches even longer. Additionally, while British Airways is extending the lives of its 747 and 777 fleets, those planes will need to be replaced eventually. All of its 747s were built in 1999 and earlier, which means the last ones will probably leave its fleet around 2025. Meanwhile, most of British Airways' 777s were built between 1995 and 2001 and will become ripe for retirement in the mid-2020s. Thus, while British Airways might defer some 787 or A350 orders by a few years, over the next decade it will need more widebodies than what it has already ordered. Even if it goes with used aircraft, that's not the end of the world for Airbus and Boeing. By taking up used planes from Middle Eastern and Asian carriers, British Airways would help make room for new widebodies in those airlines' fleets. Order backlogs are a big insurance policy When the last big aircraft order cycle peaked in 1999, the order backlogs at Boeing and Airbus were a fraction of their current size. That made both companies vulnerable to a temporary downturn in demand. Even today, aircraft types with shorter backlogs like the 747, current-generation 777, A380, and A330 have proven vulnerable to demand fluctuations. By contrast, order backlogs for the 737, 787, A320, and A350 aircraft families are quite long. This serves as an insurance policy against short-term demand fluctuations for Boeing and Airbus. The shifting fleet plans at British Airways and Lufthansa will mainly impact orders for the A320 and to a lesser extent the 787 and A350. Both manufacturers are well positioned to absorb some order deferrals over the next few years while waiting for a new replacement cycle to take hold in the mid-2020s.

The government carrier so far had to fly its aircraft empty in and out of the MRO here. Now, in a bid to recover fuel charges, Air India will fly passengers whenever a plane comes down to Nagpur for maintenance and flies back. These will be unscheduled flights available 2-3 times a month with tickets offered at a competitive rate. The Nagpur MRO at Mihan-SEZ was taken over by Air India Engineering Services Limited (AIESL) a year go. There are six MROs under AIESL, but as Nagpur is not a busy airport, planes have to specially flown here. On November 10, the Boeing 777 which had come down for maintenance will fly back to Mumbai. Air India is offering tickets starting at Rs2731 onwards (for first 10 seats) for the flight taking off at 4pm. Already, 50 tickets of the aircraft with a capacity of 340 have been booked, a source said. An Airbus which came in for basic maintenance on November 2 flew to Delhi with 60 passengers on November 5. Such rates of tickets can prove to be a steal for passengers, especially in the festive season, such as now. On Monday night, the next lowest fare after Air India's special flight on November 10 was Rs 5,299 while tickets for November 9 were as costly as Rs 9,500. The MRO here has carried out a maintenance of 10 Boeing 777s so far, which otherwise are not deployed by any airlines on the Nagpur route. The Nagpur airport only gets A319 and A320 planes. The MRO has a capacity of taking in one Boeing 777 a month but, with a recent approval to maintain Airbus 319, 320 and 321 aircraft, there are chances to have more such special flights. On the basis of feedback on the maintenance schedule by the MRO, the commercial section will book slots for the flights and offer tickets at competitive rates. The details will be uploaded on the Air India website, the source said. The flight dates will depend on the completion of the maintenance work. "So far, the planes were coming without passengers, which led to a major drain on the fuel cost. The other MROs are linked to busy airports so the planes are checked in after a regular flight and also fly back as per schedule when the maintenance is over. But it was not possible for Nagpur. Air India chairman has decided to operate these flights as commercial unscheduled flights," the source said. (in a nutshell) The Air India MRO began operations a year ago Nagpur is not a busy airport so planes have to be specially diverted here for maintenance So far 10 Boeing 777s were serviced which flew in and out empty To recover expenses Air India will operate commercial but unscheduled flights from the MRO Boeing 777s are not deployed in Nagpur in normal course The new arrangement will give a chance to flyers to travel in a Boeing 777 from Nagpur Generally the flights will be to Delhi and Mumbai Schedule will be decided on the basis of maintenance work Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

(Bruce Smith / Associated Press) MONDAY, NOV. 7, 2016, 11:18 A.M. Boeing’s retiring boomers underscore U.S. manufacturing plight By Julie Johnsson Bloomberg Twitter Facebook Email Reddit John Rothery said his goodbyes, handed in his badge and walked away from Boeing. He had worked on almost every commercial jet model over four decades, from a 707 bristling with military radar in the late 1970s to today’s sleek 787 Dreamliner. The date, Oct. 3, had been circled on Rothery’s calendar for more than a year. It was the last time that Boeing would bump up pension pay for Seattle-area factory workers before it froze the plan at month’s end, provisions dictated by a deeply unpopular 2014 contract extension. For Rothery, it was the final straw. “I’ll be 64 in November. After 37 years, that’s enough,” said Rothery, a tool-and-die maker. “I was working just to build a pension. As of Oct. 31, there’s no pension. Why stay?” The benefit change could hasten a generational shift as Boeing’s baby boomers retire, a trend that’s also looming for other U.S. manufacturers. The planemaker’s most experienced workers are packing up their tools during critical upgrades of its two largest profit-drivers: the 737 and 777 jetliners. About 10,000 mechanics are eligible to retire from the company’s Puget Sound manufacturing base alone, and no one knows how many are poised to leave. “It’s a conversation that anyone who is close to retirement is having,” said Becky Beasley, 75, a grandmother and body-structures mechanic who helps rivet together hulking aluminum panels to form the 777’s hull. Boeing is well aware of the risks: Shortages of skilled workers from a smaller, mid-1990s exodus contributed to a factory meltdown that halted production of its cash cow, the 737. So earlier this year, the manufacturer carefully structured a voluntary layoff aimed at retirement-age workers, staggering the departures of 1,057 machinists to avoid massive disruptions. “We had that very much in mind,” said Joelle Denney, vice president for human resources at Boeing’s commercial airplane division, of the 1995 tumult. As the date approached when pension benefits would stop accruing, workers had been leaving in a steady stream. “We’re not expecting a big bubble or wave,” Denney said. While Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton argue over the impact of international trade on factory jobs, U.S. manufacturers are grappling with a looming shortage of skilled workers. Almost 3.5 million manufacturing positions will need to be filled over the next decade as baby boomers retire, and 2 million of those jobs could remain vacant because of manufacturing’s fading appeal to millennials, according to a 2015 study by Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute. The dilemma could be especially acute for Boeing, where about 35 percent of the 29,645 machinists in the company’s Seattle industrial hub are 55 or older. By contrast, only 23 percent of the 15.3 million Americans working in manufacturing are in that age group, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. For the long haul, the planemaker is investing in education — from vocational training to programs at middle schools — to try to make manufacturing “cool” to a generation that has never known shop class, Denney said. In the short term, Boeing is stepping up training and mentoring programs within its factories, she said. Some question whether the company is doing enough. “I do think that if people decide to leave en masse, that they cannot replace that workforce,” said Jon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, District 751. “There’s not enough in the pipeline to replace them.” Memories are still vivid of the cascading production issues two decades ago after Boeing offered a one-time retirement incentive with few restrictions. More than 3,700 mechanics, engineers and technical workers cashed out in June and July 1995 alone, creating immediate shortages in some positions. Many later were rehired as contractors as Boeing’s factories struggled to keep pace with a sales spurt. The shortfall contributed to production meltdowns in 1997 that forced the manufacturer to temporarily halt its 747 and 737 assembly lines to catch up. The cost to Boeing: a $1.6 billion pretax accounting loss. This year, Boeing closely managed who participated in the voluntary layoff offer, methodically planning for their replacement and charting when they left the company, Denney said. The measure targeted employees and managers on the cusp of retirement by offering as many as 26 weeks of pay and accelerated retirement benefits. Boeing is trying to make its operations more efficient as it trims spending and automates more production amid cut-throat competition for slowing aircraft sales. The company has eliminated 4,853 jobs in the state of Washington since the end of January, a 6.2 percent reduction. But while Boeing can control who leaves through the voluntary layoff, anyone can retire. That raises a risk of critical shortages of skilled tradesman with an intuitive feel for fabricating and assembling airplanes — among the most complicated machines on the planet. “The tricky aspect for the executives is not to lose too many skilled positions too quickly,” said Leon Grunberg, a sociologist and co-author of “Emerging from Turbulence: Boeing and the American Workplace Today.” “Can Boeing minimize the risk of losing the tribal knowledge?” Those leaving now will receive monthly pension payments of $95 for each year of employment. That amounts to about $34,200 annually for a 30-year Boeing veteran. While that covers basic necessities, retirees will also need savings to maintain their lifestyles, another factor that makes it difficult to predict near-term attrition. Beasley, the body-structures mechanic, doesn’t have a sufficiently large nest egg after 18 years at Boeing. She’s also putting a grandson through law school. “I’m a little concerned about my financial stability when I leave,” she said. “Social Security would barely cover the house payments.” Rothery, the newly retired tool-and-die maker, is looking forward to golf, soccer and road trips in a motor home after wrapping up his career at Boeing’s Frederickson, Washington, plant. His future is secure: 401(k) plan accounts of $750,000 or more aren’t unusual for career workers who saved carefully, Rothery said. He takes satisfaction from training his successor to step in seamlessly, but frets that his transition may be the exception. “It’s the vast amount of experience that’s leaving,” Rothery said. “They will work around it. They’ll still accomplish the task at hand. At what expense, it’s hard to say.” Published: Nov. 7, 2016, 11:18 a.m.  Tags: 787 Dreamliner, Boeing, business, commercial jet, economy, editors' picks, manufacturing, military, retirement, Seattle Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Unlimited Digital Access Print edition home delivery Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

More About: Skilled Worker Shortage Boeing plant in Everett, Wash. Copyright Stephen Brashear, Getty Images Advertisement John Rothery said his goodbyes, handed in his badge and walked away from Boeing Co. (IW 500/9). He had worked on almost every commercial jet model over four decades, from a 707 bristling with military radar in the late 1970s to today’s sleek 787 Dreamliner. The date, Oct. 3, had been circled on Rothery’s calendar for more than a year. It was the last time that Boeing would bump up pension pay for Seattle-area factory workers before it froze the plan at month’s end, provisions dictated by a deeply unpopular 2014 contract extension. For Rothery, it was the final straw. “I’ll be 64 in November. After 37 years, that’s enough,” said Rothery, a tool-and-die maker. “I was working just to build a pension. As of Oct. 31, there’s no pension. Why stay?” Popular Now Top 25 Supply Chains of 2015 Five Rules for Selecting the Best KPIs to Drive Operational Improvement GE Deepens Silicon Valley Push With $915 Million Cloud Purchase The benefit change could hasten a generational shift as Boeing’s baby boomers retire, a trend that’s also looming for other U.S. manufacturers. The planemaker’s most experienced workers are packing up their tools during critical upgrades of its two largest profit-drivers: the 737 and 777 jetliners. About 10,000 mechanics are eligible to retire from the company’s Puget Sound manufacturing base alone, and no one knows how many are poised to leave. “It’s a conversation that anyone who is close to retirement is having,” said Becky Beasley, 75, a grandmother and body-structures mechanic who helps rivet together hulking aluminum panels to form the 777’s hull. Boeing is well aware of the risks: Shortages of skilled workers from a smaller, mid-1990s exodus contributed to a factory meltdown that halted production of its cash cow, the 737. So earlier this year, the manufacturer carefully structured a voluntary layoff aimed at retirement-age workers, staggering the departures of 1,057 machinists to avoid massive disruptions. Related Beating the Drum for Apprenticeships Wanted: A Few Good (Female) Machinists, Welders to Fill the Skills Gap “We had that very much in mind,” said Joelle Denney, vice president for human resources at Boeing’s commercial airplane division, of the 1995 tumult. As the date approached when pension benefits would stop accruing, workers had been leaving in a steady stream. “We’re not expecting a big bubble or wave,” Denney said. Looming Shortage of Skilled Workers While Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton argue over the impact of international trade on factory jobs, U.S. manufacturers are grappling with a looming shortage of skilled workers. Almost 3.5 million manufacturing positions will need to be filled over the next decade as baby boomers retire, and 2 million of those jobs could remain vacant because of manufacturing’s fading appeal to millennials, according to a 2015 study by Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute. The dilemma could be especially acute for Boeing, where about 35% of the 29,645 machinists in the company’s Seattle industrial hub are 55 or older. By contrast, only 23% of the 15.3 million Americans working in manufacturing are in that age group, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Educational Training Investment For the long haul, the planemaker is investing in education -- from vocational training to programs at middle schools -- to try to make manufacturing “cool” to a generation that has never known shop class, Denney said. In the short term, Boeing is stepping up training and mentoring programs within its factories, she said. Some question whether the company is doing enough. “I do think that if people decide to leave en masse, that they cannot replace that workforce,” said Jon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, District 751. “There’s not enough in the pipeline to replace them.” Boeing Retirement Incentive Hurt Production » 1 2 Next Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 4 joycejo on Nov 7, 2016 This is not news to anyone in the manufacturing industry.

Strengthening its commercial portfolio, IAI has signed a strategic agreement with Boeing, to explore opportunities for future contracting that could be worth several hundred million dollars. IAI and Boeing have a 40-year history of working together. Currently IAI supplies Boeing with the empennage leading edge for the 777 as well as the pivot bulkhead, passenger floor beams and door surround details for the 787 Dreamliner. To earn expanded work from Boeing, IAI is committed to sustain required levels of performance in areas including quality, delivery, cost, and supply chain management. In the beginning of 2016 Boeing and IAI have signed a Strategic Agreement. Under this Agreement IAI has been awarded a new contract by Boeing to build the empennage leading edges for the Boeing 777X - the latest and most advanced wide-body aircraft in development by Boeing, expected to enter into service in 2020. IAI will build the 777X empennage leading edge at its Lod, Israel, manufacturing facility, with first delivery expected in the second half of 2017. IAI was also awarded an extension of its existing contract for the 777 empennage leading edges through the life of the Programs. The new contract for the 777X demonstrates a shared commitment by Boeing and IAI leaders to expand the strategic relationship between the companies, and also, represents Boeing's renewed vote of confidence in IAI. Working with the world's leading aviation giant serves as a stamp of quality for IAI's technological and aviation capabilities. In 2015 IAI reorganized its commercial aircraft activities under the newly established Civil Aviation Organization that coordinates the activities of the company’s Commercial Aircraft Group and Engineering Group, which operates in both the civilian and defense fields. By establishing the Civil Aviation Organization, IAI created a center of knowledge and excellence that concentrates the company’s extensive experience in these areas. Civil aviation today accounts for about 30% of IAI's activities and company officials expect civil operations to increase in the future, reaching the level of IAI’s defense operations.  Coordinating IAI's civil aviation activities on a company wide basis allows the company to build and develop an efficient, unified strategy and make the most of the potential synergies between the groups. It enables IAI to streamline operations, reduce overhead and duplication across all operations. IAI has continually invests in expanding its manufacturing lines, particularly in the field of composite materials, supporting orders from Boeing for a number of aerostructures for the Boeing 787 and 777 aircraft, creating potential opportunities for additional packages using the existing modern facility.  Company officials are also optimistic about obtaining subcontracts from other major OEM's, to which IAI has offered aerostructures elements as cost-effective alternative to current parts.  Print Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Fuller Boeing is now the proud owner of a tiltrotor aircraft patent and convertible compounded rotorcraft patent. In its Oct. 25 issue, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's Official Gazette listed Boeing as a 17-time patent recipient. These newly issued patents include chromium-free conversion coating, new systems for paneling and a new fixed-wing steering method for taxiing, among others. Patent applications generally take a few years to become officially issued — Boeing’s taxiing method lists a 2010 file date. But among the patents for aircraft aspects, Boeing's two patents for rotorcraft designs were filed in 2014. Boeing’s tiltrotor design differs from existing tiltrotors by virtue of a low-wing configuration. As outlined in the patent, high-wing configurations add weight and complexity, as well as inconveniences in fueling and maintenance. A low-wing design would eradicate the need for structural reinforcements that prevent the wings from crushing the fuselage during a crash. The lack of structural reinforcements means more space on the aircraft, be it for mid-cabin exit doors without the need for escape slides and easier refueling. Boeing’s patent also covers the use of more than two engines. This way, the engines can be smaller, but still meet functional needs. Some existing tiltrotor designs have the engines attached to the tiltrotor. Boeing’s engines, in some embodiments, could be fixed to the wings. There are many different configurations outlined in the patent, leaving room for designs with different engine configurations. Boeing’s compound aircraft patent outlines a couple different embodiments. One configuration could be a fixed-wing aircraft with a removable rotor. Another configuration could be a fixed-wing aircraft that is small enough to be paired with, and carried by, a rotorcraft. The outlined docking mechanisms would also have the ability to release the aircraft. Furthering the idea of two separate aircraft flying together, the patent outlines a configuration in which a fixed-wing aircraft could be attached to a rotorcraft, with the capability to un-attach, to augment speed and lift.  The patents do not have any mentions of goals or timelines, but they outline various configurations and embodiments of Boeing’s methods and designs leaving many possibilities. A future Boeing tiltrotor could carry at least 100 passengers as a commercial transport vehicle, the patent says, while it could also have military applications. The compound aircraft patent is accompanied by a range of illustrations, displaying different configurations including docking, cargo transport and unmanned aircraft system support.

Almost 3.5 million manufacturing positions will need to be filled over the next decade as baby boomers retire, and 2 million of those jobs could remain vacant because of manufacturing's fading appeal to millennials, according to a 2015 study by Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute.

"I do think that if people decide to leave en masse, that they cannot replace that workforce," said Jon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, District 751. "There's not enough in the pipeline to replace them." Memories are still vivid of the cascading production issues two decades ago after Boeing offered a one-time retirement incentive with few restrictions. More than 3,700 mechanics, engineers and technical workers cashed out in June and July 1995 alone, creating immediate shortages in some positions. Many later were rehired as contractors as Boeing's factories struggled to keep pace with a sales spurt. The shortfall contributed to production meltdowns in 1997 that forced the manufacturer to temporarily halt its 747 and 737 assembly lines to catch up. The cost to Boeing: a $1.6 billion pretax accounting loss. This year, Boeing closely managed who participated in the voluntary layoff offer, methodically planning for their replacement and charting when they left the company, Denney said. The measure targeted employees and managers on the cusp of retirement by offering as many as 26 weeks of pay and accelerated retirement benefits. Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis See how St. Louis stocks are faring Boeing is trying to make its operations more efficient as it trims spending and automates more production amid cut-throat competition for slowing aircraft sales. The company has eliminated 4,853 jobs in the state of Washington since the end of January, a 6.2 percent reduction. But while Boeing can control who leaves through the voluntary layoff, anyone can retire. That raises a risk of critical shortages of skilled tradesman with an intuitive feel for fabricating and assembling airplanes — among the most complicated machines on the planet. "The tricky aspect for the executives is not to lose too many skilled positions too quickly," said Leon Grunberg, a sociologist and co-author of "Emerging from Turbulence: Boeing and the American Workplace Today." "Can Boeing minimize the risk of losing the tribal knowledge?" Those leaving now will receive monthly pension payments of $95 for each year of employment. That amounts to about $34,200 annually for a 30-year Boeing veteran. While that covers basic necessities, retirees will also need savings to maintain their lifestyles, another factor that makes it difficult to predict near-term attrition. Beasley, the body-structures mechanic, doesn't have a sufficiently large nest egg after 18 years at Boeing. She's also putting a grandson through law school. "I'm a little concerned about my financial stability when I leave," she said. "Social Security would barely cover the house payments." Rothery, the newly retired tool-and-die maker, is looking forward to golf, soccer and road trips in a motor home after wrapping up his career at Boeing's Frederickson, Wash., plant. His future is secure: 401(k) plan accounts of $750,000 or more aren't unusual for career workers who saved carefully, Rothery said. He takes satisfaction from training his successor to step in seamlessly, but frets that his transition may be the exception. "It's the vast amount of experience that's leaving," Rothery said. "They will work around it. They'll still accomplish the task at hand. At what expense, it's hard to say." Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Operating income and operating income excluding unusual items were both $6.1 million for the third quarter of 2015. Non-recurring items in the third quarter of 2015 were comprised of a lawsuit settlement net gain of $3.3 million, an unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustment of $1.7 million, and restructuring and other costs of $1.6 million. Diluted earnings per share, excluding the impact of non-recurring items, was break-even in the third quarter of 2015. “We improved third quarter sales, operating profit and net income over the previous three quarters,” said LMI Aerospace Chief Executive Officer Dan Korte. “We also recently announced the delivery of our first Honda Jet aileron and flap assemblies in the quarter. These results demonstrate progress toward our strategic goals. We took another step toward achieving our long-term growth plans by winning an additional $85,000 per shipset in content on the Boeing 777X. With these latest wins, LMI now has more than $135,000 of new content on this platform, and we continue to pursue other 777X opportunities. “We remain on track to close our Wichita sheet-metal operation by the end of the year. Additionally, we retired $10 million of higher-interest notes during the quarter as we work to strengthen the balance sheet and reduce interest expense. These actions support ongoing efforts to improve bottom line results and drive higher shareholder returns, even as we continue preparing for production ramp-ups with our latest investments to expand machining capacity in Fredonia.” Segment Results   Q3   Q3   Q3 YTD   Q3 YTD ($ millions) 2016   2015   2016   2015                 Net sales:               Aerostructures $ 80.4     $ 85.1     $ 232.9     $ 249.7   Engineering Services 9.5     10.8     29.2     36.8   Eliminations (0.2 )   (0.3 )   (1.1 )   (0.8 ) Total net sales $ 89.7     $ 95.6     $ 261.0     $ 285.7                   Income (loss) from operations:               Aerostructures $ 5.7     $ 8.9     $ 13.2     $ 20.0   Engineering Services (1) 0.1     (2.8 )   (28.6 )   (3.8 ) Eliminations (0.1 )   —     (0.3 )   —   Total income (loss) from operations (1) $ 5.7     $ 6.1     $ (15.7 )   $ 16.2   (1) The nine months ended September 30, 2016, include a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $28.4 million in the Engineering Services segment. Excluding the impact of the impairment charge, the Engineering Services segment recorded a loss from operations of $0.2 million and the total company recorded income from operations of $12.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Aerostructures Segment     Q3         Q3     Net Sales ($ in millions)   2016   % of Total     2015   % of Total                                 Large commercial aircraft   $ 47.2     58.7 %     $ 45.1     53.0 % Corporate and regional aircraft   18.9     23.5 %     23.6     27.7 % Military   8.8     10.9 %     8.9     10.5 % Other   5.5     6.9 %     7.5     8.8 % Total   $ 80.4     100.0 %     $ 85.1     100.0 %                                 Aerostructures revenue decreased 5.5 percent to $80.4 million in the third quarter of 2016 from $85.1 million in the third quarter of 2015. In the large commercial aircraft market, higher production rates on the Bombardier C-Series and Boeing 787 programs increased sales by $2.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, which were partially offset by a decrease in sales on the Boeing 747 program of $1.2 million. These trends are expected to continue through 2016. The decline in sales in the corporate and regional jet market was primarily attributable to lower tooling demand of $3.1 million on the Gulfstream G500/600 program and lower overall demand of $2.5 million on the Gulfstream G450/550 program. Military sales on the Sikorsky Blackhawk program decreased $0.7 million and were partially offset by an increase in sales on the Boeing Apache program of $0.5 million. The Aerostructures segment generated gross profit of $14.7 million, or 18.3 percent of net sales, in the third quarter of 2016 versus $16.6 million, or 19.5 percent of net sales, in the third quarter of 2015.  The reduction in gross profit margin in the third quarter of 2016 was primarily attributable to lower sales and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense of $0.6 million and benefits realized from restructuring activities completed during 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $9.0 million in the third quarter of 2016 versus $7.7 million in the third quarter of 2015. The change in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a net gain of $3.3 million recorded in the third quarter of 2015 related to the settlement of a lawsuit. In addition, incentive compensation costs and salaries and related fringes were lower in the third quarter of 2016 by $0.9 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Excluding the impact of the lawsuit settlement gain, selling general and administrative expenses decreased $2.0 million in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Engineering Services Segment     Q3         Q3     Net Sales ($ in millions)   2016   % of Total     2015   % of Total       Large commercial aircraft   $ 3.0     31.6 %     $ 6.4     59.3 % Corporate and regional aircraft   2.8     29.5 %     0.8     7.4 % Military   2.9     30.5 %     2.9     26.9 % Other   0.8     8.4 %     0.7     6.4 % Total   $ 9.5     100.0 %     $ 10.8     100.0 %                                 Engineering Services revenue decreased 12.0 percent to $9.5 million in the third quarter of 2016 from $10.8 million in the third quarter of 2015. The decline in net sales in the large commercial aircraft market was primarily attributable to lower sales on the Bombardier C-series program and lower maintenance and repair revenues of $1.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively. The change in sales to the corporate and regional aircraft market was primarily related to an unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustment of $1.9 million on the Mitsubishi Regional Jet program in the third quarter of 2015. Gross profit for the segment was $1.2 million, or 12.6 percent of net sales, for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $0.04 million, or 0.4 percent of net sales, for the prior year quarter.  The change in gross profit was primarily attributable to the previously mentioned cumulative catchup adjustment in 2015. In addition, the reduction in revenue in the third quarter of 2016 unfavorably impacted gross profit but was partially offset by a decline in wages and related expenses resulting from cost reduction activities completed in 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the segment were $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to restructuring expenses of $1.2 million incurred in the third quarter of 2015. In addition, intangible asset amortization and salary and wage expenses were lower in the third quarter of 2016 by $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Non-Segment Interest expense decreased $0.1 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015.  The reduction in interest expense was attributable to lower average borrowings and was partially offset by a non-recurring $0.2 million write-off of deferred financing cost related to the retirement of senior secured notes during the third quarter of 2016. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $0.2 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to an income tax expense of $0.2 million in the third quarter of 2015. The Company’s operating cash flow was $2.2 million lower in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the prior-year period. The Company’s operations provided cash of $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2016 and funded net capital expenditures of $3.7 million, resulting in negative free cash flow of $1.0 million. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company’s operations provided cash of $4.8 million and funded net capital expenditures of $3.6 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.3 million. Outlook Any financial outlook and guidance, and discussion thereof, are forward-looking statements and therefore are inherently unpredictable and may be affected by many factors.

We feel this measure provides additional transparency to investors that augments but does not replace the GAAP reporting of net income and provides a good comparative measure. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance defined by GAAP and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measure of net income. (2)  In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a net gain of $3.3 million related to a legal settlement. The gain realized from the settlement offsets expenses of $1.9 million that were recorded as a favorable adjustment to EBITDA when incurred in prior quarters.  For consistency, the above table reflects only $1.9 million of the net gain as an unfavorable EBITDA adjustment. (3)  The Company believes Free Cash Flow is a measure of the operating cash flow of the Company that is useful to investors. Free Cash Flow is a measure of cash generated by the Company for such purposes as repaying debt or funding acquisitions. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of performance defined by GAAP and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measure of cash provided by operating activities. Contact:

REUTERS/Felix Acevedo/U.S. Army/Handout via ReutersMore SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore has agreed to buy new military helicopters from Airbus <AIR.PA> and Boeing Co <BA.N> to replace its aging fleet of Super Pumas and Chinooks, the city-state's defense ministry said on Monday. Singapore has the largest defense budget in Southeast Asia at a time when China's increasingly assertive actions in the disputed South China Sea spur regional nations to step up defense spending. The defense ministry would buy H225M medium-lift helicopters from Airbus and CH-47F heavy-lift helicopters from Boeing, it said. Its current fleet is more than 20 years old. "The H225M and CH-47F possess better lift and reach capabilities and will enable the RSAF (Republic of Singapore Air Force) to meet the Singapore Armed Forces's lift requirements more efficiently with fewer helicopters and less manpower," the ministry said. The statement did not give financial details or say how many helicopters were involved. Earlier this year, sources familiar with the matter had valued a potential deal at $1 billion. The decision on helicopters was initially delayed after the crash in April of a civilian Airbus Super Puma.

Aeromexico: slightly higher 2017 capacity growth as confidence of Delta JV approval remains high CAPA > Aviation Analysis > Aeromexico: slightly higher 2017 capacity growth as confidence of Delta JV approval remains high 6-Nov-2016 Tweet © CAPA Mexico’s largest airline, Aeromexico, plans slightly higher capacity growth in 2016, mostly driven by added frequencies to its long haul markets in Asia and Europe. Its preliminary guidance shows an ASK increase in the low single digits versus 8% growth in 2016. Similarly to 2016, much of Aeromexico’s capacity should be deployed to international markets as the airline sheds three Boeing 777 widebodies and adds five 787-9s to its fleet. Aeromexico and Delta continue to believe US regulators will approve their immunised cross-border joint venture by YE2016, and are planning to increase their combined daily flights between the two countries by 43% during the next two years. The joint venture is a major pillar of Aeromexico’s transborder strategy going forward as Delta prepares to exert more influence over Aeromexico’s strategy. Some of Aeromexico’s and Delta’s rivals are lobbying for the two airlines to relinquish more slots at Mexico City Juarez, which could become a factor in the government’s final decision. In the near term Aeromexico’s outlook is relatively stable, despite continuing challenges from the depreciation of Mexico’s currency. The airline’s revenue generation for the 9M ending Sep-2016 was favourable, driven by increases in yields and load factors. NOTE: This report was prepared before the DoT issued its decision in the Aeromexico-Delta joint venture Aeromexico plans low double-digit capacity growth in 2017 as more widebodies arrive Aeromexico recently offered preliminary capacity guidance of growth in the low double digits for 2017, compared with an 8% increase in 2016. Between 2013 and 2015 Aeromexico’s average annual ASK growth was 9.6%. Aeromexico Group annual ASKs: 2013 to late 2016 Source: CAPA - Centre for Aviation and airline group reports. The company ended 3Q2016 with 131 aircraft and plans to grow its fleet to 140 aircraft by YE2017. Aeromexico is expanding its Boeing 787-9 widebody fleet by five aircraft and shedding three Boeing 777s as part of a fleet simplification programme. The airline plans to exit 777 operations by YE2017, or early 2018. Aeromexico's fleet composition as of 3Q2016 Source: Grupo Aeromexico.

Note: This profile only uses data sourced from majority-owned subsidiaries Aeromexico plans to bolster frequencies on long haul international routes in 2017 Aeromexico has estimated its domestic capacity growth should increase in the high single digits in 2017, with the bulk of its capacity being directed to international markets. The airline plans to increase frequencies in several long haul markets to Europe and Asia, beginning in the summer of 2017. From Mexico City to London Heathrow and Amsterdam Aeromexico is increasing weekly frequencies from three to six, and adding two weekly frequencies to Madrid for a total of 12. In Asia Aeromexico plans to grow weekly frequencies from Mexico City to Tokyo Narita from five to seven, and is increasing its weekly frequencies from Mexico’s capital to Shanghai from three to five. Aeromexico debuted long haul flights to Amsterdam and Tokyo Narita in 2016, and has served the other routes with planned frequency expansions for a number of years. So far Aeromexico has plans to add just a single long haul market in 2017, which is three weekly flights to Seoul in the second quarter of the year. Seoul is a hub for Aeromexico’s fellow SkyTeam member Korean Airlines, so presumably Aeromexico should have the capability to market beyond destinations from Seoul through a partnership with Korean. Aeromexico has the advantage of its stature as the only Mexico-based airline offering long haul flights from Mexico to Europe and Asia, and its expansion into those regions during the past couple of years reflects the airline’s efforts to create blanket network coverage. International routes are a major driver of Aeromexico’s revenue growth, and its growing long haul network is a significant component of its international revenue. During 3Q2016 Aeromexico’s international revenues grew nearly 17% year-on-year, and represented 51% of the company’s total revenues. Volaris ups competition with Aeromexico on transborder routes from Mexico City in 2017 Aeromexico’s planned new transborder routes for 2016 include service from Mexico City Juarez to Austin and Monterrey to Detroit – a hub for its SkyTeam partner Delta. Aeromexico is uncontested on service to Austin, and is operating alongside Delta on services between Monterrey and Detroit. The company is the largest US transborder operator among Mexican airlines, holding a 57% passenger market share from Jan-2016 to Aug-2016.

Both US and Mexican airlines are working to take advantage of a new bilateral between the two countries that lifts the restrictions on the number of airlines operating on certain routes. Aeromexico executives were recently queried about the changing competitive dynamics due to the loosened bilateral. The company concluded that a lot of additional capacity was being deployed from leisure markets, including Cancun, Los Cabos and Puerto Vallarta. But Aeromexico’s rival Volaris is taking advantage of the new bilateral to enter into more contested transborder markets during early 2017. The ULCC plans to introduce service from Mexico City Juarez to Miami, New York JFK, Houston Intercontinental and San Francisco. Aeromexico operates in all those markets and holds a majority seat share in two – JFK and San Francisco. The Mexican hybrid airline Interjet also operates from Juarez to Miami, JFK and Houston. American operates from Juarez to Miami, United operates flights from Mexico City to its hubs in Houston, and San Francisco and Delta offers flights between Mexico City and JFK. See related report: Mexican ULCC Volaris makes a pivot into it transborder strategy – into more contested markets Volaris is injecting ULCC competition on those routes, and with its sub-USD6 cent unit costs excluding fuel can likely offer ultra-low fares for a long period of time, which could pressure overall fares in those markets. Aeromexico and Delta have stated for months that they expect the US DoT to approve their proposed transborder joint venture by YE2016, and Aeromexico continues to stick to that message. Mexico’s largest airline believes the tie-up will strengthen its already strong position in the US transborder market, and plans are under way for the two airlines to grow their combined daily transborder flights from 70 to 100 in the next two years. In order to gain approval for the joint venture from Mexican authorities, Aeromexico and Delta have agreed to relinquish eight slot pairs at Mexico City Juarez. Some US airlines, including jetBlue, have been vocal about additional concessions from the two airlines. jetBlue has asked DoT to consider requiring Aeromexico and Delta to divest 30 slot pairs at Juarez to ensure fair access to the slot-controlled airport. See related report: Mexico-US transborder airline market Part 2: Controversy surrounds the proposed Aeromexico-Delta JV It is not far-fetched that DoT might require some additional slot divestitures to ensure airlines looking to take advantage of the new bilateral can gain access to Mexico City Juarez, where Aeromexico holds 41% of the airport’s system-wide seats. jetBlue has been critical that its slot times at Juarez for service to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale are commercially unviable.

Aeromexico charts solid revenue growth, but continues to battle currency pressure As it awaits approval for its joint venture with Delta Aeromexico has a relatively positive view of the its current operating environment. Its yields in 3Q2016 grew 2.9%, and unit revenues increased 7.3% year-on-year. Overall revenues grew 16.5% year-on-year. Mexico’s economy grew an average of 2.3% from Jan-2016 to Jul-2016, but the MXP depreciated nearly 14% agains the USD in 3Q2016. The currency depreciation resulted in Aeromexico’s MXP-dominated fuel costs growing 2.4% year-on-year in 3Q2016, offsetting decreases in USD fuel prices. The MXP has been depreciating against the USD for about 14 months, and to ease some of the pressure Aeromexico has been working to shift some point of sale to international markets. Its USD unit revenues are down year-on-year but perhaps, once the joint venture with Delta is in place, Aeromexico will have more of an opportunity to shift point of sale into additional international markets. Aeromexico's capacity growth underpins international ambitions in long haul, and the Delta JV Unlike most US airlines that are planning lower capacity growth in 2017 Aeromexico is planning capacity expansion, mostly into long haul international markets where, in some cases, it can feed into networks of its SkyTeam partners. Aeromexico’s transborder strategy rests on gaining approval for its joint venture with Delta, which allows for the airlines to  operate essentially as a single carrier in the key transborder market. Ultimately, in order to move forward with their plans, Aeromexico and Delta may have to concede to concessions mandated by US regulators to ensure fair access to Mexico City Juarez for airlines aiming to capitalise on the new bilateral – just as Aeromexico and Delta are hoping to do.

Mexican ULCC Volaris makes a pivot in its transborder strategy – into more contested markets 19-Oct-2016 The US has been a key market for the Mexican low cost airline Volaris since the company launched transborder service in 2009, reflected in the more than 23 US markets the airline presently serves. For many years Volaris’ transborder push originated in other bases outside Mexico City, given slots constraints at Juarez International airport and previous caps on the number of airlines serving transborder routes from Mexico City. But in 2017 Volaris is entering more contested markets, taking advantage of a new US-Mexico bilateral that lifts restrictions on the number of airlines operating on some routes between the two countries. It is upping competition with its Mexican rivals Aeromexico and Interjet on services from Mexico City, as well as with the large US global network airlines. It is not clear if the routes will absorb the additional capacity added by Volaris, but the airline will be the only ULCC operating on those routes, betting it can stimulate traffic with its ultra-low cost model in the already crowded markets. Interjet’s international passengers soar with new US transborder push against Mexican and US rivals 19-Sep-2016 International passenger numbers for the Mexican low cost airline Interjet skyrocketed more than 50% in the first seven months of 2016, reflecting the launch of more than 10 new international routes during that period, and with US transborder routes representing the bulk of Interjet’s international expansion. Interjet is no doubt positioning itself to seize on opportunities created by a new, finalised bilateral between the US and Mexico that lifts restrictions on the number of airlines operating on specific routes between the two countries. Interjet’s rival Volaris has also grown its US transborder passengers in 2016, but it has a different route profile from that of Interjet. Generally, Interjet is subject to higher levels of competition on some of its transborder routes than Volaris, given that Interjet and Volaris offer different products to their passengers. During the past two to three years Interjet and Volaris have been essentially tied for the coveted position of Mexico’s second largest domestic airline. But for the seven months ending Jul-2017 Volaris logged 22% domestic passenger growth, while Interjet’s passenger numbers inched down slightly, resulting in Volaris assuming full command of the second place ranking. © 2016 CAPA Centre for Aviation :: Contact Us :: Terms & Conditions :: Cookies & Privacy Policy :: Glossary :: Feedback :: All times are in AEST (GMT +11)

Travel Business Travel Nothing dense about British Airways’ plans for densification The airline’s plans for an extra seat in each row of economy on many of its Boeing 777s might be a smart move Simon Calder @SimonCalder Saturday 5 November 2016 16:50 BST A Row of World Traveller seats British Airways You may have seen our exclusive story about British Airways installing an extra seat in each row of economy on many of its Boeing 777s – the backbone of the long-haul fleet. “Densification,” British Airways calls it.  Now, airlines generally like to trumpet their news by sending out press releases. But the plans to densify were quietly revealed at a Capital Markets Day aimed at investors, not passengers. Nevertheless a call to British Airways confirmed the plan. Squeezing in more bums on seats in the same size plane makes sense given BA’s rivals to the east (Emirates, Etihad and a dozen more) and the success of Norwegian across the Atlantic. Indeed, BA’s boss, Alex Cruz, made the point that the densification of the 777 would bring seat costs below Norwegian’s 787.  Nonetheless, the move triggered plenty of responses to The Independent. “Funny how for years they've had a strict weight allowance for luggage but suddenly they've decided the weight of an extra 52 bodies is fine,” commented Rabid Raccoon, while Keevil81 added: “The Western world is getting fatter and seats are getting smaller. Doesn’t seem to add up.”  Read more How the big squeeze on BA could affect you John said: “The plans remind me of those old diagrams of the slave ships, the ‘merchandise’ crammed into every available space like sardines. Cavern predicted: “This is a blow for slim passengers too. The curvy passenger sat next to them will spill over even more.” And Steve tweeted: “So the only good thing about BA now is a British Captain’s reassuring voice when you board in far flung places?” Well, no. There is much that is good about British Airways. It is a premium brand with a well-earned reputation for excellent service. And for the two classes of travel that are presently most profitable for BA, improvements are on the way. The high-performing cabins are Club World and World Traveller Plus – or, if you prefer the generic descriptions, business and premium economy.  The World Traveller Plus cabin on board those British Airways 777s is being doubled in size, from 24 to 48. Since its eight-abreast configuration remains the same while personal space shrinks in economy, presumably it will be even more in demand by business travellers seeking space to work or relax without paying the often high fares of Club World. Russ Williams thinks likewise, as he tweeted: “Urgh it's tight enough as it is! Is this a dastardly ploy to encourage upgrades?!” The space race is evident in the seating plans for the new-look Boeings. Space for those extra two dozen World Traveller Plus seats is being created by removing just eight Club World flat-beds.  Read more BA to shrink seat space to squeeze more passengers on to flights Fury as BA launches seven holiday routes from Heathrow BA increases minimum check-in time BA’s business class is what keeps the whole airline aloft, and therefore I sense the airline cares more about it than any other part of the aircraft. British Airways is investing £400m to keep Club World competitive, and is promising a “new ambience to maximise sleep” and “better soft product including bedding”. Don’t tell the folk at the back on the 6,300-mile long haul to Lima. There's no First cabin to Lima – in common with almost all the routes from Gatwick, with the odd exception such as Bermuda. First is in the same category as economy: not performing as well as BA would wish. What’s wrong? “NPS high but paid load factor low,” is the crisp comment on one of the slides shown to analysts. NPS, as you know, is “net promoter score”, a proxy for how happy the passengers are. And “paid load factor low” means hardly anyone is actually paying the appropriate tariff – instead First is the refuge of upgradees (and, from my observation, partners of crew). So the number of First seats is being cut back – to just eight on the next lot of Boeing 787s. And the cabin is being removed completely from “routes with limited demand”. Ben Schlappig, who writes the One Mile at a Time blog, says: “The race to the bottom continues for British Airways”. To me, it looks more like a race to the middle.

PetroTalk Infogram Docs فارسی French فارسی French Iran says final deals ‘close’ with Airbus, Boeing Mon Nov 7, 2016 6:48PM Home Iran Economy Iran’s Minister of Roads and Urban Development Abbas Akhoundi says the plane purchase deals with Boeing and Airbus will be finalize “soon”. Iran says it expects to finalize the much-awaited plane purchase deals with global aviation giants Boeing and Airbus in the near future. Iran’s Minister of Roads and Urban Development Abbas Akhoundi told the domestic media that the representatives of the two companies are making frequent visits to Tehran to put the last touches on the texts of the deals. “Iran is trying to secure the maximum the transfer of technical expertise in the texts of the deals and this in the aviation industry concerns a certain percentage of maintenance operations or even the production of certain parts,” Akhoundi was quoted by IRNA as telling the reporters. He added that Iran specifically would try to include the required mechanisms in the contracts to provide maintenance services for plane engines.  Meanwhile, Reuters quoted informed sources as saying that Iran has reached a deal with a foreign leasing company to finance the first 17 jets it plans to buy from the French aviation enterprise Airbus.    The news agency said the lessor involved could be the UAE’s Dubai Aerospace by referring to earlier statements made to the same effect by Iranian officials.    "We have a deal to finance the first 17 aircraft," a senior Iranian official told Reuters, without elaborating. Under the deal, the leasing company would take over part of Iran's order for dozens of new jetliners and then lease them to the country's flag carrier. A similar mechanism could be used to finance a provisional order for 20 turboprops from ATR, which is half-owned by Airbus, Reuters quoted one of the sources as saying. The news agency further added that talks are expected to resume soon between Iran and Boeing to finalize the US company's deal to sell or lease more than 100 jets to Iran.   Loading ...

Duopolies make for great businesses, and Boeing is no exception. It has a fantastic brand, excellent new fuel-saving designs, and is riding a long wave of emerging market demand for its product as international passenger travel soars. And a Happy Birthday is in order, Boeing turns 100 this year. But the past year has been difficult for BA stock. The strong US dollar has more and more airline customers turning to comparatively cheaper Airbus planes. Following earnings last week, the BA stock price got clipped, falling to new 52-week lows. Is it time to buy or sell Boeing shares? Here’s three pros and three cons. BA Stock Pros International Air Travel Continues To Boom: The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that air travel will double between now and 2034. This amounts to a 3.8% compound annual growth rate, well above international GDP growth or international population growth. There are currently around 3.5 billion air travelers per year, this should reach 7 billion over the next 15-18 years. That’s good news for Boeing stock over the long-term. The fastest growth will come in areas that are less well-serviced by air transportation now. Namely, Africa, parts of Asia such as India, and South America. This should offer substantial opportunities for Boeing to find new markets. Boeing Has A Strong Defense Arm: BA is more than just a commercial company. It also has a large defense arm making a diverse range of products for the US and other militaries. Among them, the Apache helicopter, the B-52 bomber, the Chinook helicopter, the F-18 Super Hornet, and various weapons. It also just secured a new contract for the renewing of the Air Force One presidential aircraft unit. While this isn’t a big dollar contract, it’s hard to imagine a more prestigious contract win than the President’s mobile office. Also of note, the potential election of a Republican in 2016 could free up more money for the Defense Department. All positives for the BA stock price. High Dividend Yield: There’s more to a company than just making great products. Potential shareholders have to ask if the company is treating them well. In Boeing’s case, the answer is a clear yes. BA stock currently pays a 3.6% yield, which is very high among Dow Jones index companies. The company has quadrupled the dividend over the past 11 years, and just gave BA stock holders another 20% raise in 2015. With trailing earnings of $7.44/share, they can still cover the $4.36/share dividend with plenty of room to spare.

Close share panel Image copyright BA British Airways plans to add extra seats into each economy class row on some aircraft. The plan could increase the number of seats on its Boeing 777 aircraft by almost 20%, from 280 to 332. Each row would have 10 seats rather than the current nine. BA said: "We are flying more customers than ever before... To meet this demand, we are updating our (Boeing) 777 cabins to bring us into line with many of our competitors." It said it would also be upgrading its in-flight entertainment systems with bigger screens. There are also reports that BA intends to add a dozen extra seats on its short-haul Airbus A320 aircraft, based at Heathrow. The latest figures from BA's parent, IAG, showed operating profits in the July to September quarter fell 4% to €1.2bn. It said the weak pound had cost it €162m (£145m) in the third quarter of the year. The airline said it expects operating profits for the full year to be up by about 7%, a lower rate than the one it forecast in July. Its lower profits guidance followed similar moves from rivals Easyjet and Ryanair.

(David Ryder/Bloomberg) Published November 07. 2016 11:51AM  Julie Johnsson, Bloomberg John Rothery said his goodbyes, handed in his badge and walked away from Boeing. He had worked on almost every commercial jet model over four decades, from a 707 bristling with military radar in the late 1970s to today's sleek 787 Dreamliner. The date, Oct. 3, had been circled on Rothery's calendar for more than a year. It was the last time that Boeing would bump up pension pay for Seattle-area factory workers before it froze the plan at month's end, provisions dictated by a deeply unpopular 2014 contract extension. For Rothery, it was the final straw. "I'll be 64 in November. After 37 years, that's enough," said Rothery, a tool-and-die maker. "I was working just to build a pension. As of Oct. 31, there's no pension. Why stay?" The benefit change could hasten a generational shift as Boeing's baby boomers retire, a trend that's also looming for other U.S. manufacturers. The planemaker's most experienced workers are packing up their tools during critical upgrades of its two largest profit-drivers: the 737 and 777 jetliners. About 10,000 mechanics are eligible to retire from the company's Puget Sound manufacturing base alone, and no one knows how many are poised to leave. "It's a conversation that anyone who is close to retirement is having," said Becky Beasley, 75, a grandmother and body-structures mechanic who helps rivet together hulking aluminum panels to form the 777's hull. Boeing is well aware of the risks: Shortages of skilled workers from a smaller, mid-1990s exodus contributed to a factory meltdown that halted production of its cash cow, the 737. So earlier this year, the manufacturer carefully structured a voluntary layoff aimed at retirement-age workers, staggering the departures of 1,057 machinists to avoid massive disruptions. "We had that very much in mind," said Joelle Denney, vice president for human resources at Boeing's commercial airplane division, of the 1995 tumult. As the date approached when pension benefits would stop accruing, workers had been leaving in a steady stream. "We're not expecting a big bubble or wave," Denney said. While Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton argue over the impact of international trade on factory jobs, U.S. manufacturers are grappling with a looming shortage of skilled workers. Almost 3.5 million manufacturing positions will need to be filled over the next decade as baby boomers retire, and 2 million of those jobs could remain vacant because of manufacturing's fading appeal to millennials, according to a 2015 study by Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute. The dilemma could be especially acute for Boeing, where about 35 percent of the 29,645 machinists in the company's Seattle industrial hub are 55 or older. By contrast, only 23 percent of the 15.3 million Americans working in manufacturing are in that age group, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. For the long haul, the planemaker is investing in education -- from vocational training to programs at middle schools -- to try to make manufacturing "cool" to a generation that has never known shop class, Denney said. In the short term, Boeing is stepping up training and mentoring programs within its factories, she said. Some question whether the company is doing enough. "I do think that if people decide to leave en masse, that they cannot replace that workforce," said Jon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, District 751. "There's not enough in the pipeline to replace them." Memories are still vivid of the cascading production issues two decades ago after Boeing offered a one-time retirement incentive with few restrictions. More than 3,700 mechanics, engineers and technical workers cashed out in June and July 1995 alone, creating immediate shortages in some positions. Many later were rehired as contractors as Boeing's factories struggled to keep pace with a sales spurt. The shortfall contributed to production meltdowns in 1997 that forced the manufacturer to temporarily halt its 747 and 737 assembly lines to catch up. The cost to Boeing: a $1.6 billion pretax accounting loss. This year, Boeing closely managed who participated in the voluntary layoff offer, methodically planning for their replacement and charting when they left the company, Denney said. The measure targeted employees and managers on the cusp of retirement by offering as many as 26 weeks of pay and accelerated retirement benefits. Boeing is trying to make its operations more efficient as it trims spending and automates more production amid cut-throat competition for slowing aircraft sales. The company has eliminated 4,853 jobs in the state of Washington since the end of January, a 6.2 percent reduction. But while Boeing can control who leaves through the voluntary layoff, anyone can retire. That raises a risk of critical shortages of skilled tradesman with an intuitive feel for fabricating and assembling airplanes -- among the most complicated machines on the planet. "The tricky aspect for the executives is not to lose too many skilled positions too quickly," said Leon Grunberg, a sociologist and co-author of "Emerging from Turbulence: Boeing and the American Workplace Today." "Can Boeing minimize the risk of losing the tribal knowledge?" Those leaving now will receive monthly pension payments of $95 for each year of employment. That amounts to about $34,200 annually for a 30-year Boeing veteran. While that covers basic necessities, retirees will also need savings to maintain their lifestyles, another factor that makes it difficult to predict near-term attrition. Beasley, the body-structures mechanic, doesn't have a sufficiently large nest egg after 18 years at Boeing. She's also putting a grandson through law school. "I'm a little concerned about my financial stability when I leave," she said. "Social Security would barely cover the house payments." Rothery, the newly retired tool-and-die maker, is looking forward to golf, soccer and road trips in a motor home after wrapping up his career at Boeing's Frederickson, Washington, plant. His future is secure: 401(k) plan accounts of $750,000 or more aren't unusual for career workers who saved carefully, Rothery said. He takes satisfaction from training his successor to step in seamlessly, but frets that his transition may be the exception. "It's the vast amount of experience that's leaving," Rothery said. "They will work around it. They'll still accomplish the task at hand. At what expense, it's hard to say."     Next Article Loading comment count... Commenting is closed.

November 16, 2016 1227 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:171705 Publish Date: Mon, 07 Nov 2016 18:49:31 GMT Service: Iran Iran's Airbus jet purchase gets boost from lease finance deal Iran has reached a deal with a foreign leasing company to finance the first 17 jets it plans to buy from Airbus, breaking a logjam in efforts to import aircraft following the lifting of sanctions, people familiar with the move said. The deal removes a significant hurdle to securing the first tranche of jets, following uncertainty over financing and political opposition in the United States and Iran, though the sources caution months of talking have thrown up new potential hurdles, Reuters reported. Iranian officials declined to name the lessor involved, but industry sources said in September that Iran was in advanced talks with the United Arab Emirates' Dubai Aerospace on helping to finance the purchase. "We have a deal to finance the first 17 aircraft," a senior Iranian official told Reuters, without elaborating. Under the deal, the leasing company would take over part of Iran's order for dozens of new jetliners and then lease them to the country's flag carrier. A similar mechanism could be used to finance a provisional order for 20 turboprops from ATR, which is half-owned by Airbus, one of the people said. Tehran provisionally ordered more than 100 jets each from Airbus and Boeing this year after a deal with major powers to lift most sanctions on Iran in exchange for modification on nuclear program. Completing the rest of the Airbus deal depends on receiving US export licenses because of the number of US components in the aircraft. So far Airbus has US licenses for 17 jets. Airbus will unusually be paid in euros, avoiding dollars typically used by the aircraft industry. Talks are expected to resume soon between Iran and Boeing to finalize the US company's deal to sell or lease more than 100 jets: A transaction that could also involve third parties. A Boeing Middle East spokesman Fakher Daghestani said it had been allowed by the US government to talk to approved Iranian airlines and that any final agreements would require further US approval. The airplane deals represent a big economic prize for Western companies and also help the Iranian supporters of a more open relationship with the West after years of sanctions. However, negotiations have been held up by the reluctance of many Western banks to provide finance, fearing a regulatory backlash if there is a new setback in relations. Sources say the government of President Hassan Rouhani is keen to finalize contracts before the end of Iran's fiscal year in March, boosting chances of securing the first high-profile delivery in time for Iran's own presidential elections in May. "We have deadlines to meet," the Iranian official said. A second senior Iranian government official said at least 20 Western airplanes would be added to Iran's fleet by March 2017, followed by another 25 over the following four months. "Our main priority is our nation's safety," the official said in reference to Iran's old fleet and patchy safety record. "That's why the government is purchasing new planes." Iran agreed in January to buy 118 Airbus jets, including 12 A380s, the world's largest jetliner. The A380 part of the deal has already been thrown into doubt after Tehran conservatives objected that most Iranians would not benefit from the long-distance jet. The A380s are only options, one Iranian official said. Around six smaller jets that were originally meant to be delivered this year have also been discarded due to the delays in receiving US approvals, meaning the Airbus order — if completed — would involve no more than 100 jets, the sources said.     KeyWords Airbus IranDaily finance   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Iran confiscates 2 tonnes of explosives from Daesh terrorists Iran, China must boost cooperation in fight on terrorism: Rouhani Syria holds pacesetter Iran in wetland Everton joins race for Iran’s Azmoun Iran defeated by Kazakhstan in Asian water polo championship Iran, absent from kabaddi World Cup final Iranian teams capture Asian youth, junior weightlifting titles French MP: Iran’s role in fight against terrorism crucial Iran: Killing of Muslims in Nigeria worrisome Rouhani: Iran, China must boost anti-terror fight Most Visited Obama vows to veto bill seeking to block Iran plane sales Trump not going to ‘hurt’ Clinton Trump looking at 'quick ways' to ditch Paris climate accord: Report www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/0649 sec

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:10 PM, November 7, 2016 SINGAPORE/ANKARA - Iran has reached a deal with a foreign leasing company to finance the first 17 jets it plans to buy from Airbus <AIR.PA>, breaking a logjam in efforts to import aircraft following the lifting of sanctions, people familiar with the move said. The deal removes a significant hurdle to securing the first tranche of jets, following uncertainty over financing and political opposition in the United States and Iran, though the sources caution months of talking have thrown up new potential hurdles. Iranian officials declined to name the lessor involved, but industry sources said in September that Iran was in advanced talks with the United Arab Emirates' Dubai Aerospace about helping to finance the purchase. "We have a deal to finance the first 17 aircraft," a senior Iranian official told Reuters, without elaborating. Dubai Aerospace and Airbus both declined to comment. Under the deal, the leasing company would take over part of Iran's order for dozens of new jetliners and then lease them to the country's flag carrier. A similar mechanism could be used to finance a provisional order for 20 turboprops from ATR, which is half-owned by Airbus, one of the people said. ATR had no immediate comment. Tehran provisionally ordered more than 100 jets each from Airbus and Boeing this year after a deal with major powers to lift most sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on nuclear activities. Completing the rest of the Airbus deal depends on receiving U.S. export licenses because of the number of U.S. components in the aircraft. So far Airbus has U.S. licenses for 17 jets. Airbus will unusually be paid in euros, avoiding dollars typically used by the aircraft industry. The U.S. financial system remains closed to Iran under core sanctions dating back to the Islamic Republic's 1979 revolution. Talks are expected to resume soon between Iran and Boeing <BA.N> to finalize the U.S. company's deal to sell or lease more than 100 jets: a transaction that could also involve third parties. A Middle East spokesman for Boeing, Fakher Daghestani, said it had been allowed by the U.S. government to talk to approved Iranian airlines and that any final agreements would need further U.S. approval. EYES ON ELECTIONS The airplane deals represent a big economic prize for Western companies and also help the Iranian supporters of a more open relationship with the West after years of near isolation. But negotiations have been held up by the reluctance of many Western banks to provide finance, fearing a regulatory backlash if there is a new setback in relations. In particular they are concerned that the outcome of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election could lead to a new set of sanctions. Republican candidate Donald Trump and conservatives in Congress have heavily criticized the nuclear deal. Sources say the government of President Hassan Rouhani is keen to finalize contracts before the end of Iran's fiscal year in March, boosting chances of securing the first high-profile delivery in time for Iran's own presidential elections in May. "We have deadlines to meet," the Iranian official said. Rouhani, who is seen in Iran as a pragmatist, has been harshly criticized by hardline rivals over the deals aimed at renewing Iran's aging air fleet. "Rouhani wants to secure his second-term election ... Planes are not top of the list of what the country needs," said a hardline lawmaker, who asked not to be identified. A second senior Iranian government official said at least 20 Western airplanes would be added to Iran's fleet by March 2017, followed by another 25 over the following four months. "Our main priority is our nation's safety," the official said in reference to Iran's old fleet and patchy safety record. "That's why the government is purchasing new planes." Iran agreed in January to buy 118 Airbus jets, including 12 A380s, the world's largest jetliner. The A380 part of the deal has already been thrown into doubt after Tehran conservatives objected that most Iranians would not benefit from the long-distance jet. The A380s are only options, one Iranian official said. Around six smaller jets that were originally meant to be delivered this year have also been discarded due to the delays in receiving U.S. approvals, meaning the Airbus order - if completed - would involve no more than 100 jets, the sources said.

Because of its new, more fuel-efficient LEAP-1B engines, the BBJ MAX 7 has reduced fuel burn and emissions and requires less cargo volume be reserved for auxiliary fuel tanks, regardless of mission length. “We are thrilled to introduce the BBJ MAX 7 to the market,” said David Longridge, president, Boeing Business Jets. “We know customers are going to love this airplane. In terms of range, cabin space, cargo volume and operating economics, the BBJ MAX 7 cannot be beat.” The BBJ MAX 7 inherits all of the features of the already launched BBJ MAX 8 and BBJ MAX 9, including an updated flight deck, improved aerodynamics, reduced noise profile, and fly-by-wire spoilers.  Despite being larger and more capable than the current BBJ, the new MAX 7 has the lowest operating costs of any Boeing Business Jets aircraft. “We are in active discussions with more than ten customers for the BBJ MAX 7 and we are just getting started,” said Longridge. “We are very confident that the BBJ MAX 7 will be a very successful business jet and we are excited to introduce the airplane to our customers.” See other recent news regarding: BBJ, Boeing, Jets.

Airbus will unusually be paid in euros, avoiding dollars typically used by the aircraft industry. The U.S. financial system remains closed to Iran under core sanctions dating back to the Islamic Republic's 1979 revolution. Talks are expected to resume soon between Iran and Boeing to finalise the U.S. company's deal to sell or lease more than 100 jets: a transaction that could also involve third parties. A Middle East spokesman for Boeing, Fakher Daghestani, said it had been allowed by the U.S. government to talk to approved Iranian airlines and that any final agreements would need further U.S. approval. EYES ON ELECTIONS The airplane deals represent a big economic prize for Western companies and also help the Iranian supporters of a more open relationship with the West after years of near isolation. But negotiations have been held up by the reluctance of many Western banks to provide finance, fearing a regulatory backlash if there is a new setback in relations. In particular they are concerned that the outcome of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election could lead to a new set of sanctions. Republican candidate Donald Trump and conservatives in Congress have heavily criticised the nuclear deal. Sources say the government of President Hassan Rouhani is keen to finalise contracts before the end of Iran's fiscal year in March, boosting chances of securing the first high-profile delivery in time for Iran's own presidential elections in May. "We have deadlines to meet," the Iranian official said. Rouhani, who is seen in Iran as a pragmatist, has been harshly criticised by hardline rivals over the deals aimed at renewing Iran's ageing air fleet. "Rouhani wants to secure his second-term election ... Planes are not top of the list of what the country needs," said a hardline lawmaker, who asked not to be identified. A second senior Iranian government official said at least 20 Western airplanes would be added to Iran's fleet by March 2017, followed by another 25 over the following four months. "Our main priority is our nation's safety," the official said in reference to Iran's old fleet and patchy safety record. "That's why the government is purchasing new planes." Iran agreed in January to buy 118 Airbus jets, including 12 A380s, the world's largest jetliner. The A380 part of the deal has already been thrown into doubt after Tehran conservatives objected that most Iranians would not benefit from the long-distance jet. The A380s are only options, one Iranian official said. Around six smaller jets that were originally meant to be delivered this year have also been discarded due to the delays in receiving U.S. approvals, meaning the Airbus order - if completed - would involve no more than 100 jets, the sources said.

The airline giant is reportedly trying bring its services "into line" with competitors at Gatwick from 2018. It also plans to “densify” aircraft at Heathrow after that, it is said. Currently passengers will find nine economy seats in each row in the 777s.

The move would increase the population on board flights by up to a fifth and stretch current facilities further. The number of toilets is currently 11, allowing for one for every 25 passengers. The latest move will bring that up to one for every 30 passengers, The Independent claimed. However, BA says the economy cabin will be fitted with new entertainment systems with bigger screens.

He said the move would allow BA to “lower the average cost per seat, charge a lower price and stimulate demand”. A British Airways spokesman said: "We are flying more customers than ever before to our expanding network of destinations. "To meet this demand, we are updating our 777 cabins to bring us into line with many of our competitors and allow us to offer even more low fares. BA announces at IAG Capital Markets Day it is to introduce business class on U.K. domestic routes & increase seat density in World Traveller pic.twitter.com/slcyvC0ITH— LondonAirTravel (@LondonAirTravel) November 4, 2016 "As part of the update, we will also be fitting new entertainment systems with bigger screens. "British Airways continues to offer customers a generous hand baggage allowance and complimentary food and drink on all our long-haul services." Among the other airlines with a 10-abreast configuration are Air New Zealand, Emirates and Air France. British Airways will also reportedly add 12 extra seats on its short-haul Airbus A320 from Heathrow -which will increase the planes seating density to match easyJet's. The move come after BA increased its seat width from 16.8ins to 17.3 ins on its new Dreamliner fleet last year. The move followed complaints from travellers, with at least one claiming they did not have enough room to open the cutlery pack with their meal. However, the firm still hasn't caught up with some of its rivals. EasyJet’s A320 airbus and Thomson’s Boeing 767-300ER also offer 18-inch wide seats and even no-frills Ryanair gives wriggle space of 17 inches on its 737-800 aircraft.

Hot Topics: City Council Opening Justice Sought for Dead Child Kirk Cameron Event Premature Babies Disc Golf Course Mannheim Steamroller CSU Football RH Line Police Calls Corporate citizenship in Colorado means giving back By Anna Zawisza Guest Columnist Posted:   11/06/2016 10:57:02 PM MST In 2015, Denver led Forbes' List of The Best Places for Business and Careers. The Front Range is appealing for its diverse economy, highly educated workforce, amazing scenery and outdoor recreational opportunities. Companies like Panasonic Enterprise Solutions, a new technology and solar energy division of Panasonic North America, Google, and many others are increasingly selecting Denver and the Front Range as locations for their operations and workforce. These trends are expected to continue. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper's January State of the State Address focused on Colorado being perfectly positioned as a national leader in attracting new innovative businesses, a state with impressive public and private economic and natural resource assets. Colorado's tourism economy is among the nation's strongest, with visitors annually spending billions of dollars in our state. And, the governor's new Outdoor Recreation Industry Office will help communities across the state grow their recreation businesses, benefiting residents and tourists alike. Doing business in Colorado comes with significant advantages. Top among these is the high quality of life for workers and their families with Colorado's world-class outdoor recreation amenities located right in our backyard. Part of doing business in our state ought to include ensuring that this quality of life remains sustainable into the future. Advertisement That's where the statewide nonprofit Volunteers for Outdoor Colorado (VOC) plays a vital role. VOC offers individuals and businesses an opportunity to work — hands on — in caring for Colorado's outdoor recreational resources and wild places, enabling our valuable cultural and natural heritage to be preserved. Since 1984, VOC has engaged more than 105,000 people of all ages and backgrounds in caring for Colorado. VOC volunteers have built and maintained hundreds of miles of our state's most popular trails, improved plant and wildlife habitats, planted trees and gardens in parks and open spaces, and restored fire- and flood-damaged lands across the state. Yet individual volunteers are only part of VOC's story. VOC offers businesses tangible and impactful ways to channel charitable community investments and engage their employees in work that benefits our state - especially in outdoor places where they recreate. Boeing — celebrating its 100th anniversary this year — is a perfect example of a company doing business in Colorado that also believes in giving back where its employees live. Boeing employs nearly 2,000 people in Colorado with another 2,500 who have retired here. Beyond its own direct operations, the company spends nearly $500 million, contracting with Colorado-based vendors who supply everything from Boeing's aircraft circuits to International Space Station batteries. For nearly two decades Boeing has partnered with VOC, providing financial support and a commitment of its employees' time on direct outdoor stewardship. This year, for example, Boeing Employees helped to build a portion of the Front Range Trail in Douglas County, contributing 200 hours of donated labor, equating to over $4,600. As the company commemorates its centennial and looks ahead to its next successful century, its experience in Colorado is setting the bar for others to follow, serving as a leader in underscoring the importance of environmental responsibility within its own operations and in the outdoor places where its employees live, work and play. There's no dispute. The future of Colorado depends on a strong business and recreational economy. And, our state's stellar outdoor recreational resources will need all of us to ensure their long-term stewardship and care. It should go without saying that doing business in Colorado means giving back to ensure our hiking and running trails, our urban and mountain parks and picnic areas, and our prairies and open spaces, remain viable places for Colorado workers and their families to recreate and enjoy. Doing business in Colorado? A new resident to Colorado? Take a lesson from Boeing and its partnership with VOC and consider ways in which you and your company can give back to our state to ensure it remains as naturally beautiful tomorrow as you see and experience it today. Welcome to Colorado - now let's all get to work!

Search Menu Skip to content About The Badger Herald Menu Skip to content News Advice & Guidance Opinions & Reviews Lists Multimedia Sports Pot Pourri Dialogue With Desire News Obama clarifies: “I intend to go to Mars in 2030 by myself” Posted on November 6, 2016 by blschuldt Leave a comment At the 67th International Astronautical Congress this past September, Elon Musk—CEO of Tesla and lead designer of SpaceX—announced his plan for SpaceX to reach Mars by the year 2026. Soon after, CEO of Boeing Dennis Muilenburg declared that the first spacecraft with humans on it to reach Mars will be a Boeing rocket. Now, Obama wants in. After the president’s claim this past week that NASA should be able to send humans to Mars by 2030, Obama supplemented his statement in saying, “Yeah, and by humans, I mean me. Michelle and the kids can come too, if they want.” “I mean, don’t get me wrong,” the president continued, “I love this whole Space Race 2.0 thing we have going on. It’s pretty funny that every other country is so fucked that America is racing against itself. Could you redact that? Anyway, yeah, I think Mars would be a good getaway for a while. Maybe forever. We’ll see how the 2016 election turns out.” When asked why Obama wants to be the first human on Mars, Obama responded in saying that he’s “just so fucking done with this country, ya know?” The president plans on training for his mission by exercising for one hour each day, as recommended by his wife and FLOTUS, Michelle Obama. “She’s always saying ‘Let’s move!’. So I always say ‘Sure honey,’ ‘cause happy wife, happy life, you know?” Obama said to his daughters, Malia and Sasha, Thursday night at the White House dinner table. They chuckled obligatorily in response. SpaceX, Boeing, and NASA have all responded to Obama’s addendum in the same way: they’re hurrying the fuck up. “If we could be the first ones to send America’s first black president to Mars, that would be the best day of my life. Fuck, I don’t mean that in, like, a racist way. Ah, shit,” Musk said this past Wednesday at a press conference. When asked about the president’s plan to go to Mars by 2030, Michelle Obama replied, “He can go to Mars once he figures out how to set up that printer he bought for himself two years ago. Yeah, I don’t think we’ll be leaving anytime soon.” Share this: Twitter Facebook Reddit Email Google More Tumblr Pinterest Print LinkedIn Like this: Like Loading... Related Bookmark the permalink.

(Jetstar Airways/Flickr) Related Stories How election night in America could unfold in favour of Clinton or Trump What is this election about? Americans weigh in Striking moments from the Clinton, Trump campaign rallies TPP trade deal 'a continuing rape of our country,' Trump says at Ohio rally Boeing trimming jobs in race to stay competitive with Airbus Hillary Clinton gives support to workers in Trump hotel labour dispute A Washington-based union representative says that while he supports Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential election race, Republican candidate Donald Trump's comments about labour have resonated with Americans, in particular his complaints about the outsourcing of U.S. jobs. Everett, Washington is home to the state's largest employer, Boeing. The aerospace factory, which manufactures commercial airplanes, employs around 80,000 people. But in recent years, the company has shed jobs. Nearly 4,000 jobs were cut earlier this year. Boeing reportedly cutting up to 10% of workforce Larry Brown is the legislative and policy director of one of the biggest unions in the plant — the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. He told On the Coast's Stephen Quinn the job cuts have made workers at the plant nervous. "Wings for the 787 (airliner) are built in Japan. Many significant parts of the tail section for 787 are built in Italy." Brown said. "There are parts made all over the world that previously had been built in America ... They count on that work for their jobs, for their paycheques, their families." He said he appreciated Trump for raising the issue of outsourcing of jobs and focusing on the U.S. economy. Among other things, the Republican candidate has vowed to renegotiate North American Free Trade Agreement and withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Americans head to the polls tomorrow to choose between Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. (Associated Press) "Donald Trump has a real issue that he's raising there," he said. However, Brown also pointed to the fact that Trump has embroiled himself in numerous labour disputes with his own workers. "This guy is somebody that believes that workers make too much money in America," he said. "He's a guy that doesn't pay his workers, his contractors. "This guy is somebody that does not have the entire interest of the community when he is doing his business." Brown said his union is backing Clinton, and believed she would be a "fine president". However, he said many of his union members have values that align with traditional Republican philosophies. He said many of them are advocates of the right to bear arms, the military and tough-on crime legislation — issues he called traditional Republican issues.

At the Forum on American Aeronautics late last month, officials from top aeronautics agencies including NASA, the Air Force, and Lockheed Martin, said we are now ‘on the brink of a new era in air transportation.’ According to the experts, however, bringing this technology to practical use over land will require significant reductions in the sonic booms caused by the craft, and numerous firms are now working to tackle this challenge. It’s said that hypersonic flight, which achieves at least five times the speed of sound, could go anywhere in the world in just four hours.

Folding wings have been used for decades as a means of reducing the space aircraft take up on aircraft carriers and in hangers. The approach was also incorporated into a US nuclear bomber in the 1960s, the XB-70 Valkyrie, but only the tips folded during flight. Engineers hope that their spanwise adaptive wing (SAW) concept will bring folding wings into the 21st century with new technology and materials. They believe that by tweaking the shape of the wing by a few degrees in flight, pilots could find the optimal position to cut through the air with less drag and generate more lift - which could prove key to stability in hypersonic flight. Five panellists spoke at the Forum on American Aeronautics at the Mohave Air and Space Port in California to discuss the breakthroughs and challenges in supersonic and hypersonic flight. The experts say research in the field is now booming after a long lull, bringing these advanced capabilities closer to reality. ‘What’s exciting about aerospace today is that we are in a point here where suddenly, things are happening all across the board in areas that just haven’t been happening for quite a while,’ former US Air Force Maj. Gen. Curtis M. Bedke, said at panel on Oct 27, Space.com reports. ‘There was a period where engine technology had just sort of stagnated – a point where all materials technology was going along at about the same pace. ‘There wasn’t much happening.  'But suddenly, in all sorts of areas that apply to aerospace, things are happening.’ NASA’s aeronautical program is set to focus on a new line of experimental aircraft, led by House Committee on Science member Steve Knight. According to Knight, the US has not gone hypersonic in a plane since 1967 – and despite two unpiloted hypersonic programs, X-51 and X-43, the work was not continued, Space.com reports. But, Knight hopes to see the data from these research programs used to push today’s developments. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Southern Hemisphere recovered TWICE as fast as the North...

Share this article Share 81 shares This past February, NASA granted a contract to Lockheed Martin for the design of an experimental plane to test technologies that would reduce the sonic booms. While supersonic flights are currently banned over land, such an achievement could change this. The agency also recently revealed it is working with blended wings and other technologies to improve efficiency and reduce the environmental impacts of aircraft. Nasa engineers are working to develop a prototype folding wing concept. By tweaking the shape of the wing a few degrees in flight, pilots could find the optimal position - which could prove key to stability in hypersonic flight. Pictured is prototype for testing the concept Challenges Congress and the president have faced in passing budgets has affected researchers' abilities to carry out consistent work, Space.com reports. And, the experts say there’s no time to waste. ‘It is inevitable that hypersonic technologies are going to happen,’ Bedke said. ‘It is not inevitable that we are going to be the country to do it first. But we can be the country to do it first, but we’re going to have to put our minds to it, and we’re going to have to stop the history of fits and starts, of throwing money at a big program, achieving a wild success, and then having no follow-up. ‘Or throwing a lot of money at too big a program, taking too giant a bite, failing miserably and then deciding hypersonics isn’t going anywhere. Neither of those must be allowed to happen in the coming years.’ NASA'S SHAPE-SHIFTING WINGS  Last year Nasa revealed a number of test flights had taken place for craft using a shape-shifting wing technology called Adaptive Compliant Trailing Edge (ACTE). The project is a collaboration between Nasa, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and FlexSys from Ann Arbor Michigan. The wing is able to ‘bend’ through angles from -2 degrees up to 30 degrees. Test pilots have described it as being ‘very smooth’, while it can also deal with hard banking manoeuvres and extreme temperatures. For all the flights so far, the wing has flown in a fixed position on a Gulfstream III jet between these two extremes, to ensure risk is minimal. At the time, engineers said that future flights would enable the wings to change angles while in the air. The breakthrough could also increase fuel efficiency up to 12 per cent, and reduce noise at take-off and landing up to 40 per cent. Just months ago, it was revealed that plans for a revolutionary hypersonic propulsion system have taken a big step toward the construction of a ground demonstrator – but at roughly a quarter the size of the original vision. Reaction Engines Ltd has scaled back its design for the Sabre engine to bring about a demonstrator that is more affordable and better suited to early applications, including a potential X-plane. The Oxfordshire-based firm has been developing a turbine that combines both jet and rocket technologies to achieve rates five times the speed of sound, to fly anywhere in the world in just four hours.  Rather than aiming for a demonstrator that can achieve more than 150,000 lb thrust, the firm will instead now target an engine size capable of roughly 44,000 lb thrust, according to Aviation Week Network. Oxfordshire-based Reaction Engines has been developing a turbine that combines both jet and rocket technologies to achieve rates five times the speed of sound, to fly anywhere in the world in just four hours In the new plans for the Sabre demonstrator, researchers will target a smaller engine similar in size to the F135 engine for the F-35 joint Strike Fighter (pictured) In the new plans for the Sabre demonstrator, researchers will target a smaller engine similar in size to the F135 engine for the F-35 joint Strike Fighter (JSF). Such a system, scaled back due to the slowness of funding, could be used in multistage vehicles or hypersonic craft the size of an X-plane. ‘It is now more affordable, more rapid to execute and will potentially find its first application quicker,’ Reaction CEO Mark Thomas told Aviation Week Network. ‘It’s a quarter of Sabre, effectively. In an application for something like Skylon, the engine would have four combustion chambers connecting to the single nozzle, a bypass system and the same turbomachinery, intake and heat exchanger. FUTURE OF FLIGHT? HOW THE SABRE JET ENGINE WORKS A model of the revolutionary Sabre engine is pictured   The revolutionary Sabre engine could allow aircraft to take off from a runway and accelerate to five times the speed of sound, before switching to a rocket mode, propelling it into orbit. The Sabre engine works by burning atmospheric air in combustion chambers.  It then uses the heat to turbo-charge the engine. At the moment, rockets have to carry liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen to power them and the cost of carrying this heavy fuel is expensive.  The new engine creates its own liquid oxygen by cooling air entering the engine from 1,000°C to minus 150°C in a hundredth of a second – six times faster than the blink of an eye – without creating ice blockages. The revolutionary Sabre engine could allow aircraft to take off from a runway and accelerate to five times the speed of sound, before switching to a rocket mode, propelling it into orbit. A computer generated image of the ground demonstrator is pictured  This new class of aerospace engine is designed to enable aircraft to operate from standstill on the runway to speeds of over five times the speed of sound in the atmosphere.  It can then transition to a rocket mode of operation, allowing spaceflight at speeds up to orbital velocity, equivalent to 25 times the speed of sound. ‘There is a view that you could modularize the engine to a far higher degree, so that you could have four compressors and still have a large heat exchanger. From this point onward you could go completely modular, so if you could demonstrate one element, then it is all about integration.’ Along with a JSF-sized engine for the ground demonstrator, the firm plans to solve the power gap between air-breathing and rocket engines. While the engine is still in the design phase, the firm plans to see three main test phases stretching into the 2020s. It’s hoped that the first test will take place within the next 12-15 months, the CEO tells AWN, with a focus on the heat exchanger and the core. Here, a concept of the Skylon spaceplane using the engine is shown. But now, Reaction Engines Ltd has scaled back its design for the Sabre engine to bring about a demonstrator that is more affordable and better suited to early applications, including a potential X-plane Then, the team will move on to the integrated engine tests in 2020-2021. The system will undergo sea-level testing, and researchers will simulate high velocity air by heating the air flow. And, they will run wind tunnel tests to assess flow conditions. In the third phase, the firm is looking toward concepts of an X-plane or flight demonstration aircraft to put it to the test. The core will eventually be tested in the UK, meaning Reaction will need to build a test facility with a hydrogen/air breathing preburner.      Read more: Reaction Engines Refines Hypersonic Engine Demonstrator Plan | Technology content from Aviation Week Hypersonic Flight Is Coming: Will the US Lead the Way?

They are set to replace the Republic of Singapore Air Force's (RSAF's) ageing Super Pumas and older Chinooks, which have been in service since 1983 and 1994 respectively, and are facing obsolescence. "The H225M and CH-47F possess better lift and reach capabilities, and will enable the RSAF to meet the Singapore Armed Forces' lift requirements more efficiently with fewer helicopters and less manpower," the Singapore Ministry of Defence said in a 7 November statement.

Published: 16:17 November 7, 2016 Reuters   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE SINGAPORE/ANKARA: Iran has reached a deal with a foreign leasing company to finance the first 17 jets it plans to buy from Airbus, breaking a logjam in efforts to import aircraft following the lifting of sanctions, people familiar with the move said. The deal removes a significant hurdle to securing the first tranche of jets, following uncertainty over financing and political opposition in the United States and Iran, though the sources caution months of talking have thrown up new potential hurdles. Iranian officials declined to name the lessor involved, but industry sources said in September that Iran was in advanced talks with the UAE’ Dubai Aerospace about helping to finance the purchase. “We have a deal to finance the first 17 aircraft,” a senior Iranian official told Reuters, without elaborating. Dubai Aerospace and Airbus both declined to comment. Under the deal, the leasing company would take over part of Iran’s order for dozens of new jetliners and then lease them to the country’s flag carrier. A similar mechanism could be used to finance a provisional order for 20 turboprops from ATR, which is half-owned by Airbus, one of the people said. ATR had no immediate comment. Tehran provisionally ordered more than 100 jets each from Airbus and Boeing this year after a deal with major powers to lift most sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on nuclear activities. Completing the rest of the Airbus deal depends on receiving US export licences because of the number of US components in the aircraft. So far Airbus has US licences for 17 jets. Airbus will unusually be paid in euros, avoiding dollars typically used by the aircraft industry. The US financial system remains closed to Iran under core sanctions dating back to the Islamic Republic’s 1979 revolution. Talks are expected to resume soon between Iran and Boeing to finalise the U.S. company’s deal to sell or lease more than 100 jets: a transaction that could also involve third parties. A Middle East spokesman for Boeing, Fakher Daghestani, said it had been allowed by the US government to talk to approved Iranian airlines and that any final agreements would need further US approval. The airplane deals represent a big economic prize for western companies and also help the Iranian supporters of a more open relationship with the West after years of near isolation. But negotiations have been held up by the reluctance of many western banks to provide finance, fearing a regulatory backlash if there is a new setback in relations. In particular they are concerned that the outcome of Tuesday’s US presidential election could lead to a new set of sanctions. Republican candidate Donald Trump and conservatives in Congress have heavily criticised the nuclear deal. Sources say the government of President Hassan Rouhani is keen to finalise contracts before the end of Iran’s fiscal year in March, boosting chances of securing the first high-profile delivery in time for Iran’s own presidential elections in May. “We have deadlines to meet,” the Iranian official said.   More from Aviation EasyJet profit falls as currency woes take toll Berkshire bet on the biggest US airlines Etihad starts hiring additional crew Shaikh Mohammad Bin Zayed restructures Adac Passenger traffic at DWC up 161% Etihad Airways Engineering and Airbus sign MoU Best airlines to fly with in 2017 Air Arabia third quarter net profit rises 26% tags from this storyUnited Arab Emirates follow this tag on MGNUnited States follow this tag on MGNIran follow this tag on MGNDonald Trump follow this tag on MGNDubai follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessAviation tagsUnited Arab Emirates follow this tag on MGN+ MGNUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNIran follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDonald Trump follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDubai follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In AviationEasyJet profit falls as currency woes take toll Business Gallery Kish island turns to be a major tourism hub Pakistan, China launch new trade route Business Videos PlayStrata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedGalleriesVideos 01Etihad starts hiring additional crew 02Berkshire bet on the biggest US airlines 03Emirates retires last Airbus A330, A340 04Etihad Airways Engineering and Airbus sign MoU 05Shaikh Mohammad Bin Zayed restructures Adac 10Images Apple unveils Nike+ smartwatch Oct 29, 2016 1Image In pictures: Evolution of Emirates airline Oct 25, 2015 15Images Inside a Russian precious metals plant Oct 26, 2016 9Images In pictures: World Economic Forum 2010 Jan 28, 2010 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 Play Britain is open for business Sep 20, 2016 Explore the UAE Find the right airport Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News Why expats risk fines to live in bed spaces 'Utter devastation' after New Zealand quakes Viral: Saudi man’s love poem to Ivanka Trump Your guide to tonight’s Supermoon Affordable housing under review in Dubai Best airlines to fly with in 2017 Emiratis in US warned of rising harrasment Indian embassy to take up expats’ rupee concerns New Rs500, Rs2,000 notes not in UAE Close Recommended For You Abdullah opens Abu Dhabi Art 2016PUBLISHED ON Nov 16, 2016 Cultivating tolerance to overcome turmoilPUBLISHED ON Nov 15, 2016 UAE: 'We don't want to see any discrimination'PUBLISHED ON Nov 15, 2016 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

From 2018, the UK carrier’s long-haul Boeing 777 fleet operating out of London Gatwick Airport will feature 10 seats per row instead of the current nine. This will increase the passenger capacity by 52 seats for each of the aircraft. Critics of the plan at The BA Source claim adding that many seats will mean doing away with three of the 11 cabin toilets but the airline says this is simply not true. As well as its principal long haul aircraft, BA plans to reconfigure its short-haul Airbus A320s so that they are similar to those of low-cost rivals like easyJet. After the remake, these aircraft will boast an extra 12 seats apiece. BA is a subsidiary of International Airlines Group and CEO Willie Walsh says the airline is responding to current market demands by increasing the number of seats for flights. He carried on by saying BA would be able to cut its median seat overheads and passengers would reap the benefits with reduced ticket prices. A spokesperson echoed the CEO’s sentiments and said the new cabin configurations would better enable BA to compete with other carriers. The spokesperson did not draw a parallel with easyJet but noted that Air France and Emirates were among other airlines operating 10 seats per row aircraft. BA has previously operated Boeing 777s with 10-seat rows in economy. They were utilised for Caribbean and southern US routes in the latter half of the 1990s, but refurbished to comply with BA standards in 2002.

The shares rose. Profit after tax increased to €912 million in the three months through September from €843 million a year earlier, Dublin-based Ryanair said today. Analysts predicted earnings of €897 million, based on the average of four estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company stuck to its full-year earnings forecast and raised its long-term passenger target by more than 10 per cent. “Ryanair is doing very well in tough times as people trade down to lower fares,” chief executive Michael O’Leary said in a Bloomberg Television interview. If profitability goes up, the airline will most likely continue buybacks, he said. The shares rose as much as 6.3 per cent, the most in more than three months, to €13.54 and were trading at €13.41 at 8.36am in Dublin, shaving the year’s loss to 13 per cent. The discount airline is attracting passengers by cutting fares, increasing seats and adding larger airports to its schedule as it battles against expansion by competitors, which the carrier predicts will depress prices by as much as 15 per cent in the winter. Cheaper tickets boosted Ryanair’s passenger tally by 12 per cent in the first half, to 64.8 million passengers. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Nepal PM phones India’s Modi over rupee chaos Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to ‘fake’ news sites European equities drift higher United to delay taking Boeing jets in US$4.8b savings push Macau sets US$25b gaming target for 2017 below estimates Oil slumps as prospect of Trump victory roils global markets Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Malaysia growth push stymied by banks cautious on loans US stocks decline after rally as election takes centre stage BNM: Ringgit fell against most world currencies in third quarter Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Groin-flashing frog discovered in Australia An in-depth look at Mazda’s SKYACTIV-G engine Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Related Articles Ryanair sets sights on becoming ‘the Amazon of air travel’ with new platform Ryanair to pull investment from UK if leaves EU, CEO says Morocco detains ‘radicalised’ Frenchman after finding knives, gas bottle in luggage Five European airlines launch new alliance Ryanair flies over 10m passengers in record month Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The Air Force tells Aviation Week that the “Williams F107 engine is and continues to be very reliable,” with only two flight-test failures recorded in 1985 and 1990, respectively, but a contracting notice published on Oct. 17 paints a different picture.

Not only is this position is destabilizing in it's own right, but it's a violation of the oath of office that all these persons have taken/would take. These people seem to confuse "deterrence " with destabilization. The ALCM has been in service for decades as a deterrence weapon. The era of relying on free-fall non-PGM weapons was over decades ago. Log In or Register to post comments Tommy on Nov 7, 2016 If the LRSO is destabilising, maybe Clinton and her ilk can explain why they are letting Russia introduce their version of it. The truth is the Democrats have failed with their foreign policy over the last 8 years. That's why Russia is modernising their systems. Clinton was part of that failure, and would be a disaster as President. Log In or Register to post comments CARTooNMAN805 on Nov 8, 2016 NAILED IT !!! Log In or Register to post comments Advertisement Mark Lincoln on Oct 31, 2016 “The current status of the F107 engine in the [ALCM] is at jeopardy due to an aging engine fleet and a lack of knowledge associated with the sustainment of the engine,” ". . . lack of knowledge associated with the sustainment of the engine"? How did the USAF arrive at this unfortunate position? Who was responsible, if anyone? "Having scrapped the last of 395 AGM-129A Advanced Cruise Missiles on April 10, 2012," The tale of the AGM-129A was one of defective specification, bad management, deficient development, poor production quality control. It was the poster child of the shoddy procurement practices which were the norm in the period 1981-1989 and required so many terminations and cut backs in the early 90s. We badly need a replacement to maintain the credibility of the remaining B-52Hs, B-1Bs, B-2s and the B-21s which may enter service sometime. "Until LRSO is fielded, the ALCM has three ongoing Service Life Extension Programs that will ensure maximum viability of the missile until its scheduled phase-out.” Given the USAF track record for late development and cost overruns we had better hope a fourth SLEP is in the planning for the AGM-86B.

What fools. Log In or Register to post comments Mark Lincoln on Nov 1, 2016 "Oh by the way, did you see the Chinese flying the F-22 look alike yesterday?" I have seen pictures and video of the J-20 at the Zhuhai air show and see no resemblance to the F-22. For example where are the F-22s Canards hidden? How are the intakes and engine nozzles similar? Of course the ventral stabilizers of the F-22, unlike the Chengdu J-20s, are so stealthy they can't be seen. "That is why we need an outsider to be in charge instead . . . " "Those who will not reason, are bigots, those who cannot, are fools, and those who dare not, are slaves." - Lord Byron Log In or Register to post comments aero_duh on Nov 8, 2016 That the J-20 has some features not shared with the F-22 does not invalidate the claim that it is a "look alike". The nuance of this may be lost on the non-technical (like yourself?), but there are many striking and important similarities between the J-20 and F-22 that make the original comment valid. You can't dismiss the comment claiming so simply by attacking strawman arguments. You're presumptuous elitism and predetermined political agenda are exemplified in your quoting a romantic-era excessive aristocrat/activist who was no saint. This shows a detachment with reality and highlights your misguided premise that "because someone famous wrote stuff, they must be smart, and thus I'll quote what they said as truth on AVWeek comments to prove my points and belittle the other guy who I am clearly so much more enlightened than". You can't choose your side of the argument and call it "reason" just because you disagree with the other person as your citation implies. It's non-sequitur dumb dumb. This isn't the place for quote battles or locking horns with other intellectuals. You'll lose. Log In or Register to post comments Talyn on Nov 1, 2016 "Oh by the way, did you see the Chinese flying the F-22 look alike yesterday?" The J-20 is not a "F-22 look-a-like". While the front fuselage shares the similar angular shaping it's clear in looking at multiple pics of the J-20 from different angles it's not a copy. Log In or Register to post comments Cosmic Observer on Nov 7, 2016 The story is that the J-20 was designed as a result of the F-35 plans being stolen. The longer range, speed, and bigger weapons bays gives it a considerable advantage. I supported the FB-22 which would have been more applicable for strike operations, and a lot cheaper than a new bomber, or having a tanker in constant support. Log In or Register to post comments WOE on Nov 7, 2016 Only problem with that is, the F-22 does not have large enough bays to carry the B61 nuclear bomb. The air force did not want to use the F-22 for ground attack missions, but, reluctantly have until the F-35 is operational. The F-22 is suppose to be air superiority only platform. Log In or Register to post comments Goforride on Nov 8, 2016 I seem to recall the idea was to fill the gap left by the retirement of the F-117 until the F-35 could be fleshed out. Once it is, I can't imagine the F-22 will be assigned ground attack missions. It's way too valuable as a pure fighter. Log In or Register to post comments Talyn on Nov 9, 2016 "The story is that the J-20 was designed as a result of the F-35 plans being stolen." Actually, the story is that the J-31 is the beneficiary of the F-35 hack. When you look at the two the dimensions and appearance is much more alike than the J-20. Of course, except that the J-31 has two engines. Log In or Register to post comments Spectre49 on Nov 2, 2016 Am I the only one that things, gravity bombs? are you kidding me? Didn't those go out with the Enola Gay (ok, Boxcar) How about we put the nuke on a T Hawk. Those work pretty good. That's right, we did, then we retired it for a missile that is older and not used for anything else, Once again we have to salute the USAF Leadership.

Log In or Register to post comments Mark Lincoln on Nov 3, 2016 "The story is that the J-20 was designed as a result of the F-35 plans being stolen." It is remarkable how much the J-20 and F-35 are identical in every respect. What level of racial arrogance and outright denial of reality has become common around here? Anyone may see that there is NO resemblance between the J-20 and F-22 or F-35. Yet such silliness is proposed. Log In or Register to post comments Cosmic Observer on Nov 3, 2016 Mark you did not read my words correctly. I did not say they copied the F-35, I said they "designed" the J-20 as a result of having stolen the plans for the F-35. The J-20 is a better aircraft for the theater of operations it is designed to fight in. The F-35 needs a tanker and an arsenal aircraft to do what one J-20 can do. We don't need a new bomber, we need the FB-22 or go straight for a long rang UCAV. Log In or Register to post comments Talyn on Nov 9, 2016 "Anyone may see that there is NO resemblance between the J-20 and F-22 or F-35" Actually ML, it's been widely reported that the Chinese J-31 has a resemblance to the F-35. BTW, your comment about racial arrogance on this board is misplaced and disturbing. Log In or Register to post comments Mark Lincoln on Nov 3, 2016 "Am I the only one that things, gravity bombs? are you kidding me? Didn't those go out with the Enola Gay (ok, Boxcar)" No, the vestiges of the Bomber Mafia still insist that the existence of the gravity bomber is necessary so we will spend a billion or more each on B-21 to do the job that ICBMs have been able to do for almost 60 years. If a weapon was in SIOP-62 America needs it now. There were bombers in WWII. Ergo we need bombers today! Next lesson, what America needs to bring back the battleship and cavalry. Cavalry is a unique weapons system capable of almost silent approach, requires no hydrocarbon fuel, and is able to evade magnetic anomaly detectors. We need it now! Log In or Register to post comments Arctic Fox on Nov 3, 2016 ALCM “was a 10-year missile,” said Gen. Robin Rand. “It’s in its 30th year of service and needs to be replaced.” Hmmm... Considering the typical procurement cycle for strategic assets, it'll be in its 40th year of service before the follow-on shows up. And that's if Hillary doesn't cancel the follow-on program, which she likely will. You can't make this stuff up. Log In or Register to post comments Felix A9 on Nov 4, 2016 "Several lawmakers such as Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and some former government officials have campaigned against the $8.3 billion follow-on cruise missile program, saying it is destabilizing and that the mission can be accomplished with existing non-nuclear cruise missiles and penetrating, nuclear-armed stealth bombers with free-fall bombs. " Well I'm surely glad we have "experts" like Diane Feinstein to tell us what is or isn't needed. The fact she thinks a new nuclear cruise missile would be destabilizing disqualifies her right there.

Log In or Register to post comments Mark Lincoln on Nov 7, 2016 The LRSO will gain the US far more for each dollar than the B-21 or a new ICBM.

Log In or Register to post comments Captn Tommy on Nov 7, 2016 This is just the silliest article I have read in a long time. Is the Air Force really that stupid, to let a supply trail run out or to not "long term" work on a replacement engine - fit form and function?? There must be some one in the program office who watches supportability. Now I only work with supportability people like that in the Army and Navy, (having been one once myself) and they were constantly looking at obsolescence issues, the Air Force should have known of this problem years ago. But then, this has nothing to do with Jets or Pilots Very angry Captn Tommy Log In or Register to post comments Dolomite on Nov 7, 2016 Cosmic observer, Often times Mark doesn't grasp the idea you are trying to convey but rather addressing what is on his mind. In some previous post I stated that India will never buy American jet fighters because of the geopolitical circumstances in that region. Mark's response was that India is all ready buying C 130's. Is C 130 a jet fighter in his mind? Some times he is of the rails, give him a break. Log In or Register to post comments Chip on Nov 7, 2016 Without a credible standoff weapon w/ sufficient range, the B-52 is only good for gravity bombs in an uncontested aerial environment. B-52s have a lot of life left if properly maintained, but America needs a new ALCM to make it relevant as a deterrent in a near-peer (and increasingly slightly less-than-near-peer) environment, thanks to sales of increasingly advanced Russian and Chinese AD systems. A stealthy, long range, supersonic ALCM should be a relatively simple engineering challenge, no need to develop radically new technology. Save the B-21 for difficult penetrating missions, and keep the B-52 as a bomb truck orbiting 1,500 miles away from the target.... ....although, the more I think about it, can someone explain what a $500MM B-21 can do that a B-52 with long range stand off weapons can't? Log In or Register to post comments Goforride on Nov 8, 2016 Or, we could do what Jimmy Carter wanted to do in the first place and have 747's adapted with a bomb bay and rotary cruise missle launcher. We would have a stand-off truck and could upgrade the penetrating vehicle until the cows come home. Log In or Register to post comments Power and Peace on Nov 8, 2016 Are people genuinely worried about the U.S. not having a powerful enough nuclear arsenal to act as a nuclear deterrent? The "triad" is gone. Most modern nuclear attack capabilities are classified, but even what we know about about ICBMs and SLBMs such as the Trident II (both have MIRV capability), makes me believe they are capable of wiping any nation(s) off the earth, even with their most advanced missile defense systems. It's also important to remember how strong the United States ballistic missile defense it. Obviously much of this is classified as well, but look at the research that was going on in the 80s and earlier. "Star Wars" was ahead of its time but don't think the US just gave up on it. We should focus on a long range, preferably hypersonic missile that can handle conventional warheads and nuclear warheads in the unlikely chance they're needed.

Log In or Register to post comments Talyn on Nov 9, 2016 The AGM-129 ACM "had" (they've all be destroyed) based on reliability issues and higher maintenance costs. Plus the outgoing POTUS efforts to unilaterally go below the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) limits. Log In or Register to post comments Mark Lincoln on Nov 9, 2016 "The AGM-129 ACM "had" (they've all be destroyed) based on reliability issues and higher maintenance costs." The reasons Talyn were as stated. The AGM-129 was a badly botched program, typical of the defense spending frenzy of the 1980s. The AGM-129 was one of a number of Reagan era fiascos cut by the George Herbert Walker Bush administration for cause. The only platform it was ever clear for was the B-52 and in the 21st century we have more important uses for that platform. A fundamentally flawed weapon that was not worth qualifying on the B-1B was quietly retired so as to cause as little embarrassment as possible. Log In or Register to post comments Mark Lincoln on Nov 9, 2016 "Star Wars" was ahead of its time but don't think the US just gave up on it." It was far, far ahead of it's time. Which is to say never before has so much been spent to achieve so little. Our politically, not technically, resurrected ABM so rapidly and expensively deployed at Fort Greely was quickly turned over to the 49th Missile Defense Battalion, Alaska Army National Guard, so that no regular officers would have their careers affected by association with it. Log In or Register to post comments Power and Peace on Nov 9, 2016 No I agree that "Star Wars" was a huge waste. But if revolutionary technology was developed it would have been made classified. I wouldn't be the least bit shocked if the U.S. turns out to have a laser equipped satellite in orbit. Just because we're developing more ABM technology doesn't mean we don't already have a more advanced technology in place. I just don't see the U.S. having an issue puting a warhead wherever they want on earth. A new cruise missile only cabable of delivering nuclear warheads seems like a waste to me. We certainly have at least one operational scramjet that remains classified. Even if we didn't, it would take Lockheed less than a month to retrofit an SR-71 cabable of delivering a nuke. While the Mig-31 is theoretically cabable of engaging a Blackbird from the 80s, if one were upgraded with the latest stealth and ECM technologies, I don't see any fighter or SAM on earth being able to stop without advanced knowledge of where it would be and when.

The aircraft is a development of the YAK/AEM-130, a joint programme with Yakolev Design Bureau and Sokol Manufacturing Plant of Russia. In July 2000, Alenia Aermacchi announced that it would cancel the joint project and develop the aircraft alone, as the M-346. The M-346 provides combat pilot training for front line fighters with high angle-of-attack capability. The aerodynamic design of the M-346 uses vortex lift to provide manoeuvrability and controllability at very high angle-of-attack using a fly-by-wire control system. The YAK/AEM-130 has flown in prototype form since 1996. As the Yak-130, the aircraft was selected in March 2002 as the Russian AF's next-generation combat trainer. M-346 Master fighter trainer development The M-346 prototype completed its first flight in July 2004. The second prototype made its maiden flight in May 2005. The first low-rate initial production (LRIP) aircraft made its maiden flight in July 2008. The M-346 equipped with advanced helmet-mounted display systems completed its maiden flight in May 2010. The Italian Air Force (ITAF), the launch customer, received the first batch of 15 M-346 Master aircraft. Alenia Aermacchi signed a €220m ($330m) contract with ITAF in June 2009 to supply six M-346 jets. The first two of the six M-346 aircraft were unveiled in December 2010. ITAF designated the M-346 as T-346A which made its maiden flight in March 2011. The General Directorate for Aeronautical Armaments of the Ministry of Defence issued the military certification for the M-346 jet on 22 June 2011. The first T-346A aircraft was accepted by ITAF in November 2011. The second aircraft was delivered in February 2012. The contract also involves a five-year maintenance and logistics support. The M-346 was successful in its first air-to-air refuelling tests and several techniques performed by ITAF and the company pilots.

See all suppliers M-346 Master training aircraft orders and deliveries "The M-346 is an advanced and lead-in fighter trainer being developed by Aermacchi SpA of Italy." In April 2009, Alenia Aermacchi received the design organisation military approval (DOMA) certificate for the M-346 Master allowing autonomous and direct management of the homologation process, including continuation of its airworthiness. DOMA also enables Alenia Aermacchi to streamline M-346 interface with the DGAA (Direzione Generale Armamenti Aeronauticiefficient) and improve internal design and development processes of the aircraft. In January 2005, the Greek Ministry of Defence signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to become a partner in the programme and, in January 2006, Alenia Aermacchi signed an industrial cooperation agreement with Hellenic Aerospace Industry (HAI) under which HAI is responsible for production and assembly of certain parts, including the rear fuselage. In May 2006, Alenia Aermacchi announced an agreement with Boeing to jointly market the M-346. In July 2007, the M-346 flew to the UAE for hot weather tests and operational evaluation by the UAE Air Force. In February 2009, the UAE announced that it would acquire 48 M-346 advanced lead-in fighter trainer aircraft. Alenia Aermacchi will form a joint venture with Mubadala Development in UAE for establishing the M-346 final assembly line. ST Aerospace signed a €170m contract with Alenia Aermacchi on 24 June 2011 for providing logistics support to 12 M-346 trainers deployed by the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF). The M-346 jets were ordered by the RSAF in September 2010 under the Fighter Wings Course programme. The first aircraft was rolled out in August 2012 and deliveries were completed by March 2014. Alenia Aermacchi also provides spare parts, repair and overhaul services, render engineering, and field support services. The M-346 trainer was selected by the Israeli Ministry of Defence (MoD) in February 2012. Israeli MoD placed an order with Alenia Aermacchi for 30 M-346 aircraft in July 2012. Deliveries were concluded in July 2016. The Ministry of Defence of Poland placed an order with Alenia Aermacchi in February 2014 for the delivery of eight M-346 Master aircraft. In December 2014, the Italian National Armaments Directorate contracted Finmeccanica-Alenia Aermacchi for the delivery of three M-346 advanced trainer aircraft to the Italian Air Force. M-346 weapons Armaments are carried on nine external store stations, six of which are underwing, equipped with 1,000lb class ejector release units, and two wingtip stations for air-to-air missiles. The under-fuselage station carries avionics pods or a 300l conformal fuel tank. The system data presentation and control functions of the stores management system use any one of the multifunction displays in both cockpits. Hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls are used to select the weapons. Weapon aiming is controlled by the central main processor, aiming data being presented to the pilots through the head-up display (HUD) or the helmet-mounted display (HMD). "The weapons carried by the M-346 include MK82 500lb and MK83 1,000lb free-fall or retarded bombs." The weapons carried include: MK82 500lb and MK83 1,000lb free-fall or retarded bombs; rocket launchers; AIM-9 Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missiles; Raytheon AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missiles; MBDA (formerly Alenia) Marte MK-2A anti-ship missiles. The external hard points can also carry the Vinten VICON-601 reconnaissance pod, laser designator pod, radar warning receiver pod and Elettronica ELT-55 electronic countermeasures pod. For fighter trainer role, self-protection system functions and simulated tactical scenario threats are presented and monitored on the multifunction displays. For operational roles, the aircraft is fitted with a radar warning receiver, chaff and flares dispensers, and active electronic countermeasures. Cockpit The cockpit is representative of the latest-generation combat aircraft, and each crew position is equipped with raster / stroke type head-up display (HUD), full-colour liquid crystal multifunction displays (three in each cockpit), helmet-mounted display with threat simulation capability, night-vision goggle (NVG) compatible instrumentation and hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls. The cockpits can be fitted with MK16 ejection seats from Martin Baker of Uxbridge, UK. Avionics The avionics architecture is based on a dual-redundant MIL-STD-1553B digital data bus which has capacity for additional systems. The communication suite includes a VHF/UHF transceiver and an information friend of foe (IFF) transponder. The navigation suite includes a laser gyro inertial navigation system with an embedded GPS receiver, and tactical air navigation (TACAN) and VHF omnidirectional radio ranging (VOR/IIS/MB). "The M-346 provides combat pilot training for front-line fighters with high angle-of-attack capability." The flight control system (FCS) is a full authority digital fly-by-wire quadruple-redundant system, which includes four BAE Systems Italia flight control computers. The FCS provides the aircraft with controllability up to angles of attack (AoA) of 35° and higher, g-limitation, stall and spin prevention, and maximum AoA limitation. It can be adapted to various degrees of automation and autopilot modes with reversionary modes featuring automatic selection in case of damage or failures. Turbofan engines Povazke Strojarne L.M. was to be the supplier of the two DV-2S twin-shaft turbofan engines for the YAK/AEM-130. For the M-346, these are replaced with two Honeywell / ITEC F124-GA-200 turbofan engines, produced with Fiat Avio. There is also a closed-circuit self-contained aerobatics lubrication system and dual channel Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). Performance The M-346 can climb at the rate of 127m/s. The maximum and cruise speed of the aircraft are 1,092km/h and 1,059km/h respectively. Its stall speed is 166km/h. The range and service ceiling of the M-346 are 2,590km and 13,700m respectively. Its take-off run is 320m, while the landing run is 470m. The aircraft weighs around 4,610kg and its maximum take-off weight is 9,000kg.

The nuclear-powered super carrier fired at two drones using the ship’s aft RAM launcher and fired the CIWS as part of a pre-aim calibration firing evolution during Carrier Strike Group 1’s Composite Training Unit Exercise. Crew on board said the CIWS PAC fire served a dual purpose, allowing Carl Vinson Sailors to perform a maintenance check as well as readying the mounts for a rogue drone situation. A Canadian CH-148 Cyclone has conducted its first anti-submarine warfare testing with the HMCS Windsor off the coast of Nova Scotia. The Sikorsky-made naval helicopter was tested as part of its Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) carried out by the Helicopter Test and Evaluation Facility (HOTEF). Crews onboard the CH-148 employed Expendable Mobile ASW Training Targets (EMATTs) to simulate submarine movements and noise patterns, which allowed HOTEF crews to further develop those tactical procedures that will be used by operational crews following CH148 Release to Service. Boeing landed a $479 million USAF contract for engineering, manufacturing, and development of the Eagle Passive/Active Warning and Survivability System for the F-15 Eagle fighter jet. The system will provide advanced aircraft protection, significantly improved situational awareness and support for future F-15 mission requirements, replacing the jet’s Tactical Electronic Warfare Suite and keeping the aging aircraft in scheduled service through 2040. As 413 F-15Cs and F-15Es will be upgraded under the program, the expected costs may run to $7.6 billion. Middle East & North Africa Israeli news outlets have reported the presence of the Elbit Systems’ C-MUSIC anti-missile defense system on France’s Presidential Jet. Priced at $1 million per unit, the system consists of smart thermal cameras that identify an incoming missile and target the missile with a laser beam. The specialized beam interferes with the missile’s targeting system, deflecting it off its trajectory and allowing it to explode at a safe distance from the plane. A French official confirmed the reports. Europe MBDA has been awarded a $125 million Demonstration and Manufacture contract by the British MoD for the Sea Ceptor air defense system for the Type 26 (T26) Global Combat Ship (GCS). The company said the deal will last for 10 years and involves support to the T26 design as well as the manufacture of the electronics equipment required for the class of eight ships. News of the deal comes following the announcement by BAE Systems that the first steel for the frigate will be cut in Glasgow next summer. Patriot upgrades for Germany could be underway within a year if Berlin decides against selecting the rival Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) offered by Lockheed Martin and MBDA. Raytheon made the announcement as contract negotiations between the government and MBDA slow due to the cost of MEADS’ acquisition which was recently revealed to be higher than the $4.5 billion initially proposed. The company claims that upgrading their existing Patriot system would save Germany money in the short and long term, allowing them to continue to benefit from upgrades and reliability improvements funded by all 13 countries that operate the system. Asia Pacific India’s government is expected to approve the purchase of 12 US-2 amphibious aircraft from Japan today. The Defense Acquisitions Council, chaired by Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar, will green light the acquisition prior to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Japan later this week. It’s believed that Modi will sign a memorandum of understanding during the trip. Boeing is expecting a new request for information (RFI) to be released by India to build twin-engine fighters in the country. President of Boeing India Pratyush Kumar said the company had received an RFI for a single-engine fighter but could not offer any solutions to the requirement. In preparation for a twin-engine competition, however, Boeing is prepared to establish a state-of-the-art facility in order to build 200 F/A-18 Super Hornets in country.

Breitbart.com reports that polar bears are so numerous in some places that they have become pests. The bald eagle is common enough to have been removed from the U.S. endangered species list. Nevertheless, you can't watch a nature documentary without the obligatory final 10 minutes of hectoring about human activity driving the world to the brink. Meanwhile, 21 percent of U.S. pregnancies in 2011 ended in elective abortions.  About 7 percent of live births in the United States are to immigrants who are here illegally, roughly equal to the number of abortions obtained by black women. You can decide what to make of those statistics. Immigrant-rights protesters on Oct. 26 blocked New York City-bound lanes of the George Washington Bridge for hours, some chaining themselves to the girders. The next day, police in riot gear were called in to remove anti-pipeline protesters from private land in North Dakota. Yet, who protests, or even speaks, for the approximately one million unborn aborted annually?   We hear feverish claims that if conservatives stopped government funding to Planned Parenthood — which runs general women's health clinics besides its abortion mills — it would mean the end of women's cancer screening. This is untrue, since private insurance, charities and Medicaid all subsidize screenings by various providers.  Hillary Clinton has said her campaign is "about the children." Apparently, that concern only begins once the child is delivered. The unborn, however, are not part of her constituency. Gerald Keer Turnersville Beware of trade wars if U.S. hikes tariffs To the Editor: Both major candidates for president want to make more jobs for the citizens of this country. They suggest various strategies: more education; penalizing U.S. companies that manufacture goods abroad; raising barriers for importing products from other countries; financial incentives for companies that expand their U.S. operations. All of these proposals have some merit, but they'd all cost someone something. We set trade barriers to some products coming into the United States, and those blocked countries impose barriers on imports of U.S. products. How does a high tariff on planes that Boeing wants to sell to China sound to you? How about if Japan were to forbid the importation of choice beef or expensive fruit produced in America. Don't you think that such retaliatory moves would cause losses for U.S. firms and producers? Take something more specific. Suppose we put a new 20 percent tariff on imports of all goods from China? These goods would cost 20 percent more when they appear on American store shelves. With these price increases, some American firms will find that they can compete, and begin producing more goods in the good ol' U.S.A. Bingo! More jobs here. But who pays for these U.S. jobs? The 20 percent tariffs will not be paid ultimately by the countries sending us imports. American buyers will pay the extra 20 percent. Whose family budgets, whose cost of living of living, will go up? Don't get me wrong. I may be willing to pay more for the goods I buy if it means more U.S. jobs. But, remember, nothing is free. Someone pays. Howard Leroy Davis Pitman   'Yes' can ensure Westville has clean water To the Editor: Each year, Westville borough posts the state Department of Environmental Protection's Water Quality Report on our website. It shows the high quality of the water that runs out of your tap.  Water supply is a critical service the borough provides, but it comes with an increasing cost for upgrading the infrastructure and for maintenance. For this and other reasons, I support a "yes" vote in Tuesday's ballot referendum for approval to transfer ownership of the water utility to Aqua New Jersey, an investor-owned utility company.   This ballot question and sale recommendation was not a decision that borough council members took lightly. It came after years of research and an independent engineering study that evaluated existing water facilities and recommended a 20-year infrastructure improvement plan.  A sale might cause residents to have questions, but they should know this is not a unique idea. Privately-owned, regulated water systems produce 4.6 billion gallons of clean water daily to thousands of communities like ours. The sale would also mean an $8.4 million revenue boost to our community, and we won't have to raise taxes to fund the necessary infrastructure improvements. We'll also receive $3.4 million worth of improvements to our water system in the first few years — all without a rate increase during the first five years of Aqua ownership. Discounts that seniors and people with disabilities receive will continue.  Westville has been successfully running its water system since at least the early 1940s. But the new engineering report states that all 23 miles of our pipeline is nearing the end of its life cycle. It's more than 70 years old. Our community needs to implement these infrastructure changes.  This vote is about allowing the continuation of our high-quality water system and providing a financial boost that will greatly benefit Westville for years to come. This Election Day provides a great opportunity for the borough. My hope is that residents will vote "yes" on the referendum, so that we can work together to take advantage of this partnership with Aqua New Jersey.   Michael Ledrich Council President Borough of Westville Send a letter to the editor of South Jersey Times at sjletters@njadvancemedia.com nj.com About Us About NJ.com Advertise with us Contact Us Visit OMJ.com Frequently Asked Questions Jobs at NJ Advance Media Newsletters RSS feeds More on NJ.com Interact Weather Site map Claim your free business listing Sponsor Content Search Place an ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Post a job Post a free classified ad Apartments & rentals NJ.com Sections N.J.

It's a standard college recruiting pitch — except in this case, the whole company could be at stake. On a recent Thursday afternoon outside Willard Airport, 17 Parkland College aviation students listened to all of the reasons they ought to come fly for Trans States Airlines once they're licensed. Regional carriers like it are tasked with handling flights that feed into major airport hubs, and all non-military rookie pilots must work at that level before joining a big-name commercial airline like Delta or Southwest. Trans States representatives came to Champaign-Urbana to try to build brand loyalty before the job hunt starts for the 40 students in Parkland's program, 17 of whom showed up to hear the sales job. It's just one strategy used in the face of a looming nationwide pilot shortage. In February, CNN reported that a pilot shortage led to so many grounded flights for regional Republic Airways that it was forced to file for bankruptcy protection. According to Boeing and Oliver Wyman's Airline Economic Analysis, there will be a demand of 95,000 North American pilots from last year to 2034 — and just 64,000 pilots available to supply it. For aviation students, this makes their prospects almost too good to be true — they can pick from guaranteed jobs if they can successfully qualify for and travel the expansive, but expensive, road of education and training. However, that road is scarring the profession with damage that could take congressional action to reverse. After Colgan Air Flight 3407 crash-landed in 2009 near Buffalo, killing all 49 people aboard and one on the ground, Congress raised the required number of training hours for commercial pilot certification — from 250 to 1,500. That number shrinks to 1,000 after a prospective pilot obtains a four-year aviation degree, 1,250 with a two-year aviation degree and 750 for discharged military pilots. Those regulations vary for non-commercial organizations, such as charter airlines, which aren't required by Federal Aviation Administration regulations to adhere to the commercial airline rules. If the shortage continues as expected, commercial outfits — the majority of which contract with regional airlines — will be slammed next. Sybil Phillips, the chief pilot and director of aviation at Parkland, doesn't shy away from saying the industry is going through "interesting times." 'A big stress for me' Confronted with a burdensome budget shortfall, the University of Illinois closed its Institute of Aviation in 2013-14 and transferred operations over to Parkland. Students at both Parkland and the UI can still participate in the program and earn a two-year associate aviation degree or pilot certification. Over the past 10 to 15 years, the dropout rate for aviation students was around 50 percent, Phillips said. What worries her more, though, is the declining number of aviation professors. Parkland could use two to four more, she said, but many candidates, in response to the shortage, are increasingly being courted by commercial airlines — even if all they can contribute are a few years of work before mandated retirement at 65. "Locally, the shortage of flight instructors is a big stress for me," Phillips said with a solemn pause. "It's going to be very interesting to see how the shortage plays out in the next five to 10 years." That stress is spilling over to Willard, home to seven daily flights from Envoy Air, a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Airlines. Six of those go to Chicago O'Hare, the other lands in Dallas. During a Sept. 13 city council meeting, Willard's executive director received Champaign's public support to pursue adding a route to Charlotte. Gene Cossey said American Airlines needs to wait for its pilot numbers to stabilize before that can happen. "The shortage is affecting us right now," Cossey said. "American is saying they're slim on pilots." Landing a much-coveted Charlotte route also depends on how well Cossey and his staff communicate the area's need and demand for it. He said that involves meetings to drum up business and community support. Overall, Cossey said he doesn't see bankruptcy in Envoy's future because of its relationship with American. "One side (of flight shortage perceptions) is doom and gloom and the other is that it's a moderate problem," Cossey said. "The truth is that it's probably somewhere in the middle." Experience argument The 1,500-hours requirement is not without critics. The majority of aviation students and professionals contacted by The News-Gazette have unfavorable opinions of it. The naysayers include Henry Fineberg, who graduated from Parkland's aviation program in May and is training to become a flight instructor. "More experience is good but it might be a little overkill," Fineberg said, noting how he believes the requirement is contributing to the overall pilot shortage. Count Daren Goembel, a captain at the Flightstar charter service in Savoy, among those who agree with the rule. Flightstar requires that its captains have 1,200 hours of training. "You've got to do something to mitigate that gap between being licensed and having experience," Goembel said. "It makes it more difficult but overall I don't think there's anything wrong for requiring more experience." Flight training hours can accrue by providing lessons, hauling anything from cargo to corpses and flying banners, among other tasks. The time it takes to finish the hours creates a sizeable gap between graduation and launching a career. Fran Tao, a UI senior majoring in psychology and political science, takes pilot certification classes at Parkland and is debating whether she wants to enter that pre-career gap. "It's like two years of your life," Tao said of the commitment to finishing training hours. Bill Giannetti, president and chief pilot at Flightstar, doesn't mince words when critiquing the requirement. "It's unnecessary and it makes no sense," he said. "Hours have never been a good indicator of pilot skill. Military pilots are flying around in a jet fighter with 500 hours of experience. I believe the rule will be changed very shortly or else the airline industry will dry up." 'Supply and demand' While laying his career foundation in the 1990s, Flightstar captain Martin Birge was one of many pilots who worked two jobs. He had to in order to get by — back then, rookie salaries ranged from the $20,000s all the way down to minimum wage. "I waited tables at night and flew six to seven days a week for six hours each day to build my initial flight time," Birge said. Those wages are now starting to double in response to the shortage. Phillips predicts that will ultimately be what solves the problem, although it could also be what drives up ticket prices. "I wouldn't advocate that (wages) go down more," Phillips said. "It's simple supply and demand." In addition, perks like signing bonuses, raises and retention pay are becoming more and more attractive. "They're throwing money at the problem," said Scott Conrad, a captain for Trans States Airlines. Aviation students can end up paying more for air time than they do for tuition. At Parkland, Phillips said it costs around $60,000 to receive a commercial pilot license without also majoring in aviation. That amount doesn't include the air time fees for finishing training hours after leaving Parkland. For the 2016-17 school year, Parkland's aviation program charges $157, $370 or $529 per semester hour, depending on where the student lives. Additional course fees range from $1,992 at the low end to $9,894 at the highest. Parkland aviation student Tristan Polk said he is taking out multiple loans to make it all work. Airline-sponsored scholarships, from what he can tell, are starting to increase. "(Aviation) is more of a lifestyle than a job," Polk said. "You have to live around it and the cost." The gender gap Another way to recruit more pilots? Ditch the image of aviation as a boys club. According to the International Society of Women Airline Pilots, around 97 percent of all commercial pilots are male. Being a female exchange student from China, Tao said, "I want to prove that I can do anything I want — that gender is never an issue." Community-building opportunities are springing out of the gender gap, including several groups and scholarships centered around advancing women in aviation. Tao is a member of the Female Aviators Sticking Together group on Facebook. "There's aviation memes, ratings news, flying fashion tips, pictures of babies in 'My Mom Flies' onesies. ... It's really supportive," she said. Goembel says the industry gender gap is indisputable. He has seen it first-hand throughout his 10 years in the profession. "Flat out, you have more white males in the industry than any other gender or race," Goembel said. "It will take a lot of time before that changes." 'A literal dream' Unavoidable downsides to the job — the time away from home, the risks of air travel — can also drive potential pilots away, although some will have enough passion to push those aside. "Flying is a literal dream," Fineberg said. "I know I couldn't let it go." Both Birge and Goembel said they can manage their frequent time away from home because their families act as a strong support system. With all the talk of aviation's disadvantages and the pilot shortage, Phillips wants her colleagues to remember how the increased demand for air travel factors in. "I always think: Who's in the back of the plane?" Phillips said. "It's business people who are also gone from home multiple days of the week. "We're in a society where people travel for work a lot more and we're on the go a lot more."

Mana Rabiee reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Tensions were high at this Beijing hotel on Saturday. That's where family members of the passengers on board a missing Malaysian Airlines plane waited anxiously for news of their loved ones. The Boeing passenger plane carrying 239 people on board was en route to the Chinese capital from Kuala Lampur. It went missing near the South China Sea off Vietnam about an hour or so into the flight. Relatives complained about their treatment by the airline, saying no was in touch with them or giving them any information. (SOUNDBITE) (Mandarin) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN, WHOSE MOTHER WAS ON MISSING PLANE, SAYING: "Some people are crying, some are checking information on their mobile phones, there is nothing in the rooms except for some water, biscuits and bread. There is nothing else. People are sitting in chairs, or even on the floor, because there are not enough chairs." There were no reports of bad weather or an emergency on the plane. A Malaysian Airlines representative said on Saturday that a search and rescue operation was underway. (SOUNDBITE) (English) UNIDENTIFIED MALAYSIA AIRLINES REPRESENTATIVE, SAYING: "We are working with authorities who have actively activated the search and rescue team to locate the aircraft. Our team is currently calling the next of kin of passengers and crew...Our thoughts and prayers are deeply with the affected passengers and the family members." Among the passengers were 24 Chinese artists and their families, in Malaysia for an art exchange program. If confirmed, a crash would likely mark Boeing's deadliest incident since the American jetliner entered service 19 years ago.

Along with the live event at Edmonds Center for the Arts, 13 community libraries will host livestream viewing along with four partner sites including Snohomish PUD auditorium, Everett; Everett Community College, Edmonds Community College and University of Washington Bothell. To ensure seating, registration is required for the Sno-Isle Libraries sites. Registration is not required for the four partner sites. “We’ve heard some frustrations that we are just now announcing the speaker lineup, even though registration opened 20 days ago,” Harvey said. “This is something that sets TED and locally organized TEDx events, such as TEDxSnoIsleLibraries, apart from other conferences. “TED and TEDx is about coming to hear something, not see someone,” Harvey said. “It is the promise of delivering and connecting with a day of ideas, not about speaker names, credentials or personalities.” Still, Harvey said he’s pretty excited about who will be delivering those ideas. “The speakers range in age from 16 to 64,” Harvey said. “They also range from a CEO to high-school students, from a horse trainer to a robotics team coach along with other backgrounds that serve as launching points for the ideas they will bring forth.” Harvey also pointed out that the day is intended to be transformational for the speakers as well as those who hear and see them. “The speakers are chosen by a team of Sno-Isle Libraries staff members, starting from a list of nominations that we solicit from the public,” Harvey said. “But that’s just the beginning. Once chosen, the speakers go through a substantial orientation and training to help hone the presentation of their messages. “Many of the speakers from the 2015 event said this was one of the most valuable and transformational things they’d ever been involved in,” Harvey said. The speakers for TEDx SnoIsle Libraries 2016 are: Andre Feriante, flamenco guitarist, poet Andre’s career path was set at 13, when he first heard the flamenco guitar.

The market rallied simply because it loves certainty. For months, many investors assumed Clinton would be the winner of the Presidential election. So, when the FBI said it was investigating more of Clinton's emails, stocks were sent into a tailspin as the race suddenly seemed more likely to go either way. Stocks surged again on Monday on certainty when the FBI cleared Clinton's use of a private email server. This left Cramer yearning for the market to focus on earnings, not the election. "I long for the market to be, well, the market again, where we value companies on how well they are doing, not as a part of a vast basket that goes up or down depending on how certain we are about the results of the election," the "Mad Money" host said. Carlos Barria | Reuters Hillary Clinton But if Clinton does declare victory, then Cramer expects the market to go back to normal the day after the election. That means Cramer's got his eye on the companies with the best earnings that can take investors through year end. The banks were the best winners of earnings season, as they generated bigger profits than anyone expected. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and KeyCorp all blew Cramer away. Of the soft financials, Cramer was most impressed with Visa, MasterCard and American Express. The second group that performed well was the social, mobile and cloud stocks like Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon and Accenture. Transports were also a puzzling winner, as most railroads and airlines didn't make the numbers, but will likely do much better next year. Cramer liked United Continental and Norfolk Southern as comeback options. Basic industrials were also a surprise, thanks to an increase in Chinese business, a turn in Europe and an improved airline cycle. Boeing was Cramer's top pick, followed by United Technologies and Honeywell. The biggest disappointment for Cramer was the restaurants. Besides the Cheesecake Factory and Domino's Pizza, most earnings were downright miserable. The home improvement space also took a step backward with weak numbers from Masco, Sherwin-Williams and PPG. The apparel segment was also hit hard, led by Nike and Under Armour. The health care group showed promise for Cramer, courtesy of a snap back after being severely oversold. Merck delivered a strong quarter, and Cramer said he is "still reeling from the lack of respect given to Celgene." "If you look at where the money wants to go, and you figure that this election will pass …. I think that the above description of the earnings season to date will hold up until year end," Cramer said. Questions for Cramer?

Cramer's New Book
Business Stocks surge on the last day before the presidential election Wall Street Mark Lennihan / Associated Press The New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street. The New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street. (Mark Lennihan / Associated Press) James F. PeltzContact Reporter Stocks rose sharply Monday to end a nine-day slide after the FBI said it found no new evidence to warrant charges against Hillary Clinton on the eve of the U.S. presidential election. The market’s major indexes, including the Standard & Poor’s 500, rose 2% or more — their best daily percentage gain in eight months — as the Clinton news removed one of the key elements of uncertainty that have weighed on Wall Street for more than a week. Stocks worldwide also rallied, as did crude oil prices and yields on U.S. Treasury securities. The U.S. dollar was mixed against other major currencies. The S&P 500 had dropped 3% over the last nine trading sessions, the longest consecutive losing streak for the benchmark indicator in 36 years, in large part after FBI Director James B. Comey said the agency was again reviewing Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of State. But Comey said Sunday that there was still no basis for criminal charges against the Democratic candidate, removing a major element of risk to the market’s outlook should she be elected over Republican candidate Donald Trump.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index climbed 2.4% to 5,166.17. Intel Corp., based in Santa Clara, Calif., surged 3.2% to lead the gainers in the Dow Jones industrials. Microsoft Corp. gained 2.9%. Shares of Irvine data storage firm Western Digital Corp. rose 4.8%. Financial stocks also climbed sharply, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. up more than 3%. LendingClub Corp. jumped 15.2% after the San Francisco online lender posted third-quarter results showing losses that were smaller than analysts expected and sales that were much larger.  Tuesday’s election continues to pose a huge unknown for the markets, especially with Trump vowing big changes in U.S. trade policies and complaining about Federal Reserve policies under Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen. Despite the market’s recent setback, both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials are more than 4% above their levels at the start of the year. One explanation is that most business and financial indicators are betting on a continuation of the current path in government, with Clinton being elected and generally extending the Obama administration’s policies, kept in check by a GOP-controlled House. If Trump wins, analysts said, that might deliver a shock to the markets similar to the one in June caused by Britain’s vote to leave the European Union; at that time, stocks briefly suffered major losses. Crude oil for near-term delivery rose 82 cents to $44.89 a barrel. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes jumped to 1.83% from 1.78% on Friday.  Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss LAPD will not help deport immigrants under Trump, nearly 4,000 students from L.A.

During an interview with CNBC, Musk said investigators had figured out why a Falcon 9 rocket burst into flames on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine, preflight test. The accident destroyed a $200 million Israeli communications satellite and grounded the Falcon 9 fleet for the second time in 14 months. Scroll down for video  On September 1, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket (pictured) exploded as it was being fueled for a routine pre-launch test at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Musk now says this was caused by a fueling system issue that created solid oxygen in the supper stage tank SATELLITE FIRM CLAIMING DAMAGES FROM SPACEX   The Israeli owners of the destroyed AMOS-6 satellite have reportedly been hard hit by the loss. In a press conference last month, Spacecom said it could seek $50m from SpaceX following the explosion on the launch pad last week. AMOS-6 was supposed to provide home internet for Africa and the Middle East.  In addition, Facebook had signed a deal with Eutelsat to lease broadband capacity from the satellite as part of its efforts to increase internet connectivity across the African continent. The cause of the accident was a fueling system issue that inadvertently produced solid oxygen inside the rocket's upper stage tank. The oxygen then reacted with a carbon composite bottle containing liquid helium that sits inside the oxygen tank, triggering an explosion. 'I think we've gotten to the bottom of the problem,' said Musk, who is also chief executive of Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O). He added that the issue had never been encountered in the history of rocketry. Musk did not specify what mission would launch next, nor whether SpaceX would fly from a new launch pad at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, or from its West Coast site at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. SpaceX's primary launch pad, located just south of Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, was damaged in the Sept. 1 accident. SpaceX has declined to release details on the extent of damage. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Southern Hemisphere recovered TWICE as fast as the North...

Also on Friday, NASA and Orbital ATK Inc (OA.N) said Orbital's next cargo run to the International Space Station would use the heavier-lift Atlas 5 rocket, made by United Launch Alliance, rather than Orbital's Antares booster. The switch will allow NASA to fly an extra 660 pounds (300 kg) of cargo to the station while SpaceX returns to flight. SpaceX's primary launch pad, located just south of Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, was damaged in the Sept. 1 accident. The explosion destroyed the rocket and the satellite it was carrying (pictured) NASA hired Orbital and SpaceX to fly cargo to the station after the shuttles were retired in 2011. Terms of Orbital's contract with United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N), were not released. The launch is targeted for early 2017, NASA said. But, a proposal by SpaceX to fuel its rockets while astronauts are aboard poses safety risks, a group of space industry experts that advises NASA has told the U.S. space agency. 'This is a hazardous operation,' Space Station Advisory Committee Chairman Thomas Stafford, a former NASA astronaut and retired Air Force general, said during a conference call last Monday. SpaceX's founder and CEO, Elon Musk (pictured), called the failure 'the most difficult and complex' the company has ever had Elon Musk took to Twitter on September 9 seeking 'support and advice' as the investigation continues. SpaceX wrote a similar message on its Twitter account as well, which was retweeted by the billionaire SpaceX CEO Stafford said the group's concerns were heightened after an explosion of an unmanned SpaceX rocket while it was being fueled on Sept. 1. Members of the eight-member group, including veterans of NASA's Gemini, Apollo and space shuttle programs, noted that all previous rockets carrying people into space were fueled before astronauts got to the launch pad. 'Everybody there, and particularly the people who had experience over the years, said nobody is ever near the pad when they fuel a booster,' Stafford said, referring to an earlier briefing the group had about SpaceX's proposed fueling procedure. SpaceX is hoping for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now ELON MUSK'S 'INTERPLANETARY TRANSPORT SYSTEM'  Last month, Elon Musk unveiled his most ambitious project yet - an 'Interplanetary Transport System' to take mankind to Mars in 80 days and build a sustainable human colony of a million people there. 'What I want to achieve is make Mars seem possible, to show that we can do it in our lifetimes, and you could go,' he said at the International Astronautical Congress in Mexico. However, he warned the trip was likely to be dangerous - and said candidates for the first missions 'must be prepared to die'.   The Interplanetary Transport System will use a giant rocket booster with a 39 foot (12m) diameter and 49 engines, and a special shuttle with a 56 foot (17m) diameter, making the entire rocket stack 400 feet (122m) high.  They will launch with empty fuel tanks and refuel in orbit. Once on Mars, they would make more methane fuel for the return journey.  SpaceX needs NASA approval of its launch system before it can put astronauts into space.     Last month, Elon Musk unveiled his most ambitious project yet - an 'Interplanetary Transport System' to take mankind to Mars in 80 days and build a sustainable human colony of a million people there.

In a press release on Monday (Nov 7), the ministry said the new H225M and CH-47F will replace the Republic of Singapore Air Force's (RSAF) Super Pumas and older Chinooks. They have been in service since 1983 and 1994 respectively, and are going to be obsolete. MINDEF said both helicopters were selected after a rigorous evaluation process.  The contract for acquiring the H225M - a medium-lift helicopter - was awarded to Airbus Helicopters, while the heavy-lift CH-47F will be provided by The Boeing Company. “The H225M and CH-47F possess better lift and reach capabilities, and will enable the RSAF to meet the Singapore Armed Forces’ lift requirements more efficiently with fewer helicopters and less manpower,” said MINDEF. - CNA/ek Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

The shares rose. Follow @Brexit for the latest news, and sign up to our Brexit Bulletin for a daily roundup. Profit after tax increased 8.2 percent to 912 million euros in the three months through September, Dublin-based Ryanair said on Monday. Analysts predicted earnings of 897 million euros, based on the average of four estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company stuck to its full-year earnings forecast and raised its long-term passenger target by more than 10 percent. “Ryanair is doing very well in tough times as people trade down to lower fares,” Chief Executive Michael O’Leary said in a Bloomberg Television interview. If profits continue to rise, the airline will most likely continue buybacks after the current one is completed by February, he said. Ryanair is attracting passengers by cutting fares, increasing the number of seats and adding larger airports to its schedule as it battles against expansion by competitors. While cheaper tickets boosted Ryanair’s passenger tally by 12 percent in the first half to a record 64.8 million, pricing pressure and economic uncertainty resulting from the U.K.’s decision to leave the European Union are clouding the outlook.  By putting a firm number behind its buyback plans, the company is “saying to investors ‘okay this is real,’ ” Gerald Khoo, analyst at Liberum Capital said by phone. “They’ve previously talked about it, but opportunistically. Now they’ve made an actual commitment.” The shares climbed as much as 6.3 percent, the most in more than three months, to 13.54 euros and were trading at 13.40 euros at 10:44 a.m. in Dublin, shaving the year’s loss to 13 percent. “Cautious” Outlook Ryanair is betting that economic uncertainty and falling fares could help it grow, as its low-cost base allows it to grab market share by undercutting rivals. The company raised its long-term passenger target, saying it will have more than 200 million customers by 2024, up from the previously forecast 180 million. Still, Ryanair said it’s “cautious” on its outlook for this fiscal year and warned that its short-term view may need to be cut again. Last month the company had finally bowed to Brexit by downgrading its full-year guidance, saying that the sterling’s depreciation was denting pricing more than anticipated. “Weaker airfares and Brexit uncertainty will be the dominant features of the second half,” the company said, predicting winter fare declines between 13 percent and 15 percent. Full-year guidance is “heavily dependent upon there being no unexpected adverse declines in fourth-quarter airfares.” For now, Ryanair stuck to its forecast that profit for the full year will grow to between 1.30 billion euros and 1.35 billion euros. To avoid some of the Brexit turmoil, Ryanair has started hedging its U.K. currency exposure and is shifting expansion away from the U.K. and to other European countries where it says incumbent carriers are retreating amid lower fares. “What worries me about Brexit is the U.K. government clearly has no idea what it’s doing,” O’Leary said. “Ryanair is in negotiations with airports across Europe,” where “frankly the costs are lower and at least you have political certainty.” Boeing Deal Ryanair, infamous for sending passengers to airports far outside the major cities they serve, will fly to more primary hubs by the end of the year, it said in the statement. Last week, the carrier said it would base two aircraft at Deutsche Lufthansa AG’s Frankfurt hub, reversing an earlier decision to never fly there. The company is also considering flying out of Paris’s Orly or Charles de Gaulle airport, O’Leary said. As it looks to increase its passenger count, Ryanair may decide to add airplanes by converting some of its 100 options to buy 737 MAX airplanes from Boeing Co. “in the next year or two,” O’Leary said. In addition, the carrier will hold onto some aircraft originally planned for sale and extend some leases. The airline is now forecasting a fleet of 585 aircraft by 2024 up from plans for about 546. At the same time, the carrier is continuing to rein in costs, now expected to fall by 3 percent in the full-year, instead of a more modest 1 percent decline. Ryanair will have lowered costs by about 5 percent since starting its Always Getting Better marketing strategy three years ago, O’Leary said. The campaign has focused on refining Ryanair’s image and website, offering a range of paid-for extras to entice more business passengers and targeting more primary airports.

(Photo: David Kadlubowski/The Republic) Story Highlights Phoenix ranks as an "active" real estate market supporting financial services, according to a report The metro area benefits from moderate living costs and business costs, including lease rates Phoenix's office market also is seeing relatively little new-building activity, said CBRE Group 12 CONNECTTWEET 16 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Phoenix rates as an active secondary market for financial-services activities, helped by rising employment in the field and moderate costs, according to a new study. The report by CBRE Group identified five established money-center hubs with high concentrations of banking, insurance, lending and other financial employment — New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and Boston. Phoenix was listed as the No. 2 urban area behind Dallas/Ft. Worth among second-tier "active" markets supporting financial services. Other active markets include Tampa, Charlotte, San Antonio and Columbus of 20 cities examined. Some big urban areas, including San Francisco, Houston and Washington, D.C., were not covered in the report, which focused on areas undergoing notable changes. Active markets such as Phoenix were identified as having substantially lower costs and roughly the same office vacancies as established hubs. For example, asking lease rates in established major markets average about $45 a square foot compared with $22 a square foot in active markets, including $23.63 in Phoenix. The Phoenix office vacancy rate of 18 percent was slightly above the rate around 15 percent nationally. The report cited the Camelback Corridor as the city's top submarket, with higher lease rates averaging $30.68 a square foot. The Phoenix market also was characterized as having relatively little office footage under construction and "moderating" growth in lease rates. "Phoenix is a stable and low-cost location for companies with high-skill requirements," said Kevin Calihan, senior vice president in the firm’s Phoenix office. "With one of the deepest financial-services labor pools in the country, this is a market that can offer firms cost effective and sustainable growth." The report cited living costs and the costs of doing business in Phoenix as near average, with financial-occupation salaries here that are decidedly low. At an average $69,216, Phoenix financial salaries ranked only above those in Indianapolis among the 18 cities examined in this category. CBRE, based in Los Angeles, cited 36,000 finance-specific jobs in the Phoenix market and 173,700 with a general financial focus, with slightly fewer college graduates here than nationally.

Smith / November 6th, 2016 . . . the potential first female president represent[s] a purely cosmetic form of diversity that works against the structural changes that need to be made at every level of culture and politics to expose and depose a political class that has acted with impunity to promote policies that benefit wealthy donors and powerful multinational corporations. — Professor Catherine Liu Hillary Clinton is not responsible for the terrible policies of the Bush Administration, but she is responsible for following in lock-step with those policies during her tenure as Secretary of State under the Obama Administration. — Robin D., Tits and Sass That’s a wicked woman. — Minister Louis Farrakhan It is a staple observation of modern feminism that a woman has to be twice as capable as a man to go half as far in her career, which should mean that in the negative profession of U.S. politics a woman has to be four times as evil as a man in order to capture the presidency. With this in mind we can certainly agree that Hillary Clinton is “far more qualified” than Donald Trump to be president. The only question is how many more years the human race can be expected to survive such “qualified” leaders. Apparently suffering from a permanent case of what used to be called “the vapors,” liberals aghast at Donald Trump’s “racism” continually overlook the fact that Hillary backed Bill Clinton’s 1994 crime bill, which railroaded an entire generation of young blacks into prison on the pretext that they were “super-predators,” (Hillary’s term), a reformulation of the Jim Crow era’s “bestial black brutes,” always supposedly in need of a good lynching or (nowadays) a long prison term. No surprise that Hillary has close ties to the private prison industry, which grows fat on the crushed lives of the desperately poor, all too many of them black. Recall that Bill Clinton campaigned for the presidency lecturing blacks about “personal responsibility,” playing on racist stereotypes that they were hyper-actively and irresponsibly sexual, an amazing display of chutzpah given his own predilections. Furthermore, his deliberate distortion of Sister Souljah’s remarks about black lives not mattering (*Clinton claimed Souljah was calling for the murder of white people when, in fact, her point was that IF black gang members killed whites instead of each other a racist media would at least cover the story, which it does not do when blacks are doing all the dying) was a transparent attempt to put blacks at the back of the Clinton victory bus, which he clearly thought was their “place.” Such is the thinking of “New Democrats,” and Hillary is one of them. Hillary also strongly supported president Clinton’s 1996 “welfare reform,” which plunged another million American children into poverty (a disproportionate number of them black children) at a time when the U.S already had the highest rate of child poverty in the developed world. The Children’s Defense Fund (which Hillary worked for fresh out of law school) condemned the Clintons publicly for this, with founder Marian Wright Edelman opining that Bill Clinton’s “signature on this pernicious bill makes a mockery of his pledge not to hurt children.” By 2002 Hillary was so proud of welfare reform that she bragged, “These people are no longer deadbeats, they’re actually out there being productive” (italics added). Note her language – deadbeat – which is a synonym for sponger, and virtually identical to Adolf Hitler’s “useless eaters.” Note as well that the majority of welfare beneficiaries have always been children, prevented by child labor laws from being “productive.” In other words, her feminism is a fraud. She staunchly opposes welfare, a $15 an hour minimum wage, and Medicare for all, establishment stances that keep millions of women mired in dismal poverty. And she loves war, which always increases rape, and champions military interventions that strengthen ISIS, famous for practicing femicide and sex slavery as masculine ideals. During her husband’s terms in the presidency, Hillary crafted his “triangulation” strategy and helped advance Republican orthodoxy across the board: “social” spending for police, prisons, and war; NAFTA, which off-shored 682,000 American jobs; a racist drug war (penalties for crack cocaine favored by black users were far harsher than those for powder cocaine used by whites); an expansion of capital punishment; a massive assault on the First Amendment via the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, budget austerity; Star Wars; runaway prison construction; the dismissal of unions and unemployment as policy concerns; the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which exempted credit default swaps from regulation and helped usher in economic collapse. As Secretary of State she focused laser-like on the needs of corporate capital, which she confused with the national interest. According to the Wall Street Journal, she “redefined the job in ways that promoted the interests of U.S. business.” Among recent secretaries the Journal found her “one of the most aggressive global cheerleaders for American companies,” lobbying foreign governments to “sign deals and change policies to the advantage of corporate giants” like General Electric, Exxon Mobil, Boeing, and Microsoft.” According to an analysis by the paper, at least sixty companies that lobbied the State Department during Hillary’s tenure as Secretary of State also donated over $26 million to the Clinton Foundation “charity.” How did Hillary do as Secretary of State? A Stanford-NYU study soon after she left office concluded that from June 2004 through mid-September 2012 U.S. drone strikes killed thousands of people in Pakistan alone. Meanwhile, U.S.-brokered arms sales rose to an all-time high on her watch, to $66.3 billion in 2011, more than 75% of the global arms market, driven by major deals with autocratic Persian Gulf states. President Obama said that the arms deals would be good for jobs and the State Department said that in such an insecure region it would be good for security. But what kind of security? A 2009 cable published by WikiLeaks offers a hint. The document has Hillary admitting that Saudi Arabia, a major U.S. arms recipient, is “the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide.” In short, “security” means sending more fuel to the arsonists who want to burn our house down. All of which makes it difficult to take seriously Hillary’s advocacy of “smart power,” which  simply means using every conceivable means to advance Washington’s world hegemony. “Human rights” is a favorite theme, even as Washington continually tramples on international law and the sovereignty of nations to achieve it. Most alarming is Clinton’s continual portrayal of Vladimir Putin as “Hitler,” thus dismissing any role for genuine diplomacy. When Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed in Southeastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 people on board, Hillary immediately blamed Putin and urged European countries to attack Russia, though there was no evidence to back up her claim. “There should be outrage in European capitals,” she said, adding the brain-dead Cold War adage that “the only language [Putin] understands” is toughness. She declared that Putin was “pushing the envelope as far as he thinks he can,” suggesting that the Russian president had deliberately shot down the plane in order to test Western resolve. To this day she maintains that Putin “must be punished,” a policy that obviously runs a high risk of nuclear war. By comparison, Donald Trump’s call for the U.S. and Russia to “get along” and solve problems through negotiation seems stunningly brilliant. In spite of her dismal record, Hillary shamelessly affects great concern for the fate of “women and girls” around the world, but as with all her other high-minded rhetoric, it rings hollow. Not quite a year before her “good friend” Madeleine Albright declared to Leslie Stahl on 60 Minutes that killing 500,000 Iraqi children via economic blockade was “worth it” because of the perceived political gains involved, Hillary intoned that, “It is a violation of human rights when babies are denied food, or drowned, or suffocated, or their spines broken, simply because they are girls.” Note that the motive, not the killing, is what she finds reprehensible. If you kill girls not because they are girls, but simply for being Iraqi, that’s OK. And you can kill hundreds of thousands of them. No surprise, then, that Hillary believes the solution to the humanitarian crisis of Syrian refugees is to obliterate their country with bombs. The 2011 destruction of Libya was at Hillary’s initiative, as she convinced a reluctant Secretary Gates and President Obama to intervene, reducing a country that had had the highest standard of living in Africa to a chaotic ruin presided over by ISIS gangs, who now roam the beaches beheading people. At the same time as Hillary was arguing that U.S. military intervention was justified because the Libyan government was using violence against its political opponents, Washington’s head-chopping allies in Saudi Arabia were sending thousands of troops into Bahrain in support of a monarchy doing the same thing. Hillary told the Bahranian crown prince, “Violence is not and cannot be the answer. A political process is.” But not in Libya, which U.S. bombs devastated perhaps beyond repair. Former U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, one of the four U.S. diplomats killed in Benghazi, revealed what all the talk of Qaddafi being a “dictator” was really about. He said Qaddafi was getting tough with U.S. oil companies because he wanted to use more oil for Libyan purposes, like funding regional development to prevent terrorism, and to establish an independent African alternative to the United States African Command. In other words, Qaddafi wanted Libyan national resources to support Libyan purposes, which conflicted with the needs of foreign investors and the U.S. military, so he had to be overthrown and killed. Cables from the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli confirm that the U.S. objected to the Libyan government’s belief that the United States African Command was a “vehicle for latter day colonialism.” The world is plastered with U.S. military bases and awash in U.S. sponsored bloodbaths, but we’re not colonialists, and we’ll kill anyone who says we are, unless they let us govern their country for them. By all accounts, Hillary is up to the job. Sources:1 Michael K.

The Malaysia-based is growing its Thai destinations. - + Malindo Air is strengthening its coverage in Thailand with the inauguration of regular flights from Kuala Lumpur to Phuket on Nov 10. The airline, 51% owned by the National Aerospace & Defence Industries Sdn Bhd of Malaysia and 49% by Indonesia's Lion Group, will operate four weekly flights on the new route, an airline insider in Bangkok told the Bangkok Post. The launch of the flights to Phuket comes on the heels of the airline's second route to Thailand, Kuala Lumpur-Chiang Mai, which took off on October 30 with a daily flight. Malindo Air's launch of flights to Phuket and Chiang Mai form part of its accelerated expansion into Thailand from its Malaysian base, complementing its initial sole route: Kuala Lumpur-Bangkok. Malindo commenced flying to Bangkok's Don Mueang airport in April 2014, offering as many as 17 flights a week. The airline will deploy a Boeing 737-800 narrow-body jet with 162 seats, including 12 in business class, on the Phuket flights, the same arrangement used on its flights to Bangkok and Chiang Mai. Malindo will compete head-to-head with Malaysia AirAsia and Malaysia Airlines, which are already operating on the Kuala Lumpur-Phuket route. The airline aims to fly mostly tourists from Malaysia and possibly Indonesia to the resort. Malindo has been ratcheting up its international expansion as it moves towards becoming a full-service airline with a closer association with the Lion Group.

ALSO READ UK tightens visa rules for techies Theresa May to visit India in November Theresa May: Women in power Trade deal seen dominating Theresa May's India visit 10 things to know about the British PM-to-be Theresa May In a rare departure from precedent, visiting British Prime Minister Theresa May will skip Bengaluru’s famous software companies. She will, instead, visit Dynamatics Technologies - an aerospace and hydraulic pumps manufacturer, which has three factories in the UK generating jobs there - when she visits Bengaluru on Tuesday.  While Dynamatics, founded by Udayant Malhoutra, doesn’t have the brand name of an Infosys or a Wipro, the company is a respected supplier of systems for Boeing and Airbus, besides Hindustan Aeronautics. It ranks among the world’s largest suppliers of hydraulic pumps and also has built a model of generating local jobs in the UK, while offshoring work to India.  Over the past two decades, successive British PMs such as John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron have made it a point to visit campuses of Infosys or Wipro in Bengaluru and interact with young software engineers. Blair became the first foreign country leader to start his visit outside Delhi from Bengaluru, during the peak of the India-Pakistan standoff in January 2002. Other leaders have used the visit to software campuses in Bengaluru to boost their local image such as Japanese Prime Minister Yashiro Mori, whose ratings among young Japanese shored after he played golf in the mini golf course at Infosys. For May, however, the trip is different. Her conservative government has already pledged to reduce migrants into the UK, a promise that helped Brexit happen. So, her decision to skip software companies on November 8 in Bengaluru comes after her government moved to tighten visa rules, making it difficult for Indian information technology professionals to work in the UK. The visa rules have set higher threshold for salaries and tougher language norms for family members of visa holders.  India’s software sector, which is struggling for growth, is miffed. The restrictions will further hurt the sector, which generates 20 per cent of the $108-billion software exports revenue from the UK. Software lobby group Nasscom (National Association of Software and Services Companies) has already warned the move of restricting working professionals would backfire and restrict the growth and productivity of the economy of the UK. “The broader sentiment is the move by the UK is not pro-outsourcing. It is very inward-looking and veering towards protectionism,” says Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and chief executive officer of Greyhound Research.  May’s visit to a local aerospace systems supplier is also seen as the UK’s strategy to pursue new defence deals. India, among the world’s top importers of defence equipment, is already the biggest buyer of Hawk advanced jet trainers outside the UK.  “Defence is a strong area for the UK in India. That is an area they would pursue aggressively and May’s visit aligns with their goals in defence,” said an industry official, requesting not to be identified.

By Brianna Gurciullo 11/07/16 10:00 AM EST With help from Tanya Snyder and Lauren Gardner WHO'S LIABLE WHEN A SELF-DRIVING CAR CRASHES? As excitement grows for driverless cars, consensus is building around the idea that automakers, not drivers, will be held responsible for crashes in the future, as our Tanya Snyder reports for Pros. Knowing that they would face legal responsibility, manufacturers could hesitate to roll out self-driving vehicles or jack up their prices to recover projected costs, which would slow widespread use. Story Continued Below Drivers aren't off the hook yet: Still, Tanya points out that cars without steering wheels or pedals probably won’t become the norm on American roads for decades. In the meantime, human drivers could be found at fault for accidents for a number of reasons: They didn’t take over steering when the vehicle warned them to do so, they didn’t get a broken sensor replaced or they used the car in circumstances that the automaker warned it couldn’t handle. Lots to be determined: One of the main arguments for developing self-driving cars is that the technology will drastically reduce crashes across the country — the overwhelming majority of which are caused by human mistakes. But crashes involving driverless cars, though fewer, could be costlier and deadlier, Tanya reports. In theory, carmakers could shift some liability onto a third party that certifies a vehicle’s safety before it is available on the market. But the industry has already protested DOT’s suggestion that it may explore acquiring premarket approval power.

Get Pro’s Presidential Transition Roadmap: The Definitive Guide. ‘SWITCHING’ RULE PITS SHIPPERS AGAINST FREIGHTS: STB’s proposed rule on “reciprocal switching” has set off what’s sure to be a long fight between shipping industries and freight railroads. As our Lauren Gardner reports, reciprocal switching occurs “when one freight carrier moves goods to an interchange where another railroad takes over the cars for a fee.” “The proposal is intended to give shippers more leeway to ask STB to order reciprocal switching, a practice sanctioned by law today but that the board has never granted outside voluntary agreements between railroads,” Lauren reports. “Shippers say the bar has been set too high for them to successfully compel freights to switch despite complaints about competition, while freights say the lack of cases shows the current rules work.” Pros can check out the full story here. GERMAN INVESTIGATION OF VOLKSWAGEN EXPANDS: Prosecutors in Germany are now including Hans Dieter Poetsch, the chairman of VW’s supervisory board, in their investigation of possible market manipulation connected to the automaker’s emissions scandal, Reuters reports. Poetsch was the company’s CFO before he took the role of chairman last year. Prosecutors made their investigation public in June and said they would focus “on evidence that VW’s duty to disclose possible financial damage from the emissions test cheating may have arisen before Sept. 22, 2015, when it publicly admitted wrongdoing,” according to Reuters. And now … carbon emissions? Meanwhile, the California Air Resources Board found that some Audi vehicles had software that seemed to let them cheat testing for carbon dioxide emissions, the Wall Street Journal reports. VW’s year-long scandal has involved diesel engines and nitrogen oxides. What CARB found involves both diesel and gasoline engines and CO2. Bild am Sonntag, a German newspaper, first reported about CARB’s findings. RIDE-HAILING, CAR-SHARING DEALS FOR ELECTION DAY: MT gathered some special offers for getting to and from the polls Tuesday in the D.C area. (Note: This roundup is probably not exhaustive, and make sure to click the links for details!) Zipcar is letting users reserve a limited number of cars for free between 6 and 10 p.m. Because of the latest SafeTrack surge, car2go is temporarily lowering its hourly and daily rates and offering free registration. Uber and Google partnered to give app users a feature that helps them find their polling place and request a ride to it, but there’s no discount. Lyft users can get a 45 percent discount (in tribute to the soon-to-be-chosen 45th president of the United States) on a single ride from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., as The Verge reports. That means they can take a discounted ride to their polling location but not on the way back home. THIS WEEK: Wednesday — NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind gives a talk called “Highly Automated Vehicles: Challenges and Opportunities” at Volpe. Thursday — NHTSA holds a public meeting on its driverless car guidance. Transportation for America holds an expert panel discussion in Minneapolis on the election’s effects on transportation policy. FRA and NJ Transit hold an open house in New Jersey on the Hudson Tunnel Project. NJ TRANSIT HEAD SHARES RESULTS OF FRA PROBE: New Jersey Transit’s new executive director promised on Friday that the agency would address a slew of safety violations that FRA identified months before a deadly crash in Hoboken. At a state legislative hearing Friday, Steven Santoro said FRA had discovered that employees used their personal cellphones while working and sometimes failed to do brake testing. The federal agency also found that trains needed emergency equipment and workers didn’t always blow horns at crossings, POLITICO New Jersey's Katherine Landergan reports. Santoro said that, in response to the FRA investigation, his agency is doing more inspections and has toughened penalties for employees who break the rules. He said that NJ Transit is on track to implement PTC by the federal government’s deadline of December 2018. PTC at Hoboken? Santoro also said that NJ Transit would explore whether the Hoboken terminal should have PTC or some other safety technology, The Associated Press reports. The terminal received an exemption from PTC requirements six years ago. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, has now questioned whether terminals should be given such an exemption. ICYMI: Bill Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly, former allies of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, were convicted on Friday in the trial over shutting down lanes to the George Washington Bridge three years ago. As Ryan Hutchins reports for POLITICO New Jersey, prosecutors claimed that the lanes were shut down to get back at the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, who didn’t endorse Christie for reelection at the time. Christie, in a statement, said he “had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments” and he “will set the record straight in the coming days regarding the lies that were told by the media and in the courtroom.” Reaction from Hillary Clinton’s campaign: Press secretary Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) tweeted Friday: “I know Trump does not do press conferences any more but he should be pressed on whether he is going to keep Christie as his Transition chair.” Running mate Mike Pence said Sunday that there aren’t any plans to make Christie step down, as POLITICO’s Jeremy Herb reported. POSSIBLE PRECLEARANCE EXPANSION MOVES FORWARD: DHS announced Friday the 11 airports that are its newest candidates for Preclearance. The airports are in nine countries, mostly in Latin America and Western Europe. Every year, over 10 million people take flights from the airports to the United States, according to DHS. The expansion depends on negotiations between the United States and the host countries, as our Lauren Gardner reports for Pros. It would be the first time that a South American country is included in the program. Roger Dow, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, lauded the announcement in a statement Friday. “Giving travelers an innovative, convenient and efficient entry process with Preclearance sends the message that they are welcome here — and those who feel welcomed are more likely to visit again,” Dow said. IG IDENTIFIES FLAWS IN FTA’S TRANSIT SYSTEM OVERSIGHT: FTA needs benchmarks for finishing up its policies on acquiring and then giving back safety oversight authority over rail transit systems, according to DOT’s inspector general. As your MT host reports for Pros, the transit industry is confused about when and how the federal agency would assume oversight of a system. The IG’s other findings: FTA lacks the staffing and resources it needs in its Office of Transit Safety and Oversight, the federal agency hasn’t developed an oversight program focused on data and risk, and its standards aren’t enforceable. In the case of its oversight of WMATA, FTA hasn’t finalized its policies for the undertaking, causing “significant frustration.” SHIFTING GEARS: Wednesday is Donelle Harder’s last day as communications director for Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Harder is heading to Oklahoma City for a new job. Over at Boeing, Anne Marie Chotvacs has joined the company as senior director of international operations and policy. For eight years, she served as clerk and staff director of the the House Appropriations’ Foreign Operations Subcommittee, our friends at POLITICO Influence report. John Blazey also got a promotion — to vice president of global corporate citizenship in Chicago. Nicole Vernon is taking Blazey’s place as vice president of transportation and aviation. THE AUTOBAHN: — “A slow ride toward the future of public transportation.” The New York Times. — “Victims of Palm Springs bus crash may face years of uncertainty over compensation.” The Los Angeles Times. — “Report: Bus driver may've lost consciousness in other crash.” The Associated Press. — “'Tolls are coming’ to Germany’s autobahns.” POLITICO Europe. — “Gov. Wolf seeks end to transit strike, city calls for election-day suspension.” The Philadelphia Inquirer. — “Coast Guard orders unsafe ship to stay in Baltimore, stranding its crew.” The Baltimore Sun. — “Potential bidders for Takata may balk at GM bankruptcy precedent.” Reuters. THE COUNTDOWN: DOT appropriations run out in 32 days. The FAA reauthorization expires in 326 days. The 2016 presidential election is in 1 day! Highway and transit policy is up for renewal in 1,426 days. ** A message from the National Association of Manufacturers: Great nations build and invest in great infrastructure. When communities have greater access to economic opportunities and when manufacturers have efficient ways to move goods to market, the quality of life rises, productivity soars and societies thrive. Current U.S. infrastructure, however, is in an alarming state of disrepair and in urgent need of strong investments. Manufacturers want to #BeTheSolution. So as we call for healing and moving our country forward, we are calling for a major investment in renewing our transportation systems and advancing energy infrastructure. Americans are demanding a stronger, more inclusive economy. And that’s why infrastructure can be part of the answer. Historical data indicates that previous significant investments in infrastructure have aligned with high levels of growth and more aggressive economic activity. That starts with sending WRDA to the President’s desk this year. In 2017,the President-elect and Congress must act boldly.

About Armed With Science | Privacy Policy | Disclaimer Search for:   Skip to content Featured Technology Space Matters Cyber Security Robots Lasers Army Researchers Search for Technology Solutions to Defeat Sand Posted on November 7, 2016 by challer By David McNally ARL Public Affairs Armor is good protection against an enemy, but what if the enemy is so small that it takes aircraft down from the inside? Sand and dust can significantly damage a helicopter engine, which is why the Department of Defense is united in its hunt for a technology solution to protect aviators from this dangerous enemy. At the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, scientists and engineers experiment with coatings in high-temperature environments with the goal of creating something — anything — that will cause sand to slide off the inside of a turbine engine the way an egg slides off a nonstick skillet. “We are going through a very methodical process to understand the underpinning science and then use the science to predict the materials, what we call the engineered or tailored materials, that will lead to the right solution,” explained Dr. Anindya Ghoshal, chief scientist for the laboratory’s Vehicle Technology Directorate. Besides the danger of low-visibility, sand and dust wreak havoc inside aircraft engines. As molten sand accumulates inside gas turbine engines, air flow is restricted caused loss of power. Army scientists and engineers are working to discover sandphobic coatings to save lives. (Photo Credit: U.S. Army) Ghoshal leads the Army’s efforts to develop what he calls “sandphobic” coatings. “We are facing, especially in Southwest Asia, and other places, brown-out conditions,” he said. “We have a lot of dust particles that blow out, especially when you’re hovering. We get these sand particulates and other dust particulates that get ingested into the engine. “Our goal is to have the particles strike the blades or vanes [inside a gas turbine engine] and then flake off,” he said. “When we started looking into this problem, we found that in order to look at a very basic research level we want to understand the physical chemical behavior. Once we can do that, then our idea is to take that model and then predict the type of material that would enable us to develop this sandphobic coating.” Army scientist Dr. Michael Walock (left) explains the operation of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory’s hot particulate ingestion rig to ARL post-doctoral fellow Dr. Andy Nieto. (Photo Credit: David McNally) Helicopters have filtration systems that attempt to filter out larger particles, but Ghoshal said micron-sized particles go through the turbine’s combustor and adhere to the blades. This chokes the airflow and can lead to engine loss. “We have a unique rig here,” said Dr. Michael Walock, a physicist on the sandphobic coatings team. “The hot particulate ingestion rig allows us to shoot sand into the hot-gas flow at small level components and rapidly prototype new coating materials. With this system we’ve done a world-first. We used high-speed imaging to confirm the molten state of the sand particles impacting onto these thermal barrier coatings.” Computer simulations are also helping researchers arrive at a technology solution. A hot particulate ingestion rig replicates temperatures inside a gas turbine engine, allowing Army scientists and engineers to shoot sand into a hot gas flow and experiment with different coatings solutions. (Photo Credit: David McNally) “Computer modeling will play a big role in helping us to look at the interactions between particles and the surface,” said Dr. Muthuvel Murugan, acting team lead for the lab’s Turbomachinery Research Team. “The particles go through a phase change from solid to liquid and then they deposit onto the surface.” At the Army’s Vehicle Research Laboratory, the team shot high-speed videos, revealing molten sand particles splattering on turbine blade material targets and then vaporizing – a first in the scientific community. “Computer modeling of this multi-physics complex phenomena will allow us to understand the damage mechanisms,” he said. Murugan said they hope to use the power of supercomputers at the DOD High Performance Computing Center also located at APG. “We will use advanced computational fluid dynamics together with particle ingestion to better understand the interaction mechanisms of sand particles at gas turbine engine relevant high temperature,” he said. “When we simulate how particles go through the flow-field and impact and adhere to the surface, then we can understand the vulnerable parts of the turbine blade and engineer a sandphobic coatings solution.” Sandphobic coatings research is part of a larger strategic effort the Army lab officials call the Science for Maneuver Campaign. “With this campaign, we hope to discover, innovate and transition science and technology-enabled capabilities that will significantly increase the force effectiveness and global responsiveness of the Army,” said acting ARL Director Dr. Philip Perconti. “As we look to how we’re going to enable the Army of the future, we see a need to discover technology solutions that will result in improvements in aviation responsiveness and the minimization of vulnerabilities.” Earlier this year, Ghoshal’s team received DOD funding through the Laboratory University Collaboration Initiative, or LUCI, which means $600,000 over three years in collaboration with a National Security Science and Engineering Faculty fellow. Ghoshal is teaming with Dr. Jian Luo at the University of California San Diego. “There is a close collaboration going on within the community to solve this problem,” Ghoshal said. Ghoshal is also working closely with other universities, industry and government agencies, such as The Ohio State University; University of Connecticut; University of North Texas; Iowa State University; University of North Dakota; Boeing; the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center; the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory; the U.S. Naval Air Systems Command; and NASA. In 2015, the team presented initial findings, “Turbomachinery Blade Thermomechanical Interface Science and Sandphobic Coatings Research,” to the American Helicopter Society International 71st Annual Forum at Virginia Beach, Virginia. The paper received the “Best Paper Award in Propulsion Sessions at the conference, Ghoshal said. New research from the team will also be published in the January 2017 Advances in Aircraft and Spacecraft Sciences, an international journal. “I strongly believe that in the next three to five years we will have not only one, but several solutions,” Ghoshal said. “It will definitely save a lot of Soldiers’ lives in the long run. Our solutions will make our Soldiers’ lives safe and will make our Army stronger.” Follow the Department of Defense on Facebook and Twitter! ———- Disclaimer: The appearance of hyperlinks does not constitute endorsement by the Department of Defense of this website or the information, products or services contained therein.

Completion of the deal, which was agreed in July, depends on Meridiana meeting certain unspecified conditions, Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker said in an e-mailed statement Sunday. “We are hoping to have our discussions concluded by the end of January,” he said. “During this period, Meridiana Fly also has to deliver certain conditions and achieve certain targets in its performance. We want Meridiana Fly to be a very strong national carrier with a robust international network, creating jobs.” Qatar Airways had previously said it expected to complete the acquisition of unprofitable Meridiana in early October. The Italian government spent months earlier this year trying to mediate between Meridiana and the company’s unions, which objected to job-cut plans. Italy’s second-biggest airline is owned by a holding company of the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development. Qatar Airways, which is London-based IAG SA’s biggest shareholder, has been seeking stakes in foreign companies. It said in July it would pay $613 million (Dh2.25 billion) for up to 10 per cent of Latam Airlines Group SA, South America’s biggest carrier. Meridiana is expected to get some of the 70 737 Max 8s that Qatar Airways ordered from Boeing Co. last month, Corriere della Sera reported, citing an interview with Al Baker. He said in October that the Max jetliners are intended for another carrier that the Gulf operator is buying.

Secret Service agents rushed Trump offstage in Reno after they determined a protester in the audience might pose a threat him. As the agents removed the Republican presidential candidate, authorities quickly wrestled Austyn Crites, 33, to the ground in the front of the crowd. As early details of the ordeal were being reported, Trump's son Donald Trump Jr retweeted a post on Twitter shared by special projects director at Citizens for Trump, Jack Prosobiec that suggested Trump had survived a murder attempt. 'Hillary ran away from rain today. Trump is back on stage minutes after assassination attempt,' Posobiec tweeted.  Scroll down for video  After Donald Trump was quickly hustled off a stage during a rally in Nevada amid a security scare, his son Donald Trump Jr (pictured in Nevada on Thursday) was quick to retweet claiming Saturday's skirmish was an 'assassination attempt' The tweet was originally posted by special projects director at Citizens for Trump, Jack Prosobiec but was later retweeted by Donald Trump Jr (above) The younger Trump also retweeted a claim early on as details were coming in that that someone in the crowd reportedly pulled a gun Donald Trump Jr retweeted the message along with Trump campaign social media director Dan Scavino Jr also retweeted the post calling the incident an assassination attempt. The Secret Service said they never found a weapon and called the fracas 'a commotion' in a statement. News reporters and others on social media were quick to call out Prosobiec and others who described the incident as an assassination attempt or attempted murder. 'ATTENTION: Using phrase "assassination attempt" abt #Trump #Reno = RECKLESS & FLAT WRONG. Listen to @SecretService NO GUN "COMMOTION,' Major Garrett, Chief White House Correspondent for CBS News, tweeted.  Secret Service agents rushed Trump off the stage during a campaign rally in Reno on Saturday after they determined a protester in the audience might pose a threat to him 'Trump's social media director + his son tweeted about an "assassination attempt." That was obviously inaccurate,' Jose A DelReal, national political reporter for the Washington Post wrote. While introducing Trump ahead of his rally in later on Saturday in Denver, one of the speakers also described the incident as an attempted murder. 'You attack him every time, thinking he raises a speech of hate,' Mohana said. 'Tonight I think, the hate [that a] lot of [the] media raised against him caused an attempt of murder against him in Nevada.' A senior Trump campaign official told DailyMail.com that Crites, whom rally-goers already identified as an anti-Trump protester, caused a panic when he reached into his waistband. News reporters and others on social media were quick to call out Prosobiec and others who described the incident as an assassination attempt or attempted murder, including Major Garrett, Chief White House Correspondent for CBS News  Ben Jacobs, a political reporter for the Guardian, also made note that Posobiec had called the incident an assassination attempt Jose A DelReal, national political reporter for the Washington Post tweeted that Posobiec had inaccurately described the incident At that point, the campaign official said, a voice called out: 'He's got a gun!' Trump's protective detail sprang into action, pulling him offstage as a sea of bodies scattered, screams rang out and authorities dragged Crites away as he kicked and strained.  One witness told DailyMail.com that a holstered gun was spotted on the hip of a plainclothes officer, adding to the confusion.   Just before the fracas, Trump could be seen shielding his eyes from the lights in order to peer into the crowd as a struggle broke out.  Three agents then stormed the stage and hustled the Republican presidential candidate away.    Crites, who has since been released, appeared on local newscasts saying he had merely been holding a sign that read 'Republicans Against Trump.'  Secret Service agents rushed Donald trump offstage on Saturday evening in Reno, Nevada after they determined that a protester in the audience posed a threat to the Republican presidential candidate Security personnel rush off stage after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was escorted away during a rally at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center in Reno, Nevada on Saturday When he reached into his waistband, however, police and good Samaritans took the man down. The crowd surged backward in fright and strained against metal barriers enclosing the press section.  Witness Donald Newton, 45, of California who was in the crowd at the time, said he was next to Crites, who he said was holding a sign and started heading toward the stage. 'He had something on his belly. I don't know what it was,' Newton told the Reno Gazette-Journal.  'Somebody yelled "gun" and everyone jumped on him. My friend put his knee on his head, but he kept getting up.' Federal agents and tactical officers from Reno Police removed the man from the rally on Saturday. He has since been identified as 33-year-old Austyn Crites At this time a motive is not clear. Authorities placed the man in a bathroom near a secure entrance where Trump's motorcade and the press vehicles were staged Austyn Crites, 33, (pictured) was detained by Secret Service after trying to raise a flag that read 'Republicans Against Trump' when someone yelled 'gun' causing a panic during the rally Federal agents and tactical officers from Reno Police removed Crites and placed him in a bathroom near a secure entrance where Trump's motorcade and the press vehicles were staged. SWAT officers with high-powered rifles guarded the entrance to the restroom while reporters milled outside. Television footage showed the white male suspect pinioned on the ground by officers and searched, before he was led away from the convention center.  Crites told the Guardian that he was terrified how the crowd responded during the chaotic moment. 'I was in survival mode. I knew I could die at that moment,' Crites told the Guardian. Crites was punched and kicked, and his neck was placed in a chokehold, he said. At one point someone in the crowed even grabbed his testicles as he feared for his life. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next ¿I don¿t care about Trump¿s sex life¿: Cheating on Melania...

'I understand that this election has people torn, but we must chose HOPE over HATE,' one post appearing on his Facebook page read. Later on Saturday he wrote a post on his Facebook, which was slammed with negative comments and appears to have since been taken down, recounting Saturday's ordeal.  'Hi all, Not sure if you saw the news today, but I was beat up at a Trump rally for holding a sign and falsely accused of having a gun. I am ok and have been released,' Crites wrote. 'I have NO connection to the Clinton campaign apart from me supporting her HOPE over Trump’s HATE.'

PLEASE STAND UP WITH ME AND STOP TRUMP!’ The Secret Service said a thorough investigation into the incident is ongoing.   A short time after the fracas, Trump returned onstage and addressed the audience as he continued his rally speech, appearing unrattled by the scuffle and spoke with his usual self-confidence. 'Nobody said it was going to be easy for us,' he declared. 'But we will never be stopped. Never, never be stopped.' 'I want to thank the Secret Service. These guys are fantastic. They don't get enough credit. They don't get enough credit. They're amazing people.' Trump had spotted the protester and described him as a Hillary Clinton supporter before asking security to 'take him out.' As he returned to his speech, he thanked a group of fans near the stage who had stepped in to subdue his would-be attacker. Just before the fracas, Trump could be seen shielding his eyes from the lights in order to peer into the crowd as a struggle broke out Police officers stand guard backstage after Trump was hustled off the stage by security agents 'You were amazing, fellas,' he said. 'I saw what you were doing. That's a tough group of people right there... Nobody messes with our people, right?' Secret Service agents escorted the Republican presidential candidate from the Reno-Sparks Convention Center without incident. He and his staff made it aboard his custom Boeing 757, dubbed 'Trump Force One,' for of a flight to Denver where he will hold the day's fourth rally in as many stages. Trump issued a brief statement before the plane took off, but shed no new light on what had happened. 'I would like to thank the United States Secret Service and the law enforcement resources in Reno and the state of Nevada for their fast and professional response,' Trump said. 'I also want to thank the many thousands of people present for their unwavering and unbelievable support. Nothing will stop us – we will make America great again!'  Trump later returned and addressed the audience minutes later following the scary ordeal Trump thanked the Secret Service saying: 'These guys are fantastic. They don't get enough credit. They don't get enough credit. They're amazing people.' Supporters watch as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks at a rally at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center in Reno Saturday's incident marked the second time Secret Service had to intervene to protect the GOP's standard-bearer. In March a man leaped over a police barricade during a Trump rally at an airport hangar in Dayton, Ohio. Thomas Dimassimo was charged with disorderly conduct and inciting panic, but he never reached the stage. Secret Service tackled him when he was still several yards away from the candidate. 'I was ready for him, but it’s much easier if the cops do it, don’t we agree?' Trump said at the time. 'And to think I had such an easy life! What do I need this for, right?' Separately, in September a British man pleaded guilty to trying to grab a Las Vegas police officer's gun so he could assassinate Trump. The June incident at the Treasure Island hotel-casino did not put the Republican in any immediate danger.   Trump issued a brief statement before the plane took off, but shed no new light on what had happened Read more: Security forces rush Trump off stage during Reno speech Paul Lewis (@PaulLewis) on Twitter Share or comment on this article e-mail 816 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Killer wife and lover speak out over fatal love triangle Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing 'Reality has a way of asserting itself!'

Political Editor For Dailymail.com Published: 01:53 EST, 6 November 2016 | Updated: 08:26 EST, 6 November 2016 e-mail 816 shares 491 View comments After Donald Trump was quickly hustled off a stage during a rally in Nevada amid a security scare, his son was quick to retweet a message claiming Saturday's security scare was an 'assassination attempt.' Secret Service agents rushed Trump offstage in Reno after they determined a protester in the audience might pose a threat him. As the agents removed the Republican presidential candidate, authorities quickly wrestled Austyn Crites, 33, to the ground in the front of the crowd. As early details of the ordeal were being reported, Trump's son Donald Trump Jr retweeted a post on Twitter shared by special projects director at Citizens for Trump, Jack Prosobiec that suggested Trump had survived a murder attempt. 'Hillary ran away from rain today. Trump is back on stage minutes after assassination attempt,' Posobiec tweeted.  Scroll down for video  After Donald Trump was quickly hustled off a stage during a rally in Nevada amid a security scare, his son Donald Trump Jr (pictured in Nevada on Thursday) was quick to retweet claiming Saturday's skirmish was an 'assassination attempt' The tweet was originally posted by special projects director at Citizens for Trump, Jack Prosobiec but was later retweeted by Donald Trump Jr (above) The younger Trump also retweeted a claim early on as details were coming in that that someone in the crowd reportedly pulled a gun Donald Trump Jr retweeted the message along with Trump campaign social media director Dan Scavino Jr also retweeted the post calling the incident an assassination attempt. The Secret Service said they never found a weapon and called the fracas 'a commotion' in a statement. News reporters and others on social media were quick to call out Prosobiec and others who described the incident as an assassination attempt or attempted murder. 'ATTENTION: Using phrase "assassination attempt" abt #Trump #Reno = RECKLESS & FLAT WRONG. Listen to @SecretService NO GUN "COMMOTION,' Major Garrett, Chief White House Correspondent for CBS News, tweeted.  Secret Service agents rushed Trump off the stage during a campaign rally in Reno on Saturday after they determined a protester in the audience might pose a threat to him 'Trump's social media director + his son tweeted about an "assassination attempt." That was obviously inaccurate,' Jose A DelReal, national political reporter for the Washington Post wrote. While introducing Trump ahead of his rally in later on Saturday in Denver, one of the speakers also described the incident as an attempted murder. 'You attack him every time, thinking he raises a speech of hate,' Mohana said. 'Tonight I think, the hate [that a] lot of [the] media raised against him caused an attempt of murder against him in Nevada.' A senior Trump campaign official told DailyMail.com that Crites, whom rally-goers already identified as an anti-Trump protester, caused a panic when he reached into his waistband. News reporters and others on social media were quick to call out Prosobiec and others who described the incident as an assassination attempt or attempted murder, including Major Garrett, Chief White House Correspondent for CBS News  Ben Jacobs, a political reporter for the Guardian, also made note that Posobiec had called the incident an assassination attempt Jose A DelReal, national political reporter for the Washington Post tweeted that Posobiec had inaccurately described the incident At that point, the campaign official said, a voice called out: 'He's got a gun!' Trump's protective detail sprang into action, pulling him offstage as a sea of bodies scattered, screams rang out and authorities dragged Crites away as he kicked and strained.  One witness told DailyMail.com that a holstered gun was spotted on the hip of a plainclothes officer, adding to the confusion.   Just before the fracas, Trump could be seen shielding his eyes from the lights in order to peer into the crowd as a struggle broke out.  Three agents then stormed the stage and hustled the Republican presidential candidate away.    Crites, who has since been released, appeared on local newscasts saying he had merely been holding a sign that read 'Republicans Against Trump.'  Secret Service agents rushed Donald trump offstage on Saturday evening in Reno, Nevada after they determined that a protester in the audience posed a threat to the Republican presidential candidate Security personnel rush off stage after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was escorted away during a rally at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center in Reno, Nevada on Saturday When he reached into his waistband, however, police and good Samaritans took the man down. The crowd surged backward in fright and strained against metal barriers enclosing the press section.  Witness Donald Newton, 45, of California who was in the crowd at the time, said he was next to Crites, who he said was holding a sign and started heading toward the stage. 'He had something on his belly. I don't know what it was,' Newton told the Reno Gazette-Journal.  'Somebody yelled "gun" and everyone jumped on him. My friend put his knee on his head, but he kept getting up.' Federal agents and tactical officers from Reno Police removed the man from the rally on Saturday. He has since been identified as 33-year-old Austyn Crites At this time a motive is not clear. Authorities placed the man in a bathroom near a secure entrance where Trump's motorcade and the press vehicles were staged Austyn Crites, 33, (pictured) was detained by Secret Service after trying to raise a flag that read 'Republicans Against Trump' when someone yelled 'gun' causing a panic during the rally Federal agents and tactical officers from Reno Police removed Crites and placed him in a bathroom near a secure entrance where Trump's motorcade and the press vehicles were staged. SWAT officers with high-powered rifles guarded the entrance to the restroom while reporters milled outside. Television footage showed the white male suspect pinioned on the ground by officers and searched, before he was led away from the convention center.  Crites told the Guardian that he was terrified how the crowd responded during the chaotic moment. 'I was in survival mode. I knew I could die at that moment,' Crites told the Guardian. Crites was punched and kicked, and his neck was placed in a chokehold, he said. At one point someone in the crowed even grabbed his testicles as he feared for his life. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next ¿I don¿t care about Trump¿s sex life¿: Cheating on Melania...

Share this article Share 816 shares Police officers and U.S. Secret Service rush a man in handcuffs out of the rally on Saturday Audience members at the front of the crowd reportedly said they saw the man raise up a sign before a scuffle ensued Crites identifies as a Republican who supports Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, according to his Facebook page.  While he is a Republican, he has a couple of posts on his Facebook with Clinton's logo and an American flag with the words, 'Nevada Republicans proudly voting for Secretary Clinton.' 'I understand that this election has people torn, but we must chose HOPE over HATE,' one post appearing on his Facebook page read. Later on Saturday he wrote a post on his Facebook, which was slammed with negative comments and appears to have since been taken down, recounting Saturday's ordeal.  'Hi all, Not sure if you saw the news today, but I was beat up at a Trump rally for holding a sign and falsely accused of having a gun. I am ok and have been released,' Crites wrote. 'I have NO connection to the Clinton campaign apart from me supporting her HOPE over Trump’s HATE.' 'I have canvassed for her for about 3 hours, have contributed to her campaign, and voted for her.' Later on Saturday he wrote a post on his Facebook, which was slammed with negative comments and appears to have since been taken down, recounting Saturday's ordeal 'Though I do not agree with many of Hillary’s policies, we cannot allow a fascist/dictator to take our beloved freedoms to simply boost his ego and “get back” at anyone who disagrees,' he continued. 'Take what happened to me tonight as a classic example of dictator incident of violence – against your own Republican brother with a stupid sign.  'I am a Republican and cannot support Trump and his decisive rhetoric. This election cycle we all know what we need to do. PLEASE STAND UP WITH ME AND STOP TRUMP!’ The Secret Service said a thorough investigation into the incident is ongoing.   A short time after the fracas, Trump returned onstage and addressed the audience as he continued his rally speech, appearing unrattled by the scuffle and spoke with his usual self-confidence. 'Nobody said it was going to be easy for us,' he declared. 'But we will never be stopped. Never, never be stopped.' 'I want to thank the Secret Service. These guys are fantastic. They don't get enough credit. They don't get enough credit. They're amazing people.' Trump had spotted the protester and described him as a Hillary Clinton supporter before asking security to 'take him out.' As he returned to his speech, he thanked a group of fans near the stage who had stepped in to subdue his would-be attacker. Just before the fracas, Trump could be seen shielding his eyes from the lights in order to peer into the crowd as a struggle broke out Police officers stand guard backstage after Trump was hustled off the stage by security agents 'You were amazing, fellas,' he said. 'I saw what you were doing. That's a tough group of people right there... Nobody messes with our people, right?' Secret Service agents escorted the Republican presidential candidate from the Reno-Sparks Convention Center without incident. He and his staff made it aboard his custom Boeing 757, dubbed 'Trump Force One,' for of a flight to Denver where he will hold the day's fourth rally in as many stages. Trump issued a brief statement before the plane took off, but shed no new light on what had happened. 'I would like to thank the United States Secret Service and the law enforcement resources in Reno and the state of Nevada for their fast and professional response,' Trump said. 'I also want to thank the many thousands of people present for their unwavering and unbelievable support. Nothing will stop us – we will make America great again!'  Trump later returned and addressed the audience minutes later following the scary ordeal Trump thanked the Secret Service saying: 'These guys are fantastic. They don't get enough credit. They don't get enough credit. They're amazing people.' Supporters watch as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks at a rally at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center in Reno Saturday's incident marked the second time Secret Service had to intervene to protect the GOP's standard-bearer. In March a man leaped over a police barricade during a Trump rally at an airport hangar in Dayton, Ohio. Thomas Dimassimo was charged with disorderly conduct and inciting panic, but he never reached the stage. Secret Service tackled him when he was still several yards away from the candidate. 'I was ready for him, but it’s much easier if the cops do it, don’t we agree?' Trump said at the time. 'And to think I had such an easy life! What do I need this for, right?' Separately, in September a British man pleaded guilty to trying to grab a Las Vegas police officer's gun so he could assassinate Trump. The June incident at the Treasure Island hotel-casino did not put the Republican in any immediate danger.   Trump issued a brief statement before the plane took off, but shed no new light on what had happened Read more: Security forces rush Trump off stage during Reno speech Paul Lewis (@PaulLewis) on Twitter Share or comment on this article e-mail 816 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Killer wife and lover speak out over fatal love triangle Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing 'Reality has a way of asserting itself!'
