We know students learn effectively from simulations but in order to optimize learning efficiency in simulations, students’ performance should be assessed, and instruction should adapt to what they need to know. ARL researchers are investigating methods to monitor the emotions a trainee might experience during training; for example: boredom, frustration, anger, confusion, delight, stress. The ability to reliably monitor a trainee’s emotional response to training provides focused coaching when needed and managing the challenge level to maximize the benefit of the training session. PRINT  |  E-MAIL  |  CONTACT AUTHOR WASHINGTON, Sept. 30, 2016 — World-class scientists and engineers have been creating cutting-edge technologies for warfighters at military laboratories for nearly 100 years, and a Sept. 28 hearing on Capitol Hill focused on technologies being developed today for future wars. Laboratory directors from all three services addressed innovation through science and engineering in support of military operations during a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee’s emerging threats and capabilities subcommittee. Testifying before the panel were Air Force Maj. Gen. Robert D. McMurry, commander of the Air Force Research Laboratory; Dr. Philip Perconti, acting director of the Army Research Laboratory, Dr. Jeffery P. Holland, director of the Army Engineer Research and Development Center of the Army Corps of Engineers; and Dr. Edward R. Franchi, acting director of research at the Naval Research Laboratory. Air Force Research Lab In his comments before the panel, McMurry said 99 years of technology breakthroughs have contributed to or supported every major operational Air Force platform. “Just as the laboratory provided key innovations in support of the first and second offset strategies, I'm pleased to confirm that our game-changing technologies are already providing foundation and support for realizing a third offset strategy,” he said. The president’s fiscal year 2017 budget request for Air Force science and technology is about $2.5 billion, a 4.5-percent increase over the fiscal 2016 request, the general said.

The Air Force Research Laboratory is investing heavily in basic, applied and advanced research, he added, and is continuing to focus on “game-changers” such as autonomous systems, unmanned systems, nanotechnology, hypersonics and directed energy. Air Force Materiel Command recently established a strategic development planning and experimentation office to reinvigorate development planning at the Air Force enterprise level, McMurry told the panel. “The new effort will shift the Air Force from platform-centric to strategy-based multidomain solutions spanning air, space and cyberspace … [and] will support enterprise capability collaboration teams by providing modeling and simulation, war gaming and data to facilitate development planning for the highest-priority Air Force mission areas,” he said. Army Research Lab ARL is part of the Army’s Research, Development and Engineering Command, Perconti said, the Army's lead agency for technology integration and the enabling command in the development and delivery of unprecedented capabilities for the warfighter. “The uncertainty and complexity of future warfare necessitates innovation across a broad range of science and technology, which requires a research culture that is agile and effective, with an emphasis on collaboration that enables the continuous flow of people and ideas among government, academia [and] the private sector,” he added. Perconti said ARL is piloting a new business model to create a science and technology ecosystem that emphasizes mutual reliance and interdependent collaborative research as a critical element of national security. “This new business model we call ‘Open Campus’ focuses on three major initiatives: modern workforce management and policies, shared facilities with our partners, and fostering an entrepreneurial and innovative culture,” he told the panel. Through the Open Campus, ARL scientists and engineers work side by side with colleagues from academia, government and industry at ARL and at partner facilities, he added. Over the last year alone, Perconti said, the number of Open Campus agreements with academia and industry has grown from 60 to more than 180, with 170 more in negotiation, and the agreements have leveraged more than $23 million from ARL’s Army partners. “Early in 2016, we opened ARL west in Playa Vista, California. As part of the Open Campus initiative, ARL is hiring scientists and engineers on the West Coast to gain access to subject matter experts, technical centers and universities not well represented east of the Mississippi,” he said. By the end of this year, he added, ARL will have similar hubs established in Chicago and in Austin, Texas. The Army Research, Development and Engineering Command now is developing capabilities for the Army of the future, and its scientists and engineers were intimately involved in developing concepts for the DoD's third offset strategy, Perconti said. “The third offset strategy places major emphasis on technologies incorporating unprecedented levels of automation and integration, and ARL is concentrating on research areas that are essential to enabling this third offset,” he added. Army ERDC The Army Engineer Research and Development Center, or ERDC, is the science and technology arm of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Holland said. Researchers from the Army Engineer Research and Development Center Geospatial Research Laboratory’s Geospatial Sensing and Photonics Lab recently developed four Water Diagnostics Operations Gear, or WaterDOG, systems and two water assessment and purification systems as part of a series of demonstrations for the water treatment and handling team. The Army is assessing WaterDOG use with a field-portable water-treatment system. The WaterDOG provides physical water-quality parameter assessment results more rapidly than the current analog water-quality analysis system.

Army Corps of Engineers photo Download Image Image details page “We conduct research and development in support of the warfighter, military installations and the core civil works mission,” he told the panel. “We also manage the Department of Defense’s high-performance computing modernization program that provides supercomputing capabilities for DoD research, development, testing and evaluation communities throughout the department.” In fiscal year 2016, ERDC is executing a $1 billion program, $500 million of which is associated with reimbursable projects from every military service, the Office of the Secretary of Defense and most federal agencies, he said. “Innovation requires a talented workforce, and I'm proud to represent ERDC's 2,100 engineers, scientists and support personnel. ERDC’s human capital goal for this fiscal year and the next five years is to hire more than 800 new scientists and engineers to our organization,” Holland said. “Service laboratories play a key role in national security,” Holland said,” “and ERDC has a long history of providing innovative solutions to keep our warfighters and civilians safe.” ERDC force-protection technologies are installed in the combat theater to protect troop installations from rocket and mortar attacks. The State Department also uses the technology to protect critical facilities and personnel worldwide, Holland said, and many buildings in the national capital region, including the Pentagon, are safer because of ERDC protection technologies. “Our airborne counter [improvised explosive device] systems currently provide U.S. Central Command with unique capabilities,” he said. “ERDC tunnel-detection technologies have been applied in Iraq, along the Egypt-Gaza border and along the U.S.-Mexico border in support of DoD and the Department of Homeland Security.” ERDC delivers environmentally sustainable solutions for energy, water and waste, and installations, and it is the Army's leader in energy research and development in support of contingency basing, Holland added. Naval Research Lab NRL was born from an idea conceived in 1915 by inventor Thomas Edison, and that became a reality in 1923, Franchi told the panel. NRL, working with industry and academia and knowledgeable about Navy needs, would help to build U.S. sea power through long-term mission-related research and development. The electromagnetic railgun launcher is a long-range weapon that fires projectiles using electricity instead of chemical propellants. Magnetic fields created by high electrical currents accelerate a sliding metal conductor, or armature, between two rails to launch projectiles from ships at 4,500 mph. Electricity generated by the ship is stored over several seconds in the pulsed power system. Next, an electric pulse is sent to the railgun, creating an electromagnetic force accelerating the projectile up to Mach 6. Using its extreme speed on impact, the kinetic energy warhead eliminates the hazards of high explosives in the ship and unexploded ordnance on the battlefield.

The laboratory, for example, is making important contributions to laser weapons and railguns. NRL scientists were first to prepare and simulate the use of incoherently combined high-power fiber lasers as the architecture for the Navy's new laser weapon system, he added. “NRL's railgun program began in 2003, and has since become a critical element in the efforts to develop hypervelocity electric weapons,” Franchi said. Rapid prototyping and experimentation is an important process used at NRL to transition science and technology to demonstrations of operational capabilities, he said. Franchi said the biggest reason for NRL's success in providing science at the cutting edge is a world-class workforce of about 1,600 scientists and engineers, more than 870 with Ph.D. degrees. NRL's most serious challenge is the need to modernize its aging infrastructure, he told the panel, noting that the average age of buildings at the NRL main campus is 59 years.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Is America still a serious nation?  Consider. While U.S. elites were denouncing Donald Trump as unfit to serve for having compared Miss Universe 1996 to "Miss Piggy" of "The Muppets," the World Trade Organization was validating the principal plank of his platform. America's allies are cheating and robbing her blind on trade. According to the WTO, Britain, France, Spain, Germany, and the EU pumped $22 billion in illegal subsidies into Airbus to swindle Boeing out of the sale of 375 commercial jets. Subsidies to the A320 caused lost sales of 271 Boeing 737s, writes journalist Alan Boyle. Subsidies for planes in the twin-aisle market cost the sale of 50 Boeing 767s, 777s and 787s. And subsidies to the A380 cost Boeing the sale of 54 747s. These represent crippling losses for Boeing, a crown jewel of U.S. manufacturing and a critical component of our national defense. Earlier, writes Boyle, the WTO ruled that, "without the subsidies, Airbus would not have existed ... and there would be no Airbus aircraft on the market." In "The Great Betrayal" in 1998, I noted that in its first 25 years the socialist cartel called Airbus Industrie "sold 770 planes to 102 airlines but did not make a penny of profit." Richard Evans of British Aerospace explained: "Airbus is going to attack the Americans, including Boeing, until they bleed and scream." And another executive said, "If Airbus has to give away planes, we will do it." When Europe's taxpayers objected to the $26 billion in subsidies Airbus had gotten by 1990, German aerospace coordinator Erich Riedl was dismissive, "We don't care about criticism from small-minded pencil-pushers." This is the voice of economic nationalism. Where is ours? After this latest WTO ruling validating Boeing's claims against Airbus, the Financial Times is babbling of the need for "free and fair" trade, warning against a trade war. But is "trade war" not a fair description of what our NATO allies have been doing to us by subsidizing the cartel that helped bring down Lockheed and McDonnell-Douglas and now seeks to bring down Boeing? Our companies built the planes that saved Europe in World War II and sheltered her in the Cold War. And Europe has been trying to kill those American companies. Yet even as Europeans collude and cheat to capture America's markets in passenger jets, Boeing itself, wrote Eamonn Fingleton in 2014, has been "consciously cooperating in its own demise." By Boeing's own figures, writes Fingleton, in the building of its 787 Dreamliner, the world's most advanced commercial jet, the "Japanese account for a stunning 35 percent of the 787's overall manufacture, and that may be an underestimate." "Much of the rest of the plane is also made abroad . . . in Italy, Germany, South Korea, France, and the United Kingdom." The Dreamliner "flies on Mitsubishi wings. These are no ordinary wings: they constitute the first extensive use of carbon fiber in the wings of a full-size passenger plane. In the view of many experts, by outsourcing the wings Boeing has crossed a red line." Mitsubishi, recall, built the Zero, the premier fighter plane in the Pacific in the early years of World War II. In a related matter, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit in July and August approached $60 billion each month, heading for a trade deficit in goods in 2016 of another $700 billion. For an advanced economy like the United States, such deficits are milestones of national decline. We have been running them now for 40 years. But in the era of U.S. economic supremacy from 1870 to 1970, we always ran an annual trade surplus, selling far more abroad than Americans bought from abroad. In the U.S. trade picture, even in the darkest of times, the brightest of categories has been commercial aircraft. But to watch how we allow NATO allies we defend and protect getting away with decades of colluding and cheating, and then to watch Boeing transfer technology and outsource critical manufacturing to rivals like Japan, one must conclude that not only is the industrial decline of the United States inevitable, but America's elites do not care. As for our corporate chieftains, they seem accepting of what is coming when they are gone, so long as the salary increases, stock prices and options, severance packages, and profits remain high. By increasingly relying upon foreign nations for our national needs, and by outsourcing production, we are outsourcing America's future. After Munich in 1938, Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax visited Italy to wean Mussolini away from Hitler. The Italian dictator observed his guests closely and remarked to his foreign minister: "These men are not made of the same stuff as the Francis Drakes and the other magnificent adventurers who created the empire. These, after all, are the tired sons of a long line of rich men, and they will lose their empire." If the present regime is not replaced, something like that will be said of this generation of Americans.

Boeing has been awarded a contract to provide Harpoon missiles for the Indian Navy's Shishumar-class submarines (IHS/Harry M Steele) The overall package is worth USD200 million and includes 12 UGM-84L Harpoon Block II Encapsulated missiles and 10 UTM-84L Harpoon Encapsulated training missiles. Also included are two Encapsulated Harpoon certification training vehicles, containers, spares, as well as all-inclusive logistics support and instruction for IN personnel on the missile system. The missile systems will be delivered by 2018, the DoD notification stated. The awarding of the contract on 23 September finalises a deal struck in July 2014 to fit the missiles as part of the midlife upgrade of the IN's two Shishumar-class (Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft Type 209/1500) diesel electric submarines. This upgrade work is being undertaken by Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems at the Naval Dockyard in Mumbai. India previously purchased 21 AGM-84L Block II Harpoons at a cost of USD200 million (in October 2012) for its eight Boeing P-8I Neptune maritime patrol aircraft, and in 2010 the Indian Air Force bought 24 Harpoons for its SEPECAT Jaguar IM attack aircraft fleet.

On Wednesday, U.S. officials started to tell lawmakers about the deal. Boeing will send 36 F-15s to Qatar for $4 billion and another 28 F/A-18E Super Hornets will be sent to Kuwait for $3 billion with the option to purchase 12 more. Lockheed will ship 17 F-16 jets to Bahrain and upgrades for potentially 20 other planes, according to Reuters. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., confirmed the sale to Defense News. He said a Boeing plant in St. Louis, Missouri, could have shut down had the deals collapsed. "In my opinion our national interest is being served by pursuing these sales; That always comes first, but a by-product of that is we are keeping production lines functioning in case we need to utilize those in the future," Corker told Defense News. Related Stories US, Israel Sign $38B Military Aid Package Kuwait Detains Suspected ISIS Militants, Foils Attacks He added: "These countries are buying equipment that is interoperable with our equipment which gives us the opportunity to deal with crises as they occur." The diplomatic reasons and mechanisms involved in the deal are complex and far-reaching when it comes to U.S. policies in the Middle East. Israel has a deal with the U.S. that requires it maintain its “qualitative military edge” over other Middle Eastern nations. Israel was also concerned over Sunni extremist groups in Qatar. The U.S. also had to appease Sunni countries like Kuwait, which was worried over the U.S.’s recent nuclear non-proliferation deal with Shi’ite controlled Iran. Israel likely curbed any of its concerns after reaching a record-setting $38 billion military aid package extension with the U.S. earlier this month. That deal required Israel to phase out a program that funneled 26 percent of the previous funding to Israeli defense contractors. Instead, the money will go to American companies.

The renewed Japan Airlines agreement for Boeing’s GoldCare Expendables, formerly Integrated Materials Management (IMM), is an expendable parts service solution that builds on more than a decade of success. The partnership reduces the airline’s operating costs by having Boeing manage a majority of its spare parts inventory, providing items to the airline mechanic as needed. Under the agreement, Boeing will provide the service through 2026. According to Japan Airlines, Boeing’s exceptional customer support and parts solutions were key factors in the decision to extend the contract. “Boeing is pleased to continue our long-standing partnership with Japan Airlines, helping to improve operating efficiencies through our parts service,” said Rick Anderson, vice president of sales and marketing, Boeing Commercial Aviation Services. “Our focus is on providing our customers what they need, before they know they need it. This approach, along with our world-class customer support, is what continues to make Boeing a preferred parts provider across the globe.” The Japan Airlines order demonstrates the increased flexibility of Boeing’s parts business, which continues to evolve and improve based on customer needs and requirements. In 2015, Boeing increased inventory by 35,000 parts and lowered prices on 24,000 parts. In addition, Boeing has nearly doubled stocked parts for out-of-production airplanes and is offering emergent-build capabilities for customers who need to find parts for out-of-production fleet types. Boeing is a leader in providing 24/7 support and service to the global aviation industry. In addition to its expanded parts business, Boeing offers the industry’s largest portfolio of services, including retrofits and modifications, subscription-based maintenance programs, engineering support, crew training, route planning, digital crew scheduling, advanced data analytics and software to enhance airlines and leasing company operations.

How a showdown in the skies could trigger a transatlantic trade war The battle between Airbus and Boeing may set the stage for a full-on feud between Europe and the US. Sep 30th 2016, 11:59 AM 11,257 Views 5 Comments Share14 Tweet Email1 Image: AP/Press Association Images ARE WE ON the brink of a US-EU trade war? Some pundits with an eye on the sky seem to think so. A 12-year dog fight between the world’s two leading aircraft manufacturers came to a head last week when the World Trade Organisation (WTO) accused European plane maker Airbus of failing to comply with a 2011 ruling to stop accepting illegal state aid from the European Union. Even more significantly, the WTO ruled in its 574-page report that some EU member states had given Airbus so-called ‘launch-aid loans’ to fast track the building of wide-body aircraft, which it said created “genuine and substantial” loss of sales for its US rival, Boeing. The WTO said Airbus couldn’t have developed its A350XWB aircraft, a direct competitor to Boeing’s successful 787 Dreamliner jet, without unlawful EU subsidies estimated to be worth around $5 billion. This was a fresh accusation as the trade body had already ruled that Airbus received unlawful funding to develop its A380 aircraft. Unsurprisingly, Airbus has said it will appeal the WTO’s accusations, while the EU has suggested it will do the same, dubbing the findings in the report as “unsatisfactory”. On the other side of the pond, US trade representative Michael Froman said the WTO’s findings signaled “a sweeping victory for the US and its aerospace workers”. “We have long maintained that EU aircraft subsidies have cost American companies tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue, which this report clearly proves,” he said. An Airbus A350XWB Source: Kamran Jebreili/AP/Press Association Images Boeing’s chief executive and president Dennis Muilenburg echoed Froman’s claims and said the “historic ruling finally holds the EU and Airbus to account for their flouting of global trade rules”. The “winning” side may want to can the celebrations though – the WTO is in turn investigating whether Boeing has complied with rules on accepting a leg-up from the US. Tariffs With increased political turbulence on both sides of the Atlantic, it is not that difficult to imagine how the ongoing battle between Airbus and Boeing could set the stage for a full-blown trade war. If the EU loses its appeal, the US could impose import duties on goods coming from the region as punishment for breaching civil aviation rules. Boeing fueled this potential outcome by suggesting that Washington could receive up to $10 billion in annual tariffs if it decides to sanction the EU, a figure based on previous statements made by US authorities. Boeing's CEO Dennis Muilenburg Source: Ted S. Warren/AP/Press Association Images Meanwhile the WTO is to deliver a separate ruling on how Boeing handled a $5.3 billion leg-up it received in state funding, about half of what Airbus received. The Toulouse-based manufacturer could use that ruling as ammunition against its American competitor. The EU has also filed a complaint against an $8.7 billion payment Boeing received from the state of Washington in exchange for manufacturing new 777X jets at its Seattle facilities. Dominance The Boeing-Airbus duopoly has dominated the global aircraft making industry since the late 1990s when both firms absorbed several smaller manufacturers. The current battle dates back to 2005 when the US and EU both filed lawsuits over how they both funded their respected aircraft manufacturers. Since then, the two sides have repeatedly accused each other of accepting unlawful payments: Boeing through military contracts and tax breaks, Airbus through launch-aid loans. The WTO ruled in 2010 and 2011 that both sides had been unfairly financed and ruled that they should eliminate illegal payments. The two manufacturers have claimed victory several times and accused their enemy of non-compliance. This is a seemingly never-ending slagging match between two corporate giants that dominate in a fiercely competitive industry. Global air passenger traffic roughly doubles every 15 years. That means there will be around 7 billion air passengers per year by 2034, according to predictions from the International Air Transport Association, so both companies will be looking to meet deadlines for aircraft deliveries.

China, the US, India, Indonesia and Brazil are predicted to be the fastest growing markets, so both plane makers will be elbowing each other to win orders from airlines that operate in those regions. It is an expensive gamble for companies to invest in new aircraft. They cost millions and take years to build, yet by the time an aircraft is delivered a proposed route may not be economically viable any more. Indigenous manufacturers in some of those emerging markets are keen to get their own slice of the pie in the sky, but right now they don’t have the muscle of the big two to meet growing demands and adhere to strict regulations. China's competitor, the C919 Source: AP/Press Association Images The tit-for-tat mudslinging between Airbus and Boeing has been typical carry on in a dispute that has lasted more than a decade. Pundits have for years warned that it could lead to an imminent trade dispute on the back of this rivalry – only to later dismiss the petty bickering as a phoney war. But the latest warning comes at a time when protectionist policies are gaining significant ground in Europe and the US, which gives it a bit more edge.

Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Is America still a serious nation? Consider. While U.S. elites were denouncing Donald Trump as unfit to serve for having compared Miss Universe 1996 to "Miss Piggy" of "The Muppets," the World Trade Organization was validating the principal plank of his platform. America's allies are cheating and robbing her blind on trade. According to the WTO, Britain, France, Spain, Germany and the EU pumped $22 billion in illegal subsidies into Airbus to swindle Boeing out of the sale of 375 commercial jets. Subsidies to the A320 caused lost sales of 271 Boeing 737s, writes journalist Alan Boyle. Subsidies for planes in the twin-aisle market cost the sale of 50 Boeing 767s, 777s and 787s. And subsidies to the A380 cost Boeing the sale of 54 747s. These represent crippling losses for Boeing, a crown jewel of U.S. manufacturing and a critical component of our national defense. Earlier, writes Boyle, the WTO ruled that, "without the subsidies, Airbus would not have existed ... and there would be no Airbus aircraft on the market." In "The Great Betrayal" in 1998, I noted that in its first 25 years the socialist cartel called Airbus Industrie "sold 770 planes to 102 airlines but did not make a penny of profit." Richard Evans of British Aerospace explained: "Airbus is going to attack the Americans, including Boeing, until they bleed and scream." And another executive said, "If Airbus has to give away planes, we will do it." When Europe's taxpayers objected to the $26 billion in subsidies Airbus had gotten by 1990, German aerospace coordinator Erich Riedl was dismissive, "We don't care about criticism from small-minded pencil-pushers." This is the voice of economic nationalism. Where is ours? After this latest WTO ruling validating Boeing's claims against Airbus, the Financial Times is babbling of the need for "free and fair" trade, warning against a trade war. But is "trade war" not a fair description of what our NATO allies have been doing to us by subsidizing the cartel that helped bring down Lockheed and McDonnell-Douglas and now seeks to bring down Boeing? Our companies built the planes that saved Europe in World War II and sheltered her in the Cold War. And Europe has been trying to kill those American companies. Yet even as Europeans collude and cheat to capture America's markets in passenger jets, Boeing itself, wrote Eamonn Fingleton in 2014, has been "consciously cooperating in its own demise." By Boeing's own figures, writes Fingleton, in the building of its 787 Dreamliner, the world's most advanced commercial jet, the "Japanese account for a stunning 35 percent of the 787's overall manufacture, and that may be an underestimate." "Much of the rest of the plane is also made abroad ... in Italy, Germany, South Korea, France, and the United Kingdom." The Dreamliner "flies on Mitsubishi wings. These are no ordinary wings: they constitute the first extensive use of carbon fiber in the wings of a full-size passenger plane. In the view of many experts, by outsourcing the wings Boeing has crossed a red line." Mitsubishi, recall, built the Zero, the premier fighter plane in the Pacific in the early years of World War II. In a related matter, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit in July and August approached $60 billion each month, heading for a trade deficit in goods in 2016 of another $700 billion. For an advanced economy like the United States, such deficits are milestones of national decline. We have been running them now for 40 years. But in the era of U.S. economic supremacy from 1870 to 1970, we always ran an annual trade surplus, selling far more abroad than Americans bought from abroad. In the U.S. trade picture, even in the darkest of times, the brightest of categories has been commercial aircraft. But to watch how we allow NATO allies we defend and protect getting away with decades of colluding and cheating, and then to watch Boeing transfer technology and outsource critical manufacturing to rivals like Japan, one must conclude that not only is the industrial decline of the United States inevitable, but America's elites do not care. As for our corporate chieftains, they seem accepting of what is coming when they are gone, so long as the salary increases, stock prices and options, severance packages, and profits remain high. By increasingly relying upon foreign nations for our national needs, and by outsourcing production, we are outsourcing America's future. After Munich in 1938, Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax visited Italy to wean Mussolini away from Hitler. The Italian dictator observed his guests closely and remarked to his foreign minister: "These men are not made of the same stuff as the Francis Drakes and the other magnificent adventurers who created the empire. These, after all, are the tired sons of a long line of rich men, and they will lose their empire." If the present regime is not replaced, something like that will be said of this generation of Americans.

The upgrade from a single-aisle Airbus A321 aircraft will cater to strong demand to and from the capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, offering guests the more enjoyable comfort of a wide-body aircraft. Together with the other daily Boeing 777 Riyadh service, Etihad Airways will have more than 8,700 weekly seats on the route. Flight EY317 will be operated with a B787 Dreamliner, departing Abu Dhabi at 10:15, arriving into Riyadh at 11:15. The return flight EY318 will depart Riyadh at 16:25, arriving into Abu Dhabi at 19:10. Etihad's 299-seat B787 Dreamliner aircraft has a two-class configuration with 28 Business Studios and 271 Economy Smart Seats. Business Studio provides all passengers with direct aisle access and is equipped with an in-seat massage and air cushion control system to adjust the seat cushion for added comfort. Business Class guests can choose from an a la carte and Dine Anytime menu. Specialised hospitality services are also offered on board, including a Food & Beverage Manager in the Business Class cabin, multi-national cabin crew and a Flying Nanny, who is able to offer a helping hand to parents travelling with young children. Economy Class features the airline’s Economy Smart Seat which has a ‘fixed wing’ headrest, extra seat width and individual TV monitors. Etihad Airways currently operates the latest Panasonic eX3 IFE equipment for its B787 inflight entertainment system. Mobile connectivity with access to onboard Wi-Fi and seven satellite channels of live TV are also available.  “The Boeing 787 is playing a key role in Etihad Airways’ fleet expansion with routes carefully selected on which to deploy this unique aircraft. We are delighted that Riyadh will soon join our 787 cities giving guests a different experience to and from Abu Dhabi, and with convenient connections to destinations across our diverse worldwide network,” said Kevin Knight, Etihad Airways Chief Strategy and Planning Officer. “The aircraft also provides significantly more cargo capacity to facilitate the movement of a greater number of goods to and from the Saudi capital. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a very important market for Etihad Airways, supporting our global expansion since the launch of services 13 years ago. Our commitment to the Saudi market has grown since we began flying to Riyadh in 2004, steadily increasing our presence to the current 63 flights each week to and from four Saudi cities.” On the Riyadh route alone, Etihad Airways has flown more than 2.5 million passengers since 2004.  See other recent news regarding: Etihad Airways, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh Subscribe to our Latest Travel News Daily Email Free of Charge by simply entering your email address to the right.

While U.S. elites were denouncing Donald Trump as unfit to serve for having compared Miss Universe 1996 to “Miss Piggy” of “The Muppets,” the World Trade Organization was validating the principal plank of his platform. America’s allies are cheating and robbing her blind on trade. According to the WTO, Britain, France, Spain, Germany and the EU pumped $22 billion in illegal subsidies into Airbus to swindle Boeing out of the sale of 375 commercial jets. Subsidies to the A320 caused lost sales of 271 Boeing 737s, writes journalist Alan Boyle. Subsidies for planes in the twin-aisle market cost the sale of 50 Boeing 767s, 777s and 787s. And subsidies to the A380 cost Boeing the sale of 54 747s.These represent crippling losses for Boeing, a crown jewel of U.S. manufacturing and a critical component of our national defense. Earlier, writes Boyle, the WTO ruled that, “without the subsidies, Airbus would not have existed … and there would be no Airbus aircraft on the market.” In “The Great Betrayal” in 1998, I noted that in its first 25 years the socialist cartel called Airbus Industrie “sold 770 planes to 102 airlines but did not make a penny of profit.” Richard Evans of British Aerospace explained: “Airbus is going to attack the Americans, including Boeing, until they bleed and scream.” And another executive said, “If Airbus has to give away planes, we will do it.” When Europe’s taxpayers objected to the $26 billion in subsidies Airbus had gotten by 1990, German aerospace coordinator Erich Riedl was dismissive: “We don’t care about criticism from small-minded pencil-pushers.” This is the voice of economic nationalism. Where is ours? After this latest WTO ruling validating Boeing’s claims against Airbus, the Financial Times is babbling of the need for “free and fair” trade, warning against a trade war. But is “trade war” not a fair description of what our NATO allies have been doing to us by subsidizing the cartel that helped bring down Lockheed and McDonnell-Douglas and now seeks to bring down Boeing? Our companies built the planes that saved Europe in World War II and sheltered her in the Cold War. And Europe has been trying to kill those American companies. Yet even as Europeans collude and cheat to capture America’s markets in passenger jets, Boeing itself, wrote Eamonn Fingleton in 2014, has been “consciously cooperating in its own demise.” By Boeing’s own figures, writes Fingleton, in the building of its 787 Dreamliner, the world’s most advanced commercial jet, the “Japanese account for a stunning 35 percent of the 787’s overall manufacture, and that may be an underestimate.” “Much of the rest of the plane is also made abroad … in Italy, Germany, South Korea, France, and the United Kingdom.” The Dreamliner “flies on Mitsubishi wings. These are no ordinary wings: they constitute the first extensive use of carbon fiber in the wings of a full-size passenger plane. In the view of many experts, by outsourcing the wings Boeing has crossed a red line.” Mitsubishi, recall, built the Zero, the premier fighter plane in the Pacific in the early years of World War II. In a related matter, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit in July and August approached $60 billion each month, heading for a trade deficit in goods in 2016 of another $700 billion. For an advanced economy like the United States, such deficits are milestones of national decline. We have been running them now for 40 years. But in the era of U.S. economic supremacy from 1870 to 1970, we always ran an annual trade surplus, selling far more abroad than Americans bought from abroad. In the U.S. trade picture, even in the darkest of times, the brightest of categories has been commercial aircraft. But to watch how we allow NATO allies we defend and protect getting away with decades of colluding and cheating, and then to watch Boeing transfer technology and outsource critical manufacturing to rivals like Japan, one must conclude that not only is the industrial decline of the United States inevitable, but America’s elites do not care. As for our corporate chieftains, they seem accepting of what is coming when they are gone, so long as the salary increases, stock prices and options, severance packages, and profits remain high. By increasingly relying upon foreign nations for our national needs, and by outsourcing production, we are outsourcing America’s future. After Munich in 1938, Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax visited Italy to wean Mussolini away from Hitler. The Italian dictator observed his guests closely and remarked to his foreign minister: “These men are not made of the same stuff as the Francis Drakes and the other magnificent adventurers who created the empire. These, after all, are the tired sons of a long line of rich men, and they will lose their empire.” If the present regime is not replaced, something like that will be said of this generation of Americans.

Resend activation e-mail Scientific Method / Science & Exploration NASA officials mulling the possibility of purchasing Soyuz seats for 2019 Congress, which recently has fully funded the private program, will be displeased. by Eric Berger - Sep 29, 2016 10:40 pm UTC Login to bookmark 51 Johnson Space Center Director Ellen Ochoa and NASA Administrator Charles Bolden are seated inside a mock-up of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. Chris Ferguson, of Boeing, describes the interior of the spacecraft. NASA Senior managers in NASA’s International Space Station program have begun internal discussions about the possibility of buying additional Soyuz seats for US astronauts in 2019, two sources have told Ars. Although any final decision will likely come after the presidential election, the issue is “on people’s minds” at Johnson Space Center as confidence in operational commercial crew flights beginning from US soil by or before 2019 is shaky. Ars understands that NASA has not formally broached the topic with Roscosmos, the Russian space agency which builds the Soyuz spacecraft and rockets and manages their launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Negotiations would need to begin fairly soon, however, as it typically takes as long as three years of lead time for the Russians to manufacture additional launch vehicles. Uncertainty in the production timelines for Boeing and SpaceX, which are both developing capsules to carry humans to the space station, has driven contingency discussions about additional seats at the Houston-based space center. Publicly, NASA has maintained the hope that at least one private vehicle would be capable of operational missions by the end of 2017 or early 2018. Boeing has already slipped its schedule into early 2018, however. SpaceX has maintained the possibility of a later 2017 launch date, but with its recent accident, delays seem inevitable. Privately, NASA planners are concerned about additional delays that might slip those schedules further, into 2019. On Thursday, the director of Johnson Space Center, Ellen Ochoa, expressed optimism but not certainty about the private company timelines. “We think it’s very doable to have it in 2018, but you’re always just month to month with the progress,” the former astronaut told Ars. Asked about the SpaceX accident, she added, “It’s really hard to say what that impact will be. I would just say both companies are extremely committed. They are working well with us.” A politically painful decision A decision to buy seats almost certainly won’t be made until December or later, because such an action would be politically painful for the space agency. While it is true that Congress and the President agreed to retire the space shuttle after its final flight in 2011, no one in Washington DC was happy with the gap in US human spaceflight capabilities after the shuttle’s end During the first half of this decade, Congress exacerbated this gap by under-funding the commercial crew program, in which NASA gave contracts to several companies for crew transport spacecraft that were significantly cheaper than NASA could have developed. The lower-than-requested funding, totaling more than $1 billion over the course of several years, led to delays in initial flights from 2015 to 2017. But since NASA down-selected to just Boeing and SpaceX in September 2014, Congress has increased its funding level to more closely align with NASA’s requests. The agency’s own inspector general, Paul Martin, recently concluded that schedule delays beyond 2017 were due to technical challenges with the spacecraft’s design rather than funding issues. Hmm, we wonder why the price went up so much in 2010 and 2011. NASA Inspector General With that in mind, Congress will not be positively predisposed to funding requests for additional Russian seats, especially because the price keeps going up. Since the decision to retire the space shuttle in 2009, the Russian price for a seat has skyrocketed from about $30 million for a trip into orbit to $81.9 million for each of the six seats NASA bought for 2018. (This has led more than one aerospace insider to quip, “The Russians are the best capitalists of all.") It seems likely the price for any seats in 2019 would increase substantially, especially because NASA would be providing less than the three years of lead time as is customary for such orders. Trading seats Another wrinkle that NASA must contend with is how to handle trades for seats on commercial crew spacecraft after they begin flying. That is because when Boeing’s Starliner and SpaceX’s Dragon capsules launch from Florida, they will carry one Russian astronaut in addition to the NASA and any international partner astronauts on board. This is to ensure that every crew that goes to the station has representation of the two main partners, the United States and Russia. The way it works now is that there is an “A-line” Soyuz and, three months later, a “B-line” spacecraft, with a total of four launches a year. The A-line vehicle carries two Russians and one American, and the B-line vehicle typically has one NASA astronaut, one Russian, and one international partner. When the commercial crew vehicles begin flying, there will likely be a Soyuz launch, then a commercial vehicle, then a Soyuz, and so on. Essentially, a Starliner or Dragon will replace the B-line Soyuz now in the schedule. The wrinkle is that it has not been determined how NASA and Roscosmos will trade their seats. For example, one source familiar with the issue said it was unlikely that Russia would pay a comparable amount for a seat on a US commercial vehicle that NASA pays for Soyuz transport. (They might argue, for example, that the US vehicle is still in an experimental mode.) In any case, this may provide an additional point of negotiation—and Congressional consternation—if NASA decides it needs to purchase additional seats in 2019.

A nationwide realignment of military forces moved the jets to other bases, and the last of them flew out in 2009. The F-15s were built across the runways at McDonnell Douglas Corp., which became part of Boeing Co. Photo by Huy Mach, hmach@post-dispatch.com There are excellent defense and geostrategic arguments supporting the Obama administration’s approval of Boeing warplane sales to Kuwait and Qatar, but let’s be honest: For St. Louis, this boils down to economic stability and jobs — thousands of them. The St. Louis area has been in a holding pattern for the past two years, with the future of Boeing’s assembly plant in north St. Louis County in question as the company awaited approval of the two packages, with a total value of $7 billion. Qatar wants to buy 36 to 72 F-15 fighters, and Kuwait needs 28 F/A-18 Super Hornet attack jets. The two deals would keep the St. Louis plant churning at least into the early 2020s. The interaction between commerce here and events in the Persian Gulf region underscore why it’s important for our readers to keep abreast of world events. What happens over there truly matters here in tangible ways. We ignore developments in distant lands at our peril. Consider, for example, Boeing’s proposed $17.6 billion sale of 80 passenger jets to Iran. The very mention of Iran raises hackles for those concerned about Tehran’s nuclear program or those who still have fresh memories of Islamic Republic’s involvement in Middle Eastern upheaval since the late 1970s. State Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Glendale Republican who now is running for state treasurer, opposes the passenger jet sale and wants to punish Boeing by canceling tax breaks that help ensure the company doesn’t leave Missouri. Schmitt clearly wants to garner headlines and burnish his hardliner credentials. But the damage he seeks to inflict could have long-range, serious consequences. If Boeing doesn’t compete for this sale, Iran will almost certainly turn to Boeing’s competitor, Europe’s Airbus. It would help Iran replace a badly aging fleet of passenger jets that have gone poorly maintained after years of punishing international economic sanctions. This is a civilian safety issue. The Obama administration has negotiated a nuclear deal with Iran that, while imperfect, at least has delayed Iran’s ability to produce fissile material for several years. During that time, diplomacy and dialogue will be essential if there’s any hope of extending the nuclear agreement. The Boeing sale absolutely is a part of that diplomacy. Schmitt and his Republican cohorts are meddling in ways that promise to inflict far more damage than good. The Qatar and Kuwait sales underscore the long-term, beneficial effects from such deals. To keep these machines flying, both countries will need to ensure steady supplies of spare parts and maintenance expertise, which require U.S. government approval. That means both governments must maintain cooperative diplomatic ties with Washington. One relationship feeds off the other, increasing the likelihood that additional job-creating deals could come in the future. Schmitt must rethink this short-sighted political ploy.

Kuwait will purchase 28 Boeing Super Hornets, with an option for 12 more, in a deal worth $3 billion. Bahrain will receive Lockheed Martin’s F-16s. Had the deal not gone through, the F-15 production line would have been halted. © AFP 2016/ GIL COHEN-MAGEN Israel Searching for New Allies Despite Record Military Aid Package From US "In my opinion our national interest is being served by pursuing these sales; That always comes first, but a by-product of that is we are keeping production lines functioning in case we need to utilize those in the future," Corker said. "These countries are buying equipment that is interoperable with our equipment which gives us the opportunity to deal with crises as they occur." Part of the reason for the delay focused on Israeli objections. The United States is legally bound to ensure that Israel maintains a military edge in the region. Washington recently agreed on an historic military aid deal that provides Israel with $38 billion over the next ten years. © AFP 2016/ THOMAS COEX US Delivers New Fighter Jets After OKing Record Military Aid Package to Israel Israel also objected to the Qatari sale, arguing that the country supports Sunni Islamic extremists.

That's perhaps why they are dropping out of the peace deal. Damascus may not see the build-up because they are coming from neighboring states, from all directions.

Qatar Airways is in the process of firming up the order, which it was due to have placed at July's Farnborough airshow, but which was delayed by the Qatari government in an effort to speed up U.S. approval for the fighter contract, one of the sources said. Bloomberg reported that the deal was for at least 30 Boeing 777 and 787 jets, valued at about $6.7 billion at list prices. Boeing declined to comment and Qatar Airways was not immediately available to comment. If the deal is finalized, it would give the Chicago-based planemaker a substantial sales boost amid a slump in widebody orders this year. It follows news on Wednesday that the United States had begun notifying lawmakers informally that it had approved the sales of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar, valued at around $4 billion. The United States also approved the sale of fighters to Kuwait. The sales to both states had been pending for more than two years amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally, that they could be used against it, and criticism of Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker said in August that the airline planned to make a major aircraft order to enable its network expansion plans. In July the airline also said it was in advanced talks to purchase up to 30 of Boeing's 737 narrowbody planes. Earlier in the year, Qatar Airways refused to accept three Airbus A320neo narrowbody jets, because of engine cooling issues. The airline has canceled its first A320neo delivery and said it must source alternate planes to meet demand. Engine maker Pratt & Whitney said in March it expected the cooling problem and other software issues to be fixed this year. Airbus is struggling to keep up with deliveries to Qatar Airways of the long-haul Airbus A350 planes. Those delays, combined with the A320neo problems, has put Qatar Airways at risk of posting a loss in the fiscal year that ends in March, Al Baker said in August. "Our relationship is very strained," Al Baker said in August. "What's happening at Airbus with the deliveries is seriously affecting our growth."

REUTERS/Jim Young/File PhotoMore (Reuters) - Boeing Co <BA.N> is close to clinching a large sale of widebody jetliners to Qatar Airways, a deal that moved closer with the recent U.S. approval of Boeing fighter jet sales to the Gulf nation, according to two people familiar with the situation. Qatar Airways is in the process of firming up the order, which it was due to have placed at July's Farnborough airshow, but which was delayed by the Qatari government in an effort to speed up U.S. approval for the fighter contract, one of the sources said. Bloomberg reported that the deal was for at least 30 Boeing 777 and 787 jets, valued at about $6.7 billion at list prices. Boeing declined to comment and Qatar Airways was not immediately available to comment. If the deal is finalized, it would give the Chicago-based planemaker a substantial sales boost amid a slump in widebody orders this year. It follows news on Wednesday that the United States had begun notifying lawmakers informally that it had approved the sales of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar, valued at around $4 billion. The United States also approved the sale of fighters to Kuwait. The sales to both states had been pending for more than two years amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally, that they could be used against it, and criticism of Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker said in August that the airline planned to make a major aircraft order to enable its network expansion plans. In July the airline also said it was in advanced talks to purchase up to 30 of Boeing's 737 narrowbody planes. Earlier in the year, Qatar Airways refused to accept three Airbus <AIR.PA> A320neo narrowbody jets, because of engine cooling issues. The airline has canceled its first A320neo delivery and said it must source alternate planes to meet demand. Engine maker Pratt & Whitney <UTX.N> said in March it expected the cooling problem and other software issues to be fixed this year. Airbus is struggling to keep up with deliveries to Qatar Airways of the long-haul Airbus A350 planes. Those delays, combined with the A320neo problems, has put Qatar Airways at risk of posting a loss in the fiscal year that ends in March, Al Baker said in August. "Our relationship is very strained," Al Baker said in August. "What's happening at Airbus with the deliveries is seriously affecting our growth."

BERLIN: The United States began notifying lawmakers that it has approved $7 billion in long-stalled sales of Boeing Co fighter jets to Kuwait and Qatar, and more than $1 billion in Lockheed Martin Corp jets to Bahrain, sources familiar with the decision said Wednesday. The sales had been pending for more than two years amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington’s closest Middle East ally, that arms sold to Gulf Arab states could be used against it, and criticism of Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups. US officials began notifying lawmakers informally about the sale of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar valued at around $4 billion, and 28 F/A- 18E/F Super Hornets, plus options for 12 more, to Kuwait for around $3 billion, the sources said. They also told lawmakers about plans to sell 17 Lockheed F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain, plus upgrades of up to 20 additional aircraft. The deals will be formally announced once the 40-day informal notification process has ended. Then lawmakers will have 30 days to block the sales, although such action is rare. Reuters reported earlier this month that the US government was poised to approve the long-delayed sales to Kuwait and Qatar. The State Department said it could not comment on any ongoing government-to-government arms sales. Delays in the process had caused frustration among US defense officials and industry executives, who warned that Washington’s foot-dragging could cost them billions of dollars of business if buyers grew impatient and sought other suppliers. The approval of the fighter jet sales comes as the White House tries to bolster relations with Gulf Arab allies who want to upgrade their military capabilities. They fear the United States is drawing closer to Iran, their arch-rival, after Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers last year. Sources said officials at both the State Department and Pentagon had largely agreed to the deals some time ago, but had been awaiting final approval from the White House. Both Kuwait and Qatar are part of a 34- nation alliance announced by Saudi Arabia in December aimed at countering Islamic State and al Qaeda militants in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt and Afghanistan. The sales will boost fighter production for both companies. Boeing’s F-15 line is set to close in 2019 after Boeing completes work on a large order for Saudi Arabia, unless a follow-on order is approved. As orders slow, Boeing is increasingly relying on technology upgrades and services sales to maintain its revenue stream from fighter jets, Shelley Lavender, president of Boeing’s military aircraft division, said in an interview. The company is adding new technology to the F-15 and F/A-18 and other aircraft, and is refurbishing them on the same assembly lines use to build new aircraft, she said. When the current fighter jet lines end, that loss of revenue will be offset by upgrade efforts. “We’re blurring the traditional lines of new aircraft builds and sustainment,” Lavender said. Boeing’s broad portfolio from commercial derivatives rotocraft, autonomous vehicles, fighters and weapons “will allow us to remain healthy for the decades to come,” she said. Byron Callan with Capital Alpha Partner said he expected all three sales to be approved. —Reuters Share This article was published on 29/09/2016 Most Read Rain expected till end of month Number of Indian nationals in Kuwait reaches 921,666 Govt eyes taxing remittances, privatizing hospitals, schools Anti-expat sentiments on the rise; Interior plans to fines and fees 8-hour ban on travelers return overruled Are our ideals ideal?

It’s easy to do their training here.” The Galveston County Daily News (http://bit.ly/2cE4re8 ) reports Boeing is one of two companies — SpaceX is the other — contracted by NASA in the final part of its commercial crew program, which will allow the United States to again launch people and material into space. Advertisement Continue reading NASA in 2014 awarded Boeing a $4.2 billion contract to develop the Starliner. Once completed, it will allow the United States to return to the International Space Station for the first time since 2011, when the space shuttle was retired. NASA has had to rely on Russian rockets and private contractors to deliver crews and cargo to the space station since then. “This is a big project for Boeing,” commercial crew program Deputy Manager Chris Ferguson said. “We don’t just handle the product, but we are also in charge of training the astronauts as well.” In addition to the contract to develop the Starliner, Boeing also received a $1.18 billion contract last year to fund its Space Training, Analysis and Review (STAR) facility, which opened June 21 at Boeing’s facility about 4 miles from the JSC. Boeing Space Exploration is based in the Clear Lake area and employs about 3,800 people across the state. The training installations at the JSC — which include “part-task” crew trainers, an instructor operation station suite and a cloud-based simulation server — are the most current milestone reached by Boeing on the way to developing the Starliner spacecraft. “It’s a big milestone,” Ferguson said. “But we are also working on software developments and some of the final drops are taking place. Little things need cleaning up, but the big bones are in place.” Included with several other training devices still under development by Boeing, these installations will be used to train Starliner crews and mission controllers for flights to low-Earth orbit, according to a news release. Advertisement Continue reading The part-task trainers, are meant to replicate various phases of the mission and flight to help prepare the astronauts, according to Boeing. “(They) are convenient for us in being able to start and stop the simulation at different parts,” astronaut Bob Behnken said during a simulation. “It lets us repeat things and try out different scenarios until the data is locked in our brains. “It’s nice not to have to have such a large support team each time. We will be able to run more simulations with a limited staff.” Where the part-task trainers are meant to instruct crew members on mission phases, the instructor operator station suite is where controllers and instructors “will monitor flight crew and controller performance, introduce malfunctions and measure trainee responses.” “The base of the cloud-based server allows us to do four simulations at once,” Pete Meisinger, program manager for the Boeing space vehicle training program, said. Still in development, the Boeing Mission Simulator will be the “full-scale, high-fidelity simulator allowing astronauts to practice all aspects of the mission,” according to Boeing. “The structure will look like the CST-100 Starliner,” Meisinger said. “The interior is full-fidelity and has the actual controls and control displays in the spacecraft. If the part-task trainers are the batting cages, then this is getting on the practice field.” Boeing hopes to have the Boeing Mission Simulator ready in the early months of 2017, Meisinger said. Advertisement Continue reading After the installation of the mission simulator in 2017, Boeing looks to install a mock-up trainer in Building 9 at JSC with a delivery target of February to March of 2017. “That will give us the most high-fidelity environment possible,” Meisinger said. Alongside the installation of the training devices, Boeing is working to accomplish other milestones for a scheduled crew test flight in 2018. “I think it’s doable in 2018, but we also recognize this is month-to-month,” Ochoa said. “This is one more milestone in a long list to accomplish on the way to the launch.” Ultimately, the goal of the Starliner goes beyond the NASA partnership into what Boeing hopes will be further commercial development in low-Earth orbit. “NASA is the flightship customer,” Ferguson said. “After that, it will be largely market-driven, but there are three big possibilities. One is space tourism; two is manufacturing in low-Earth orbit, and the third is finding a country interested in having a program for low-Earth orbit, but doesn’t want to develop the infrastructure.” The Starliner will be able to carry up to seven crew members or a mixture of personnel and cargo. It will be reusable up to 10 times. ___ Information from: The Galveston County Daily News, http://www.galvnews.com This is an AP Member Exchange shared by The Galveston County Daily News Share Tweet LinkedIn Print Subscribe Around the Region Suggested Stories: Boeing, SpaceX to transport NASA astronauts – Sep 17, 2014 Bezos' space company to build, launch rockets in Florida – Sep 15, 2015 5 years after shuttle, NASA awaits commercial crew capsules – Jul 20, 2016 How Obama brought capitalism to outer space – Oct 11, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Facts 2016-09-29T14:47+02:00 14:47 29.09.2016 SBU calls intl report on investigation into Malaysian Boeing crash 'sentence to Russia' The results of the investigation conducted by the international investigation commission into the crash of the Malaysian Boeing in Donbas in July 2014 play an important role in determining those responsible for the tragedy, Vasyl Hrytsak, head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), has said. "The tentative conclusions drawn by the Joint Investigation Team on the Boeing downed by Russian aggressors were published yesterday [...]. All people can now judge whether Russia is an aggressor or not. Even tentative investigation data can serve as a sentence to the Russian side," Hrytsak told reporters in Kyiv on Thursday. The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 Flight MH17 en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down in the airspace over Donetsk region on July 17, 2014. All 298 people on board were killed. The Joint Investigation Team (JIT), comprising prosecutors and representatives of other law enforcement agencies of Ukraine, the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia and Malaysia, and also representatives of Eurojust, was created on August 7, 2014. The first results of the criminal investigation into the MH17 crash were presented in the Netherlands on September 28, 2016. According to the Joint Investigation Team, the Boeing 777 Flight MH17 operated by Malaysia Airlines was downed by a 9M38 missile of a Buk anti-aircraft missile complex, launched from the Pervomaisk district in Donbas, six kilometers south of the Snizhne populated area which was controlled at the time by Donbas militants. Investigators noted that the missile complex had been brought to eastern Ukraine from Russia and later sent back to Russia. Russian experts said on the day that they find it incorrect that there is no technical investigation into the presentation by the international investigative team on the Malaysian Boeing crash in Donbas. Mikhail Malyshevsky, adviser to the main constructor at Almaz-Antey, said the crash of the Malaysian Boeing in Donbas could have been caused by a missile of an old modification of a Buk system fired from an area controlled by the Ukrainian military. Russian presidential press officer Dmitry Peskov, for his part, said the report by the international investigation group investigating the Boeing 777 crash in Ukraine on July 17, 2014 cannot be regarded as "the final truth." Alexander Zakharchenko, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), told reporters on Thursday that the militants did not down the Malaysian Boeing.

The new maritime patrol aircraft is based on Boeing’s 737-800 fuselage, and will replace a fleet of AP-3C Orion aircraft currently in service with RAAF. The Orion aircraft is based at RAAF Base Edinburgh and will be replaced over the next three years. RAAF chief air marshal Leo Davies said: “The P-8A is the latest in a pedigree of Boeing aircraft that have provided important and significant operational capability to Australia. “This history includes the C-17A Globemaster, E-7A Wedgetail, F/A-18 Classic Hornet, F/A-18F Super Hornet, Helicopter Aircrew Training System and in the near future E/A-18G Growler.” The P-8A is equipped with weapons bay, under wing and under fuselage hard points for weapons and is designed for continued low level operations and high angle of bank turns. "The P-8A is the latest in a pedigree of Boeing aircraft that have provided important and significant operational capability to Australia." The first aircraft will arrive in Australia on 15 November, with the remaining 11 aircraft to be delivered by March 2020, RAAF said in a statement. Aircrew and maintenance personnel for the P-8A are being trained since early 2015 by working alongside the US Navy at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida. The first P-8A Australian pilot flew a four-hour sortie on 14 April 2015. The aircraft is capable of conducting long-range anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, along with intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. It can also be used for broad-area maritime and littoral operations. Image: A P-8A Poseidon flying alongside a Lockheed P-3 Orion. Photo: courtesy of US Navy photo by Liz Goettee.

WestJet at Gatwick: WestJet expands its long haul service despite competitor pressure CAPA > Aviation Analysis > WestJet at Gatwick: WestJet expands its long haul service despite competitor pressure 27-Sep-2016 Tweet © CAPA Attempts by WestJet’s competitors to flood the London market with capacity in order to undermine the low cost airline’s widebody experiment in the London Gatwick market have not produced the end result of driving WestJet from the trans-Atlantic space. WestJet is sending a clear message to its competitors that it plans to remain firmly entrenched on long haul routes. The company is currently examining options for more widebody aircraft, and is discussing further long haul expansion with its pilots. After a rocky start to its highly anticipated long haul service to London, WestJet is posting load factors on its routes to Gatwick that are higher than system average, and concludes that the flights are delivering positive returns. An interesting pattern in WestJet’s passenger composition on the company’s trans-Atlantic service to Gatwick is the number of US-originating passengers from large metropolitan areas that currently have nonstop service to London – a dynamic that the airline attributes to its lower fares. The US-originating customers are boosting WestJet’s sixth freedom traffic flowing over Canada to long haul destinations. WestJet seeks compensation over mechanical mishaps with Boeing 767 widebodies In May-2016 WestJet became the first North America-based low cost airline to broaden the low cost model on long haul flights across the Atlantic. The company added used Boeing 767s to the fleet for the launch of year-round flights from Calgary and Toronto to London Gatwick, and seasonal service from Vancouver, St John’s, Edmonton and Winnipeg to Gatwick. WestJet operates four Boeing 767 widebodies on the route in a 262-seat configuration – 24 “Plus” reclining seats and 238 economy seats. WestJet charges for meals, checked bags and seat selection on the flights.

The company’s trans-Atlantic debut was marred by operational disruptions stemming from aircraft mechanical problems, and shortly after the problems occurred WestJet declared that the issues were creating grief for the airline. See related report: WestJet’s 767 operational problems cloud a significant low cost long haul opportunity Recently WestJet CEO Gregg Saretsky offered some insight into the mechanical problems to investors, stressing that the challenges had nothing to do with the company’s organisational capability, “and everything to do with the health of the aircraft we received”. Under WestJet’s arrangement it acquired the aircraft from Boeing, who purchased the jets from Qantas. Boeing’s responsibilities included repainting, reconfiguring and refurbishing the aircraft interiors, and providing a clean bill of health for the aircraft, said Mr Saretsky. Problems alledgedly occurred with the maintenance, repair and overhaul company selected by Boeing to perform the work on the 767s. Mr Saretsky stated that WestJet was receiving the aircraft anywhere from 50 to 120 days late and the first jet had more than 200 snags – but none of the issues had compromised safety of flight, he explained. It took WestJet two months to smooth out the mechanical issues, and during that time the airline hired Omni Air International to operate services when the 767s needed repairs. Mr Saretsky declared that WestJet was holding discussions with both Boeing and the MRO provider for the additional expense that “we incurred as a result of the poor workmanship”. Previously WestJet has cited pressure in its unit costs excluding fuel for 2016, created by the expenses associated with the irregular 767 operations, which included using a third party contractor and compensating passengers for delayed flights. The company now expects its unit costs to increase 2.5% to 3.5% versus previous estimates of an increase ranging from 0.5% to 2.5%. See related report: WestJet’s positive unit revenue trend. 2016 still challenging for airlines, but investors encouraged At the high point of WestJet’s maintenance challenges with the 767s a lot of attention was placed on the age of the aircraft, which for WestJet averages 24 years. Mr Saretsky was quick to dismiss any concerns about the age of its widebody jets, noting that American, Air Canada, Delta, British Airways and KLM all reliably operate 767s of the same vintage. WestJet posts positive results in the Atlantic, despite competitive capacity additions Prior to launching its London Gatwick flights WestJet faced some investor trepidation about its long haul plans, given Canada’s tenuous economic environment driven by weakness in the country’s Western provinces due to the downturn in the oil business. WestJet took great care to stress that the 767 operations were a low-risk exercise; Mr Saretsky characterised the new flights as “almost a throw-away experiment” to see if the markets made sense. See related report: Canada’s airlines Part 2: WestJet stays the course as capacity growth dampens its stock price Mr Saretsky then recently expressed some regret over characterising the 767 operations as an experiment, explaining that it had triggered competitors to do “silly things”, including adding significant capacity in the market. WestJet’s main rival Air Canada did not sit idly by as the low cost airline entered the lucrative trans-Atlantic market with nonstop flights. Air Canada reacted by introducing its own flights to London Gatwick (it serves London Heathrow from several Canadian airports) through its low cost subsidiary rouge. Data from CAPA and OAG show that overall in early Jul-2016 seats between Canada and the UK grew 15% year-on-year, with Air Canada posting 6% growth. British Airways’ seat numbers fell slightly in that period, and Air Transat’s seats increased approximately 4%. Canada to United Kingdom (seats per week, one way): 23-Sep-2013 to 13-Mar-2017 Source: CAPA - Centre for Aviation and OAG Mr Saretsky stated that WestJet’s returns across the Atlantic would be better without the excess capacity; however, the company was happy with the performance of those routes, which have met the company’s goals of being accretive in year one. WestJet attracts US sixth freedom traffic on long haul flights due to its lower fares One observation Mr Saretsky offered regarding the new service is that many passengers on the Gatwick flights originated in the US, in larger metropolitan areas including Boston, Phoenix, Newark, Los Angeles and San Francisco that feature nonstop service to London. The stopovers for those passengers in Canada are driven by WestJet’s lower fares in the markets, and Mr Saretsky cited the benefits of the incremental transborder passengers at a time “when the weaker Canadian dollar is creating headwinds for us”. Although WestJet is enjoying a boost from sixth freedom traffic for its nonstop trans-Atlantic service from the US, it has no feed for beyond flights from London Gatwick. The airline approached British Airways about extending their current codeshare to cover flights beyond Gatwick but British Airways declined WestJet’s offer. As a result, WestJet has decided to end its codeshare with British Airways in Oct-2016 – the agreement covers WestJet’s flights to Canada’s interior beyond the country’s gateways. The dissolution of the codeshare is an interesting by-product of WestJet’s trans-Atlantic expansion, but it has not deterred WestJet from plotting further growth across the Atlantic; nor has the airline been deterred by the additional capacity ushered in by its competitors to quash WestJet’s trans-Atlantic experiment. WestJet declares its intent to remain in the long haul space; competition remains fierce Mr Saretsky has stated that WestJet is in the market looking for additional widebodies to operate further international expansion, and is also holding discussions with its pilots in order to facilitate that growth. WestJet is drawing a line in the sand, stressing that its foray into the nonstop long-haul trans-Atlantic market has moved far beyond the experimental stage. The airline is staking a claim in a market it can hardly walk away from if it wants to reach and maintain its return targets over the long term. During the decades-long duopoly that WestJet has held with Air Canada in Canada’s domestic market WestJet has survived heightened competition with its larger rival. Now WestJet consistently needs to prove that it can handle attacks from its familiar rival in the long haul space. Want more analysis like this?

WestJet’s 767 operational problems cloud a significant low cost long haul revenue opportunity 22-Jul-2016 The operational challenges Canadian low cost airline WestJet has encountered in its launch of widebody flights to London has done little to quell investor concern about the carrier’s ability to execute low cost long haul flights successfully. Mechanical problems with the Boeing 767s have triggered cancellations and operational challenges, which has created passenger frustration, and resulted in reaccommodation and other expenses that are not insignificant. WestJet has been working to smooth out the operational teething pains of the twin aisle jets, and is assuring that the hiccups are temporary. However, the less than ideal launch could call into question WestJet’s ability to spread the low cost model and stimulate traffic from Canada in the North Atlantic market. The company is attracting a higher level of scrutiny since it is the first LCC based in North America to attempt to spread the model on long haul flights. Despite the shaky launch of its long haul flights with widebodies, WestJet cannot ignore long-term opportunities presented by the long haul market from Canada – with a value in the billions. WestJet can ill-afford to cede all the revenue to rival Air Canada and non-Canadian airlines operating on trans-Atlantic routes. In the short term the airline finds itself in a position of now attempting to engender passenger confidence that its operational snafus are temporary, and its product proposition remains intact. jetBlue Airways, armed with its premium product Mint, is poised to disrupt the trans-Atlantic market 3-Oct-2016 Periodically throughout the last few years jetBlue has hinted that long haul trans-Atlantic flights could be a possibility at some point in its evolution. But in mid-2016 the company took a more concrete step towards serving trans-Atlantic routes by altering its Airbus order book – potentially to support long haul expansion. JetBlue’s decision to option the Airbus A321LR occurs at a time when airlines such as WestJet, Norwegian Air Shuttle and WOW Air are pushing the low cost model into the long haul international market. Perhaps the steps those airlines are taking to carve out the low cost niche in the long haul space has accelerated jetBlue’s evaluations of trans-Atlantic service. The company has declared that it would make a decision about its options for the long-range Airbus narrowbody in 2017 ahead of the narrowbody’s debut in 2019. The biggest drivers for jetBlue’s decision to enter the long haul trans-Atlantic market are identifying routes where it can inject low fares to stimulate traffic and drive revenue. The company’s base in Boston is emerging as the epicentre for those potential opportunities. © 2016 CAPA Centre for Aviation :: Contact Us :: Terms & Conditions :: Cookies & Privacy Policy :: Glossary :: Feedback :: All times are in AEST (GMT +11)

MH17 probe 'biased', Moscow 'disappointed': foreign ministry by Staff Writers Moscow (AFP) Sept 28, 2016 Malaysia PM vows justice after MH17 probe Kuala Lumpur (AFP) Sept 28, 2016 - Malaysia on Wednesday promised "firm action" against those behind the downing of Flight MH17 in Ukraine, after a Dutch-led enquiry found the plane was hit by a missile transported from Russia. The international criminal enquiry presented its findings into the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 in conflict-torn eastern Ukraine in July 2014, which killed all 298 people on board. "The Joint Investigation Team has concluded that MH17 was downed by a Russian-made missile and it was fired from rebel controlled territory," national news agency Bernama reported Prime Minister Najib Razak as saying. "Based on the two findings, Malaysia wants firm action to be taken. We have promised that those who were responsible for the downing of the aircraft will be brought to justice," he told Malaysian media during a trip to Germany. "We owe it to the families. The families want justice. So we will pursue this," he said. Malaysia will call for a meeting with representatives from other countries which lost citizens in the crash, notably the Netherlands and Australia, he said. The report did not assign blame but said the Boeing 777 was shot down by a BUK missile system from an area in eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists, and that the system was brought in from Russia and then taken back there. The dead included 44 Malaysians, along with 192 Dutch nationals and 27 Australians. Moscow on Wednesday described as "biased" and "politically motivated" the Dutch-led inquiry into the downing of Flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine, which concluded the plane was shot down by a missile transported from Russia. "Russia is disappointed that the situation around the investigation of the Boeing catastrophe is not changing," foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement. "The conclusions of Dutch prosecutors confirm that the investigation is biased and politically motivated," she said. She accused the Joint Investigative Taskforce of "arbitrarily designating a guilty party and inventing the desired results." The taskforce presented its findings on Wednesday after a two-year investigation into the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in conflict-torn eastern Ukraine, which killed all 298 people on board in July 2014. The conclusion did not assign blame but said the Boeing 777 was shot down by a BUK missile system from an area in eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists, and that the system was brought in from Russia and then taken back there. The ministry statement said the taskforce "excluded Moscow from fully participating in the investigation process" while embracing Ukraine as a "full member of the JIT" and giving Kiev an opportunity to "falsify evidence and twist the case in its favour". "Russia is practically the only (party) that sends true information and discloses more and more new data," the statement said. Yet the "whole 'body of evidence' of the Dutch prosecutors was provided by Ukraine," it said. The taskforce said Wednesday that Moscow had only provided part of the information that it had requested. Russia's defence ministry on Monday released what it claimed were new radar images showing that there was no missile fired from rebel-held territory on that day, which contradicted some of its earlier declarations. Russia's Almaz-Antey missile maker, which produces BUK surface-to-air systems, said in a briefing Wednesday that the inquiry did not include its findings. The state-controlled firm last October alleged the plane was downed from disputed territory by an outdated version of the BUK missile that is no longer in use by the Russian military. Dutch prosecutors said they only received Almaz-Antey's data this month and did not find that it outweighed the probe's conclusions. Points from the MH17 investigation Nieuwegein, Netherlands (AFP) Sept 28, 2016 - An international criminal inquiry into the 2014 downing of Flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine revealed Wednesday that a BUK missile which brought down the plane was transported from Russia. Here are the main findings of the inquiry carried out by the Joint Investigation team (JIT), led by Dutch prosecutors with teams from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine. - The weapon - The JIT said it has "irrefutable evidence to establish that on 17 July 2014, Flight MH17 was shot down by a BUK missile from the 9M38-series." Some 298 people were killed when the Malaysia Airlines plane on a routine flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was blown out of the skies over eastern Ukraine. It made this determination by dismantling various types of BUK, a Russian-made ground-based air defence system, and comparing them to metal parts recovered from the crash site. Investigators also ruled out alternative scenarios that the disaster was caused by an accident or a terror attack. And according to radar data, no other planes were in the area which could have shot it down. - Where did the missile come from? - Using photos, videos and intercepted phone conversations, the investigators retraced the missile system's route which they say originated in Russia. "The system was transported from Russian territory into eastern Ukraine and was later transported on a white Volvo truck with a low-boy trailer. The truck was escorted by several other vehicles and by armed men in uniform," the inquiry concludes. An intercepted telephone conversation said to be between two Russian-speaking men fighting on the side of the separatists suggests the launcher crossed the border on the night between July 16 and 17. The wiretapped conversation intercepted on Wednesday, July 16, 2104 at 7:09 pm records one man, identified as Nikolayevich, saying he doesn't know if "his men can hold" and asking if he can "receive a BUK in the morning... that'd be good. If not things will go totally fucked up". "If you need ... we'll send it over to your area," the other man, called Sanych, replies. - The launch site - The final destination of the BUK-TELAR launch system was farmland near Pervomaiskyi. Investigators said that at the time the field was in rebel-held territory. Witnesses told the investigators they had seen "a plume of smoke, the BUK-TELAR at the launch site in Pervomaiskyi, and the missile right after it had been launched." Multiple witnesses had also photographed the condensation trail of the missile and its movement. "After the BUK missile had been fired, the BUK-TELAR initially drove off under its own power. A short time later it was reloaded onto the Volvo truck and transported back to the Russian border. During the night, the convoy crossed the border into the territory of the Russian Federation," the inquiry says. - The perpetrators - Investigators did not name any suspects, but revealed they have identified about 100 people "who can be linked to the downing of MH17 or the transport of the BUK-TELAR." It is also probing the chain of command, and has extended the investigation to January 2018. "Who gave the order to bring the BUK-TELAR into Ukraine and who gave the order to shoot down flight MH17? Did the crew decide for themselves or did they execute a command from their superiors? This is important when determining the offences committed by the alleged perpetrators," the inquiry states in its report. The JIT team has put a number of intercepted phone conversations on its website www.jitmh17.com and is asking people who recognise the voices to come forward with information.

US approves Boeing, Lockheed fighter jet sales to Gulf BERLIN, September 29, 2016 The US on Wednesday began notifying lawmakers that it has approved $7 billion in long-stalled sales of Boeing Co fighter jets to Kuwait and Qatar, and more than $1 billion in Lockheed Martin Corp jets to Bahrain, sources familiar with the decision said. The sales had been pending for more than two years amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally, that arms sold to Gulf Arab states could be used against it, and criticism of Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups. US officials began notifying lawmakers informally about the sale of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar valued at around $4 billion, and 28 F/A- 18E/F Super Hornets, plus options for 12 more, to Kuwait for around $3 billion, the sources said. They also told lawmakers about plans to sell 17 Lockheed F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain, plus upgrades of up to 20 additional aircraft. The deals will be formally announced once the 40-day informal notification process has ended. Then lawmakers will have 30 days to block the sales, although such action is rare. Reuters reported earlier this month that the US government was poised to approve the long-delayed sales to Kuwait and Qatar. The State Department said it could not comment on any ongoing government-to-government arms sales. Delays in the process had caused frustration among US defense officials and industry executives, who warned that Washington's foot-dragging could cost them billions of dollars of business if buyers grew impatient and sought other suppliers. The approval of the fighter jet sales comes as the White House tries to bolster relations with Gulf Arab allies who want to upgrade their military capabilities. They fear the United States is drawing closer to Iran, their arch-rival, after Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers last year. Sources said officials at both the State Department and Pentagon had largely agreed to the deals some time ago, but had been awaiting final approval from the White House. Qatar, home to the largest US air base in the Middle East, and Kuwait have ramped up military spending after uprisings across the Arab world and amid rising tensions between Sunni Muslim Gulf Arab states and Iran, the region's Shi'ite power. Both Qatar and Kuwait are part of a 34-nation alliance announced by Saudi Arabia in December aimed at countering Islamic State and al Qaeda militants in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt and Afghanistan. The sales will boost fighter production for both companies. Boeing's F-15 line is set to close in 2019 after Boeing completes work on a large order for Saudi Arabia, unless a follow-on order is approved. As orders slow, Boeing is increasingly relying on technology upgrades and services sales to maintain its revenue stream from fighter jets, Shelley Lavender, president of Boeing's military aircraft division, said in an interview. The company is adding new technology to the F-15 and F/A-18 and other aircraft, and is refurbishing them on the same assembly lines use to build new aircraft, she said. When the current fighter jet lines end, that loss of revenue will be offset by upgrade efforts. "We're blurring the traditional lines of new aircraft builds and sustainment," Lavender said. Boeing's broad portfolio from commercial derivatives rotocraft, autonomous vehicles, fighters and weapons "will allow us to remain healthy for the decades to come," she said. Byron Callan with Capital Alpha Partner said he expected all three sales to be approved. – Reuters Tags: Gulf | Boeing | F-16 | Lockheed | fighter jets | More Miscellaneous Stories ADGB draws over 180 top UAE, international firms The Saudi Trade Finance Summit opens in Jeddah today Microsoft, CH9 partner to fuel business development in Bahrain 4 killed in suicide bombing at US base in Afghanistan Dubai Customs carries out over 3,000 seizures Saudi Prince Turki bin Abdulaziz passes away World Tea Coffee Expo draws over 3,400 visitors Anti-Trump protests spread across US, flag burnt Isis now using toxic chemical weapons Kanafani invests in Arab Advisors Group Online govt transactions top $5.25m in Bahrain On-demand expert marketplace expands to Mideast Dubai’s RTA to deliver disability cards 40 potential start-ups to pitch at Mena Angel Investors Summit Hellofood, Hungerstation merge UAE's food sector sales poised to top $16bn New law firm AS&H launched in Saudi Arabia Iraqi troops storm town near Mosul, thousands flee Bahrain issues directive on dual nationality Anghami raises funds to support regional expansion British MPs approval must for Brexit, says high court WOP Dubai to feature 15pc more exhibitors Battle for Mosul: Iraqi forces on city edge Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Boeing jet deal means big boost for St. Louis jobs By Chuck Raasch St. Louis Post-Dispatch Chuck Raasch Sep 28, 2016 (…) Courtesy Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, in a photo provided by Boeing. WASHINGTON • The administration of President Barack Obama has approved $7 billion in long-stalled sales of Boeing Co. fighter jets to Kuwait and Qatar, a decision that could preserve thousands of jobs in the St. Louis area. The deal had been delayed for more than two years, amid concerns by Israel that the planes posed a threat to that nation’s security. But members of Missouri’s delegation had long touted the sale as a jobs boost for the St. Louis region, where F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and F-15 Eagles are produced. The Navy also is considering building an additional 14 or more Super Hornets to replace aging ones and add to the Pentagon’s strike-force capabilities, although funding for them has been caught in the ongoing debate over spending bills now stalled in Congress. Reuters reported earlier this month that the sale had essentially been approved and that the next step would be notifying members of Congress. U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin, was among lawmakers applauding the decision. The fighter jet sales, she said, “will help our allies located within a volatile region fight the growing threats of Islamic extremism.” “These jets are also critical to the St. Louis manufacturing base and support 5,000 families whose loved ones build these jets, as well as thousands of additional jobs across Missouri,” she said. “I am thrilled that this sale was approved, which will keep the Super Hornet production line in St. Louis running into 2020.” U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis, agreed. “The administration’s approval of additional foreign sales of Boeing F-15 Eagles and Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets will not only strengthen our Gulf allies, it will protect thousands of skilled manufacturing jobs in north St. Louis County and at Boeing suppliers across Missouri and Illinois,” Clay said in a statement. U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said via Twitter, “I’ve been proud to back the F-15 and F-18 programs and the thousands of jobs they support, and will continue to do so.” The sales were delayed amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington’s closest Middle East ally. U.S. officials have also criticized Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups. Earlier this month, the U.S. pledged to provide $38 billion in military assistance to Israel over the next decade, the largest such aid package in history. The state of Qatar requested to buy at least 36 of the F-15 air-superiority jets, and possibly 72. Boeing is busy building F-15s for Saudi Arabia, and those orders would keep production lines in north St. Louis County running into 2019. The Qatari orders, worth $4 billion, would extend that into the early 2020s. Kuwait had requested 28 F/A-18 Super Hornet attack jets, with an option for 12 more. Boeing has enough orders to keep that line running into 2018. The $3 billion Kuwaiti order, combined with orders requested by the Navy, would extend production into 2020.

The White House also approved a sale of 17 Lockheed F-16 fighters to Bahrain, Reuters reported. The sales will be announced formally once the informal 40-day congressional notification period has ended. Then lawmakers will have 30 days to block the sales, although such action is rare. The approval of the fighter jet sales comes as the White House tries to bolster relations with Persian Gulf Arab allies who want to upgrade their military capabilities. They fear the United States is drawing closer to Iran, their archrival, after Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers last year. Qatar, home to the largest U.S. air base in the Middle East, and Kuwait have ramped up military spending after uprisings across the Arab world and amid rising tension between Sunni Muslim Gulf Arab states and Iran, the region’s Shiite power. Both Qatar and Kuwait are part of a 34-nation alliance announced by Saudi Arabia in December aimed at countering Islamic State and al-Qaida militants in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt and Afghanistan. Sources said both the U.S. State Department and Pentagon had largely agreed to the deals some time ago but had been awaiting final approval from the White House.

The sales had been pending for more than two years amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally, that arms sold to Gulf Arab states could be used against it, and criticism of Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups. U.S. officials began notifying lawmakers informally about the sale of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar valued at around $4 billion, and 28 F/A- 18E/F Super Hornets, plus options for 12 more, to Kuwait for around $3 billion, the sources said. They also told lawmakers about plans to sell 17 Lockheed F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain, plus upgrades of up to 20 additional aircraft. The deals will be formally announced once the 40-day informal notification process has ended. Then lawmakers will have 30 days to block the sales, although such action is rare. Reuters reported earlier this month that the U.S. government was poised to approve the long-delayed sales to Kuwait and Qatar. The State Department said it could not comment on any ongoing government-to-government arms sales. Delays in the process had caused frustration among U.S. defense officials and industry executives, who warned that Washington's foot-dragging could cost them billions of dollars of business if buyers grew impatient and sought other suppliers. The approval of the fighter jet sales comes as the White House tries to bolster relations with Gulf Arab allies who want to upgrade their military capabilities. They fear the United States is drawing closer to Iran, their arch-rival, after Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers last year. Sources said officials at both the State Department and Pentagon had largely agreed to the deals some time ago, but had been awaiting final approval from the White House. Qatar, home to the largest U.S. air base in the Middle East, and Kuwait have ramped up military spending after uprisings across the Arab world and amid rising tensions between Sunni Muslim Gulf Arab states and Iran, the region's Shi'ite power. Both Qatar and Kuwait are part of a 34-nation alliance announced by Saudi Arabia in December aimed at countering Islamic State and al Qaeda militants in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt and Afghanistan. The sales will boost fighter production for both companies. Boeing's F-15 line is set to close in 2019 after Boeing completes work on a large order for Saudi Arabia, unless a follow-on order is approved. As orders slow, Boeing is increasingly relying on technology upgrades and services sales to maintain its revenue stream from fighter jets, Shelley Lavender, president of Boeing's military aircraft division, said in an interview. The company is adding new technology to the F-15 and F/A-18 and other aircraft, and is refurbishing them on the same assembly lines use to build new aircraft, she said. When the current fighter jet lines end, that loss of revenue will be offset by upgrade efforts. "We're blurring the traditional lines of new aircraft builds and sustainment," Lavender said. Boeing's broad portfolio from commercial derivatives rotocraft, autonomous vehicles, fighters and weapons "will allow us to remain healthy for the decades to come," she said. Byron Callan with Capital Alpha Partner said he expected all three sales to be approved.

If it is completed, the Qatar Airways purchase would be Boeing’s largest twin-aisle sale this year, providing a little more visibility into its plans for the 777, Boeing’s largest twin-engined plane, as well as the Dreamliner. Published: 16:01 September 30, 2016 Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Chicago/Toulouse/London: Boeing Co is nearing an agreement with Qatar’s flagship airline for a multibillion-dollar commercial jet order, following US approval of a long-stalled sale of F-15 fighter jets to the Arabian Gulf nation. Qatar Airways is in late-stage talks to acquire at least 30 Boeing wide-body jets and would take 787 Dreamliner and 777 models, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. The order would be valued at upwards of $6.7 billion (Dh24.5 billion) at catalogue prices, although airlines typically negotiate discounts. Akbar Al Baker, chief executive officer of government-owned Qatar Airways, told reporters in late August that the carrier was poised to make a “large” aircraft purchase, adding to its backlog of orders for Boeing and Airbus Group SE planes. The US approved fighter-jet sales to Arabian Gulf allies including Qatar, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Boeing declined to comment on the discussions, as did a spokeswoman for Doha-based Qatar Airways. Double boost The two deals would provide boosts to Chicago-based Boeing as the world’s largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and second-largest defence contractor. The fighter-jet sale would help keep the company’s St Louis assembly lines busy through the early 2020s as US orders wane. That transaction could be valued at more than $7 billion for Boeing, Howard Rubel, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a note to clients. Boeing and Airbus have struggled to land sales of twin-aisle jetliners this year as a glut of second-hand 777 and Airbus A330 models curbed demand and the sold-out 787 was unavailable in the near term. Airlines in many parts of the world have reined in expansion plans as traffic has lagged behind projections, leading to overcapacity that drags down air fares. “From a producer standpoint, it’s badly needed,” Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, said by phone. “From a customer’s, it doesn’t make sense unless it comes at the expense of another order,” he said, referring to Qatar’s bulging order backlog that includes an agreement to take Airbus A350 wide-bodies. Production plans If it is completed, the Qatar Airways purchase would be Boeing’s largest twin-aisle sale this year, providing a little more visibility into its plans for the 777, Boeing’s largest twin-engined plane, as well as the Dreamliner, the company’s marquee carbon-fiber jet. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said earlier this month that sales campaigns underway could determine whether the plane maker boosts 787 output — and whether a dearth of orders will force it to again slow the assembly of the current-generation 777 models until an upgraded version of the plane debuts in 2020. While Boeing needs to sell 40 to 50 of the large jets annually to sustain current production plans, it has only netted eight 777 orders so far this year. “Obviously, pressure there, a number of campaigns under way. We need to be successful on some of those campaigns over the next two months to three months to hold that seven-a-month rate structure,” Muilenburg told a Morgan Stanley conference. Al Baker had said repeatedly that Qatar Airways intended to exercise the options it held to purchase 30 Dreamliners, a move that would double its Boeing 787 fleet. The carrier, which has global ambitions to match those of Dubai-based Emirates and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad, also holds orders for another six Boeing 777 and 60 of the upgraded 777X, according to the planemaker’s website. Very strained The Qatar Airways CEO has signalled his growing frustration with Airbus in recent months, threatening to switch an order for 48 Airbus A320neo family planes to Boeing 737 Max jets after declining to take delivery of the first Airbus narrowbodies because of an engine cooling issue. Airbus has also drawn Al Baker’s ire for its struggles to meet delivery deadlines of the A350, the European company’s most advanced jetliner, which competes with the 787 and 777. The airline was the first buyer of the new Airbus wide-body. “Our relationship is very strained,” he told reporters last month. “What’s happening at Airbus with the deliveries is seriously affecting our growth.” More from Aviation US House stops sale of Boeing jets to Iran 04:57 pm Emirates faces issues with new A380 engines 04:57 pm Boeing to cut 500 jobs in defence and space unit EasyJet profit falls as currency woes take toll Berkshire bet on the biggest US airlines Etihad starts hiring additional crew Shaikh Mohammad Bin Zayed restructures Adac Passenger traffic at DWC up 161% tags from this storyDubai follow this tag on MGNAbu Dhabi follow this tag on MGNQatar Airways follow this tag on MGNUnited States follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessAviation tagsDubai follow this tag on MGN+ MGNAbu Dhabi follow this tag on MGN+ MGNQatar Airways follow this tag on MGN+ MGNUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In AviationEmirates faces issues with new A380 engines Business Gallery Kish island turns to be a major tourism hub Pakistan, China launch new trade route Business Videos PlayStrata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedGalleriesVideos 01Emirates faces issues with new A380 engines 02Emirates faces issues with new A380 engines 03US House stops sale of Boeing jets to Iran 04Etihad starts hiring additional crew 05Shaikh Mohammad Bin Zayed restructures Adac 10Images Apple unveils Nike+ smartwatch Oct 29, 2016 1Image In pictures: Evolution of Emirates airline Oct 25, 2015 15Images Inside a Russian precious metals plant Oct 26, 2016 9Images In pictures: World Economic Forum 2010 Jan 28, 2010 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 Play Britain is open for business Sep 20, 2016 Explore the UAE Find the right airport Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News UAE announces public, private sector holidays Why expats risk fines to live in bed spaces Jailed, abused, and homeless Viral: Saudi man’s love poem to Ivanka Trump 'Utter devastation' after New Zealand quakes Data of 34 million Keralites leaked Your guide to tonight’s Supermoon Indian embassy to take up expats’ rupee concerns Best airlines to fly with in 2017 Close Recommended For You Professionals wanted to serve communityPUBLISHED ON Nov 18, 2016 Al Shabab fail to find the target in Dibba drawPUBLISHED ON Nov 18, 2016 Woman marries boyfriend in husband’s presencePUBLISHED ON Nov 18, 2016 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

transport UPDATE 2-Boeing nears wide-body jet sale to Qatar Airways -sources 29 September, 2016 The Boeing logo is seen at their headquarters in Chicago, in this April 24, 2013 file photo. REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo Reuters/Jim Young/File Photo (Rewrites with confirmation from sources) Sept 29 (Reuters) - Boeing Co is close to clinching a large sale of widebody jetliners to Qatar Airways, a deal that moved closer with the recent U.S. approval of Boeing fighter jet sales to the Gulf nation, according to two people familiar with the situation. Qatar Airways is in the process of firming up the order, which it was due to have placed at July's Farnborough airshow, but which was delayed by the Qatari government in an effort to speed up U.S. approval for the fighter contract, one of the sources said. Bloomberg reported that the deal was for at least 30 Boeing 777 and 787 jets, valued at about $6.7 billion at list prices. Boeing declined to comment and Qatar Airways was not immediately available to comment. Advertisement If the deal is finalized, it would give the Chicago-based planemaker a substantial sales boost amid a slump in widebody orders this year. It follows news on Wednesday that the United States had begun notifying lawmakers informally that it had approved the sales of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar, valued at around $4 billion. The United States also approved the sale of fighters to Kuwait. The sales to both states had been pending for more than two years amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally, that they could be used against it, and criticism of Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker said in August that the airline planned to make a major aircraft order to enable its network expansion plans. In July the airline also said it was in advanced talks to purchase up to 30 of Boeing's 737 narrowbody planes. Earlier in the year, Qatar Airways refused to accept three Airbus A320neo narrowbody jets, because of engine cooling issues. The airline has canceled its first A320neo delivery and said it must source alternate planes to meet demand. Engine maker Pratt & Whitney said in March it expected the cooling problem and other software issues to be fixed this year. Airbus is struggling to keep up with deliveries to Qatar Airways of the long-haul Airbus A350 planes. Those delays, combined with the A320neo problems, has put Qatar Airways at risk of posting a loss in the fiscal year that ends in March, Al Baker said in August. "Our relationship is very strained," Al Baker said in August. "What's happening at Airbus with the deliveries is seriously affecting our growth."

Virtually every poll.’ Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images Alan Yuhas @alanyuhas Friday 30 September 2016 06.00 EDT Last modified on Friday 18 November 2016 10.06 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Polls “Wow, did great in the debate polls (except for @CNN – which I don’t watch). Thank you!” – 27 September, Twitter “We won every poll. Virtually every poll.” – 27 September, Melbourne, Florida The lies Trump told this week: drugs are a 'big factor' in North Carolina protests Read more Trump did not win the post-debate polls. Trump seized on 11 online surveys, many of which allow people to vote many times, none of which vet respondents, and none of which weigh results according to actual voting demographics. Two of the online surveys Trump cited on Tuesday came from the Drudge Report, which excoriated his main primary rival almost daily this spring, and Breitbart News, whose executive chairman is Trump’s campaign chief executive. None of the 11 polls screened respondents or were predictive or representative of voters. It is therefore impossible to have any idea where those respondents are coming from, who they are, or whether they might be bots. On Fox & Friends on Tuesday morning, Trump also said: “I won CBS.” There was no post-debate CBS poll. Pollsters with more scruples heard Americans say that Trump lost the debate. A quick CNN poll – although imperfect – showed 62% of voters thought Clinton won versus 27% for Trump. A Politico/Morning Consult poll showed 49% for Clinton versus 26% for Trump. An Echelon Insights poll showed 48% of registered voters thought Clinton won and 22% believed Trump had won. The closest result was a survey by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-leaning pollster: 51% for Clinton to 40% for Trump. Although these polls are hardly flawless, social media surveys do not compare. Trump did perform well in one poll, by LA Times/USC, which gave him a four-point lead. As a tracking poll, it did not ask about the debate. And although Trump claims not to watch CNN, this month alone he has tweeted commentary about its programming nine times, including three embedded videos (each of himself). Facebook Twitter Pinterest Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump trade blows “A new post-debate poll that just came out, the Google poll has us leading Hillary Clinton by two points nationwide and that’s despite the fact that Google’s search engine was suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton. How about that?” – 28 September, interview with Fox News Trump is apparently referring to a poll by Independent Journal Review-Google Consumer Surveys poll – which said he lost the debate – and to a discredited conspiracy theory first propagated by the site SourceFed, which argued in June that Google’s autocomplete tool ought to turn up “Hillary Clinton criminal” when prompted by “Hillary Clinton cr”, because Google Trends shows an interest in this phrase and other search engines, Bing and Yahoo, do show “criminal”. As Rhea Drysdale, an executive at a search engine optimization firm, explained in June, SourceFed appears to have misunderstood Google’s algorithm. Autocomplete does not directly reflect what is popular on Google Trends, meaning it does not behave like Facebook’s trending news box, which promotes popular stories whether they are real, hoaxes, satire or conspiracy theories. SourceFed employees also appear not to have applied their random-letter-bias test to Trump. Typing “Donald Trump cr” turns up “crying”, “Crimea”, “crowds” and “crooked Hillary”. “Donald Trump in” turns up “India” and “Instagram”, with the same results for Clinton. In June, when the conspiracy theory first surfaced, a Google spokesman told CNN: “Our autocomplete algorithm will not show a predicted query that is offensive or disparaging when displayed in conjunction with a person’s name. “Google autocomplete does not favor any candidate or cause. Claims to the contrary simply misunderstand how autocomplete works.” Donald Trump attacks 'biased' Lester Holt and accuses Google of conspiracy Read more Boeing and Ford “See that plane? That plane was built in America. Now that same company is going to start building these planes in China. I don’t like it.” – 27 September, Melbourne, Florida Boeing no longer makes 757 models like Trump’s private plane, an ageing aircraft he bought used. Boeing is building an assembly center, not technically a factory, in China. The company’s CEO, Ray Conner, has directly contradicted Trump’s accusation that it will outsource manufacturing. The deal “will also create more jobs here”, Conner told the Seattle Times. “It’s lopsided on what we get and give – we get more. It’s being portrayed as the opposite.” Conner also defended the plant last year, before Trump began criticizing it. Boeing 737s will be built in Washington state, he said, and then flown to China for interior assembly. The company also put out a statement saying it had opened a $1bn facility in Everett, Washington, and expanded its Seattle delivery center. “Ford is leaving, thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They are all leaving.” – 26 September, Hempstead, New York Like Connor, Ford chief executive Mark Fields took the unusual step for a businessman of dipping into politics to reject Trump’s claim. “It’s really sometimes disappointing when politics gets in the way of facts,” he told a Bloomberg Market summit on Wednesday. “What we announced is that we will be moving our small car out of our Michigan facility down to Mexico. But we’re going to be replacing that with two other vehicles. So the facts are zero jobs will be impacted here in the United States.” Referring to the union of autoworkers, Fielda added: “And this is an agreement that we have with the UAW.” He also said, correctly, that the car company ranks highest for vehicle factory jobs in the US, at least as of last year. Fields may have understated the initial impact of the Mexico plant, but he is correct that Ford has struck a deal to invest $9bn in US plants, creating 8,500 jobs in the UAW and building Mustangs, Lincolns and Tauruses in the midwest. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Biden attacks Trump for boasting about not paying taxes Catching up with Clinton “He’s paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody’s ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn’t pay any federal income tax.” – 26 September, Hempstead, New York None of the actual tax returns Clinton alluded to during Monday’s debate are public, but a 1981 report to New Jersey’s casino control commission, which reviewed Trump’s taxes from 1975 to 1979, shows that he paid federal income taxes for three of those five years. He did not pay taxes in two of those five years because he lost more money, $3.8m, than he made. “When I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.” – 26 September, Hempstead, New York The lies Trump told this week: from 'deplorables' to his interrupted speech Read more Clinton appears to be exaggerating how quickly Iran could have developed a bomb. During negotiations, intelligence officials and analysts said they believed Iran was two to three months away from bomb capabilities. The terms of the deal extend that “breakout” ability to a year, and have restrictions extending over 10, 15 and 25 years. “What I have proposed would not add a penny to the debt.” – 26 September, Hempstead, New York Clinton’s proposed tax plan would add $191bn to the debt over the long term, according to the Tax Foundation, a conservative thinktank. The Tax Policy Center, however, estimates that she would add $1.1tn in revenue in a decade, though much of that would be offset by increased spending. The Tax Foundation estimated that Trump’s plan would add $5.3tn to the debt.

Qatar Airways is in the process of firming up the order, which it was due to have placed at July's Farnborough airshow, but which was delayed by the Qatari government in an effort to speed up US approval for the fighter contract, one of the sources said. Bloomberg reported that the deal was for at least 30 Boeing 777 and 787 jets, valued at about $6.7 billion at list prices. Boeing declined to comment and Qatar Airways was not immediately available to comment. If the deal is finalised, it would give the Chicago-based planemaker a substantial sales boost amid a slump in widebody orders this year. It follows news on Wednesday that the US had begun notifying lawmakers informally that it had approved the sales of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar, valued at around $4 billion. The US also approved the sale of fighters to Kuwait. The sales to both states had been pending for more than two years amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally, that they could be used against it, and criticism of Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups. Qatar Airways chief executive Officer Akbar Al Baker said in August that the airline planned to make a major aircraft order to enable its network expansion plans. In July the airline also said it was in advanced talks to purchase up to 30 of Boeing's 737 narrowbody planes. Earlier in the year, Qatar Airways refused to accept three Airbus A320neo narrowbody jets, because of engine cooling issues. The airline has cancelled its first A320neo delivery and said it must source alternate planes to meet demand. Engine maker Pratt & Whitney said in March it expected the cooling problem and other software issues to be fixed this year. Airbus is struggling to keep up with deliveries to Qatar Airways of the long-haul Airbus A350 planes. Those delays, combined with the A320neo problems, has put Qatar Airways at risk of posting a loss in the fiscal year that ends in March, Al Baker said in August. "Our relationship is very strained," Al Baker said in August.

(Qantas) Qantas will carry Australia Post’s international parcels for the next five years under a new contract. The extension of the pair’s previous agreement was announced on Friday. Qantas Freight chief executive Gareth Evans said it was a “substantial contract to secure”. “We have transformed Qantas Freight to deliver flexible and efficient operations for the changing needs of our customers,” Evans said in a statement. “This partnership sees the Australia Post Group and Qantas Freight well-positioned to support the e-commerce industry, which relies on air freight for express delivery of its steadily increasing volumes of international packages and parcels.” Under the contract, the 1,500 international flights operated by the Qantas group of airlines will continue to carry Australia Post’s international letters and parcels. Further, Qantas Freight’s interline agreements with other carriers would “ensure the Australia Post Group has world-wide access” for the 12,000 tonnes of parcels. A file image of Australia Post chief executive Ahmed Fahour and Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce in front of a StarTrack-branded Boeing 737 freighter. (Qantas) The contract extension for international air freight followed the signing of a five-year agreement in 2015 for Qantas to carry Australia Post’s domestic mail, parcels and Express Post until the mid-2020s. And in May 2016, the airline established a dedicated sub-fleet of six freighter aircraft to deliver domestic mail, parcels and Express Post for Australia Post and its subsidiary StarTrack comprising two Boeing 737-300Fs and three BAe 146-300Fs from Qantas’s existing freighter fleet, as well as a new Boeing 737-400F branded with StarTrack livery. Meanwhile, Qantas Freight also operated one Boeing 767-300F and two Boeing 747-400F freighter aircraft on international routes. The 747 freighters were operated by Atlas on behalf of Qantas. Qantas, Australia Post and StarTrack have a long history of cooperation. Qantas and Australia Post formed domestic air freight operator Australian air Express in 1992 as a 50:50 joint venture, while in 2003, again as 50:50 partners, they acquired courier delivery company Star Track Express. In 2012 Qantas sold its share of StarTrack to Australia Post, and in turn acquired Australia Post’s 50 per cent share in Australian air Express. StarTrack chief executive and executive general manager Bob Black said the partnership with Qantas was “important for our customers”. “This strategic alliance – combined with our global reach through existing partnerships with key ecommerce platforms, postal and freight providers – will help Australian businesses and consumers buy and sell goods internationally with confidence, and complements our unrivalled domestic capability,” Black said. Qantas said at its 2016/17 results presentation in August its freight business suffered a 44 per cent drop in underlying earnings before interest and tax to $64 million, which the company said reflected flat cargo demand amid a six per cent increase in global cargo capacity. Meanwhile, Virgin Australia commenced its cargo operations with dedicated freighter aircraft ferrying parcels, food, documents and machinery for its major customer TNT and other clients in July 2016.

Getty Images Related Media 10 Health-Care Plan Questions Employers Must Be Prepared to Answer Advertisement The Obama administration will compel employers with federal contracts to provide paid sick leave for workers and require all businesses to collect data on salary differences between men and women under two final rules issued Thursday. The first rule, which President Barack Obama announced last year, will require federal contractors to provide as many as seven days of paid sick leave for their employees. The White House said the rule will mean additional sick leave for more than 1 million people, including employees at top federal contractors such as Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. The rule takes effect January 1, 19 days before Obama leaves office. “This rule means that the federal government is putting our money where our mouth is,” Obama said in an interview with Slate.com. “We know that providing at least seven paid sick days a year to our contracted workforce will give us the best value for taxpayer dollars and is good for workers and business alike.” Popular Now These Industries are the Future of Additive Manufacturing Ford Sees Bumps Ahead with Used-Car Glut, Trump Presidency What a President Trump Might Mean for the Internet of Things In a separate action, the Labor Department will require companies with more than 100 employees to report salary data broken down by gender, race and ethnicity for the first time. The rule, intended to encourage companies to combat pay gaps between workers of different genders or races, will affect about 60,000 employers, the White House said. Companies will have to report the data by March 31, 2018. The two rules stem from executive orders Obama has signed within the last 13 months, as he’s sought to expand his legacy on labor issues in the final months of his presidency. Congress has tried to delay implementation of a new regulation to expand overtime pay protections to 4 million workers, and 21 states filed a lawsuit against that rule this month.

The sales to Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait can go ahead unless they are rejected by the US Congress. The Israeli government has used its influence to stall the sale of weapons to governments. An “informal notification” sent to the House and Senate foreign affairs committees on Wednesday begins an initial review that could last as long as 40 days, according to the officials, who asked not to be identified in advance of a formal announcement that will come later. That notice will trigger an official 30-day review. The aircraft sales will deliver on pledges by President Barack Obama and the Pentagon to bolster the weaponry of Sunni-led nations in the Middle East. Those allies were left angry and uneasy after the US agreed to a deal with their regional rival, Iran, to ease international economic sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme. The notification to Congress says the potential sales include as many as 72 Boeing F-15 jets to Qatar and as many as 32 of the Chicago-based company’s F/A-18 E/F fighters to Kuwait, according to one of the people. Lockheed, based in Bethesda, Maryland, would be able to sell as many as 19 of its F-16s to Bahrain. Qatar lodged its proposal in July 2013, and Kuwait made its request in April 2015. Bahrain’s is more recent. The aircraft sales could be valued at as much as $12 billion for the planes, and $20 billion if spare parts, logistical support and munitions are included, according to Richard Abu Lafia, an aerospace analyst for the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. He underscored that the sales would help keep open assembly lines for older planes, such as the one in St. Louis where Boeing builds the F-15, as US purchases shift to Lockheed’s new F-35. “These fourth-generation fighters have far more durability than anybody would have expected,” Abu Lafia said. “It’s a solid win for both Boeing and St. Louis. The F-15 could conceivably live to see a half-century.” Boeing was encouraged to finally see the sale progressing, said Scott Day, a company spokesman. “It’s nice to see the further movement on the fighter sales as they are part of the future of F-15, F/A-18 lines.” Lockheed spokesman Bill Phelps said in an e-mail that “it would be inappropriate to comment on the details of ongoing government-to-government discussions between the US and Bahrain.” More from Gulf Oman keeps terrorism vulnerability to zero 52 minutes ago Qaboos presides over National Day parade 07:13 pm Fighting rages in Yemen ahead of truce tags from this storyUnited States follow this tag on MGNIran follow this tag on MGNQatar follow this tag on MGNBahrain follow this tag on MGNKuwait follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsNewsGulf tagsUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNIran follow this tag on MGN+ MGNQatar follow this tag on MGN+ MGNBahrain follow this tag on MGN+ MGNKuwait follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In NewsA walk to beat diabetes blues Follow us Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosGalleries 01Viral: Saudi man’s love poem to Ivanka Trump 02Baby placed at cliff edge for souvenir photo 03Oman tightens tourist visa rules Play Dubai Canal opens with fireworks Nov 09, 2016 Play US expatriates in Dubai on Trump's victory Nov 09, 2016 Play Prince Charles tours Humanitarian City in Dubai Nov 08, 2016 Play Dubai Canal bridge lights at night Nov 08, 2016 24Images Supermoon rises over UAE skyline Nov 14, 2016 19Images Aftershocks rattle New Zealand after big quake Nov 14, 2016 12Images Pics: UAE Tolerance March draws crowd in Dubai Nov 16, 2016 1Image Pakistan, China launch new trade route Nov 14, 2016 Gulf: Weather today today-weatherManama, Bahrain Kuwait CityMuscat, OmanDoha, QatarRiyadh, Saudi ArabiaSana'a, Yemen weather-volume Celcius Fahrenheit Essential reading UAE announces public, private sector holidays United Arab Emirates Why expats risk fines to live in bed spaces United Arab EmiratesJapanDubaiSharjah Viral: Saudi man’s love poem to Ivanka Trump United StatesSaudi Arabia 'Utter devastation' after New Zealand quakes United StatesIndiaPakistanUnited Kingdom Latest Comments Haneef Puttur wrote: He may be an expert.

International investigators released findings Wednesday saying the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missiles that was transported into Ukraine from Russia. Turnbull said in addition to the Security Council, where Russia has used its veto power to block action, the Netherlands could take up its own prosecution of the case. “Every single one of those murdered victims killed by that missile brought in from Russia, fired with the knowledge of Russia, every single one of them demands justice and we will be tireless in our efforts to ensure that justice is done,” he said. The findings released Wednesday confirm an earlier investigation by the Dutch Safety Board that concluded Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was brought down by a Russian-made Buk missile, a claim Russia has denied. “It may be concluded MH17 was shot down by a 9M38 missile launched by a Buk, brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation,” said Wilbert Paulissen of the Dutch National Police. Paulissen said evidence shows that pro-Russian rebels requested the deployment of the surface-to-air missile to the village of Pervomaysk and reported its arrival in eastern Ukraine. But Russia has dismissed the Dutch-led investigation as subjective. “Russia is disappointed that the situation around the investigation of the Boeing crash is not changing,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement. “The conclusions of the Dutch Prosecutor’s office confirmed that the investigation is biased and politically motivated.” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov told the Interfax news agency, “All of the data presented today at the briefing by the investigation team has two main sources: the Internet and security services of Ukraine. Therefore, doubts are bound to be raised over the objectivity of this information, and, correspondingly, the conclusions based on it.” Zakharova said Russia offered to assist in the investigation but the investigators “removed Moscow from full participation,” relegating Russia to only a “minor role.” In a move aimed at preempting the new findings, Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier Wednesday that Russian radar data proved that no rocket was fired from within territory held by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. “The most important thing in today’s report is that the circle is narrowing and perhaps next year the international commission of inquiry will name the perpetrators of the crime,” Bogdan Petrenko, deputy director of the Ukrainian Institute of Extremism, told VOA. “Probably, after a final conclusion, it will be possible to take the Russian Federation to court. Of course, we are talking first and foremost about the relatives of the victims of the downed Boeing.” “The investigation, a trial in this case, is very important for Ukraine. It makes it possible to sue Russia according to several international conventions,” political analyst Olesya Yakhno-Belkovskaya told VOA. “One involves support and financing of terrorism. The results of the investigation of this tragedy are, in particular, proof of Russia’s actions in the east of the country — support and funding of military operations against Ukraine.” The U.S. Department of State said the findings support Secretary of State John Kerry’s statement days after the attack that the plane was downed by a BUK missile that was launched from an area controlled by Russian-backed rebels. “While nothing can take away the grief of those who lost loved ones on that tragic day, this announcement is another step toward bringing to justice those responsible for this outrageous attack,” said State Department spokesman John Kirby. Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed rebels were engaged in intense fighting in eastern Ukraine at the time of the crash. Ukraine reacts to findings Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry hailed the report as “an important milestone” that exposes Russia’s “direct involvement” in the missile attack. “This puts an end to all of Russia’s attempts to discredit activities of the Joint Investigation Team and conclusions by spreading distorted or fabricated information,” the ministry said. Malaysia called Wednesday for the perpetrators of the missile attack to be brought to justice. “Malaysia wants firm action to be taken,” said Prime Minister Najib Razak. “We have promised that those who were responsible for the downing of the aircraft will be brought to justice.” In addition to Russia’s consistent denial of any involvement in the crash, Moscow has claimed the airliner was downed either by a Ukrainian fighter jet or shot down from Ukrainian-held territory. But the evidence against that is overwhelming, military science analyst Justin Bronk of the London-based Royal United Services Institute said in an interview with VOA. “The rebels had been firing surface-to-air missiles regularly for months at all sorts of Ukrainian military aircraft. They did not have any official contact with air traffic control. So they basically have just taken delivery of a much more powerful missile system than they had had previously, and were shooting at whatever they could see. And they, unfortunately, happened to hit an airliner.” Netherlands chief prosecutor Fred Westerbeke said investigators have identified about 100 who were involved in the attack “one way or another.” He said, “A clear impression of the chain of command” must be established before it can be determined if they are culpable. The report, which stopped short of concluding Russian soldiers were involved, was prepared by prosecutors from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine. The report’s findings were based on thousands of pieces of evidence, including wiretaps, photographs, witness statements and forensics tests that were gathered over a more than two year period. Possible criminal trial Investigators say the latest findings, in addition to those from an earlier investigation, may be solid enough to be used in a criminal trial. Prosecutors cannot file charges at this time because international investigators have not agreed in which court to hold a trial. The previous investigation identified a 320-square kilometer area where it said the rocket launch must have taken place. Authorities did not explicitly say who had fired it, although all the land was controlled by pro-Russian separatists fighting Ukrainian forces. In a move aimed at preempting the new findings, Russia on Wednesday said its radar data proved that no rocket was fired from within territory held by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. On a conference call with reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russian radar identified all flying objects over the rebel territory, and there was no rocket. “The data are clear-cut…there is no rocket,” he said. “If there was a rocket, it could only have been fired from elsewhere.” All 298 passengers on the Boeing 777 died after it broke apart in mid-air while traveling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The downing of the plane was a major factor in a decision by the European Union and the United States to impose sanctions on Russia, leading to a rise in East-West tensions to levels not seen since the end of the Cold War in 1991.

They said the missile launcher was brought into Ukraine from Russia and later returned there. All 298 people on board the Boeing 777 died when it broke apart in midair flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Prosecutors said they were not accusing Russia of involvement. They said there were 100 people “linked to the crash or the transport of the Buk” missile, but they are yet to determine who could be held criminally responsible. There is a need to establish who gave the order to move the missile launcher into eastern Ukraine, and where the order for it to be fired came from, investigators said. Russia has disputed claims that the missile was fired by rebels in eastern Ukraine. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) consists of prosecutors from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine. They have narrowed the missile launch site down to a specific field near the village of Pervomaiskyi. “Based on the criminal investigation, we have concluded that flight MH17 was downed by a Buk missile of the series 9M83 that came from the territory of the Russian Federation,” chief Dutch police investigator Wilbert Paulissen said.  The missile launcher was later taken back to Russia, he said. An inquiry by the Dutch Safety Board last year found that a Russian-made Buk missile hit the plane but did not say where it was fired from. The JIT investigation’s findings are meant to prepare the ground for a criminal trial but suspects will not be named. Prosecutors played recordings from intercepted phone calls during their news conference. They said witnesses reported seeing the missile launcher move from Russia into Ukraine and presented pictures and videos. The launch site was pinpointed by “many witnesses”, prosecutors said. Relatives were briefed before the JIT released their preliminary findings.  “They told us how the Buk was transported [and] how they came to that evidence from phone taps, photo, film material, video,” Robby Oehler, whose niece was killed in the crash, told the BBC. Separatist rebels have denied they were involved. “We never had such air defence systems, nor the people who could operate them,” Eduard Basurin, military deputy operational commander at the rebel Donetsk People’s Republic, told the Interfax news agency. “Therefore we could not have shot down the Boeing [flight MH17].” Earlier this week, Russia said it had radar data showing that the missile was not fired from rebel-held territory. The JIT does not yet have access to that data, prosecutors said.  AFP reports from Nieuwein, Netherlands adds:  A criminal inquiry into the downing of Flight MH17 said Wednesday it is investigating 100 people for a missile attack on the plane two years ago over eastern Ukraine, saying the system used had been transported from Russia. The investigators also confirmed that the BUK missile which slammed into the Malaysia Airlines plane was fired from a field in a part of eastern Ukraine which at the time was under the control of pro-Russia separatists. The Boeing 777 passenger jet was brought down over rebel-held eastern Ukraine in July 2014 on a routine flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, killing all 298 people on board including 196 Dutch citizens. “Our investigation has shown that the location from where the BUK was fired was in the hands of the Russian separatists,” said Wilbert Paulissen, the head of the Dutch police investigation. The joint investigation “has identified approximately 100 people who can be linked to the downing of MH17 or the transport of the BUK-TELAR” missile system, Dutch prosecutors said.

Separatist rebels have denied they were involved. We never had such air defence systems, nor the people who could operate them, Eduard Basurin, military deputy operational commander at the rebel Donetsk Peoples Republic, told the Interfax news agency. Therefore we could not have shot down the Boeing [flight MH17]. Earlier this week, Russia said it had radar data showing that the missile was not fired from rebel-held territory. The JIT does not yet have access to that data, prosecutors said. AFP reports from Nieuwein, Netherlands adds: A criminal inquiry into the downing of Flight MH17 said Wednesday it is investigating 100 people for a missile attack on the plane two years ago over eastern Ukraine, saying the system used had been transported from Russia. The investigators also confirmed that the BUK missile which slammed into the Malaysia Airlines plane was fired from a field in a part of eastern Ukraine which at the time was under the control of pro-Russia separatists. The Boeing 777 passenger jet was brought down over rebel-held eastern Ukraine in July 2014 on a routine flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, killing all 298 people on board including 196 Dutch citizens. Our investigation has shown that the location from where the BUK was fired was in the hands of the Russian separatists, said Wilbert Paulissen, the head of the Dutch police investigation. The joint investigation has identified approximately 100 people who can be linked to the downing of MH17 or the transport of the BUK-TELAR missile system, Dutch prosecutors said.

They also narrowed down the area it was fired from to a field in territory controlled by Russian-backed rebels. All 298 people on board the Boeing 777 died when it broke apart in mid-air flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Russia said it could not accept the findings as the final truth, saying no Russian weapons were taken to Ukraine. “Based on the criminal investigation, we have concluded that flight MH17 was downed by a Buk missile of the series 9M83 that came from the territory of the Russian Federation,” chief Dutch police investigator Wilbert Paulissen told a news conference yesterday. The missile had been taken from Russia to rebel-held Ukraine in the morning of 17 July, when the plane was shot down, and the launcher was taken back to Russia the next day, he said. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has also narrowed the missile launch site down to a specific field near the village of Pervomaiskyi, which was then in rebel hands. n an interview with the BBC, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was “nothing to accept or deny”, as he understood these were preliminary findings. “We cannot accept as final truth of what they say. I bet you haven’t seen any proof of what they say,” he told the Hardtalk programme, adding: “We know the devil is in the detail, and we are still missing lot of the detail.” But he appeared to rule out that the missile came from Russia: “We’ve been ruling out the fact that any Russian weapons were shipped to Ukraine, any Russian army members, any Russian troops were inside Ukraine. And we’re still ruling out that possibility.” Ukraine’s President Petro Poroshenko hailed the inquiry’s initial findings, saying: “We have solid proof of who is to blame for this dreadful crime.” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called the preliminary findings “an important step on the road to the ultimate goal: finding and prosecuting the perpetrators”, whereas the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said his country sought “firm action” so that those responsible “will be brought to justice”. Near the village of Hrabove, where a large section of the Boeing 777 had come down, we soon found bodies scattered in the fields and a pile of suitcases by the side of the road. A child’s diary lay open on the ground. The intense heat from the crash had melted part of one of the wings and a section of human backbone lay in the ashes. For the families of the 298 people killed when MH17 was shot down, today’s report is a step forward in their long, frustrating quest to see those responsible brought to justice. The confirmation that the missile launcher had been sent from Russia implies that Russian soldiers could have been involved at least in the transportation and possibly in the firing of the rocket. But prosecutors admitted they did not know who gave the order to shoot the plane down. And while there is a determination to prosecute those responsible, it is very unclear that this will ever be possible, particularly if it would require Moscow to hand over suspects. Separatist rebels have denied they were involved. “We never had such air defence systems, nor the people who could operate them,” Eduard Basurin, military deputy operational commander at the rebel Donetsk People’s Republic, told the Interfax news agency. “Therefore we could not have shot down the Boeing [flight MH17].” An inquiry by the Dutch Safety Board last year found that a Russian-made Buk missile hit the plane but was not specific about where the launch site could have been. Earlier this week, Russia said it had radar data showing that the missile was not fired from rebel-held territory. Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?

At Georgia’s Perry-Houston County Airport on Friday a B-25 named Show Me sat at the end of Runway 36. Its powerful propeller twin engines shook the seats as the bomber waited to takeoff — a little bit like Jimmy Doolittle and his raiders did in 1942 aboard the USS Hornet. Eighty men volunteered for that mission — what turned out to be a one-way air attack — vengeance for Japan’s strike on Hawaii that crippled the US Navy fleet and left 2,403 dead. For them, Pearl Harbor was their 9/11. After four months, it was time for payback. The mission — depicted in the 2001 film “Pearl Harbor” — called for 16 US B-25s to take off from an aircraft carrier near Japan. The planes would bomb five Japanese cities and fly on to China, where the men would connect with friendly forces who would help them get home. On April 18, 1942, Doolittle and co-pilot Richard E. “Dick” Cole sat in the cockpit of their B-25 going over a preflight check list with the engines running. “I was setting the engine cowl flaps and watching to make sure the engines didn’t overheat,” said Cole, now 101 years old and a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel. “It was a bit hectic,” he said, because crews were scrambling. The mission launch was moved up by 12 hours because of fears that Tokyo had been tipped off. As a result, the B-25s would have to take off hundreds of miles farther from Japan than planned. That meant the planes wouldn’t have enough fuel to guarantee they’d land safely in China. “We were the first plane,” Cole said. “I remember I was hoping that we had done everything that we needed to do to make the takeoff. “ A versatile airplane Aboard our Friday B-25 flight in Georgia, Show Me’s pilot, Craig O’Mara, kept his feet on the brakes while pushing the throttles forward — revving up the ridiculously loud engines. “The noise is intense,” said David Thompsen, another Show Me pilot, because engine exhaust pipes aim toward the cockpit and crew cabin. With a green light from air traffic controllers, O’Mara released the brake and unleashed the aircraft. The 72-year-old plane raced 2,000 to 2,500 feet down the runway, accelerating to about 120 mph before completely leaving the ground. Owned by the Commemorative Air Force, Show Me appears at airshows nationwide to promote the Disabled American Veterans, a nonprofit charity which helps give a voice to disabled US vets returning from war. This weekend, the plane is one of the stars of the Thunder Over Georgia airshow at nearby Robins Air Force Base. During its heyday, the B-25 was a respectable warplane — distinguished by its twin-tail and versatility. “It became the most heavily armed airplane in the world, was used for high- and low-level bombing, strafing, photoreconnaissance, submarine patrol, and even as a fighter,” according to Boeing. Of nearly 10,000 B-25s built by North American Aviation, Show Me (which was not on the Doolittle Raid) is among fewer than 50 that can still fly. From our Georgia airport, it’s about 300 miles to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, where Doolittle’s raiders trained in secret seven decades ago to learn cross-country navigation without radios or landmarks and how to execute short takeoffs from ships. “The highest risk for pilots during takeoff from a carrier would have been an engine failure at a slow speed,” Thompsen said. Engine failure would force pilots to abort takeoff. They risked losing control of the plane which could allow it to veer into key structures on the ship. The mission begins A typical B-25 takeoff uses about 2,000 feet of runway, Thompsen said. But the Hornet’s deck allowed the planes as little as 300 feet to get airborne — otherwise they’d drop off the edge and crash into the ocean. Amazingly, the mission pilots had been trained to be able to take off as slowly as 75 mph with as little as 250 feet of runway. Have pilots ever tried that with Show Me? “No we haven’t,” Thompsen said. “That’s a high-risk maneuver and we don’t do that. We try to treat her gently.” With the natural winds, combined with speed from the moving ship, the B-25s only needed to get up to about 23 mph to fly off the Hornet, Cole said. Japan was about 650 miles away. A flag on the deck green-lighted the takeoff. It was time. Both Cole and Doolittle kept their hands on the engine throttles to make sure the levers didn’t accidentally slip downward and — in case of engine failure — to quickly bring the plane to a stop. With his engines revving hard, Doolittle released the brakes, sending the plane barreling toward the ship’s edge. Seconds later, the first raiders were airborne. ‘A little bit scary’ They made one circle over the Hornet and then pointed the airplane toward Japan. Soon, all 15 remaining planes followed. The grueling mission had begun. “I remember thinking we had just separated ourselves from civilization,” Cole said. “The range of our short-wave radio was only about 45 miles and we were going to be more than 45 miles away from civilization for 8 or 10 hours.” “In a way it was a little bit scary,” he said. But they were fully committed. There was no turning back. To avoid detection, the raiders flew extremely close to the Pacific — sometimes dangerously low. At speeds around 190 mph, Doolittle flew about 200 feet above the water. Incredibly, some pilots flew as low as 50 feet. One stiff wind or mistake in the cockpit could’ve sent the 14-ton bombers crashing into the ocean. ‘Drop the bombs’ At about noon, Doolittle and Cole’s crew were the first of the raiders to reach Tokyo. Still flying low, they encountered no air attacks, Cole said. Apparently, the element of surprise was intact. Bombardier Fred Braemer found a target and “Col. Doolittle pulled up to 1,500 feet and said, ‘Drop the bombs,'” Cole recalled. At one point over Tokyo Cole spotted several Japanese aircraft high above. “Apparently they did not see us,” he said. The B-25’s bomb bay is pretty much completely enclosed. “The bomb bay doors are hydraulically operated and they move very fast,” Thompsen said. “When they close, they’re kind of like a guillotine.” Overall, the raiders’ 16 planes hit factory areas, oil storage facilities and military installations. Despite plenty of anti-aircraft fire from the ground, all the planes reached their targets without being shot down. The raiders had accomplished their mission. They disproved Japan’s claims that the mainland was impervious to enemy attack. They also had dealt America’s first blow in response to Pearl Harbor — raising morale back home. “I felt that we made a pretty good retaliatory strike,” Cole said. Jumping out of a plane in the dark during a storm But the mission was far from over. They still had to get home — via China. When Doolittle and Cole’s plane reached the Chinese coast they were running low on fuel. Worse, it was dark and they were surrounded by a powerful storm. With no safe landing zone in sight, Doolittle ordered his crew to bail out at 9,000 feet, traveling about 166 mph. “All kinds of ideas go through your head” before you jump out of an airplane into the dark during a thunderstorm,” Cole said. “Number one, you hoped that the ‘chute would work and number two, you hoped you’d have a sense to know what you were going to hit in the terrain below you when you bailed out.” “Fortunately for me, I didn’t have to worry about hitting the ground,” he said. “My ‘chute opened fine and it caught on a small pine tree which made my landing very easy.” Cole spent the night in his parachute, suspended about 10 feet off the ground. The next day he met up with friendly Chinese Nationalist troops who also found Doolittle and the rest of the crew. A few days later they all were escorted to a US military aircraft, which flew them to safety. The legacy Overall, 11 crews bailed out of their bombers. Four planes crash-landed. One crew flew to the Soviet Union. Of the 80 raiders, three were killed in action. Eight were captured; one starved to death in a Japanese prison camp and three were executed. As if they hadn’t done enough, after recovering from their mission, many raiders, including Cole, rejoined the war to fight again. After the war, the surviving raiders lived out the rest of their lives, pursuing careers, building families, enjoying their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The survivors would reunite to toast their victory and their comrades. Two weeks ago the Air Force honored the mission’s legacy by naming its new long-range B-21 bomber The Raider, which is expected fly as soon as the mid-20s. Last June, former B-25 gunner/engineer David Thatcher died at age 94, making Cole the last living raider. When you can look back on a life like Cole’s, you’ve likely learned a few lessons along the way. The man who helped lead the Doolittle raiders offered some advice. “As you go through life,” Cole said, “expect the unexpected.” 'It was wild!'

"In a bid to explain the additional reasons for which Russia does not accept the methods used by the International Investigation Team, which, it believes, are taking the investigation in the wrong direction, the Russian Foreign Ministry will summon the Dutch ambassador to Moscow on October 3," Tass reported citing a statement. "The head of the Dutch diplomatic mission will hear the Russian side's arguments why it is impossible to ignore the vital objective data, which Russia has turned over to the Dutch side," the Russian Foreign Ministry said. "In the end, such an attitude is undermining the Russian experts' cooperation with the investigators and is discrediting all efforts aimed at getting the true picture of that tragedy and bringing the culprits to justice in compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2166," added the ministry . "The preliminary conclusions announced by the International Investigation Team have been obtrusively presented as the only faithful result, which brooks no doubt or contradiction. The Dutch side considers any criticism of the published interim results of the criminal investigation (into MH17 crash) to be totally unacceptable even if some substantiated arguments are presented," Zakharova said. The Dutch Foreign Ministry summoned the Russian ambassador to the Netherlands on Friday to demand explanations on Russia's statements concerning the criminal investigation into the MH17 Boeing crash over Ukraine in July 2014. --IANS sku/ SEARCH About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2016.

Defense News reported that Kyd wants the Bell Boeing V22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft and US Marine Corps F-35B fighter jets deployed for extended periods of time once the Queen Elizabeth is fully up and running.  © Flickr/ Royal Navy Media Archive UK Woefully Unprepared for Future Wars - Former Royal Navy Chief "We’ll certainly see some footprint aboard the ship," he said. "The big question is do they deploy with us much longer term in the future, maybe for six, seven, eight, nine months from when we deploy. That’s what I would love to see." During a London meeting between US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter and his British counterpart Michael Fallon in early September, it was confirmed that US fighters would deploy from Royal Navy aircraft carriers, and that British fighters would deploy from US carriers in the future. Construction is wrapping up on the 65,000-ton ship, which is slated to begin flight trials with British fighters in the summer of 2018. The Royal Navy has had problems with manpower and learning the new platform, but Kyd is confident that the challenges can be met.  © REUTERS/ US Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Scott Fenaroli/Handout US Navy Starts Accompanying British Ships Off Iranian Coast He told Forces TV, "Everyone understands the challenges we have across the country for engineers, particularly. But right now I've got 650 sailors on board the ship all beavering away… they're all very excited. We just want to get the ship out to sea, actually!" When Kyd first arrived on the Queen Elizabeth in May he called captaining the vessel is "without doubt the pinnacle of my career," according to the Royal Navy Website. Part of the decision to deploy American fighter jets from British warships is based on funding issues the Royal Navy has in acquiring the number of aircraft needed to mount a respectable strike force. Eight F-35Bs have been acquired so far, and another batch is in the process of being purchased. Kyd said, "We are constrained by the F-35 buy rate even though that was accelerated in Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) in 2015, so initial operating capability numbers in 2020 are going to be very modest indeed. We will flesh it out with helicopters, and a lot depends on how many USMC F-35s come on our first deployment in 2021. But by 2023 we are committed to 24 UK jets onboard and after that it’s too far away [to say]." ...

Courtesy photo Pictured above is Annelle Baum of the Hill with two â€œfur babyâ€ friends. Photo by Elizabeth Kane “What greater gift than the love of a cat?” wrote Charles Dickens over 150 years ago. Certainly this means that this week’s Neighbor to Know lives a truly gifted life.  Please meet Old Town Neighbor Annelle Baum. Seal Beach seems to attract an extraordinarily high proportion of native born Californians. This is most certainly true of Annelle, who was raised and still lives within the same six miles of where she was born in Belmont Shore.  The middle child of three, her mother was a nursery school teacher and for many years her father was the produce manager for John’s Food King market on Main Street.  She spent an abundance of time with her dad and remembers vividly driving to the produce farms not so far away at the time in Anaheim and Cypress to pick up for the store, not  at a warehouse, but at the farms which used to exist here back then. The family always had cats around and her mother told her that at 8 months old the first clear word she ever spoke was “kitty” from her high chair, and then did not utter another word for months.  Her first attachment was a kitten, Ziffy that came into the family and bonded with Annelle when she was just 3 years old and stayed with her until she was 21.  She attended Lowell Elementary and remembers one of the first times she recognized that she was an “animal person.” She won a pair of baby ducks at a school carnival; live ducks which would never happen today.  But a house in the city was no place for them so her father took them to a park that had a small lake,  where they set them free.  They would come back to check on their welfare, and she knew she was already on a path of caring and doing right by animals. When she graduated from Wilson High she was sure she was ready to test her wings by starting college at San Jose State.  But college was not her thing and she instead spent a few amazing youthful months bumming her way with friends through Europe, staying in youth hostels and traveling by Eurail.   She eventually found her way into a career in the travel industry, arranging trips and memories for others like she had experienced for herself.   She loved it and worked for both independent agencies as well as corporations such as Boeing, where she booked corporate travel.   She has been all around the world, seeing most of Europe, the South Pacific, Asia, Tahiti, and South America. Her most favorite place on earth, she says, is Fiji because “the people there are so amazing.” In 1973 she married first husband Mike and moved to what is now her forever home on 3rd Street.  The home was a typical beach bungalow then, with two units.  She and Mike lived in the back unit and rented out the front for many years until they built the home that stands there today. She and Mike were divorced in the 90’s but she has continued to live in and love Seal Beach for over 43 years. In 1989, Annelle was part of the startup that has now become the Seal Beach Animal Care Center, noting that Seal Beach actually had its own animal control officer back then.   She served as volunteer for years, walking dogs, caring for cats and on the board of directors, finding a clear connection and outlet for her love of animals.   But it was meeting Helen Sanders soon after coming to Seal Beach in the 70’s that would be a game changer for Annelle. Helen was our very own “Cat Whisperer.” Her life was devoted to the care and well-being of the feral cats that lived along the river jetty.  It was a common dumping ground for unwanted cats, and the population used to number well into the hundreds.  Helen would catch, spay-neuter and care for these cats.  When Helen passed away in 2005, Annelle and others knew they needed to pick up where Helen left off.  She and others tried for a few years on their own to continue the work, but it was financially draining. As a result, in 2010, Annelle founded CatPAWS, a 501(c) 3 organization whose charter is simple:  Providing education, support and resources to the community to help more cats lead full and cherished lives.  They do this by working toward three simple goals:  Promote  spay/neuter through education and providing vouchers 1)    Support Trap, Neuter and Return (TNR) efforts through providing medical care and food 2)    Save cats/kittens from public shelters where they would otherwise be killed At the time Helen passed away, there were over 180 feral cats at the jetty.  Today, due largely to the efforts of CatPaws the population now is less than 20 and declining each year.  In addition, CatPaws has built a strong relationship with the Long Beach Shelter, which is a euthanasia site, so they can pull cats and kittens and find foster homes and then permanent homes for them.   They provide the means for foster parents to care for babies and they have established amazing relationships with both Petco Seal Beach and PetSmart Long Beach to place adult cats in their adoption centers.  They also provide free spay and neuter vouchers for adoptive parents. The organization is always is need of donations to help with medical care, program costs and supplies. Annelle would meet her soul mate Kris Baum in 2003. Kris was a native born Seal Beach resident whose parents still reside here on the Hill.   They married on April 1st of 2004 at the Cottonwood Falls, Kansas courthouse where they were visiting an uncle who was turning 100. They took advantage of the simple and idyllic setting and with just a few family members with them, tied the knot.   They had 11 wonderful years together, before their time was cut short in December of last year with Kris’ unexpected passing.   She has found solace in the focus on her organization as she works through this devastating transition in her life, and if you visit her, her home is abundant with fur-baby love, from her dog to her cats and fosters who also give her focus and meaning each day.  Annelle exemplifies the day-to-day care that so many of you do each day to make our community better without fuss and fanfare.  She has gone about this so quietly you would never know, but we all should know and thank her and her volunteers for their efforts.  Make sure when you see her to say so.  If you would like to know more or would like to donate to CatPaws, please go to helensanderscatpaws.com.

Getty Images Advertisement The Obama administration has told Congress it won’t complete approval for Bahrain to buy as many as 19 F-16 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin Corp. and upgrades for older ones for almost $4 billion until the Gulf ally demonstrates progress on human rights, according to people familiar with the issue. The declaration of concern, which doesn’t specify what steps Bahrain would have to take, was included in a draft notification of the pending sale that the administration sent to Congress on Wednesday, according to the people who asked not to be identified discussing details of the message that wasn’t released publicly. The proposed sale to Bahrain is one of three involving fighter jets by Lockheed and Boeing Co. to Persian Gulf allies, according to people familiar with the decision. The initial, informal notifications to Congress say the potential sales include as many as 72 Boeing F-15 jets to Qatar and as many as 32 of the company’s F/A-18 E/F fighters to Kuwait, according to one of the people. Crackdown on Dissent While the long-delayed sales would deliver on President Barack Obama’s promise to bolster the defense of Gulf allies worried by U.S. participation in the nuclear deal with their arch-rival Iran, the strings attached to the Bahrain sale in the draft, which could still change, reflect concerns in the administration over that government’s crackdown on dissent and opposition. Popular Now These Industries are the Future of Additive Manufacturing Ford Sees Bumps Ahead with Used-Car Glut, Trump Presidency What a President Trump Might Mean for the Internet of Things Without specifying how much Bahrain must do before the arms sale can move forward, the Obama administration is calling on its rulers to reverse its moves suppressing nonviolent opposition and dissolving the al-Wefaq political society, the main opposition group of the country’s Shiite majority, according to an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The administration is also concerned by continuing legal actions against Sheikh Issa Qassim, al-Wefaq’s leader, and the detention of human-rights activist Nabeel Rajab, the official said. Secretary of State John Kerry has previously condemned the decision to dissolve al-Wefaq, saying the government’s efforts to suppress nonviolent opposition undermine Bahrain’s cohesion and security. The Arab nation hosts the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet in the Persian Gulf. Bahrain’s embassy in Washington said in a statement Friday hat the kingdom “has continuously taken extensive social, political, economic and judicial reform measures and is committed to continue its reform plans,” which it said are often downplayed. It said Bahrain “is highly concerned with the manner the Foreign Military Sales case has been politicized,” and “the government will not tolerate those exploiting sectarian rifts, either domestically or regionally.” An aide to Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee said the conditions proposed for the Bahrain deal will be evaluated by the panel as part of its review of the planned sale. Review Timetable The arms sales notifications sent to lawmakers this week begin an informal review to take as long as 40 days. That would be followed by an official, public notification, after which the deals would go through unless Congress moves to stop them within 30 days. In addition to the 19 new F-16s valued at as much as $2.8 billion, the sale to Bahrain would include upgrades costing as much as $1 billion to Bahrain’s existing F-16 fleet, according to the informal notification. Unlike Bahrain, the planned sales for Qatar and Kuwait are being proposed without conditions. “Anytime there are strings attached, countries are less likely to complete a deal,” said Loren Thompson, a defense analyst with the Arlington, Virginia-based Lexington Institute who also consults for Lockheed, said in an e-mail. Older Planes “If Bahrain goes elsewhere for its fighters, that would destroy U.S. jobs and undermine U.S. influence in the region,” said Thompson, who indicated he was aware in general terms of the administration’s conditions. Concerns on issues such as human rights are normally taken into account in deciding whether to sell arms to a country, not included as a condition in notifying Congress, said Joel Johnson, an analyst who follows foreign military sales for the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. The arms sales to the Gulf allies will help the U.S. contractors keep assembly lines running for their older fighters as U.S. purchases shift to Lockheed’s new F-35. “This order is very important to Lockheed Martin,” Michael Rein, a spokesman for the Bethesda, Maryland-based contractor, said in an e-mail. “We have been aggressively pursuing additional F-16 orders and without this sale to Bahrain we run the very real risk of the F-16 line shutting down. Bahrain is a valued customer and key partner.” Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

The disclosure was made during the Annual Navy Technology Exercise (ANTX) in August. To transmit the launch command to the Marlin, Lockheed engineers relied on the Submaran, an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) developed by Ocean Aero, as a relay. Middle East & North Africa It’s been reported that the US State Department has finally cleared the multi-billion sale of fighters to Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain. Sources told media outlets that US officials have begun to notify lawmakers informally about the sale of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar valued at around $4 billion, 28 F/A- 18E/F Super Hornets (plus options for 12 more), to Kuwait for around $3 billion, and 17 Lockheed F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain, plus upgrades of up to 20 additional aircraft. The deals will be formally announced once the 40-day informal notification process has ended. Eurofighters purchased by Kuwait will come equipped with Lockheed Martin’s Sniper targeting pod, with 14 more already requested for its F/A-18 legacy Hornets. Deliveries will commence in 2017 for integration. Once fitted, the Eurofighter will become the 9th platform to use Sniper, joining variants of the F-15, F-16, F-18, A-10, B-1, B-52, F-2 and Harrier. Africa Building is underway by the US military of a $100 million facility for the use of MQ-9 Reaper operations in the region. The news comes less than a year after the announcement was made that Reaper and Predator bases in Ethiopia and Djibouti would be closed. MQ-9s operated from East African bases are used primarily for missions against Islamic insurgents such as al-Shabaab in Somalia and AQAP in Yemen. Europe Romania has become the latest operator of the F-16 following delivery of the first six from a total of twelve from Portugal. The $203 million deal includes nine F-16AM single-seaters and three F-16BM two-seaters as well as an overhaul of engines; initial logistics support; training of up to nine pilots, 75 technicians, and four mission planers; two years of on-site support; and updating the fleet to operational flight program (OFP) development software M5.2R standard, with support from Lockheed Martin. More F-16s from another NATO member are being sought by Romania who currently operate a fleet of MiG- 21 LanceR aircraft. Asia Pacific Saab is to pursue Gripen figter sales to the Philippine Air Force, with plans to open an office in Manila by the end of the year. Speaking on the opening day of the Asian Defence and Security 2016 (ADAS 2016) exhibition in Manila, Carl-Erik Leek, Saab’s executive vice-president in the Asia Pacific, said the new office would be the centre of the company’s marketing activities in the country. Current efforts in the country have been coordinated from the company’s regional offices in Thailand. Delivery of the Malaysian Air Force’s fourth and final A400M transport aircraft will happen early next year. The first aircraft was delivered in March 2015, the second came early this year while the third was received in the middle of this year. Gen Tan Sri Roslan Saad told reporters that the latest A400M will come with a software upgrade. Boeing rolled out the first of its 12 P-8A Poseidon aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force during a ceremony in Seattle. The maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft, based on the design of Boeing’s 737-800 fuselage, will fly to Australia in November. Featuring a weapons bay as well as under-wing and under-fuselage hard points for weapons, the aircraft will be used for anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare and shipping interdiction as Australia looks to assert itself as a regional security player in the region.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:15 AM, September 30, 2016 Updated: 8:00 AM, September 30, 2016 Qatar Airways is in late-stage talks to buy at least 30 Boeing Co <BA.N> wide-body jets, valued at more than $6.7 billion at list prices, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The order, which follows the U.S. approval of a long-stalled sale of Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar, would include 787 Dreamliners and 777 planes for the country's flagship airline, Bloomberg reported. (http://bloom.bg/2dnOVra) Reuters reported on Wednesday that U.S. officials began notifying lawmakers informally about the sale of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar valued at around $4 billion, and 28 F/A- 18E/F Super Hornets, plus options for 12 more, to Kuwait for around $3 billion. Boeing declined to comment and Qatar Airways was not immediately available to comment. Qatar Airways is the largest customer of Airbus Group SE's <AIR.PA> A350 plane, a mid-sized carbon-composite jetliner designed to compete with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and larger Boeing 777. However, deliveries of A350s to Qatar Airways have been delayed due to shortages of cabin equipment, Reuters had reported in April. Qatar Airways earlier this year canceled its first delivery of the narrowbody Airbus A320neo jet due to delays because of an engine cooling issue, and has said it must source alternate planes to meet demand.

Flights had to be redirected from Nausori Airport since Sunday because after the sealing works carried out by AFL contractors , the airport was unsuitable for Fiji Airways Boeing 737 aircraft operations. Consumer Council of Fiji chief executive, Premila Kumar, said there should have been ‘better coordination’ between Fiji Airways and Airports Fiji Limited. She said they had received complaints from consumers in the way passengers on international flights from Nausori were managed by the airline and AFL staff members. AFL in responding to the statement said: “We need to understand that flight cancellation due to works at Nausori International Airport was an unforeseen. “AFL brought in a specialist Australian contractor who had worked for a number of nights to seal cracks at Nausori. “Flights would then resume in the day. However, on Sunday, the sealant they applied could not cure in the day resulting in flight cancellations due to precautionary reasons as we cannot compromise on safety. “Since then the contractor Supersealing carried out remedial works and as of Tuesday gave the all clear for runway usage. “Understandably the airlines are carrying out their own independent assessment before resuming B737 flight operations, whilst ATR operations resumed last Monday.” AFL said the reason for the crack sealing works was to give a longer life to the current Nausori runway to service airlines and passengers. This is whilst AFL works on the more permanent runway expansion over the next three years. “These crack sealing works will ensure better serviceability of Nausori over the next two years. The mishap by the contractor is an unforeseen and we are most apologetic to our passengers,” AFL said.   Fiji Airways response Meanwhile, Fiji Airways says they sympathise with their customers affected by the runway closure. “The unsuitability of the runway surface is simply beyond the airline’s control, and we’d refer queries regarding this to Airports Fiji Limited,” it said. “The first cancellation last Sunday was done at the last minute in the interest of safety. Non-availability of buses and restaurants to supply food on Sunday further contribute to delays faced by customers. “Fiji Airways and Fiji Link try to accommodate as many varying needs and requests as possible. “We do understand, however, the inconvenience facing customers in unavoidable situations like these. “Our focus is on getting our customers to their destinations. While it isn’t ideal to transfer customers from Suva to Nadi by road, at times it is the only option available. “Where seats are available on our Twin Otter and ATR aircraft, we are able to fly them to Nadi to catch a connecting international flight.”   Loss of money concerns The Consumer Council indicated they received complaints about some passengers suffering financial loss as they could not take their duty-free purchases already made at Nausori Airport to Nadi. AFL said they have seen the complaints lodged with the council but there are a number of agencies involved in duty free goods clearance. These include Customs, airport security, airlines, duty free operators, specific destination country security regulations, under the overall guidance of the regulator CAAF that are set up based on ICAO safety regulations. “In a one-off unforeseen occurrence, it is difficult to change the safety regulations and systems with multi agencies involved,” AFL said. “We have nevertheless taken the Consumer Councils concerns on board and will work with all agencies. “We invite passengers who have been affected in not being able to take their duty free goods abroad to contact AFL with their specific details. “We will work with the relevant agencies to find solutions. We once again apologise for any inconvenience caused out of this unforeseen.” Feedback:  rachnal@fijisun.com.fj     Tags Airports Fiji LimitedConsumer Council of Fiji chief executiveFiji AirwaysFIJI NEWSPremila KumarPremila KumarConsumer Council of FijiRachna Lal Share Share 0  Tweet 0  +1 0  Share 0  Share 0  Related Articles Scroll Back To Top Island Blu, VaiWai Making A Splash With Natural Artesian Water 0 First National Fisheries Policy In The Pipeline 0 Lawaki Bakery Success, Result Of Women’s Hardwork 0 Paradise Beverages Appoints New Acting GM 0 InterContinental Fiji Wins Fiji’s Best Golf Hotel 2016 0 Garden And Water World Increase Customer Numbers 0 "Everything we did was for our country we knew that we have to prove ourselves to be the best."

What specific opportunities are you pursuing in the regional aircraft leasing segment, following the capital infusion from Bregal Freshstream?  Some 50% of all global air travel is for journeys less than 500 nm. Many airlines that serve this sector not only are the regional divisions of larger airlines, but also dedicated independent regional airlines operating routes away from the traditional hubs. This section of the aircraft leasing market is relatively under-served compared to mainstream aircraft leasing. It requires a specialist approach and a distinctive skills set, as the needs of the market are different in some respects to the mainstream.   Many airlines in this sector operate types such as ATR, Bombardier and Embraer, both jets and turboprops. There is generally less choice for these airlines in terms of leasing options, so we see a great opportunity to provide a service to this market.   Specifically, we are purchasing aircraft in small groups for leaseback, plus individual deals for pairs of aircraft.  We are focused on diversifying our exposure by geography, aircraft type and by airline credit so that we build a broad portfolio.  Do you intend to continue focusing solely on regional aircraft? If so, why? Yes, we intend to focus solely on the needs of regional airlines. This means we must have the skills and experience required in the aircraft types our customers fly.  Generally speaking, the market for Boeing and Airbus leasing is crowded with many offerings. Dedicated, focused experience in ATR and Bombardier turboprops, for example, is less widespread and so our services are in demand.  Our combined management team has more than 100 years of experience in these types of aircraft in good times, and challenging times. We know how to locate, evaluate and support such aircraft and have extensive experience in remarketing and leasing them, which enables us to provide leases optimized for our customers' needs.    What’s included in your aircraft asset portfolio today and how will you build that over the next few years? Right now we already own ATR turboprops and Bombardier regional jets. We aim to close deals in the months ahead to establish a fleet of perhaps 20-25 aircraft over the coming months and perhaps 50 by the end of 2017. We have strong support from our equity backer. They share our vision of providing choice, flexibility and service in this part of the aircraft leasing market. We are committing to the purchase of both used aircraft from other lessors as well as airlines, plus new aircraft on sale and leaseback for delivery in the years ahead.  TrueNoord aspires to be “one of the leading lessors in the regional aircraft market.” How will you do this in the aftermarket and with end of lease transitions? Over the next few years, we plan to build a portfolio of aircraft of reasonable size and diversification. This means that in time, we also will be active in trading aircraft both mid-lease and at the end of lease. We have an enormous amount of experience in remarketing and releasing regional aircraft types--perhaps more experience than may be found in many larger leasing companies. We will be active in helping our clients manage their fleet, in terms of operating leases and remarketing aircraft to make way for changes in the fleet and new deliveries.  How long do you hold your assets? What is your lifecycle management approach? We are building a business for the long term. This means that we are happy to hold a broad range of assets in our portfolio.   This will always include a core of assets on long-term leases with high-quality credit exposure, together with a range of situations where leases may be shorter and the opportunity to trade aircraft will be presented.  Therefore, we will always have aircraft we manage throughout the lifecycle, through new delivery on first leases, through to trading aircraft on to other airlines for their second and third leases, through to eventual part-out.  At the core of our business, however, we are committed to holding high quality, young assets. This will be our main focus. Print Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Edward was saved and dedicated his life to Jesus in 1977 at the age of seven, and was baptized on Christmas Day. He graduated from Wenatchee High School and immediately joined the Navy. After his discharge from the Navy, he returned home to obtain his two-year Associates Degree from Wenatchee Valley College. From there, he attended Western Washington University and earned his Bachelor’s Degree in Anthropology with a minor in philosophy. He went on to attend University of Washington and while in Seattle, he met Suzanne Elenich. Together, they moved to Maryland, where she became a Certified Equestrian Instructor and he became a Certified Farrier. After completing their schooling, they made their way back to Washington and settled in Federal Way. While Suz continued her equestrian career, Edward found employment in a number of places. He accepted a position in maintenance and soon became the supervisor for an apartment complex. It was during this time he became interested in learning about low voltage electronics. Edward found out he had cancer in 2014. After surgery and treatment, he continued to pursue his interest in low voltage electronics and became an apprentice in that field. He was working as a contracted employee for Boeing when they found out his health would no longer allow him to work in this field. He immediately pursued opportunities to teach creative writing to students in an effort to pursue his certification to teach. Edward was a sponge for learning and meeting people. To his family, he was a wanderer, but to God, he was a teacher of how one should be a friend. While many of us are building walls around ourselves in our lives and careers, Edward was reaching out to his fellow man from Washington State to Maryland, and back again. With kindness, loyalty, generosity and acceptance, he showed all who crossed his path his true self. Edward was an intelligent, curious child who followed his mother around the house relentlessly asking question after question. Once, she closed the door between them for just a moment, and at three years old, he had not finished asking his question, he put his little mouth to the crack in the door and pressed for just one more answer to the important subject on his mind. As an adult, he could carry on a meaningful conversation with anyone who happened to be in his general area, and could talk intelligently on almost any subject. His many friends can attest to his appreciation for individuality, and personal growth. He accepted people no matter where they were in life without judgement or compromise. Edward is in heaven, in the truest sense. We can only imagine his excitement today, as he speaks to those who hold answers to the questions that remained unanswered here on earth. We are sure he is picking the brains of Martin Luther King, Jr., President Lincoln, and a host of others: and we rejoice. We find peace knowing that Edward has finally met his little brother, Joshua; said hi to his Grandma, Lorraine; mama, E.C.; and papa, Pete Melton; hugged his cousin, Jenny Mathews; said hi to auntie Bonnie and auntie Debra. Edward is survived by his soulmate, Suzanne Elenich of Federal Way, WA; parents, John and LauVonne Melton of Wenatchee, WA; aunts and uncles: Orville and Kathy Ochs, Eldon (Eno) and Lori Ochs, Dolonne “Donnie” Beem, Donald and Kelli Melton, Dennis and Shirley Carey, all of Wenatchee, WA; and aunt, Connie Melton of Yakima, WA; papa, Bob Williams of Wenatchee, WA; and many cousins and friends. Edward was preceded in death by his infant brother, Joshua John; grandparents: Lorraine Ochs, Ireneaus “Edward” Ochs, Otis “Pete” Melton, E.C. Melton; aunts: Bonnie Melton, Debra Ochs and Vickie Villa. His Celebration of Life will be held on Friday, September 30, 2016, at 2:00 p.m. at Wenatchee Valley Baptist Church, located at 650 Crawford St., Wenatchee, WA. In Lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Lighthouse Ministries or Wenatchee Valley Baptist Church. Arrangements are by Telford’s Chapel of the Valley, East Wenatchee, WA.

DeHart, 70, is retired from the Boeing Co. This is the second time he has applied to fill a council vacancy. DeHart also made his interest know when Kellen Northcott was appointed to a council vacancy several months ago. DeHart and a second applicant, Riverside Printing co-owner Ben Nelson, were briefly interviewed at last week’s council meeting. Council members then selected DeHart to fill the position. In other business, the council set Oct. 26 as the date for an event to recognize community volunteers for the contributions during the past year. The event will be in the Winthrop Barn. Acheson reminded the council that Confluence Park, the recently completed public space on Riverside Avenue, will be dedicated on Oct. 8 at 11:30 a.m. Jim and Gaye Pigott, owners of Moccasin Lake Ranch, privately financed construction of the park on the former site of the Arrowleaf Bistro. They will donate the park to the Town of Winthrop, which will then take over its maintenance. The Pigotts intend to dedicate the park to Gaye Pigott’s father, Jon Titcomb, who bought Moccasin Lake Ranch in 1961. Council member Mike Strulic noted that the park is already seeing lots of activity. “People are really using it and pleased with it,” he said. “I feel like it was a good decision.” The council also adopted a timeline for considering and adopting the town’s 2017 budget, with the goal of having a public hearing on Nov. 16.

Sections Machines Discoveries Space Futures Gaming Earth Videos About en de es fr it nl pt The VICE Channels Share Tweet Motherboard Motherboard Watch Sections Machines Discoveries Space Futures Gaming Earth Latest Videos Documentaries Interviews Machines Discoveries Space Futures Gaming Earth Follow Motherboard Newsletter A still image from 'The Martian' starring Matt Damon. Image: 20th Century Fox Why ‘The Martian’ Author Won’t Join Elon Musk’s Mars Mission Written by Shannon Stirone September 29, 2016 // 08:00 AM EST Copy This URL Earlier this week, SpaceX founder Elon Musk announced his plans for colonizing Mars by the middle of this century, using a humongous new spacecraft design called the Interplanetary Transport System (ITS), which would be capable of carrying a crew of 100 people to the Red Planet at a time. Musk’s sincere belief is that this system can and should ferry up to a million Martian colonists by the 2060s. The plan, which you can read more about in detail here, is incredibly ambitious and plenty outlandish. It’s has already drawn its fair share of critical dissection by those of us in the sci-tech media. But how does it stack up to what we’ve learned about traveling to Mars from sci-fi? To find out, we asked Andy Weir, the author of the bestselling realistic sci-fi novel-turned film The Martian. “The mission profile is definitely achievable, there’s nothing unreasonable in it, but there’s also nothing really innovative about it either,” Weir told Motherboard in a phone conversation. “I’m a huge SpaceX fanboy, I think they are the best commercial spaceflight company out there." Weir also thinks that SpaceX’s cost estimates—$230 million for the booster rocket and a $10 billion total development cost, according to Spaceflight Insider—are optimistic. “A Boeing 777, the workhorse of international travel, costs $320 million,” Weir said. “SpaceX is saying that they can make a long range spacecraft for less than it costs to buy a long range aircraft, I don’t think those numbers add up.” Don’t get Weir wrong though, he loves SpaceX. “I’m a huge SpaceX fanboy, I think they are the best commercial spaceflight company out there," he told me. "They’re innovating and forcing other space industry to actually get off their asses and innovate rather than enjoying their big contracts.” Musk and his SpaceX team have been criticized for years about their lofty plans for reusable rockets and getting to space with people in tow; the new ITS plans will no doubt incite a new level of skepticism. One of the biggest questions raised yesterday was who would want to be crammed into a spacecraft with 99 other strangers for a minimum of three months. Andy Weir testifies before Congress in May 2016. Image: Andy Weir/Facebook Weir’s not too worried about that, though. “People once gathered together in vomit encrusted boats to come to the New World,” Weir said, referring to the Age of Discovery (1500s-1800s) “I did some math on the crew cabin [for the ITS] and it’s actually got a huge internal volume. There’s enough room for everyone to almost have their own dorm room and common spaces.” According to Musk’s presentation, the ITS passenger vehicle would be 49.5 meters (162 feet) in length, and have a diameter of 17 meters (55 feet). Weir makes a good point, as humans have put themselves through some pretty harrowing situations in search of new lands and opportunities. But unlike the first European settlers who came to America —a land rich with soil for farming, lumber, minerals, people, and trade opportunities—Mars is a barren, lifeless, cold deadly place. “There is literally nothing on Mars that’s not in abundance on Earth. So why go?” Weir asked. “The only reason I can imagine people would want to go is because humans have an inherent instinct to spread out, explore, and live in weird places.” During the Q&A portion following Musk’s talk yesterday, when someone asked the space-loving entrepreneur if he planned on going to Mars someday, he seemed a bit hesitant about answering. "I like Earth. I like the internet. I like Diet Coke. I have cats. I write about brave people —I’m not one of them.” You might expect that Andy Weir, who literally wrote the book on traveling to Mars, would be one of the first on board of Musk’s ITS system, but this is not the case. So would he go? “No, not at all,” Weir said. “I do not have that explorer’s instinct. I don’t have ‘the Right Stuff.’ I wouldn’t even go to low Earth orbit. If someone offered me a free trip to the International Space Station, I would decline. I like Earth. I like the internet. I like Diet Coke. I have cats. I write about brave people —I’m not one of them.” Musk’s plans for SpaceX may seem a little mad or brilliant or the stuff of science fiction, but as he pointed out in his talk on Tuesday, SpaceX has delivered on some ambitious goals, goals like landing upright rockets on floating barges and becoming the first private company in history to send cargo to the space station; goals that were previously relegated to science fiction from the 1940s and 50s. (Back then, it was assumed if we ever were a legitimate space faring people than of course we would re-use our rockets!) Transporting humans en masse to other planets like Mars has been present in that art, too. If we are to really go to the Red Planet or worlds beyond, maybe Musk and SpaceX will have proved instrumental in that process. Just don’t expect Andy Weir to be along for the ride.

On Wednesday, international prosecutors from Joint Investigation Team (JIT) revealed a preliminary report on the investigation of the Boeing 777 crash in 2014, which claimed that plane was downed by a missile fired from Buk launcher, which had been brought from Russia and located on territory held by the militias.

Flight MH17 crashed with 298 people on board on July 17, 2014, in eastern Ukraine, while en route to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam, leaving no survivors.

The Ukrainian authorities are responsible for the crash of flight MH17 in Donbass in July 2014, as they did not ban civil flights over the conflict zone, the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko, said on Thursday. Read also Russian aviation official urges Ukraine to bear responsibility for MH17 crash "The responsibility for the shot down Boeing is fully with Ukraine, as well as responsibility for their not preventing the flight. Those responsible will be punished," the Donetsk news agency quoted him as saying. Zakharchenko once again denied any role of Donetsk in the crash of the airliner. The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) that brings together specialists from the Netherlands, Ukraine, Australia, Malaysia and Belgium presented on Wednesday preliminary results of a probe into the crash over Donetsk. The report said the JIT is "convinced of having obtained irrefutable evidence to establish that on 17 July 2014, flight MH-17 was shot down by a BUK missile from the 9M38-series." According to the JIT, there is also evidence that the missile was launched from a farmland near Pervomayskoye to the south of Snezhnoye, which was under control of militias. "So far, the JIT has identified approximately 100 people who can be linked to the downing of MH17 or the transport of the BUK-TELAR," the report said. Read also Kremlin spokesman says report on MH17 crash 'has no proof at all' Russian defense ministry doubts objectivity of MH17 crash investigators' report Investigators of MH17 crash fail to match real damage — missile manufacturer Moscow considers MH17 probe biased, politically motivated — foreign ministry MH17 crash investigators call not to rush with accusations against Russia Kremlin calls for impartial, full investigation of MH17 crash in Ukraine The Dutch-led team has not so far identified any particular suspect, Dutch prosecutor Fred Westerbeke who heads the JIT said, adding that it was early to speak about their nationality or any Russia’s involvement. The team had no time to look into data presented by Russia, which disproves this version. On July 17, 2014, a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 passenger airliner on flight MH17 from the Dutch city of Amsterdam to the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur crashed in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board. Most passengers - 193 people - were Dutch nationals. The strike of a ground-to-air or air-to-air missile was named as a possible cause of the crash. Ukraine’s authorities and the militia of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic accused each other of the tragedy. On July 21, the UN Security Council called to carry out an independent investigation. Russia’s representatives have said on many occasions they are dissatisfied with how the investigation was carried out and that the data presented by the Russian side were ignored. {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Topics Boeing 777 crash in Ukraine Top News November 18, 18:10 Russian Defense Ministry says ‘Aleppo bombings blunder’ will leave stain on Kirby’s bio November 18, 18:10 November 18, 17:38 Expert: China’s economy dynamics poses no risk to Russian economy anymore November 18, 17:38 November 18, 18:35 Money for good name: How Crimean companies win credit reputation November 18, 18:35 November 18, 15:44 Russian premier: Russia regains status of leading player on world’s food market November 18, 15:44 In other media Реклама Photo 11 Meet the future First Lady of the United States Melania Trump 13 Donald Trump's path to presidency 4 Triumphant Trump supporters flock to White House to celebrate Infographics The US and Ukraine voted against the UN resolution condemning the glorification of Nazism Opium production in Afghanistan over 20 years The Eurasian Economic Union starts its work Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Most read Now Today This week 1 Russian Defense Ministry says ‘Aleppo bombings blunder’ will leave stain on Kirby’s bio 2 Clarivate Analytics Names 2016 Highly Cited Researchers 3 Russian Army to receive missiles with warheads based on new physical principles 4 Russia's Tupolev-95MSM bomber delivers first-ever strike on mission to Syria 5 Russian expert on accuracy of Kh-101 cruise missiles used against terrorists in Syria 6 Russian premier: Russia regains status of leading player on world’s food market 7 Russia's 'Night Hunter': from maiden flight to fighting ISIS 1 Russia's Tupolev-95MSM bomber delivers first-ever strike on mission to Syria 2 Russian bombers deliver strike at terrorist strongholds in Syria — Defense Ministry 3 Obama calls Russia ‘military superpower,’ important partner 4 Russia's 'Night Hunter': from maiden flight to fighting ISIS 5 Russian Army to receive missiles with warheads based on new physical principles 6 Russian expert on accuracy of Kh-101 cruise missiles used against terrorists in Syria 7 Family of Russian officer killed in Syria writes letter to Hollande 1 Russian forces launch large-scale operation against terrorists in Syria 2 MIG-29 fighter jet crashes into Mediterranean off Syrian coast 3 Russia declines to ratify International Criminal Court Statute 4 Russian bombers deliver strike at terrorist strongholds in Syria — Defense Ministry 5 Russia's Tupolev-95MSM bomber delivers first-ever strike on mission to Syria 6 Putin sets task to ensure reliable protection of Russian forces in Syria 7 Russian army receives 10 new advanced UAVs TOP STORIES US presidential election 2016 Conflict in Syria Russia's defense industry Oil & Gas Industry Space programs Реклама News World Russian Politics & Diplomacy Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

According to Carlisle, the IOC has been approved for 15 QF-16s currently available for target operations. Airmen from the 82nd Aerial Target Squadron (ATRS) under the 53rd Wing will fly the aircraft assigned to Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida. The new aerial target will replace the QF-4 aerial target that is to officially retire in December this year. 82nd ATRS commander lieutenant colonel Matthew Garrison said: "This leap forward in airframe capabilities, combined with advanced electronic pods, will allow us to properly test and evaluate our fifth-generation aircraft and weapons.” The Boeing-built QF-16 FSAT has been designed to provide next-generation of combat training and testing for US warfighters. Retired F-16 aircraft are converted into QF-16 aerial targets for use in testing newly developed weapons and tactics, said Boeing. "The Boeing-built QF-16 FSAT has been designed to provide next-generation of combat training and testing for US warfighters." The QF-16 maintains all inherent capabilities of the baseline F-16 Fighting Falcon including supersonic flight and 9 G manoeuvrability, according to the airforce. Boeing and the USAF conducted the first unmanned flight of the QF-16 in 2013 at Tyndall Air Force Base. The QF-16 mission profile included auto takeoff, a series of simulated manoeuvres, supersonic flight and an auto land, all without a pilot in the cockpit. Testing on the six aircraft continues at Holloman Air Force Base. Image: A QF-16 flies across the horizon at Tyndall Air Force Base. Photo: courtesy of US Air Force photo/Sara Vidoni.

The project aimed to use a floating launch site to place rockets on the equator – the best possible location for launch – which gives the rocket additional speed on lift-off thanks to centripetal force caused by Earth's rotation.

Who is Richard Duncan and why is he on Ohio's presidential ballot? Jeff O'Rear, Enquirer contributor 4:18 p.m. EDT September 30, 2016 Buy Photo Richard Duncan campaigns outside Thursday night's Bengals game. (Photo: Dean Lowry for The Enquirer)Buy Photo Richard Duncan stands outside Paul Brown stadium with a six-foot-tall sign that extolls his qualifications to become the next president of the United States. As he hands out cards to the Bengals fans headed to Thursday night’s game against the Dolphins, he bellows out, “You have another choice!” “I’m running for president.” “Vote me for me, I’m on the ballot.” He is mostly ignored, garnering a few laughs, bewildered looks and sarcastic endorsements as the fans walk toward the stadium. Duncan is on the Ohio ballot for president as an independent candidate. This is his fourth candidacy. Because he appears only on the Ohio ballot - and not in any other states -  he knows his chances of winning are non-existent. But, he said, must get his message out. “The parties recently have not been helping out the people,” the 63-year-old Aurora, Ohio, resident said. “If I can at least accomplish that, I think we’re headed in the right direction.” He is a self-funded candidate, spending around $5,000 of his own money, crisscrossing Ohio, obtaining the 5,000 signatures required to appear on the ballot. On Sept. 1, he received a letter saying he made this year’s ballot. Ohio voters will see name alongside Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Gary Johnson and Jill Stein. Buy Photo Richard Duncan campaigns at Thursday night's Bengals game.  (Photo: Dean Lowry for The Enquirer) 'It's hard to come from nowhere in politics'  Duncan hatched the idea of running in 2004, helping his daughter, a then-senior at Aurora High School, with a government class project. He decided to run in that year’s election on his anti-two party platform. He received 800 write-in votes. The next year, he began collecting petition signatures for the 2008 ballot. He needed 5,000, and he got around 13,000 over a three-year span. He ended up receiving about 3,900 votes that election. In 2012, he did even better, getting 12,502 votes, good for fifth-place among the seven presidential candidates in the state. In August 2015, he made up his mind to run again, and he hit the trail to get his required signatures. He visited fairs and festivals during the warmer months and stores and shops during the winter. “I was going out three times a week instead of here and there,” Duncan said of the abbreviated petition window. “In a year’s time, the weather cooperated, and I collected my 13,000 signatures.” Someone like Duncan could make some noise nationally in a presidential race. But the odds are heavily against independent candidates winning, said David Niven, a University of Cincinnati assistant professor of political science. “They would have to start from a position of prominence,” Niven said. “That’s the biggest problem for candidates trying to bust their way in from the outside. Who is going to take the moment to give them the first bit of attention? “Done well, someone in this position can make a little bit of a stink and a tiny bit of noise,” Niven said. “It’s really hard to come from nowhere in politics.” Bill Clinton took his business card  Those odds haven’t deterred Duncan from driving all over Ohio and spreading his message. He campaigned and collected signatures at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this past July. And he plans to keep campaigning until Election Day. He’s planning to be at Saturday’s Ohio State-Rutgers game in Columbus. He is also taking advantage of the Cleveland Indians making the playoffs, campaigning as long as the team’s season keeps going. “I keep continuing on because I believe what I am saying,” Duncan said. “So I’m absolutely not going to stop. The two parties are starting to see that people are not happy with them, and they’re going to have to change because the people are supposed to be running this country.” He attended a Hillary Clinton rally recently where former President Bill Clinton spoke. He had the opportunity to shake the former president’s hand, giving him a business card, which he said Clinton put in his suit jacket pocket. “That was pretty rewarding for me to have a former president take my card,” Duncan said. “Maybe I’m doing something right.” Thursday night, after almost 30-straight minutes of no responses from Bengals and Dolphins fans at the stadium, Duncan finally engaged a passer-by. “I’ll take your card, and I will definitely check you out,” Jordan Boeing said. But Boeing is from Burlington, Ky., and is not registered to vote in Ohio. Duncan hadn’t gained a vote, but at least one more person had heard his message. “A thousand-mile journey begins with a single step,” he said. Jeff O'Rear and Dean Lowry are part of a University of Cincinnati partnership helping The Enquirer cover the election. On Twitter: @UCPolReporters About Richard Duncan Age: 63 Hometown: Aurora, Ohio Party: Independent Web site: http://richardaduncan.samsbiz.com/ Highlights from his web page: "We as a country must maintain a strong position worldwide. I believe the current strategy in force of a continual offensive bombing is productive." "The goal of creating new jobs and preserving the ones we have in this country is crucial to everyone. I will do this by developing ZONES OR GEOGRAPHIC AREAS throughout the nation. Within these zones industries and businesses will be encouraged to locate therein by giving them incentives such as tax breaks and reduced rent or land cost prices. However, in return they must hire our U.S. citizens at a good wage and provide health care coverage.  10-year Congressional term limits; "The morals in our country will be preserved with the pro life movement and maintaining the right to worship a God of ones choice." "Our Constitutional freedoms will be preserved such as gun rights (I am against gun free zones), unreasonable searches and seizures, free speech, free market trade and religious choice.

This “clean” stopgap package puts the focus on Congress’ post-election lame duck session to keep agencies running through FY 2017 and would seemingly give lawmakers another opportunity to move on a full-year or longer term government spending bill. Recent history of course has suggested any compromise will be hard to come by in this political environment but agencies and contractors always hold out hope for a deal and subsequent certainty. With that out of the way, we will use the remainder of this space to highlight two key news items from the GovCon arena this week with respect to financial/M&A and global defense. Technology investment group Vista Equity Partners has returned to M&A’s buyer side through its $153 million deal for public sector cloud company GovDelivery announced Monday. Vista owns one-fifth of cybersecurity company ForcePoint, which was formed out of the former Websense business that Raytheon bought majority control of last year. Also, reports surfaced Wednesday that the White House approved close to $7 billion in requests by Kuwait and Qatar to purchase Boeing-built fighter jets and a separate $1 billion sale of Lockheed Martin-made combat aircraft to Bahrain. The next morning, DSCA Director Joseph Rixey addressed the Potomac Officers Club’s “International Military Programs” event to update GovCon executive attendees on the state of America’s foreign military sales program and ways for industry to help in the effort. Rixey told Reuters in July the U.S. was on track at the time to close $40 billion in FMS transactions for FY 2016 and demand from allies is not slowing down in light of the world’s security environment. Deloitte forecasts worldwide defense spending to total $1.6 trillion through 2020 despite some reductions in the U.S. with Asia-Pacific countries’ expenditures predicted to go up and that gives large primes and others opportunities for both increased volume and diversified sales.

Maybe you never pondered the outcome of this seemingly nonsensical matchup, but someone from Australian airline Qautas did (more on that later). Presumably, it was to underscore the point that all electric vehicle drivers know: Electric cars are really quick, especially off the line. To understand why, we need a little science. Torque is the twisting motion that turns car wheels. Going from gasoline to tire twist is a multistep process involving parts like pistons, crank shafts, flywheels, and other under-the-hood stuff. Each step in the process drains a bit of energy – and hundredths of a second – from the time you pin the throttle to the time the tires squeal into action. In EVs, the path from batteries to tire-turning torque is a shorter and more efficient one. Thus, a typical EV motor can spin out 15,000 rpms compared with roughly 8,000 from an internal combustion gasoline engine. Hence, the drag-racing prowess of your Tesla. So perhaps it isn’t surprising that a little-known battery-powered beast is making waves in the speed-crazy supercar world. It’s called the Concept One from Croatian startup Rimac, and it is billed as the world’s first electric supercar. It debuted nearly five years ago, but the buzz surrounding actual production got a recent boost courtesy of footage of the all-EV Rimac roasting both a top spec Tesla Model S P90D and a $1.5 million Ferrari LaFerrari in a quarter-mile drag race.   As noted above, the Rimac’s off-the-line prowess isn’t surprising given the virtually instantaneous torque of EVs. More impressive is the Concept One’s sustained acceleration – especially against the V12-powered LaFerrari. That’s because electric cars tend to lose their edge – and potentially overheat – under sustained, hard acceleration. Rimac says it combats these performance liabilities with gobs of power and technology: 1,088 hp and 2,800 lb. - ft. of torque courtesy of four electric motors, each with its own gearbox, and an advanced torque vectoring system that constantly calculates the optimum amount of twist to send to each wheel. According to Rimac, all of this means the Concept One doesn’t require any special “launch mode” setting like gasoline-powered cars for insane off-the-line performance and a zero-to-62 sprint of 2.6 seconds. Just pin the throttle and hold on for dear life. It doesn’t hurt that the Rimac is also elegantly styled inside and out – including a richly appointed interior crafted by former employees of legendary Italian auto-styling firm Pininfarina. As for our EV vs. Boeing 737 showdown, as you might expect, the sedan (a Tesla Model S) beat the Boeing off the line before succumbing to the jet’s superior acceleration. However, Rimac has also unveiled a hopped-up version of the Concept One supercar, the 1,365-hp Concept S.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Oct 01, 2016 - Page 12　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp CAL to ply A350 on HK, Osaka routes Staff writer, with CNA A new Airbus SAS A350-900 XWB delivered yesterday to China Airlines Ltd (CAL, 中華航空) is to be first used on flights to Hong Kong and Osaka, Japan, CAL chairman Ho Nuan-hsuan (何煖軒) said. The carrier would start flying the aircraft to Amsterdam, Vienna and Rome from next year, Ho said during an aircraft delivery ceremony in Toulouse, France. Didier Evrard, head of programs at Airbus, was also in attendance. CAL is the first Taiwanese carrier to procure an A350, lauded as the world’s latest-generation airliner and the newest member of the Airbus family. The carrier is to have 13 more A350s delivered by the end of 2018. The new airplanes could improve CAL’s performance, especially in Europe, Ho said. Among the 1.22 million passengers traveling between Taiwan and Europe last year, CAL claimed a 21 percent market share, he added. While nearly 60 percent of those passengers were making transit stops during their trips, the long-haul, medium-capacity A350-900s could contribute to more flexible flight operations, Ho said. In addition, CAL flights to Amsterdam and Rome are to become nonstop next year at the earliest, thanks to the A350s, he said. According to CAL, the A350-900 XWB is built using the most advanced production technology, and its high-end production materials have resulted in a lighter and safer aircraft. In addition, the eco-friendly aircraft is expected to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 25 percent, which will help lower maintenance costs, the carrier said. The first A350-900s, which are to carry the airline’s plum blossom logo on their tails, have a seating capacity of 306 — 32 in business class, 31 in premium economy and 243 in economy, it said. Ho said CAL might team up with Airbus Group SE to establish an aircraft maintenance facility at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, tailored exclusively for the Airbus A350, making it the first A350 maintenance facility in Asia. CAL operates a similar service near the airport, CAL Engineering and Maintenance Organization (中華航空公司機務組織), which provides services that include component, airframe and engine maintenance for several Airbus, Boeing Co and Embraer SA aircraft. Services for the A350 are not available from the company. Ho said CAL is expected to receive a reply on the possible venture from Airbus by the end of this year, adding that the carrier also wants to get Taiwan-based Aerospace Industrial Development Corp (漢翔航空) involved in the deal, because the company is already part of the A350 supply chain. Ho declined to comment on the capital estimated for the joint venture or the shareholding ratio for the three potential stakeholders. Ho said the initiative has won the support of Taoyuan Mayor Cheng Wen-tsan (鄭文燦), who promised to find CAL a proper space for the facility. This story has been viewed 1410 times.

Buckhead’s plan for park over a highway joins a national trend The proposed park that would snake atop Ga. 400 in Buckhead’s business district is part of a nationwide highway-capping trend that has created green spaces from Seattle to Boston and from Chicago to Dallas. The reason is simple: Highway-capping can be a relatively easy way for a city to gain green space. But the challenge is big: Costs can be high and piecing together the public-private partnerships typically involved is complicated. The East Lawn of Klyde Warren Park in Dallas. (Office of James Burnett) “The most important piece of advice I give a community like Atlanta that is considering [a cap park] like this is, find your champion,” said Tara Green, president of Klyde Warren Park in Dallas, which has become a model of highway-capping success. Klyde Warren Park’s champion was banker Jody Grant, “who didn’t take no for an answer” and put up $1 million of his own money to start leveraging public financing for the $110 million project, Green said. For the Buckhead Community Improvement District board, which has proposed the park, costs have been a concern. The current proposal is not a complete cap, but rather a large bridge paralleling Ga. 400, partly because that is easier to build. After a project gets a champion, keeping the price tag reasonable can be another challenge. Boston’s downtown has been reconnected with the 1.5-mile Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway, built atop a formerly elevated highway now sunken in a tunnel. That project, nicknamed the Big Dig, became notoriously wasteful, with cost estimates running well over $15 billion. However, now that it’s complete, Boston’s Greenway is extremely popular, packed with public art and events, according to Janet Knott, the policy and media director for Boston City Councilor Sal LaMattina, whose district includes much of the park. Like Buckhead’s proposal, the Greenway has sub-parks in different sections. The North End Park section of Boston’s Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway. (Special) “It’s a set of parks defined by the neighborhoods along it,” Knott said. “It involves the neighborhoods by creating this network instead of creating this blanket open space.” “This [park over Ga. 400 idea] is exciting for your city because, as you know, parks are so popular all over the country,” Knott said. “Trying to find green space is a priority for many cities right now.” Just as carving highways through city centers was popular in the 1950s and ’60s, cap parks are a modern urban planning trend. An early example is Seattle’s Freeway Park, built in the 1970s. St. Louis has a cap park underway, part of a renovation of its Gateway Arch monument. And such major cities as Chicago and Los Angeles have highway-cap parks on their drawing boards. The Buckhead CID’s concept isn’t even the only one in Atlanta, as Central Atlanta Progress is proposing a Downtown Connector cap called the “Stitch,” which would include both park space and buildings. Earlier this year, various Atlanta leaders, including Buckhead CID Executive Director Jim Durrett, visited Dallas to hear about Klyde Warren Park, which opened in 2012 and now draws a million visitors a year—significantly more than expected. Green said that what Dallas’s plan had, besides a champion, was civic motivation. She said there is some evidence that “city leaders knew they were creating a moat” with the highway in the 1960s and had early ideas of bridging it somehow, making the city more receptive to the park idea. But the real “catalyst,” she said, came in 2001, when the giant aircraft corporation Boeing chose Chicago over Dallas for its new headquarters. A main reason Boeing cited for rejected Dallas was the lack of a “vibrant downtown,” she said. Klyde Warren Park in Dallas. (Office of James Burnett) Like Atlanta, Dallas is a city of infamous sprawl, endless highways and relatively little green space. Klyde Warren Park became a place to move away from car culture and provide a “back yard” to people increasingly living downtown, Green said, echoing concerns of Buckhead’s leaders. “We did not have that reason to walk in Dallas,” she said. “We’re so happy we have taught Dallas how to walk.” The park is city-owned, but privately run and managed, including private security. It is self-funded, using no city park funds, Green said. The Dallas park’s success comes with some wrinkles. According to media reports, most fundraising targeted the park rather than the less glamorous cap structure. The park is so popular the administration is already considering an addition, including a controversial parking garage. Still, Green has a simple message for Buckhead’s park planners: “It will be well worth the investment.” Major U.S. highway-cap parks Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway Boston, Mass.; opened 2008 15-acre, 1.5-mile-long park atop a highway tunnel. Cost more than $15 billion, including all of the Big Dig. Klyde Warren Park Dallas; opened 2012 5-acre cap over a highway that was already built below-grade. Cost $110 million. In August, proposed a $90 million addition that would include restaurant, park offices, many amenities and a parking garage. Margaret T. Hance Park Phoenix, Az.; opened 1992 32-acre park built atop a highway tunnel at a cost reportedly over $100 million. Plans for a $118 million renovation/redevelopment are in the works. Freeway Park Seattle; opened 1976 5-acre cap over a highway.

Or Address Climate Change and Human Needs? Published on Friday, September 30, 2016 by Common Dreams US at the Crossroads: Start a New Nuclear Arms Race? Or Address Climate Change and Human Needs? by Kevin Martin 0 Comments The banner reads, 'Don't Nuke The Climate.' (Photo: Wise International) What if I have little time left? How should I spend my time? Most people face these questions in terms of their own lifespans. But what if the subject of these sentences changes from “I” to “we?” What if the subject is not an individual, but humanity? What if climate change is shortening our human lifespan (and that of many species) to just a few decades? According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), August was the 16th consecutive month of record temperatures for the planet. July was the hottest month on record worldwide, until it was tied by August. Persistent drought conditions already threaten water supplies and agricultural breadbaskets in the U.S. and elsewhere Arctic and Antarctic ice are melting at unprecedented rates, as are glaciers in many countries, promising global sea level rise that will threaten cities and countries everywhere. Glacier National Park in Montana may have to change its name before too long, as the glaciers are melting rapidly. The U.K.-based Global Challenges Foundation calculates Americans are five times more likely to die in a “human extinction event” such as nuclear war, climate change-driven catastrophe or pandemic, than to die in a car crash. One prominent climate scientist, Guy McPherson of the University of Arizona, thinks humanity may not survive past 2030, fourteen years from now, from climate change and the resulting breakdown in our food and water supply, and in the social order. We are already seeing wars driven by climate change, the calamity in Syria perhaps the most prominent example. The CIA and Pentagon clearly state climate change is helping drive armed conflict in many regions, and expect it to get worse. Nobody can know with any certainty at this point how much time humanity has left on Earth. However, the question of whether we have 14 years left, or 50 or 250, or much longer, doesn’t matter all that much. The amount of money we’re about to squander on a New Nuclear Arms Race, projected at $1 trillion over thirty years, is indefensible. Our tax dollars and focus need to be on protecting life on Earth, not threatening its extinction. A New Nuclear Arms Race? Who Wants That? Under the benign or even positive heading of “nuclear modernization,” the United States plans to spend an estimated $1 trillion (it will surely be more than that – when was the last time an exorbitant military project came in under budget?) to overhaul every part of our nuclear weapons enterprise over the next three decades. Weapons laboratories, warheads, missiles, planes and submarines are all slated to be upgraded. Predictably, every other nuclear weapons state (Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea) is following suit and planning similar Dr. Strangelovian upgrades to their arsenals. So our folly not only makes the world more dangerous in terms of nuclear proliferation, it provides “leadership” down the dark path of fear and destruction for countries that can afford this investment even less than we can. Besides  the opportunity cost of investing in new nukes – money that won’t go to cancer research, affordable housing, health care for all, infrastructure repair and building the green economy – what baffles is the lack of democracy and accountability. Did anybody vote for this? Did any politicians run on this platform? Certainly not President Obama, who ran on reducing and eventually eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide, yet agreed to The New Nuclear Arms Race proposal in exchange for ratification of the modest New START agreement with Russia, a very poor trade-off. Regardless of that, the politicians and government employees who have hatched this mad scheme work for us. We pay their salaries, and our tax dollars fund the weapons and the research, and the contracts that go to Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, Northrop Grumman and the other merchants of death. When they say there is no money for addressing climate change and human needs, that’s a lie. It’s going to the endless war machine. An interesting data point – the UN Environment Program estimates it will take about $300 billion to adapt to climate change worldwide by 2030. That’s about half the Pentagon’s annual budget. Harvard Professor Elaine Scarry, in her recent book Thermonuclear Anarchy, makes the crucial argument that our nominal democracy is completely undercut when it comes to human survival, because one person (the president, in the case of the U.S.) can make the decision to start a nuclear war which could end life on Earth. In the last few weeks, this issue has gotten significant attention, as many are mortified at the prospect of Donald Trump having control of the nuclear “button.” This has had a positive effect in terms of raising this issue, as President Obama is reportedly considering changing U.S. nuclear doctrine to a No First Use policy. Some Members of Congress are also pushing for that, with U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) and Senator Edward Markey (D-MA) introducing a bill to prohibit a U.S. nuclear first strike absent a Congressional declaration of war. Sen. Markey has also introduced the SANE Act to significantly cut investment in the New Nuclear Arms Race, and U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) has a companion bill in the House of Representatives. This outbreak of democracy regarding U.S. nuclear weapons is healthy, but much more will be needed to stop the colossal squandering of resources on the New Nuclear Arms Race in order to  restore sanity to our budgetary priorities. It’s up to us to determine our future, however long that is. Can we say the future looks brighter, or longer, if we stay on the current course?

But it was her part-ownership of Canica, one of Norway’s largest private investment companies, that gave her the means. As the number of successful female executives and business owners increases, the number of women in philanthropy is set to rise. The trend is beginning to show up in the growth of female philanthropic networks. Women Moving Millions, a global community of mainly women donors, has more than doubled in size since launching, from 102 members in 2007 to 250 in 14 countries today. Donors each give or pledge $1m or more to initiatives focused on advancing women and girls. Elsewhere, Impact Austin, a US giving circle — in which donors pool their funds — started in 2003 with six women, each donating $1,000 a year. It now has about 500 female members, who in 2015 gave a total of $5m to charities. The way businesswomen distribute their wealth differs from the approaches taken by their male counterparts. Women tend to spread their giving across several organisations, while men typically concentrate on a narrower range of charities, according to the Women’s Philanthropy Institute at Indiana University. Women are more likely to volunteer — and volunteer more hours — than men. “Women and men have very different motivations for engaging in philanthropy,” says Debra Mesch, the institute’s director. “Women come with a very empathetic, altruistic point of view, while men tend to focus more on giving for what it could do for them.” Gender empathy often plays a role in the causes women choose to support. Many focus on giving to organisations that help women and girls. Research from Indiana University shows a higher proportion of women than men — 50 per cent compared to 40 per cent — reported giving to at least one cause that affected mainly women and girls. Women’s approaches to philanthropy also reflect the way they do business, says Prof Mesch. “The way they network and mentor other women — we see that in philanthropy as well,” she says. For example, members of the Maverick Collective, a network of female philanthropists — which also invests in projects that benefit girls and women — support each other when testing ideas for tackling social problems. “We’re in the business of high-risk pilots of new approaches in improving the lot of women and girls, and that can be a pretty lonely business,” says Martha Darling, a Maverick Collective member. “So there’s a lot of reinforcement and support when things are successful, and working it through in the rough patches.” Ms Darling sees a more collaborative spirit at work among female philanthropists than among male donors. “There’s a lot less ego on the table,” she says. “And the emphasis is on the outcomes, on doing the work collectively and on being more deeply engaged.” Female philanthropists who made their own money also differ in their approach from those who inherited it. “For those of us with business experience, we tend to be more demanding about the nature of our involvement because of the focus on metrics and wanting to invest wisely,” says Ms Darling, a former Boeing executive. Related article Natalia Oberti Noguera of women’s investor group Pipeline Angels Founder of network that pairs women venture capitalists with female-led social businesses on the need for ‘women sharks’ “A lot of people join different things, do a couple of hours of volunteering or give money here and there,” says Ms Darling, who takes an approach more similar to businessmen. “I have a narrower funnel and I want to see where the money is going.” Ms Hagen Sørli has used what she has learnt in business in her philanthropy. She says running a company that invests in retail and fast-moving consumer goods companies has given her insights into how to increase access to clean toilets in developing countries. “It’s not just that people can’t afford to buy one. It’s because they don’t prioritise buying one,” she says. “So it’s also about behaviour change, and I know something about that from working with retail every day.” Yet despite the rise of female philanthropists, lists of the world’s biggest givers are still populated largely by men. For example, among the businesspeople who have taken the Giving Pledge — the initiative launched by Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett to encourage the wealthy to leave their money to charity — only a handful are women. The reason may not be entirely due to their smaller numbers, however. It can be harder to find the names of prominent female philanthropists in business in part because of another characteristic found in many women who give: modesty. “They’re more reluctant to splash their names on buildings,” says Prof Mesch. “That’s not something that resonates with women.” Nevertheless, she believes women are becoming a powerful force in charitable giving. “They’re taking charge of their own philanthropy as well as taking charge of their own careers,” she says. Given their tendency to support women’s advancement in their giving, this could create a ripple effect, by helping other women succeed in the global economy — and thus building the next wave of female donors.

Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation (RSC) Energia will devise within five years a new carrier rocket for the Sea Launch (Morskoi Start) floating space pad project, the corporation's director said Friday. "This symbiosis, I am sure, will allow us to to create a new launch vehicle in absolutely short deadlines. I myself see a reference point of five years," General Director Vladimir Solntsev told reporters. Sea Launch was formed in 1995 as a consortium of four companies from Norway, Russia, Ukraine and the United States, and was managed by US aerospace giant Boeing. The project aimed to use a floating launch site to place rockets on the equator – the best possible location for launch – which gives the rocket additional speed on lift-off thanks to centripetal force caused by Earth's rotation. Sea Launch resumed operations in 2011 after a 30-month hiatus that saw passage through US Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Now the company is 95-percent owned by Energia Overseas Limited, a subsidiary of Energia. ...

Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors Inc. (AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu) WASHINGTON – A group of 10 Republican members of Congress wrote Thursday that they are increasingly concerned about SpaceX’s ability to safely fly NASA astronauts and national security satellites after the company recently suffered its second rocket explosion in just over a year. In it a letter to the Air Force, NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration, the group said SpaceX should not be leading the investigation into its most recent failure, and that authority should be turned over to the federal government “to ensure that proper investigative engineering rigor is applied.” Last year, an unmanned Falcon 9 rocket exploded a couple minutes after it launched a resupply mission to the International Space Station, destroying $118 million worth of cargo. Then, earlier this month, another Falcon 9 rocket blew up as it was being fueled ahead of an engine test. A $195 million commercial satellite sitting on top of the rocket, was lost in the fireball. Advertisement Continue reading “These failures could have spelled disaster, even loss of life, had critical national security payloads or NASA crew been aboard those rockets,” wrote the members, many of whom represent states where SpaceX’s chief competitor, the United Launch Alliance, has a strong presence. SpaceX declined to comment. After the Sept. 1 explosion, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said on Twitter that the Dragon capsule would have been able to abort in time, ferrying the astronauts on board to safety. The company has said it is narrowing down on the cause of the explosion, pinpointing a breach in a second-stage helium system. Earlier this week, Musk said the investigation was “vexing and difficult.” He stressed that finding out what went wrong is the company’s “absolute top priority” but said what actually caused the explosion was still unknown. “We’ve eliminated all of the obvious possibilities for what occurred there,” he said. “So what remains are the less probable answers.” He didn’t say what those might be. In the wake of the explosion, NASA has said it stands by SpaceX and the Air Force has said it shouldn’t affect the company’s certification. SpaceX, which relies heavily on the federal government for revenue, currently holds lucrative contracts with NASA to fly cargo and eventually astronauts to the space station. It also holds a certification from the Air Force that allows it to compete for contracts to launch national security satellites against the United Launch Alliance, the Colorado-based joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. The members of Congress, led by U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colorado, questioned whether the Air Force should reconsider SpaceX’s certification. And they asked NASA whether it still plans to allow SpaceX to use the Falcon 9 for its cargo and crew missions. Since there was no loss of life or injury, and no outside property was extensively damaged federal regulations call for the launch providers to conduct the investigations with oversight from the FAA. NASA and the Air Force are also helping with the investigation. NASA, the Air Force and the FAA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The new regulation brings Australia into alignment with the European Military Airworthiness Requirements, providing a common baseline with more than 30 other countries. Air Marshal Leo Davies, the Chief of Air Force, said the DASR will replace the current system which has evolved over twenty years and is unique to Australia. “The current regulations have served us well, but it is no longer efficient or desirable to maintain an independent system,” AIRMSHL Davies said. “The European Military Airworthiness Requirements are quickly becoming a global safety standard and are recognised as global best practice. This will bring benefits and enhance military aviation safety into the future.” Air Commodore James Hood from the Defence Aviation Safety Authority said the decision to migrate to the European convention was made after careful consideration. “We have been working with Defence and Industry organisations for three years to make sure we’ve got the DASR right. I am thrilled that major Australian industry will be involved in phase one tomorrow, including Boeing, Airbus Group, QinetiQ, Raytheon Australia, BAE Systems Australia, Pilatus, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman,” he said. “The new DASR are less prescriptive than the current regulation, offering higher levels of safety assurance at lower cost.” “Benefits of the transition will include increased efficiencies of global supply chains and maintenance options; employing ‘blended workforces’ on Defence and civilian aircraft and improve recognition of the approvals and certifications provided by other military and civilian airworthiness authorities. The common convention also allows commercial organisations to pursue innovation across the Defence and civil aviation sectors, which ultimately strengthens the aviation industry in Australia. The new DASR regulation will also improve the freedom of decision for Commanders, required for military operations,” AIRCDRE Hood said. Implementation is occurring in two phases, with some organisations migrating tomorrow, with minimal impact to existing management plans, contracts and organisational structures. Having locked in the current level of safety under phase one, organisations can then decide when to exploit the flexibility and efficiencies that DASR offer, depending on particular circumstances.

 House Republicans don't want SpaceX investigating its own 'troubling' rocket failures Dave Mosher and Rebecca Harrington Sep. 29, 2016, 7:22 PM 47,282 facebook linkedin twitter email print Elon Musk. Thomson Reuters Just days after SpaceX founder Elon Musk delivered his sweeping vision of colonizing Mars, a Colorado congressman is calling on government agencies to take over an investigation of the aerospace company's recent launchpad rocket explosion. The move — a signed congressional letter dated Thursday, September 29 — follows on the heels of two recent explosions of uncrewed Falcon 9 rockets. "These failures could have spelled disaster, even loss of life, had critical national security payloads or NASA crew been aboard those rockets," the letter states. "Both SpaceX failures occurred after the Air Force certified the Falcon 9 launch vehicle for U.S. national security launches, less than fifteen months ago." Congressman Mike Coffman (R-CO) penned the four-page congressional letter, which was cosigned by nine other House Republicans. (The letter's full text is at the end of this post.) It asks for increased scrutiny of SpaceX's investigation practices, given its plans with NASA to launch astronauts to the International Space Station. It also lobs pointed questions at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), NASA, and the US Air Force (USAF) about the certification process of SpaceX hardware, pricing schemes, risk assessment, and more. Semi-internal investigations An explosion on the launch site of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is shown in this still image from video in Cape Canaveral Thomson Reuters The first SpaceX incident in question was an in-flight explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket on June 28, 2015, destroying a telecommunications satellite. SpaceX chose to do an internal accident investigation with some FAA oversight, ultimately determining that a faulty strut had caused the accident. The most recent accident was a launchpad fireball of a Falcon 9 rocket on September 1, 2016, in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The percussive blaze destroyed Facebook's $200 million Amos-6 satellite, and SpaceX again exercised a federal law to perform its own investigation (since no people were harmed). That investigation isn't done, though a helium system seems to be at fault. For its ongoing investigation, SpaceX nearly doubled its team to a core group of "around 20 people," of which "more than half are representatives from FAA, NASA, US Air Force and industry experts," a company spokesperson previously told Business Insider in an email. Leading the entire group is Hans Koenigsmann — SpaceX's vice president of mission assurance. "[W]e believe he is the best person to do so," the spokesperson said. "We are collaborating very closely with the participating agencies, sharing raw data and providing access to meetings." But the 10 signers of the congressional letter do not seem satisfied with the internally led process. "We feel strongly that the current investigation should be led by NASA and the Air Force to ensure that proper investigative engineering rigor is applied and that the outcomes are sufficient to prevent NASA and military launch mishaps in the future," the draft letter states. John Taylor, a SpaceX spokesperson, declined to comment when provided a copy of the letter. A space battle on Capitol Hill Rep. Mike Coffman. Associated Press Raising issues about SpaceX, its failures, and its treatment by the US government is not a first for Coffman. As a member of the House Armed Services strategic forces subcommittee (which oversees military spacecraft), he did so in 2015 on multiple occasions, and in 2014 as well. The congressman now faces a heated 2016 reelection campaign in his district — the home of SpaceX's biggest competitor, United Launch Alliance (ULA), which is itself a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Records show that Coffman has publicly accepted more than $51,000 in campaign donations from Lockheed Martin during his career. Coffman has also publicly supported ULA. Samantha Masunaga, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times, captured the scuffle well in a story published in May 2016: "Traditional launch providers see their market being threatened by nontraditional entrants," said Loren Thompson, aerospace analyst with the Lexington Institute, an Arlington, Va., think tank. "Basically, this is competition between launch providers over market share and money that in the political process gets related to local interests." In 2015, United Launch Alliance spent $1.4 million on lobbying, up from $1 million the year before, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks federal campaign contributions and lobbying efforts on its website opensecrets.org. That same year, SpaceX spent $1.7 million on lobbying, up from $1.5 million in 2014. The sparring has been especially heated between the two companies as they compete for government launch contracts worth tens of billions of dollars. A government rule limiting the use of Russian-made engines — which ULA has relied on for its rockets — in the launch of military spacecraft has not helped matters for the company. (SpaceX makes its own rocket engines.) Business Insider contacted Rep. Coffman's press secretary as well as ULA and Lockheed Martin for this story, but we did not immediately receive a response. A Boeing representative could not immediately provide a comment. How federal agencies initially responded A SpaceX Falcon 9 liftoff and rocket Twitter/SpaceX The letter calls on the FAA, USAF, and NASA for their responses to the letter by October 31, 2016. Business Insider forwarded both a draft and then a signed letter to those agencies as well as to the DoD (which is named in the letter) and asked for comment. Hank Price, an FAA spokesperson, told Business Insider "it'd take some time to draft a response, and we wouldn't respond to it until we'd spoken to the Congressman first." Another FAA spokesperson later told Business Insider in an email: "The FAA received the letter late Thursday afternoon and has not had a chance to review it. Safety of all operations, including commercial space, is our top priority, and the FAA is closely overseeing the accident investigation. We will respond to the members of Congress in a timely manner." NASA representatives for the agency's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate told Business Insider in an email "we haven't officially received this, but even when we do, we wouldn't be able to comment in advance of responding." Laura Seal, a DoD spokesperson, told Business Insider by email that the "letter is not addressed to the Department of Defense. If we do receive a letter from Congress on this topic for response, we would respond directly to the author." Representatives at the USAF did not immediately reply.

This competition is down to the Boeing-Saab T-X and the noticeably older but capable T-50A. Boeing-Saab needs to release the specs on their T-X.

Cut each by 5 % and if they can pro- duce their design. And just like building a home if you add on "rooms" then that has to be negotiated understood ! Let's do something diff- rent ---- Set a defined timeline again set by a neutral entity and let the evaluation also be done by a neutral entity. The Air Force has already set this up for "failure" with is incentive program mentioned above. Bottom line is that Either you need those requirements of not, and sadly those are just the camo to pick your favorite contractor.The good old boy system without the tax payer ever in the consideration. The T-38 was a bargain basement plane that has lasted all these years. Let's do as well this time !!! Sorry about the spacing - not sure why that is ? Log In or Register to post comments davidtussey@gma... on Sep 30, 2016 How many times have I heard that "affordability trumps performance"? Hogwash. During my military career and tours in the Pentagon, I heard that on the ATF the ATA, the Super Hornet, etc. Just not the case. A top performing aircraft will always dazzle the selection committee....yes, then you work to get a lower price, but there are very few instances where affordability trumps performance. The JPATS effort may be one. The F-22 and F-35 certainly are not. B-21? Unlikely. Looks like the Boeing and Lockheed designs lead at this juncture. The Northrop entry needs to be really super in performance to kick the "it's just a T-38" impression. The T-100 is simply underpowered, and underperforming. Log In or Register to post comments hrkramer@verizon.net on Sep 30, 2016 I'd imagine that this one is certain to end-up with a protest, no matter which teams lose. In addition, it seems almost tailor-made for a classic low-bid buy-in. Seems we may have seen that before. Log In or Register to post comments Mark Lincoln on Sep 30, 2016 "The Air Force will likely release one more draft RFP that better defines some of the evaluation parameters in the source-selection process before issuing the final version in December." Two more opportunities to move the goal post in front of the desired winner.

The F-5/F-104 of the 2000's. it needs a new nose to fit an AESA radar though. Log In or Register to post comments Warrant9 on Oct 5, 2016 Raytheon's RACR or Nothrop Grumman's SABR will fit, and that has been out for several years. However, the South Koreans are upgrading the KF-16s with a Northrop Grumman AN/APG-83 (SABR). Lockheed Martin bagged orders for over 300 upgrades to date from South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. That being the case, the SABR variant with a smaller antenna is probably the most likely candidate given South Korea's experience with that configuration. The T-50A should have a fully functional radar and the pilots learn to crawl, walk, and run with that in the jet. They will be 'Flying' with it long before they get to their new ride. Learning how to handle a complex information system, the sophisticated resources, plan a mission, and fly it in a dynamic environment, is the goal. Hopefully the trainer will handle the pilots final ride's helmet so there is less translation to the new platform, and learning/retention of skill. Simulators key as well obviously, where we learn to crawl and walk. Log In or Register to post comments Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX, speaks during the 67th International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, on Tuesda (Susana Gonzalez/Bloomberg) By Christian Davenport September 30 Follow @wapodavenport A group of 10 Republican members of Congress wrote Thursday that they are increasingly concerned about SpaceX’s ability to safely fly NASA astronauts and national security satellites after the company recently suffered its second rocket explosion in just over a year. In a letter to the Air Force, NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration, the group said SpaceX should not be leading the investigation into its most recent failure, and that authority should be turned over to the federal government “to ensure that proper investigative engineering rigor is applied.” Last year, an unmanned Falcon 9 rocket exploded a couple minutes after it launched a resupply mission to the International Space Station, destroying $118 million worth of cargo. Then, earlier this month, another Falcon 9 rocket blew up as it was being fueled ahead of an engine test. A $195 million commercial satellite sitting on top of the rocket was lost in the fireball. [Elon Musk on mariachi bands, zero-G games, and why his Mars plan is like ‘Battlestar Galactica.’] “These failures could have spelled disaster, even loss of life, had critical national security payloads or NASA crew been aboard those rockets,” wrote the members, many of whom represent states where SpaceX’s chief competitor, the United Launch Alliance, has a strong presence. SpaceX declined to comment. After the Sept. 1 explosion, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said on Twitter that the Dragon capsule would have been able to abort in time, ferrying the astronauts on board to safety. The company has said it is narrowing down the cause of the explosion, pinpointing a breach in a second-stage helium system. Earlier this week, Musk said the investigation was “vexing and difficult.” He stressed that finding out what went wrong is the company’s “absolute top priority” but said what actually caused the explosion was still unknown. [Elon Musk’s SpaceX narrows in on cause of rocket explosion] “We’ve eliminated all of the obvious possibilities for what occurred there,” he said. “So what remains are the less probable answers.” He didn’t say what those might be. In the wake of the explosion, NASA has said it stands by SpaceX and the Air Force has said it shouldn’t affect the company’s certification. SpaceX, which relies heavily on the federal government for revenue, holds lucrative contracts with NASA to fly cargo and eventually astronauts to the space station. It also holds a certification from the Air Force that allows it to compete for contracts to launch national security satellites against the United Launch Alliance, the Colorado-based joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. The members of Congress, led by U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) questioned whether the Air Force should reconsider SpaceX’s certification. And they asked NASA whether it still plans to allow SpaceX to use the Falcon 9 for its cargo and crew missions. Since there was no loss of life or injury and no outside property was extensively damaged, federal regulations call for the launch providers to conduct the investigations with oversight from the FAA. NASA and the Air Force are also helping with the investigation. NASA declined to comment on the matter. The Air Force said it would respond to the members of Congress directly. The FAA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. business economy true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

Home Companies Airbus Group to merge with its jetmaking unit: Sources Airbus Group to merge with its jetmaking unit: Sources Airbus Group SAS is likely to merge with its main planemaking unit, Airbus SAS, as part of a corporate restructuring being finalised on Thursday, people familiar with the matter said. By: Reuters | Paris | Published: September 30, 2016 1:14 AM The Frenchman will continue to run jetmaking activities, which will be solely a division rather than separate entity. (Reuters) Airbus Group SAS is likely to merge with its main plane making unit, Airbus SAS, as part of a corporate restructuring being finalised on Thursday, people familiar with the matter said. The restructuring aims to simplify a top-heavy corporate structure inherited from the group’s complex origins as a group of separate aerospace firms, and consolidate its position as a European aerospace champion anchored in Toulouse, France. A spokesman for Airbus Group declined to comment. The merger of the operational parent and jetmaking unit into one company called “Airbus” rekindles an idea debated over a decade ago, but abandoned amid disagreements among former managers and shareholders aligned with competing French and German interests. The group changed its name from EADS and overhauled its governance in 2012, limiting the influence of French and German minority state shareholdings and granting more independence to management under German-born Chief Executive Tom Enders. But it remained saddled with separate bureaucracies and confusion over the brand, with the planemaking unit keeping the core “Airbus” identity and no fewer than five CEOs spread across the parent company, three units and one geographical division. Analysts say the reorganisation will reinforce Enders as sole CEO while removing any ambiguity over his successor, as planemaking boss Fabrice Bregier steps up to become chief operating officer of the whole company. The Frenchman will continue to run jetmaking activities, which will be solely a division rather than separate entity. The impact on jobs was unclear but Enders has pledged to avoid “massive” redundancies among the 137,000 staff. Nor was it immediately clear how the new structure would fit under the company’s publicly listed legal parent, Airbus Group SE, based in the Netherlands. Shares in Europe’s rival to Boeing rose 1 percent. Highlighting its growing international focus, the decision to streamline the European firm was being thrashed out at a board meeting at a new Airbus plant in Mobile, Alabama. Due to be announced as French engineer Alstom remains mired in a political storm over a factory closure, the reorganisation will heavily talk up new digital methods, something Enders hopes will make aerospace stand out from declining industrial sectors. Sources said on Wednesday the company’s defence chief, Siemens veteran Dirk Hoke, would take a lead role in spreading digital processes and services across the group.

The 10-minute test flight on Thursday at Stuttgart Airport in southwestern Germany involved two pilots and two dummy passengers. The twin-cabin plane, known as HY4, was developed by the aircraft maker Pipistrel, the fuel cell specialist Hydrogenics, the University of Ulm and the German Aerospace Center DLR.

He co-authors FP’s Situation Report newsletter and has written for The Daily Beast, Wired, and War Is Boring. September 29, 2016 - 8:04 am paul.mcleary @paulmcleary   More troops to Iraq. More American troops are headed to Iraq in the ramp up to the invasion of the Islamic State-held city of Mosul, Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Wednesday: 615 of them, to be exact. The deployment will push the official number of U.S. troops on the ground there to about 5,200, though with temporary assignments and rotations, the number will be well over 6,000. Carter said the new troops will advise local forces while providing logistics support during the operation to seize Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city that has been in ISIS hands for over two years. Many of the newly arriving troops will head for the Al Asad air base northwest of Ramadi in Anbar province, where the U.S. already has several hundred troops training Iraqi forces along with a M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), which delivers punishing long-range pinprick strikes. FP has lots more on the HIMARS in Iraq, here. Air strikes everywhere. President Barack Obama is ready to extend the U.S. bombing campaign on Islamic State targets in Libya for a third month, Fox News’ Lucas Tomlinson scoops, amid continuing resistance from the fighters in the city of Sirte. The U.S. Marines flying from the USS Wasp have already conducted 175 strikes in and around Sirte since Aug. 1, and despite Pentagon officials insisting at the time that the campaign would take “weeks, not months,” it’s taking months. An American strike Wednesday in Somalia that the Pentagon says killed nine al Shabab fighters is under closer scrutiny, as one local military commander says the U.S. was tricked by one of his rivals into bombing his soldiers, killing 22. The U.S. military is looking into the matter, defense officials said Wednesday. In Aleppo, some analysts are saying that the utter destruction being wrought by Russian and Syrian planes is part of a concerted strategy to drive moderate rebel groups into the hands of more extremist elements, thereby muting any international protests to bombing any anti-Assad forces and propping up the regime in Damascus. Life in Aleppo. A gripping read here from the Washington Post’s Liz Sly and Louisa Loveluck about how those Russian and Syrian planes hit targets at night, and the toll it’s taking. Around 1,700 bombs have fallen in rebel-held eastern Aleppo in the week after the ceasefire’s collapse, with two more hospitals being hit Wednesday night: “The bombings at night are the worst. There is no electricity in the rebel-held portion of eastern Aleppo, and the warplanes flying overhead target any light piercing the blackness beneath. So families huddle together in the dark, gathered in one room so that they don’t die alone, listening to the roar of the jets and waiting for the bombs to fall. After they do, rescue workers venture out, navigating the rubble and craters left by earlier bombings, to dig out victims without headlights or lamps. They haul them to hospitals swamped with patients being treated on the floor by doctors who barely sleep and must choose which lives to save and which to let go.” Manilla turning everything on its head. If Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte makes good on his threats to walk away from his country’s 65-year-old alliance with the United States, FP’s Dan De Luce writes in a great piece on the latest South China Sea headache for the Obama administration, “the first casualty would likely be the U.S. military mission there, which has become a model for successful counterterrorism operations worldwide.” Duterte has already warned that the U.S. military contingent of several hundred troops has to go, and on Wednesday said an upcoming joint military exercise would be the last with the United States. But his threat to push out the team of up to 100 U.S. Special Operations Forces, along with an additional 300 to 500 American conventional troops, “comes as concerns mount in Washington and Southeast Asia about the Islamic State’s efforts to spread its tentacles in the region,” De Luce says. Congress to Obama: here’s your veto. Congress handed president Obama the first veto override of his presidency Wednesday, overruling him on his opposition to a bill that would allow the families of the victims of the 9/11 attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia. FP’s Paul McLeary notes that while the Republican-controlled Congress was more than happy to thwart the president, many in Congress expect the bill to be tweaked in the upcoming lame duck session, making it more difficult for the lawsuits to go through, and putting up barriers to foreigners suing Washington over civilian deaths in counterterrorism operations. In a CNN Town Hall Wednesday evening, President Obama called the vote a mistake, “the problem with that is that if we eliminate this notion of sovereign immunity, then our men and women in uniform around the world could potentially start seeing ourselves subject to reciprocal loss, right?” McCain vs. Kerry vs. Russian delusions. Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham put Secretary of State John Kerry on full blast Wednesday, issuing a blistering statement sarcastically applauding Kerry for taking a hard stance with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov over the Russian bombing campaign in Syria. FP’s Paul McLeary catalogues the back and forth which ended with the Senate duo mocking that if the talks are off between Kerry and the Russians over a ceasefire in Syria, as Kerry threatened, “we can only imagine that having heard the news, Vladimir Putin has called off his bear hunt and is rushing back to the Kremlin to call off Russian airstrikes on hospitals, schools, and humanitarian aid convoys around Aleppo.” Good morning and as always, if you have any thoughts, announcements, tips, or national  security-related events to share, please pass them along to SitRep HQ. Best way is to send them to: paul.mcleary@foreignpolicy.com or on Twitter: @paulmcleary or @arawnsley 2016 One of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s top foreign policy advisors is headed to Japan. Retired Lt. General Mike Flynn says he’ll visit Tokyo in order to give America’s allies in east Asia a clearer idea of what a potential Trump administration’s policy views would be. Trump has repeatedly complained that American allies like Japan enjoy the protection of America’s security umbrella but do not, in his view, fairly compensate the United States. North Korea A North Korean soldier just finished one of the most dangerous trips you can make, sneaking his way across the tense, mine-laden demilitarized zone between North and South Korea in order to defect. The unnamed soldier traveled unarmed and managed not to draw fire from either side’s forces. Thus far, North Korea hasn’t acted up following the soldier’s defection but South Korean troops are bracing for the possibility of a violent tantrum from Pyongyang. Syria Make Turkey great again. Turkey is close to finishing 560 mile wall along its border with Syria in order to deal with the threat of terrorist infiltration. The wall, begun in 2014, should be finished by February of 2017, Turkish officials tell Reuters. The 10-ft. high wall will be laced with razor wire and manned by private security. Turkey’s wall is one of a number of such counterterrorism barriers going up along the borders of the middle east, with countries like Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, and Libya each trying to fence out problems with their neighbors. Business of defense The White House has finally given its blessing to the sale of at least $7 billion worth of fighter jets to Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain, Defense News reports. Under the deal, Qatar will get 72 F-15E Strike Eagles and Kuwait will get F/A-18 E/F Super Hornets. Bahrain also plans to buy 17 F-16s. The sale had been delayed, to the ire of lawmakers like Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), but the deal will keep open a Boeing production line in St. Louis, Missouri. Israel also protested that the deal could undermine its qualitative military edge in the region, but its concerns should be allayed in the face of a new $38 billion in military financing from Washington. Bots o’ war The U.S. Army is gearing up for a battlefield that could one day include Russian drones directing artillery fire from the skies. Defense One reports on recent comments by Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster about the Army’s efforts to turn soldiers into drone killers. The Army’s approach to the threat of Russian drones involves developing radar systems that can identify the smaller aircraft as well as lasers and electronic warfare equipment that can either zap or jam them out of the skies. The next step for the Army includes actually fielding the anti-drone equipment. For the first time ever, one of the Navy’s robotic helicopters designated a target for a missile fired by a manned chopper. An MQ-8B Fire Scout and an MH-60S took off from different bases for the test, and the Fire Scout called the shot for a Hellfire missile from the Seahawk, successfully hitting the target. Manned-unmanned teaming, the integration of platforms operated autonomously and by humans, is an area of growing interest within the U.S. military. Marines The Marine Corps has a new operating concept and it involves working more closely with the service’s counterparts in the Army, Breaking Defense reports. The concept upgrades the “three block war” concept, in which grunts have to conduct a spectrum of operations ranging from humanitarian work to open warfare within the span of three blocks with the latest concept adding information operations into that mix. Technology is also a big part of the implementing the concept, with Marine Corps Commandant Robert Neller saying he’d like to field a quadcopter with each infantry squad and one day get the ability to 3D-print drones.

Moscow has deep regrets over the low quality of an international probe into the MH17 crash in Ukraine while Russia is still ready to provide assistance in the investigation, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday. "We deeply regret over the low quality of the international probe into the Malaysian Boeing disaster in Ukraine in 2014 and its politicized nature, which have become finally obvious for all after yesterday’s report by a representative of a joint investigative team," Zakharova said. "Yesterday, unfounded and unsubstantiated claims were announced on their behalf that the military hardware that had shot down the Boeing had allegedly crossed into the Russian border," the spokeswoman said.

"Competent Russian specialists have carried out an expert study of one of these records," the diplomat said. "It was clearly established that this was doctored up," she said. "Again, we didn’t hear any specifics that would be based on facts," the spokeswoman said. "We’re again calling on colleagues to turn to facts and begin work with reliable information. The Russian side expresses the desire to assist in this effort," she said. {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Persons Maria Zakharova Topics Russian Foreign Ministry Boeing 777 crash in Ukraine Top News November 18, 18:10 Russian Defense Ministry says ‘Aleppo bombings blunder’ will leave stain on Kirby’s bio November 18, 18:10 November 18, 17:38 Expert: China’s economy dynamics poses no risk to Russian economy anymore November 18, 17:38 November 18, 18:35 Money for good name: How Crimean companies win credit reputation November 18, 18:35 November 18, 15:44 Russian premier: Russia regains status of leading player on world’s food market November 18, 15:44 In other media Реклама Photo 4 Crimea’s ex-prosecutor Poklonskaya takes helm at State Duma’s Commission on MPs’ income 4 Putin: Uzbek people can count on Russia’s support 3 Russia's Kirov Region governor detained on suspicion of taking €0.4 mln bribe Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Russia’s state defense order in 2015 Chinese Lunar Exploration Program Russia’s Angara A5 heavy-load space carrier rocket Most read Now Today This week 1 Russian Defense Ministry says ‘Aleppo bombings blunder’ will leave stain on Kirby’s bio 2 Clarivate Analytics Names 2016 Highly Cited Researchers 3 Russian Army to receive missiles with warheads based on new physical principles 4 Russia's Tupolev-95MSM bomber delivers first-ever strike on mission to Syria 5 Russian expert on accuracy of Kh-101 cruise missiles used against terrorists in Syria 6 Russian premier: Russia regains status of leading player on world’s food market 7 Russia's 'Night Hunter': from maiden flight to fighting ISIS 1 Russia's Tupolev-95MSM bomber delivers first-ever strike on mission to Syria 2 Russian bombers deliver strike at terrorist strongholds in Syria — Defense Ministry 3 Obama calls Russia ‘military superpower,’ important partner 4 Russia's 'Night Hunter': from maiden flight to fighting ISIS 5 Russian Army to receive missiles with warheads based on new physical principles 6 Russian expert on accuracy of Kh-101 cruise missiles used against terrorists in Syria 7 Family of Russian officer killed in Syria writes letter to Hollande 1 Russian forces launch large-scale operation against terrorists in Syria 2 MIG-29 fighter jet crashes into Mediterranean off Syrian coast 3 Russia declines to ratify International Criminal Court Statute 4 Russian bombers deliver strike at terrorist strongholds in Syria — Defense Ministry 5 Russia's Tupolev-95MSM bomber delivers first-ever strike on mission to Syria 6 Putin sets task to ensure reliable protection of Russian forces in Syria 7 Russian army receives 10 new advanced UAVs TOP STORIES US presidential election 2016 Conflict in Syria Russia's defense industry Oil & Gas Industry Space programs Реклама News World Russian Politics & Diplomacy Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

The 10-minute test flight Thursday at Stuttgart Airport in southwestern Germany involved two pilots and two dummy passengers. The twin-cabin plane, known as HY4, was developed by aircraft maker Pipistrel, fuel cell specialist Hydrogenics, the University of Ulm and the German Aerospace Center DLR.

Boeing and Airbus have also tested smaller fuel cell planes in recent years as the aircraft industry searches for ways to reduce emissions.

پارسی العربية اردو کوردی Türkçe English Mehrnews English Fri 18 November 2016 × Politics Home All News Iran World Politics Economy Culture Technology Sports Photo Cartoon Video Opinion Shamkhani: Washington sabotage on Tehran would ‘bounce’ News ID: 3782506 - Thu 29 September 2016 - 13:58 Politics TEHRAN, Sep. 29 (MNA) – Secretary of SNSC has said Tehran would decide to respond more seriously should Washington continue sabotage on ‘every single case.’ Ali Shamkhani who was addressing a ceremony in Milad Tower on Thursday to commemorate Ministry of Energy staff martyred in the Sacred Defense, paid homage to the culture he believed was ‘unique’ and which would guide the current generation of the youth; “the culture which helped achieve such an epic, would be excellent source of spiritual material for our young generation in leading the country forward,” Mr. Shamkhani added. Leader’s representative in the Supreme National Security Council believed that promotion of a culture of martyrdom would provide alternatives to an aberrant culture which fosters Wahhabist extremism; “the threat should be counteracted through our culture inculcated in the perceptive minds and hearts.” Shamkhani also praised the Ministry’s contribution in terms of logistics to the country during sanctions; “now, with the Resistance Economy, preparation for all conditions would prove more difficult than the conditions of the war,” he briefly said, turning to the issue of Washington’s sabotage; “the US had been obsessed with sabotage when Iran engaged in even the smallest trade transaction; we wait whether purchase of passenger jets from Boeing and Airbus incites still other cases of sabotage in Washington, and if we face it, we will decide in more serious way to respond; we have viewed the many examples of their conduct which had made us to reconsider possibilities of trust to the US, the JCPOA implementation as a telling example,” he emphasized.

The joint investigation team said they believed the Buk rocket was fired from a field in Pervomaiskyi, in eastern Ukraine, which at the time was in the hands of pro-Russian rebels. According to the team, which gathered experts from Belgium, the Netherlands, Australia, Malaysia and Ukraine, the rocket launcher was removed shortly after it was fired and taken back to Russian territory. Wilbert Paulissen, from the Brabante-Norte regional Dutch police and a member of the JIT, said the launch system was brought in from Russian territory and brought back to Russian territory after the attack. Given the wealth and diversity of the evidence gathered by the JIT, we have no doubt whatsoever that the conclusions we are presenting today are accurate, he said. Defense spokesman for the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples Republic, Eduard Basurin, denied the findings of the investigation. The official told Russian Interfax news agency that pro-Russian soldiers in the region did not have that type of (weapons) system in their arsenal, and therefore couldnt have shot down the Boeing. However, Paulissen played two recorded telephone calls between Russian soldiers the moment the plane came down. The first conversation, he said, showed a request for a Buk missile and the second that one had been delivered. A statement by the Dutch Public Prosecutors Office (OM), which formed part of the JIT, said witnesses reported that they saw a Buk missile launcher near the suspected firing location. These witnesses testified that they heard a very loud noise and a high whistling sound, said the statement. The investigators said they researched and subsequently discarded other potential scenarios, such as the plane being shot down by another aircraft or an internal attack. Head of the OM Fred Westerbeke said around 100 people suspected of being involved in the crash or the transport of the Buk were under investigation. He said that, in order to hold a trial, more research had to be done into finding specific perpetrators. The Russian Foreign Ministry said the investigations conclusions showed the JIT was biased and politically motivated. It criticized that the team had allowed Ukrainians to join the investigations but had ignored Moscows contributions. All 298 people on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 were killed when it was brought down in July 2014.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved
19 Nov 2016 Local World Business Sports US will continue to work with JIT on downing of MH17 investigation (Updated) Posted on 29 September 2016 - 12:30pm Last updated on 29 September 2016 - 11:50pm KUALA LUMPUR: The United States today reaffirmed its commitment that it will continue to work with the Joint Investigation Team investigating the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The US Department of State spokesperson John Kirby also called on other states that are in a position to assist, to cooperate fully so that those responsible are held accountable, reported Bernama. Yesterday, the Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team concluded in the interim report that MH17 was shot down by a Buk missile which was brought from Russia to Ukraine. Meanwhile, according to a statement from the team on the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service website, the Buk missile was fired from a farmland near the city of Pervomaiskyi, "which, at the time, was controlled by pro-Russian fighters". "While nothing can take away the grief of those who lost loved ones on that tragic day, this announcement is another step towards bringing to justice those responsible for this outrageous attack," Kirby said in a statement released by the US Embassy in Malaysia, here. Kirby said the findings corroborated US Secretary of State John Kerry's statement in the days following the tragedy that MH17 was shot down by a Buk surface-to-air missile fired from Russian-backed, separatist-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine. Earlier, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Abdul Razak said Malaysia was committed to bringing those responsible for downing MH17 to justice and there was no two ways about it. MH17 was shot down while cruising at an altitude of 30,000 feet and crashed in a tense area of Ukraine, near the Russian border. The Boeing B777 aircraft was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur and carrying 298 passengers and crew. It was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, killing all on board. Last year, Dutch Safety Board chairman Tjibbe Joustra confirmed that MH17 was shot down by a Buk surface-to-air missile over eastern Ukraine. The report came out after 15 months of investigation undertaken by a joint investigation team from the Netherlands, Ukraine, Malaysia, Australia, the United Kingdom, US and Russia. Meanwhile, Munira Mustafa, 54, the sister of MH17 flight attendant Mastura Mustafa, said the news had given hope that the perpetrators will face the consequences of their actions. "Finally I received an answer to questions that have been plaquing my mind for the past two years," she told Aiezat Fadzell from the theSun. Noorlin Mohd Noor, 48, the sister of passenger Norahimah Mohd Noor, 67, said the report has answered some of the questions, but she is still curious why MH17 was downed. "Now, another mystery should be uncovered … Why was that particular flight shot down?" she asked. "I'm sure that all the victims' family members would want to know this as well," she said.

After Saarc meet snub, govt likely to review air services agreement with Pak Hindustan Times 29-09-2016 © Provided by Hindustan Times India is likely to review its air links with Pakistan, a move aimed at scaling down engagement with the neighbour, which it holds responsible for the September 18 terror attack on the Uri army base that killed 18 soldiers. New Delhi is already reviewing the 56-year-old Indus Waters Treaty to explore ways to make optimum use of water from Pakistan-controlled rivers — as stipulated in the agreement but not enforced fully. These are part of non-military retributive steps the NDA government has initiated after the Uri attack, apart from stepping up efforts to isolate Pakistan diplomatically. If New Delhi decides to ban air links and overflight facilities with Pakistan — as it had done after the Parliament attack in December 2001 — it might have implications for flyers from both countries who would have to pay more and spend longer flying hours. Sources privy to the government’s deliberations over anti-Pakistan measures said after the Indus Waters Treaty, a review of the air services agreement with Pakistan was next on the agenda. Under the existing bilateral agreement, airlines from each side can operate 12 flights a week. While no Indian airlines flies to Pakistan, the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) operates to Delhi and Mumbai. If PIA flights are banned over Indian airspace, they will need to take a long detour to fly to Bangladesh and destinations in Southeast Asia. RELATED Nawaz Sharif threatens India 'Don't escalate tension with Pak' ALSO ON MSN AAP's big anti-Cong, BJP plan Andhra man's 'Baahubali' moment “Airlines are forced to change routes only in case of an airspace closure. In this case, airlines from the two countries will have to revise flight routes and prepare themselves for fat fuel bills,” said a former official from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) requesting anonymity. According to industry experts, if New Delhi decides to snap air links with Pakistan, there might not be an immediate impact on fares, but airlines could pass the burden on passengers in the long run. “The rise in prices could go up to 20% since jet fuel accounts for almost half the operation cost of an airline,” said a member of the Civil Aviation Economic Advisory Council, an independent think-tank appointed by the government in 2012. When India snapped air services with its neighbour after the Parliament attack, Air India was the only airline that operated international flights. India-Pak standoff: Full Coverage The national carrier’s flying time for West-bound flights increased by up to an hour and its annual fuel bills rose by around Rs 40 crore during the two-year closure, said a retired official from the air traffic control department. A similar situation now will hurt Pakistan more because all its east-bound flights will require a long detour through China. “Our Europe and US-bound flights will become longer by 45 minutes to an hour,” said a Boeing commander with a private airline requesting anonymity. For instance, a 9.45-hour Mumbai-London flight that travels through Karachi would fly above Iran and reach the destination an hour later, the pilot said. Flights from Delhi might take the same route through Ahmedabad or fly through Uzbekistan. “During the previous closure we flew Airbus 300-200, which had a maximum travel time of 5-6 hours at a stretch. So for a Srinagar-Jeddah flight, we flew all the way down to Ahmedabad and took a right from the edge of the Mumbai airspace and made a stopover in Dubai. The final leg of the journey was between the two Gulf cities,” said an Airbus commander. The pilot said aircraft such as the new Boeing 787s are the most fuel-efficient in the world. “The fuel bills will hurt us but hurt them more.” Airlines might face pilot shortage if the closure is for a long haul. According to DGCA rules, international flights with less than 10 hours of travel time could be operated with a set of two pilots. But if that extends, the airline would have to roster another pilot. “A Mumbai-London flight, for instance, might require more than two pilots if air links are severed with Pakistan,” said another senior pilot who didn’t wish to be named.

Total new orders for manufactured goods totalled $226.9 billion, barely changed after having risen 3.6 percent in July. Analysts had forecast a decrease of 1.9 percent for August. However, excluding transportation, an important but volatile component, orders fell 0.4 percent. Defense orders for capital goods rose $2.3 billion, or 23.6 percent, to $11.9 billion. According to Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics, the August results were signficantly boosted by the US Air Force’s recent order of 19 new tanker aircraft from Boeing, which helped offset a decline in civilian aircraft orders. However, he said the figures showed a third consecutive gain in core capital equipment expenditures, excluding defense items and aircraft. “The key factor driving the turnaround is the rebound in activity in the oil sector,” he said, adding that another business survey indicate gains in capital spending by non-oil sectors.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Aerospace & Defense | Fri Sep 30, 2016 | 3:39pm EDT Indonesia's Garuda's U.S. return to generate 5 percent of 2017 revenue: CEO Workers clean the body of a Garuda Indonesia Airbus A320 aircraft inside Hangar 4 of PT Garuda Maintenance Facility (GMF) Aero Asia at Soekarno-Hatta airport in Jakarta, September 28, 2015. By Allison Lampert | MONTREAL MONTREAL Garuda Indonesia's (GIAA.JK), the country's national carrier, expects its return to the United States next year with three flights a week to generate about 5 percent of the airline's top-line passenger revenue for 2017, its chief executive said. The airline is now negotiating rights to start service from Jakarta to Los Angeles via Japan, Chief Executive Officer Arif Wibowo said in an interview. He said the new flights would be a "milestone" for Garuda, which reported $3.81 billion in total operating revenues in 2015. Garuda's plans follow an August announcement by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that Indonesia's aviation safety performance now meets international standards, allowing its carriers to fly to the United States. The FAA removed the ability of the country's carriers to fly to the United States in 2007. The southeast Asian nation has struggled with a patchy aviation record. Garuda is also considering a route to New York via Europe, where it flies to Amsterdam and London. "What we are aiming is to ... grab market between Indonesia and the U.S.," Wibowo told Reuters late Thursday on the sidelines of a United Nations aviation assembly in Montreal. "We can start from three flights per week. Eventually we are also aiming to become a daily flight." Traffic between the United States and Indonesia is about 400,000 passengers a year, he said. Garuda is publicly traded but the Indonesian government is its largest shareholder with a 60 percent stake. The fast-growing carrier is in negotiations with planemaker Boeing Co (BA.N) and rival Airbus Group SE (AIR.PA) for at least 22 widebody planes to replace A330s that the carrier has on an operating lease, Wibowo said.

(AP) Aircraft engineers in Germany have successfully tested the world’s first four-seater plane that uses emission-free hybrid fuel cells to fly. The 10-minute test flight Thursday at Stuttgart Airport in southwestern Germany involved two pilots and two dummy passengers. The twin-cabin plane, known as HY4, was developed by aircraft maker Pipistrel, fuel cell specialist Hydrogenics, the University of Ulm and the German Aerospace Center DLR. It uses hydrogen to generate electricity in-flight, giving it a cruising speed of 165 kilometers per hour (102.5 mph) and a range of up to 1,500 kilometers (932 miles), while relying on batteries for take-off and landing. Boeing and Airbus have also tested smaller fuel cell planes in recent years as the aircraft industry searches for ways to reduce emissions.
