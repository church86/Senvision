(NFLX) Stock Is Worth Its Insane Valuation 3 Reasons Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Still Is a Great Buy View All Posts “I’m convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket,” Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg recently said at the What’s Next Tech Conference in Chicago. With that one sentence, Muilenburg set off a massive debate about space colonization and who’s going to get us there first — it also more eyes on Boeing stock. Source: Wikimedia SpaceX CEO Elon Musk feels his company is best equipped to make that happen; BA feels otherwise. If you look at how each company is funding their Mars adventures, Muilenburg is right to feel this way. Boeing is being supplied with billions of dollars from NASA to build a next-generation rocket dubbed the Space Launch System that will get the Orion spacecraft to Mars sometime around 2035. SpaceX is self-funded, currently contributing about 5% of its resources to the Mars rockets and spaceships. It’s projecting a Mars mission by 2024, well ahead of Boeing’s plans. There’s only one problem with SpaceX’s current spending and future plans: the Mars mission is estimated to cost as much as $1.5 trillion. 7 Tech Stocks That Will Ride Healthcare to Riches Where is it going to get the money to pay for it? Musk has been able to woo NASA into becoming an investor in SpaceX itself. Perhaps they will fork over additional billions to Musk (as they’ve done with Boeing) playing both sides against the middle. BA Has the Upper Hand However, where we stand today, is that BA is the one with the contracts, not SpaceX. So, from that perspective, they’re ahead of the game at least when it comes to NASA. If you want to get to Mars you’re going to need them on your side. But enough of the space talk. Putting all these hypotheticals aside, what does all of this mean for the current BA stock holder? Very little. Yes, it has contracts that were signed in 2014 regarding the SLS worth $3 billion that are ongoing through 2021; in the seven years prior to signing those contracts it also received an estimated $1.66 billion for preliminary work on the rocket. That’s almost $5 billion received before the project is even remotely close to completion. There will be more contracts and many more billions of dollars leading up to 2035. But you have to take that in the context of the entire BA business. In the first six months of 2016, Boeing generated $3 billion in free cash flow from $47.4 billion in revenue. Its backlog is $472 billion with nearly 5,700 commercial airplane orders. The SLS is practically a rounding error. However, if you drill down into its Defense, Space & Security segment, you’ll get a better idea why a little long-term thinking vis-a-vis the SLS makes a whole lot of sense. Space Exploration is housed within the Network & Space Systems division, which itself is one of three divisions that make up Boeing’s DS&S segment. In the first half of the year, N&SS generated operating earnings of $301 million on $3.5 billion in revenue. Normally, that’s about 8% to 10% of the company’s overall revenue. Over the last two fiscal years, its operating margins have increased by 100 basis points to 9.4%. In 2015, NS&S had $7.8 billion in revenue, $726 million in earnings from operations, and a $7.4 billion contractual backlog. That’s about 20% of the backlog of its other two divisions — Boeing Military Aircraft and Global Services & Support — combined. When you add to this the fact NS&S has the smallest margins of the three divisions, you can’t help but fail to notice the possibilities Boeing stock provides. Bottom Line on Boeing Stock However, put your Warren Buffett cap on for a moment, and we’ve got the makings of a very good long-term hold in BA stock. Let’s say Boeing does get a rocket and spaceship to Mars by 2035 and humans can actually withstand the radiation on the planet. Then what? Obviously, at some point, NASA and/or other space agencies are going to begin the initial stages of colonization. It could take another 100 years after that before we see something resembling a city or town. How Far Can Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Really Go With the Cloud? That’s obviously too long-term for anyone currently alive. However, that doesn’t mean BA investors can’t pass Boeing stock on to their kids and grandkids as a keepsake. More importantly, unlike the early car pioneers such as Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), BA stock investors already get a company that’s nicely profitable. Space colonization is coming. Why not ride Boeing stock all the way to the finish line? As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

On Sept. 24, three days after the licenses were issued, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif confirmed that Iran had received the green light to purchase 80 out of the 88 aircraft it had sought to buy from Boeing, adding, “Out of 118 Airbus jetliners, the license for selling 17 has been issued.” Summary⎙ Print Beyond being the first major aircraft sales with Iran in decades, the Boeing and Airbus deals are groundbreaking because they may entice major Western banks to resume dealings with the Islamic Republic. Author Saheb Sadeghi Posted October 19, 2016 Airbus and Boeing had previously agreed to sell or lease more than 200 passenger planes to Iran, which has sought to revamp its aging air fleet after the signing of the July 14, 2015, Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). After the formal Jan. 16 Implementation Day of the nuclear deal, the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued documents declaring that all US institutions wishing to sell or lease aircraft, spare parts or maintenance and safety services to Iran could apply for licenses on a case-by-case basis. OFAC guidelines further stipulated that non-US institutions also need licenses for selling and leasing aircraft to Iran if more than 10% of the components of their products are American made. Beyond the issue of securing licenses to sell the aircraft is the challenge of financing the deals. Hinting at this problem, Zarif told the Council on Foreign Relations in New York Sept. 23, “The US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control … tells international banks that it’s OK to do business with Iran but — and the buts and ifs are so long — I mean there is one sentence that it is OK to do business with Iran and five pages of ifs and buts. So at the end of the day, these banks say we will take the safe road. We will forget about Iran. And that has been the outcome. No major European bank has started doing business with Iran now, eight months after the deal. And we believe that’s a shortcoming.” According to what has been reported so far, the Boeing and Airbus passenger planes are not going to be bought in cash but rather financed. In practice, this means that Iran will buy the aircraft with loans and will repay the debt through revenue generated from operating the planes. Thus, not only is a bank or other financial institution needed to make the deal happen, but the loans must be long term. The broader implication is that if Iran is able to purchase aircraft through external financing, it could also do so with regard to other projects. While negotiations to finalize the aircraft deals are still ongoing, Iranian officials say they have made good progress. Indeed, things appear to be particularly moving forward on the crucial issue of financing. On Oct. 14, Tasnim news agency quoted a source in the Iranian government as saying, “Boeing and an American bank are reaching an agreement to finance Iranian purchase of the airliners through a Japanese bank.” Prior reports said that issues related to financing of the Airbus deal had also been solved. On Sept. 24, Iranian Deputy Minister of Roads and Urban Development Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan told the Iran newspaper, “A financing agreement between Airbus and a big financial institution has been finalized that has remained a secret in order to avert some enemies’ plots.” Some experts are of the view that the OFAC licenses to Boeing and Airbus are a promising sign that serious banking cooperation between Iran and Europe is around the corner. This would be an important development since major European banks have remained wary of remaining US sanctions and thus refrained from resuming banking ties with Iran — even after the formal implementation of the nuclear deal. As such, Tehran has so far relied on cooperation with smaller European banks while continuing dialogue with the bigger ones. Given the scale of the Boeing and Airbus deals and the need for financing to be long term, it is evident that small banks will not be able to finance the contracts. One can thus expect that major players are involved in the financing, and that the deals may help jump-start business between Iran and major Western banks in the near future. Indeed, beyond authorizing two major deals, OFAC’s licensing of aircraft sales to Iran is giving assurance to the world's major businesses that it is now possible to resume dealings with the Islamic Republic. Prominent Tehran economist​ Saeed Leylaz told Al-Monitor, “The OFAC licenses will have a big psychological impact on major investors and financial enterprises. This matters especially because under immense pressure from Iran and Its European trading partners, the United States now has to abide by its obligations under the JCPOA.” Leylaz added, “Serious cracks have emerged in the most complex and oldest sanctions and this will impact non-nuclear sanctions as well. In as much as Boeing is one of the biggest financial enterprises in the world and the United States, its financial transactions with different US economic sectors will spread to other sectors.” Al-Monitor also spoke with Tehran-based economist Tahmasb Mazaheri. He agreed that OFAC’s granting of licenses to Boeing and Airbus to deal with Iran is a good sign of the full implementation of the nuclear deal — but argued that the United States has only facilitated the latter after having in effect been forced to do so. Pointing to Iran’s deep and lingering mistrust of the United States, Mazaheri added, “Despite this good sign, we cannot trust the United States to fulfill its promises because in order to be assured of these promises, they must be credible — but the United States is not trustworthy. The United States has so far shown that it doesn’t want to fully implement the JCPOA and its acceptance of its obligations has always been accompanied with strict conditions.”  Read More: http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/10/iran-airbus-boeing-deals-ofac-licenses-western-banks.html Saheb Sadeghi Contributor,  Iran Pulse Saheb Sadeghi, a columnist and political analyst, is currently the managing director of the Iranian magazine Diplomat, a monthly publication that specializes in foreign policy issues, and director of economic service at the newspaper Iran Daily.

The study by Doyletech Corporation, a Canadian strategic management consultancy, suggests that Boeing’s four locations in Canada include Winnipeg, Richmond, Montreal and Ottawa both directly and indirectly create positive economic effects. The aerospace company supports more than 17,000 jobs across the country and contributes to nearly 14 percent of Canada’s aerospace industry. “Boeing has been a strong partner to Canada since 1919, and these results demonstrate the significant continued economic benefits to Canada from Boeing’s long-term commitments and collaboration with Canada’s aerospace industry,” said Maria Lane, Defense Space & Security vice president of International Strategic Partnerships. “This study helps to quantify Boeing’s impact for Canadian industry. Looking ahead, we are committed to growing our partnership with Canada, supporting local jobs and growth across the country.” The study found that Boeing’s spending in Canada has grown at an average annual rate of nearly eight percent, four times as much as the Canadian economy’s growth rate. Boeing will contribute more than US$10 million this year toward the Canadian government’s objectives in science, technology, economic evolution and growth at the province level. Doyletech explored three different areas where Boeing contributes to the Canadian economy. The three areas include Boeing as an “Agile Producer,” direct and indirect contributions to Canada’s science policy and national science and technology objectives through Doyletech’s EconWin economic impact model; and estimated direct, indirect and induced spending and jobs related to Boeing operations and supply chain in Canada. “Working with a country is about more than selling aircraft. It’s about creating measurable long-term partnerships across government, industry, research centers and the community,” said Roberto Valla, Defense, Space & Security vice president for Global Sales for Canada. For Valla, the study suggests that collaboration between Boeing and Canadian industry can produce widespread, mutual economic benefit and technological growth for decades. The study will support Boeing’s development of a tailored industrial engagement plan, through Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, related to its offering of the F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet to Canada. www.boeing.ca Share Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Tags Boeing Winnipeg Related Canadian aerospace market overcomes “disappointing global economy” Study: How to help Canadian startups become billion dollar firms Boeing, Airbus offer positive outlook for aircraft demand Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

A four-year agreement to this effect was signed between the Australian Department of Defence and Boeing. The deal to support P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol and response aircraft is expected to create more than 35 jobs in South Australia. Australia's Minister of Defence Industry Christopher Pyne said: “This contract continues to deliver on the Turnbull Government’s commitment to using Australia’s defence expenditure to the benefit of both Australia’s national security interests and the economic health of this important employment sector. “Developing this kind of indigenous capability, where we can maintain our own military hardware, is critical for our national security and is good for Australian jobs.” In September this year, Boeing launched the first P-8A Poseidon aircraft for RAAF. Based on Boeing’s 737-800 fuselage, the new maritime patrol aircraft will replace a fleet of AP-3C Orion aircraft currently in service with RAAF. "The P-8A is a world class Maritime Patrol and Response aircraft and Australian Defence industry support will be a critical enabler to our military’s operational capability in the region." The P-8A is equipped with weapons bay, under wing and under fuselage hard points for weapons and is designed for continued low level operations and high angle of bank turns. Pyne further added: “The P-8A is a world class Maritime Patrol and Response aircraft and Australian Defence industry support will be a critical enabler to our military’s operational capability in the region.” “Importantly Australian defence industry involvement in the sustainment of this aircraft will provide regional support for the global P-8A fleet and has the potential to improve opportunities for Australian defence industry participation in future support activities.” Image: A P-8A Poseidon flying alongside a Lockheed P-3 Orion.

  Wednesday 16/11/2016     Product Focus    Print this page Kennametal, KM4X: A new twist on an old ally in the setup-time reduction war 19 October 2016 Quick-change modular tooling is a clear way to increase productivity, shorten setup time, and generally improve the bottom line for job shops and large manufacturers alike. The KM™ system from Kennametal Corp., Latrobe, PA has been a top performer in this area for over three decades, and is known throughout the industry for its high clamping strength and consistent accuracy in both spindle-mounted and static tooling applications.The bending moment of KM4X is substantially higher than any tooling interface available on the market today, superior even to Kennametal's own KM design So when aerospace giant Boeing came to Kennametal with a request for a heavy-duty spindle connection capable of outperforming traditional CAT and BT-style adapters, tooling engineers turned to this robust and well-established platform as a starting point. The result was a 100 mm spindle connection with four ball tracks instead of two and up to 40 percent greater clamping force than comparably-sized KM tooling.  That was 15 years ago. KM continues to thrive, and was adopted in 2008 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as ISO standard 26622. The original Boeing-inspired design has been renamed as well, and marketed for the past several years as KM4X100™, a spindle platform popular with machine builders such as Fives Group, Mitsui Seiki, Stama, and others, as well as those machine shops looking for superior rigidity in demanding machining conditions. That popularity is about to grow. Kennametal has announced the KM4X tooling family has gained a 63 mm sibling, one aimed at a broader machine tool platform and therefore greater availability to the machining community. "Just as we did with Boeing, we challenged ourselves to make a great solution even better," says Bill Redman, Kennametal Global Product Manager, Tooling Systems. "The clamping strength, bending stiffness, and RPM capabilities of the KM4X63™ are dramatically higher than virtually any other connection out there." Redman and others on the product management and engineering team aren't done. They recently approached a number of machine builders to ask for opinions on the initial KM4X product offering. Based on that feedback, Kennametal continues to expand the portfolio—the KM4X lineup now includes shrink fit toolholders, HydroForce™ hydraulic chucks, TG and ER collet chucks, and a variety of other spindle tooling, clamping units, and modular adapters, with more on the way.  »By the end of 2016, we're going to add roughly 30 new line items, most of which will be extensions in the 80 to 200 mm range, and centerline turning tools to support mill-turn applications,» says Redman. "We've found that, because of KM4X's extreme rigidity, we can greatly increase gage lengths. This means our customers can reach much farther without having to buy a special tool, something that's especially important with 5-axis machining—they can basically add on whatever extension length is needed and off they go, in both static or rotating applications. We're pretty excited about that." One example of this is a 674 mm gage length (26.54 in.) KM4X boring bar that will be displayed on an Integrex i-400 in the Mazak booth at this year's IMTS. "KM4X63 has a maximum bending moment of 2,100 Nm (1548 ft. lb.) and, depending on the machine, clamping force of 36 to 58 Kn (8093 to 13038 lb.)," he says. "It's the strongest connection available in this size range, period." It's also faster. Redman says KM4X63 comes 'out of the box' capable to 38,000 rpm, which is higher than HSK-A and 'dramatically' faster than competing brands of spindle tooling. For those shops on the fence about spindle tooling and quick-change, Redman offers the following advice. "There's nothing worse than going into a shop that just bought a $500,000 machining center or lathe and then discovers they should have opted for a different tooling platform. We as tooling providers have an obligation to educate customers, and get them thinking about what they're trying to accomplish—whether they need high spindle speeds for an aluminum or die-mold application, or greater low-end torque for titanium and HRSA machining. The majority of tooling systems out there can accommodate one of these things, but not both. We feel KM4X provides a competitive advantage no matter what you're cutting." KM and KM4X work on stationary applications as well, as in this centerline turning tool holder for multi-tasking machines and mill-turn lathes Due to its inherently balanced design, KM4X63 achieves 'out of the box' spindle speeds 30% greater than HSK, and nearly twice that of comparably-sized polygon-style toolholders Anatomy of the KM4X clamping mechanism: four ball tracks instead of two. On the system size 63, this provides 50% greater clamping force over PSC, and 150% higher clamping force than HSK63   For more information, please contact: Anna Mason Kennametal U.K. Ltd.

"Airbus and Boeing have given the Iranian aviation industry the rights for plane maintenance and repair operations as well as manufacture of airplane spare parts," Member of Iranian Aviation Companies Association Maqsoud Assadi Samani said on Tuesday. He said that the negotiations with Airbus and Boeing authorities had been underway with satisfactory pace. In mid-September, Deputy Managing Director of Boeing Company Martin Benturd underlined that the sales of the giant aviation firm's airplanes to Iran is on the right track. "There is no problem for selling airplanes to Iran and conditions are ripe for obtaining license from Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)," Benturd told reporters in Ashgabat. He underlined that Boeing and the Iranian airliners are continuing their talks on the sale of passenger planes. OFAC is a financial intelligence and enforcement agency of the US Treasury Department. In mid-June, Head of Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization (CAO) and Deputy Road Minister Ali Abedzadeh announced that the country has signed a deal with Boeing on purchasing 100 planes from the US manufacturer. "The two sides reached a written agreement to purchase 100 planes," Abedzadeh said. He said that the written agreement was made after representatives of Iran and Boeing company held several rounds of talks, adding that the planes will be provided to Tehran through a financing deal.         Related News Iran, Airbus to Discuss Passenger Planes Deal Again Today  Official Says 10 Airbus Planes to Be Purchased  Official: Iran to Finalize Contract to Purchase Airbus, ATR Planes Soon  Official: German, French Banks to Finance Iran's Purchase of Airbus, ATR Planes  Official: Iran-Airbus Deal to Take Time to Materialize  French Minister: Iran, Airbus to Finalize Deal Next Week  Minister: Iran, Airbus Finalizing Plane Purchase Contract  LATEST STORIES (5) Yemen Water Crisis Iraqi Popular Forces Continue Operations against ISIL Terrorists West of Mosul Iraqi Forces Take Back Ancient City of Nimrud from ISIL Iraqi Popular Forces Safeguarding Peace in Newly Gained Territories near Mosul Police Violence during Anti-Trump Protests Iran and US: A Tale of Two Elections Supermoon in Iran's Sky Iran Eyeing NITC Listing in Int'l Stock Markets VP: World Admitting Iran's Constructive Role in Maintaining Regional Security Iraqi Interior Minister: Nearly 1,000 ISIL Terrorists Killed, Over 100 Captured in Mosul Operation Battle for Mosul Day 29: Iraqi Forces Only 3km from Mosul Airport Kurdish Fighters Seize over 550 sq/km of Raqqa from ISIL Iraqi Police Confirm Liberation of Entire Area South of Mosul City Iraq: ISIL Hits Nineveh's Al-Qayyara Town with Chemical Missiles Protests, Students Walkouts Mark Week after Trump's Win Yemen Water Crisis TEHRAN (FNA)- The Saudi war in Yemen, which has claimed more than 12,000 lives, has caused a serious humanitarian crisis in a country that is already threatened by severe water scarcity.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 18 October 2016 | MYT 9:39 PM Japanese aerospace parts maker Asahi opens facility in Klang Asahi's new facility will play a role of supporting parts manufacturing for all of Boeing’s commercial airplane programmes. The Reuters photo shows the Boeing Company logo projected on a wall at the "What's Next?" conference in Chicago earlier this month. KUALA LUMPUR: Japanese aerospace parts maker Asahi Kinzoku Kogyo Inc, through Asahi Aero Malaysia Sdn Bhd, has set up an aircraft parts surface treatment facility in Klang -- its first in South-East Asia.  Asahi Aero Malaysia said in a statement that the RM18mil facility, jointly owned with Toyota Tsusho Corp, specialised in cadmium and Zn-Ni plating, as well as boric surifuric and phosphoric acid anodise processing.  Managing director Go Yamanaka said the one-stop processing facility was opened in order to be closer to Asahi’s customers and meet their needs for quality, on-time delivery and greater affordability.  “The new facility will rapidly play a role of supporting parts manufacturing for all of Boeing’s commercial airplane programmes,” he added. Asahi has five facilities in Japan and one in the United States.  It was the first company in Japan to receive the National Aerospace and Defence Contractors Accreditation Programme (Nadcap) certification, a global cooperative accreditation programme for aerospace engineering, defence and related industries, which is a prerequisite to work with companies such as Boeing.  Boeing Commercial Airplanes director of supplier management (Asia) Troy Kim said Asahi is a trusted partner to Boeing.  “They have helped meet Boeing’s requirements for high quality, competitive pricing and on-time delivery while expanding our supply chain capability in South-East Asia,” Kim said. The Malaysian Investment Development Authority has identified the aerospace industry as a key source of growth for the Malaysian economy. Asahi believes that its expertise and investment in aircraft parts surface treatment technology will help expand Malaysia’s manufacturing sector. “We are committed to creating local employment opportunities and aspire to become the employer of choice in Malaysia,” said Yamanaka.  Tags / Keywords: Airlines , Boeing , Asahi Aero Malaysia Sdn Bhd Related Stories Boeing to consolidate defense, space and security business Boeing Q3 profit jumps, raises revenue forecasts Boeing Q3 profit jumps; raises delivery and revenue outlook Airbus net orders fall as it draws line under Kingfisher failure MAS orders RM22b jets You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Fine-tune your songs Xiaomi opens its Mi Store on Lazada MRT fare starts at RM1 Property Related advertisement Latest News There is no "truly low-cost" airlines in Asia, there is a gap for this Malaysian palm oil price declines for 2nd session in a row Oil rallies on OPEC deal bets; tech, energy boost global stocks Google announces new London office, 3,000 jobs expected Wall Street rises, helped by tech and energy (Update 1) Most Viewed in Business MRT fare starts at RM1 There is no "truly low-cost" airlines in Asia, there is a gap for this Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Billionaire Ananda Krishnan exploring taking Astro private Malaysia Airlines mulls purchase of 25 widebody jets next year EPF, Eco World in JV to develop township, business park in Selangor Oil rallies on OPEC deal bets; tech, energy boost global stocks Google announces new London office, 3,000 jobs expected Malaysian palm oil price declines for 2nd session in a row PDZ stops fund-raising exercise for proposed billion-ringgit LPG project advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

One giant robot, named Panel Assembly Line or PAL, sounds friendly, but its job is to construct wings for 737 airplanes. PAL sits at 20 feet tall inside a Boeing factory and helps build 42 airplanes per month, that's about two sets of wings per day  "What this line does, it builds up our upper and lower wing panels that build up our wing box on our 737 wings," said Greg Beltz, senior manager of PAL.

Air Un-fair Taxpayers pick up part of the tab when a President makes campaign trips on Air Force One, but with rare exceptions that's the only mode of air travel the President can use. David Emery Oct 18, 2016 Share - - Claim: It costs American taxpayers roughly $200,000 an hour every time President Obama travels in Air Force One to campaign for Hillary Clinton. mixture WHAT'S TRUE: Taxpayers foot part of the bill when the President uses Air Force One for campaigning purposes. WHAT'S FALSE: The true cost of operating Air Force One is likely a good deal less than $200,000 per hour, and the President is required to reimburse the government for the equivalent commercial cost of campaign travel. Example: [Collected via Facebook, September 2016] Origin:The image shown above, stating that it costs U.S. taxpayers $200,000 per hour to maintain and operate the official White House jet, Air Force One, was circulated heavily in the final months of the 2016 presidential campaign, during which President Obama made at least a dozen trips around the country to stump for fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton. It echoed a sentiment tweeted that July by Republican candidate Donald Trump, who complained that taxpayers were paying a "fortune" for Obama and Clinton to take Air Force One to North Carolina for a joint campaign appearance: Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2016 Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 5, 2016 These are worthwhile questions to ask: How much does it really cost to operate Air Force One? And is it true that taxpayers have to foot the entire bill, even when the president isn't traveling on official business? The first question to consider is how much the use of Air Force One really costs U.S. taxpayers. The "$200,000 per hour" cost of Air Force One (or, more specifically, of the Boeing VC-25A aircraft on which the President usually travels) is a commonly cited figure, but it is both variable and highly misleading. For starters, the National Taxpayers Union Foundation (NTUF) reported in April 2016 that the cost per flight hour (CPFH) for Air Force One had decreased in the last few years: The most easily quantifiable item to estimate is the cost to operate Air Force One (AF1), a Boeing VC-25A, the military version of the 747 aircraft. Some good news for taxpayers is that the costs per flight hour for AF1 has gone down again. In 2013, it cost $228,288. Last year, it was reported at $206,337 per flight hour. In response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed by Judicial Watch, the Air Force reported that the FY 2016 cost per flight hour for the AF1 is $180,118. The main issue with this dollar figure is that it's not very informative since we don't know how much Air Force One costs when the President isn't using it. That is, cost per flight hour (CPFH) is typically determined by dividing fixed costs (or operating and support costs) by the number of hours flown — so an airplane that is very expensive to maintain but is flown relatively little (as Air Force One is) will have a high CPFH, but most of those costs will be incurred whether the aircraft is used or not. As a ridiculously simplistic example, let's suppose you own a small plane that you pay $10,000 per month (or $120,000 per year) to maintain and store in a hangar, and once per year you put $1,000 worth of fuel in that plane and fly it for an hour. Your CPFH for the year would be a whopping $121,000, even though you would have spent $120,000 of that had you never used the plane at all. Moreover, if you bought $10,000 worth of fuel and flew the plane for ten hours, your CPFH would drop all the way to $13,000 even though you actually spent more money on your airplane. Air Force One likely has a very high fixed cost because it has to be continuously maintained, inspected, secured, crewed, and prepped to fly at a moment's notice, but since it doesn't generally log a lot of flight hours (especially when compared to the typical commercial airliner), it has a relatively high CPFH — and as noted, taxpayers would be footing the bill for those hefty fixed costs whether the President flew or not. The CPFH figure is also highly misleading because if the President used Air Force One more often than he actually does, that additional usage would cause the CPFH to drop, and it would paradoxically seem as the President were saving taxpayer money by spending more of it. Whatever the true cost of the President's using Air Force One might be, how much of that cost do U.S. taxpayers bear when the purpose of the trip is political? That side of the equation is less clear. Federal Election Commission rules require that the government be reimbursed for whatever percentage of a President's trip is devoted to campaigning, based on the cost of chartering a similar-sized (or slightly smaller) commercial plane to carry campaign-related personnel on an identical trip. According to the Washington Post, that cost is currently about $11,000 per hour. We don't know exactly how much more it costs taxpayers when Air Force One is in the air rather than on the ground, but it's probably greater than $11,000 per hour (and quite a bit less than $200,000 per hour). This issue is something of an unwinnable one for a President — it's not illegal for a President to spend time campaigning, for himself or for others, but with rare exceptions the President isn't allowed to travel on any aircraft other than Air Force One. And President Obama (or his party) is already paying much more for campaign use of Air Force One than his predecessor did: prior to 2009 (when Barack Obama took office), the presidential reimbursement for political travel only amounted to a few hundred dollars per hour, so President George W. Bush paid significantly less per flight to take Air Force One on political trips than President Obama does. In the specific case of the campaign trip President Obama took with Hillary Clinton to North Carolina, official paperwork showed that the Clinton campaign reimbursed the government $36,602.99 for the use of Air Force One on 5 July 2016 — pretty close to the going rate, it sounds like, but perhaps still no bargain for the American people.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Boeing Co. plans to close a 35-year-old factory in Macon, Georgia, while cutting about 120 jobs. The aircraft maker blamed a softening market for big cargo planes, like the 747, for the cutbacks. The plant closure reverses a former plan to bring 200 jobs to Macon over the next three years, according to the Telegraph. “Just a year ago last month, officials from Boeing and Macon-Bibb County government celebrated the announcement that Boeing would invest nearly $82 million to convert its existing military facility in Macon to a commercial airplane manufacturing plant,” the newspaper reported. Boeing's stock has fallen about 6 percent this year, failing to re-take the 2015 peak. The Macon-Bibb Industrial Authority is working to help people find new jobs if they’re unable to transfer to other Boeing plants. “It was very disappointing to the Industrial Authority and its leadership, but we also understand that the overall economic situation impact right here at home and this is a classic example,” Macon-Bibb Industrial Authority Chairman Clifford Whitby told news station WMAZ. “There are some workers who will not wish to leave the community. So we have programs with the state and the Labor Department that’s designed to help transition workers in this case.” The Boeing site started as a McDonnell Douglas factory in 1988 that worked on commercial and military aircraft programs such as the MD-80 and the C-17, the Telegraph reported.   © 2016 Newsmax Finance.

Kevin Knight, Etihad Aviation Group’s chief strategy and planning officer, said the upgrade to the B787 Dreamliner reflected the importance of the Japan route and the airline’s commitment to the market. "The B787 Dreamliner is an exceptional aircraft from an operational and guest experience perspective. Its unique design and our innovative and stylish cabins offer a guest experience that’s superior in terms of luxury and comfort." The Abu Dhabi carrier, beginning May, was scheduled to receive five new 787 Dreamliners over a seven-month period. The fleet now serves routes including Brisbane, Washington, Singapore and Zurich from Abu Dhabi. The Dreamliner is expected to be Etihad’s flagship long-haul aircraft when it takes delivery of 66 more Boeing 787s over the next few years. Etihad Airways commenced service to Japan on February 1, 2010 with five weekly flights between Abu Dhabi and Nagoya, via Beijing, and was increased to daily four years later. Tokyo Narita was added to the Japan route on March 27, 2010 with five weekly non-stop flights, before being upgraded to a daily service on March 31, 2013. business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe Etihad launches new Dreamliner superjumbo flight to Riyadh Etihad adds flights and cities to India sector Dreamliner to provide lift for Boeing even if 777 output hits downdraught More Aviation Next-gen A380s and Boeing 777s on the way as Emirates boosts superjumbo-only fleet Delivery of 61 Boeing jetliners on hold as United looks to save $1.6bn UK’s easyJet reports first annual profit slide in six years Malaysia Airlines pins hopes on adding flights to China MOST VIEWED Business | All Next-gen A380s and Boeing 777s on the way as Emirates boosts superjumbo-only fleet Majid Al Futtaim will expand Sharjah City Centre Leonardo DiCaprio and synthetics irritate the diamond industry Stronger dollar could hold back Dubai property recovery Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe Rolls-Royce chief: ‘Our targets are always based on profitability, not volumes’ Review: Joyable app helps ease social anxiety at work Review: Moto Z is a brilliant modular device A380s and Boeing 777s make up Emirates’ entire fleet as it scores a world’s first More Most Viewed Album review: Hardwired...

Author: Jack Stewart. Jack Stewart Transportation Date of Publication: 10.19.16. 10.19.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am Meet the Giant Robot That Builds Boeing’s Wings To stay ahead in the war for the skies, Boeing chases a simple goal: sell as many 737 jets as it can. Things get more complicated when it comes to building most popular commercial jet ever. In 2015, the Seattle centenarian pushed an average of 42 per month out of the door and into the sky. By 2018, it aims to make that 52 a month. Faster assembly requires some fancy new tools, so Boeing brought in the robotic Panel Assembly Line, aka PAL. This 20 foot tall giant glides back and forth on tracks in the floor, patiently and accurately riveting wings together. The 60-ton machine increases production rates by 33 percent, helping workers with all that clamping and drilling. PAL, built by Washington-based Electroimpact, joins upper and lower skin panels to spars which, like ribs, form the wing’s internal support. The lower skin, which will become the bottom of the wing, has a series of “portholes” that airline mechanics use for inspections. Precision matters: These wings aren’t just keeping you aloft, they’re holding the fuel that’s pushing your plane forward. So the next time you gaze out the window of a 737, remember the helpful PAL who helped you get there. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Aviation Boeing Manufacturing Skip Social.

(Zach Stein) Related Stories WestJet flight diverted to Regina Iguanas on a plane: WestJet flight grounded by lizards on the loose A group of travellers aboard a WestJet flight destined for Canada were temporarily stranded in Greenland Tuesday after the plane was unexpectedly grounded. WestJet Flight 4 was headed to Toronto from London but was diverted when air traffic control and pilots deemed the plane was unsafe to fly about five hours into the flight, Winnipegger Zach Stein said. "The pilot did a great job ... he kept everybody very calm," said Stein, who was among the 250 passengers and nine crew members aboard the Boeing 767. The pilots landed at the Kangerlussuaq Airport in Greenland a short time later. A spokesperson with WestJet said the flight was grounded due to a potential mechanical issue related to the aircraft cooling system. The flight landed fine and was met by emergency vehicles as a precaution, the spokesperson added. Travellers were provided meals at the airport, and WestJet sent two Boeing 737s to Greenland Tuesday night to pick up the passengers and take them to Toronto in the morning. Stein said he was impressed with how WestJet handled the situation. "The staff did a great job, as WestJet usually [does]. They were professional, courteous, friendly, caring, answering questions." 'Nothing to do with lightning' Stein said before the flight took off, an airline attendant announced the plane was hit by a "severe lightning strike" during an earlier flight from Vancouver to London. That put people a little on edge, he said, adding no one was told whether the diversion later was related. Zach Stein was among 250 passengers temporarily stranded in Greenland Tuesday after their WestJet flight was unexpectedly grounded. (Zach Stein) But WestJet maintains "this matter had nothing to do with lightning." "That aircraft had flown from London to Vancouver the previous day, and while there had been lightning in the area around the airport when it departed [from] London, it was not hit," the spokesperson said in a statement.  "As a precaution, a comprehensive, specialized lightning inspection was performed in Vancouver yesterday after it landed and no strikes were found." WestJet plans to touch base with passengers who wish to be compensated for the delay. "We apologize to our guests for this disruption to their travel plans. Safety will always be our top priority and we will never compromise it to operate a flight," the WestJet spokesperson said. "The decision to divert was appropriate and demonstrates that commitment."

November 16, 2016 1230 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:170541 Publish Date: Tue, 18 Oct 2016 18:54:12 GMT Service: Iran Boeing, Airbus grant Iran 'maintenance, part manufacturing' permits Airline industry giants Airbus and Boeing granted Iran permissions for plane maintenance and repair operations and manufacturing spare parts, announced the secretary of Society of Iranian Airlines. Maqsoud Asadi-Samani told Mehr News on Tuesday that a draft of a deal with the two giant holdings had stipulated the permissions for Iranian airline industries — a demand long overdue.  "The negotiations with Airbus and Boeing authorities had been underway at a satisfactory pace. In the negotiations, a possibility was addressed under which a Japanese and an American bank would finance Iran's deal with Airbus and Boeing in which billions of dollars would be at stake," he added. Asadi-Samani rejected claims by the airline industry community that Iran suffered lack of necessary permits by air industry giants which would permit repair and maintenance activities in Iran. "It is far too early to make untimely claims about that possibility, and would be legally inaccurate. The buyer, according to the conventions, would receive such rights and we believe the agreements as well are not silent about that, and Iran has received maintenance, repairs, and spare part manufacturing permissions," he underlined. President Hassan Rouhani's visit to Paris was a turning point in Iran's deal with Airbus, a European air industry giant, during which he effectively hammered out a lucrative deal with the company to buy brand new planes to refurbish Iran's antiquated air fleet. Iran still works to make operative a deal to buy aircraft from the two companies. Iran's vision for renewal of its air fleet is rather ambitious, with 118 Airbus and 108 Boeing planes which would transform the country's airline industry into a new world class quality. Under new conditions, the government should turn to domestic companies to provide them with new technology coming from outside through agreements on making such transfers possible. During the four decades of sanctions during which Iran had not bought new planes, Iranian planes still succeeded in landing in European airports, with few exceptions.     KeyWords Boeing Airbus permit   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Iran confiscates 2 tonnes of explosives from Daesh terrorists Iran, China must boost cooperation in fight on terrorism: Rouhani Syria holds pacesetter Iran in wetland Everton joins race for Iran’s Azmoun Iran defeated by Kazakhstan in Asian water polo championship Iran, absent from kabaddi World Cup final Iranian teams capture Asian youth, junior weightlifting titles French MP: Iran’s role in fight against terrorism crucial Iran: Killing of Muslims in Nigeria worrisome Rouhani: Iran, China must boost anti-terror fight Most Visited Obama vows to veto bill seeking to block Iran plane sales Trump not going to ‘hurt’ Clinton Trump looking at 'quick ways' to ditch Paris climate accord: Report www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/2535 sec

They soon could be if you book this quirky new party package offered by Middlesbrough College. At the themed birthday celebration, children are given the chance to check in, wear cabin crew uniform and then board the college’s own mock 757 jet - that was once part of an actual Boeing. As well as that they’ll be given safety demonstrations, the chance to use the on board equipment and given in flight food and treats from the trolley. Julie King, commercial booking officer at the college, says other party packages at the venue will include a nail and hair pamper package in the college’s own salon, a cupcake party and a pizza-making party. She said: “We have been running a range of children’s parties here at the college for the past four years. “We started out with our very successful football parties hosted on the AstroTurf pitches and these proved successful for both parents due to their affordable prices and children with the fun-filled content." Middlesbrough College set to offer 'plane parties' for children Middlesbrough College set to offer 'plane parties' for children She added: “We also host a summer school during August which features dozens of exciting day activities for children to keep entertained whilst learning in holidays. “Middlesbrough College principal and chief executive Zoe Lewis was keen to replicate the success of this party and the summer school across the college to appeal to a wider range of children.” The Boeing 757 aircraft was salvaged by Tees Valley specialists Sycamore Aviation and installed in the college to create a life-like training environment. Julie added: “I was approached by Carole Bennett, director of sport, travel and public services, who felt it would be a brilliant idea to incorporate our brand new simulated aircraft cabin into children’s parties. “Once part of a Boeing 757 aircraft, this is a unique party for children. Middlesbrough College set to offer 'plane parties' for children Middlesbrough College set to offer 'plane parties' for children “We try to make our parties as fun and educational so that children go home with fantastic memories. “We’d love to inspire children to new career paths in their future such as the travel and tourism industry!” After the fun on the plane the young guests are then taken through to ‘arrivals’ and given birthday cake. The new range of parties will be available from January. There is a fixed price of £180 for up to 16 children for the plane party, which includes party invites.

New video purporting to show a pro-Ukrainian death squad giving a Nazi salute after killing warlord Arseniy Pavlov, nicknamed Motorola, has emerged. But doubts have been voiced about whether Ukrainian forces were behind the 33-year-old's killing - with some commentators suspecting Moscow carried out the assassination. Scroll down for video  A video was released by supposedly anti-Moscow fighters claiming to have killed warlord Arseniy Pavlov, nicknamed Motorola The killers were seen doing a Nazi salute after announcing that Pavlov, 33, had been 'liquidated' Motorola, pictured on his wedding day with bride Elena Kolenkina, died in the attack on Sunday The death of the Russian-born mercenary commander - a key figure in the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples Republic (DPR) defence forces - has prompted warnings of violent retribution and a return to war between Russian rebels and Ukraine. Pavlov died alongside a bodyguard on Sunday when an improvised bomb detonated in a lift in his Donetsk apartment block. Bloodstains were seen on the road outside after the men were removed from the lift. There are suggestions his death on Sunday could have been ordered by the Kremlin because he 'knew too much' about the downing of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 by a BUK missile in July 2014. His bride reportedly wore a handgun under her bridal gown, and also brandished a Kalashnikov on their wedding day RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Putin says the West can 'screw themselves' over the threat...

Share this article Share 65 shares Russian journalist Yulia Latynina linked his death directly to his knowledge as a field commander of those guilty of shooting down MH17. Pavlov was 'the one who knew who hit the Boeing', she said. It has also been suggested that Russian forces want to purge figures linked to war crimes.  Alex Kokcharov, a Ukraine and Russia risk analyst at London-based IHS Markit defence and security consultancy, said Moscow may want 'more acceptable civilian faces not directly implicated in MH17 or war crimes'. Pavlov and a bodyguard were killed in his apartment block in Donetsk after a bomb exploded in a lift Arseniy Pavlov, well known as warlord Motorola, was 'paranoid' about his security and that of his family, according to sources in Donetsk Another theory is that he was killed in a dispute over control of Donetsk's black market. A source with links to senior separatists told The Telegraph: 'Some suspect that Motorola was killed over an internal fight over control of the black market. 'Others are saying that handlers higher up the chain are cleaning up first-generation rebels to destroy any incriminating evidence and remove witnesses to war crimes. 'The Kremlin needs its proxies to have a more acceptable public face.'   The 33-year-old was purportedly killed by anti-Moscow fighters, but experts and sources close to the warlord have cast doubts on the claims A source close to the warlord voiced doubts over whether Ukrainian forces were behind the killing. 'Motorola was very careful with his security, he was paranoid about his safety and that of his family,' the source said.  It looks like he was eliminated by his cousins in crime of this anti-human terrorist gang. This is a sad but just end. Artyom Shevchenko, Ukrainian Interior Ministry spokesman 'So the idea you could do a sophisticated hit like this requiring such close access requires someone in the inner circle. The official version is pretty doubtful.'  Motorola was described as a 'warrior from God' in Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda after his death, and had previously featured on a set of commemorative stamps in the region.  Footage supposedly taken by Pavlov's killers, who claim to be anti-Moscow rebel factions, shows fighters giving the Nazi salute after a masked figure declares: 'Good day, this video is being recorded in Donetsk, where we have just liquidated the well known terrorist Motorola.' Pools of blood were seen in the road outside Pavlov's apartment block after the bodies of the warlord and his bodyguard were removed The masked killers made threats against Igor Plotnitsky and Alexander Zakharchenko in a video released after Pavlov's death A man in a skeleton-style mask continues, referring to other key pro-Kremlin rebel leaders: 'Zakharchenko, Plotnitsky, you're next.' The threats refer to Igor Plotnitsky, leader of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic, and Alexander Zakharchenko, prime minister of the Donetsk People's Republic. The authenticity of the footage could not be verified, although pro-Vladimir Putin forces are using it to blame Kiev for the death of the rebel leader, who is hailed as a hero by Russia. 'It looks like he was eliminated by his cousins in crime of this anti-human terrorist gang,' Ukrainian Interior Ministry spokesman Artyom Shevchenko said on social media. 'This is a sad but just end.' Pavlov was already married when he tied the knot with bride Elena Kolenkina in July 2014 The voices speak in Russian, not Ukrainian. Pavlov is known to have departed Donetsk region for Crimea on July 18 2014, the day after MH17 was downed, with new wife Elena Kolenkina, then 21, who he was suspected of marrying in a bigamous ceremony. MH17: INVESTIGATION TEAM HAD FOUND THAT RUSSIAN MISSILE WAS FIRED FROM UKRAINE  The plane crashed in eastern Ukraine in July 2014, killing 298 passengers and crew A report by the Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) found that MH17 was shot out of the sky by a Russian missile from a BUK M1 launcher, but it did not name those who it believes carried out the act. The strike was from a location in eastern Ukraine, controlled by pro-Moscow rebels. The launcher had arrived from Russia. And after the strike, it was driven back to Russian territory, according to the JIT. Moscow has strenuously denied the allegations, and accused the investigators of ignoring crucial evidence suggesting the Ukrainian army was to blame for the loss of the MH17.  An earlier attempt on Pavlov's life was made on 24 June. He headed the Sparta battalion in the Ukraine, which was notorious for being one of the most ill-disciplined and ruth  Kiev blamed Pavlov, a former lifeguard and car wash worker, for 'murdering' at least 15 prisoners of war in the bloody Ukrainian conflict. Pro-Kremlin Russian analyst Igor Korotchenko warned: 'In light of recent events, a new round of war in the Donbas, unfortunately, becomes almost inevitable.' Putin supporters in the region blamed Kiev president Petro Poroshenko for Pavlov's death, which they saw as a ceasefire violation. Alexander Zakharchenko, head of Donetsk People's Republic, warned: 'I understand it that Poroshenko has broken the ceasefire and declared war. 'Now you wait. This is enough. We have coped with it enough. We promised enough. My close friend was killed .... It is no ordinary challenge for us.' He warned: 'I'd like to tell the armed forces of Ukraine, national security services and intelligence services: you should be very afraid.' Another source warned: 'Having killed Motorola, Ukraine has declared a start of a terror war.' A spokesman for the neighbouring so-called Lugansk People's Republic - also controlled by pro-Moscow rebels - warned: 'Those involved in this crime will be found and eliminated.' Pavlov was seen as a war hero to Putin but as a criminal to Ukraine, where Poroshenko had been quoted saying last month: 'During questioning, against all international conventions, Ihor (Branovytsky, a Ukrainian prisoner of war) was shot dead personally by one inhuman gangster with the nickname Motorola. Motorola's first Russian wife Victoria Kondrashova, mother of their son Danya, has said she will go to his funeral 'It won't be forgiven. This beast will be made responsible. He will be punished for the death of a Ukrainian hero.' Kiev did not initially officially comment but sources voiced the suspicion that Moscow could be behind his death in order to provoke a new round of war in eastern Ukraine. In one interview Pavlov admitted to allegations that he killed Branovytsky and went on to say: 'I don't give a f*** about what I am accused of, believe it or not. 'I shot 15 prisoners dead. I don't give a f***. No comment. I kill if I want to. I don't if I don't,' he was quoted as saying. He is believed to have been awarded medals by Putin for his role in the Russian military operation to return to Crimean Peninsula to rule by Moscow in defiance of international law. Pavlov suffered serious injuries to his head, arm and leg during fighting in Sloviansk. He was at the centre of the fierce military battle for control on Donetsk airport during the conflict with his Sparta Battalion. There were accusations that his wedding to Elena Kolenkina, now 23, in June 2014 came when he was already married to a wife in Moscow with whom he had a son, then five. Pavlov's bride was seen carrying weapons on her wedding day, and he was described as 'paranoid' about his security Questions have been raised about whether Moscow was behind the warlord's murder, with claims that he knew the identity of those behind the downing of flight MH17 His wife in Moscow, Victoria Kondrashova, confirmed today he was married to her when he died despite his 2014 wedding to Elena. She plans to take their son Danya, now seven, to his father's funeral. Pavlov had told how he met the then 21 year old met in a cellar where she was hiding from shell fire together with her mother. Motorola and his wife Elena were married in Grushevka village in Crimea, at a time when he was already married Motorola's death has been met with threats of violent retaliation It was about two months before their marriage in July 2014, when she reportedly wore a handgun under her bridal gown, and also brandished a Kalashnikov. His death was being treated as a 'terrorist act' likely conducted by Kiev, said head of the rebel parliament in Donetsk, Denis Pushilin. Gevorg Mirzoyan, an expert from the Russian Government Financial University, said: 'Murdering Motorola is not one time shell fire. It is the liquidation of one of the best known field commanders of the DPR. 'And now Kremlin is in a hard position. On the one hand, Russia should not follow Poroshenko's plan to start a war. 'On the other, this murder cannot be left aside either by Donetsk, or by Moscow.' Pavlov was a veteran of fighting in Chechnya, it was reported.  Read more: 'Declaration of war' in Ukraine as pro-Russian rebel commander Arseniy 'Motorola' Pavlov is assassinated in Donetsk lift bombing Share or comment on this article e-mail 65 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Killer wife and lover speak out over fatal love triangle Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing 'Reality has a way of asserting itself!'

The budget airline has already broken the mould of transatlantic services by adopting the fuel-efficient long-haul Boeing 787 Dreamliner and running return services from £300 return out of Gatwick. The Boeing 737 Max is a super-efficient longer-range version of the 737, a workhorse of the European short-haul market. Its 4,000-mile range could be used to reach the east coast of the US.

REUTERS/Jim Young/File PhotoMore By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK (Reuters) - A new supplier of economy-class seats for Boeing Co's <BA.N> top-selling 737 jetliners has signed its first two airline customers, allowing it to begin production, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday. The agreements with Huntington Beach, California-based LIFT by EnCore, which are due to be announced as early as this week, are the first in which Boeing buys the seats from the supplier, known as "seller-furnished equipment," essentially guaranteeing they will arrive on time. With other seat makers, which include B/E Aerospace <BEAV.O> and Zodiac Aerospace <ZODC.PA>, airlines are required to buy the seats and have them delivered to aircraft factories, a process that has led to problems for the plane makers when seat deliveries are late. European plane maker Airbus <AIR.PA> made a similar move in 2015 when it chose German seat maker Recaro to supply seats for the A320 family. Recaro and LIFT are privately held. LIFT's initial orders will equip at least 50 of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft with seats designed for the Boeing 737 Sky Interior, with deliveries beginning in 2017, said the source, who could not be named because the negotiations are private. The airline customer names could not be learned. The deals for seats on Boeing's top-selling 737 show initial market acceptance and would allow LIFT to begin certification and production, the source said. Boeing's choice of LIFT as its sole seller-furnished seat supplier prompted drops in B/E Aerospace and Zodiac shares when the deal became public in April. Boeing currently has orders for 4,350 of its 737 jetliners. Boeing declined to comment on LIFT's orders, but said it is seeking new seat suppliers to solve capacity problems that have hampered its assembly lines in the past. "To bring more capacity into the market ... we are looking for and helping to develop more seat companies," Boeing spokeswoman Jessica Kowal said. Boeing shares were up 0.37 percent at $134.00 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Boeing also has been working with Chinese seat maker Ali-Jiatai, which delivered its first set of 737 seats to a Chinese airline over the summer, Kowal said. LIFT by EnCore, founded in 2011, has not delivered seats before. Founders Tom McFarland and Jim Downey sold their previous company, C&D Aerospace, to Zodiac in 2005. EnCore has produced galleys and other aircraft fixtures for customers such as Southwest Airlines.

Beranek in Symphony Hall in Boston in 2003. An expert in acoustics, he improved the sound in several concert venues. Credit Rick Friedman/Corbis, via Getty Images Leo L. Beranek, an engineer whose company designed the acoustics for the United Nations and concert halls at Lincoln Center and Tanglewood, then built the direct precursor to the internet under contract to the Defense Department, died on Oct. 10 at his home in Westwood, Mass. He was 102. His death was confirmed by his son James. Dr. Beranek taught acoustic engineering at Harvard and M.I.T. for more than three decades after World War II, conducting research there that laid the groundwork for acoustic advances with wide social impact, including noise standards for public buildings and airports. But one of his most notable achievements was well outside the field of acoustics. In 1969, the company he helped found, Bolt, Beranek & Newman, won a contract from the Defense Department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency to build the first computer-based network, which came to be called Arpanet. By demonstrating the ability to share data and messages through vast computer networks, Arpanet, a product of government-sponsored research, paved the way for the creation of the internet. Among its many breakthrough achievements, his company sent the first email message that used the @ symbol, in 1972. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. Beranek was a sought-after acoustics genius, and Bolt, Beranek & Newman’s first contract was to design the acoustics of the United Nations General Assembly Hall in New York. He also improved the acoustic environment in such landmark concert venues as the Koussevitzky Music Shed at the Tanglewood Music Center in Lenox, Mass., and Philharmonic Hall (now David Geffen Hall) at Lincoln Center in New York. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. Beranek’s most successful book, “Acoustics,” published in 1954, remains a textbook for acoustic engineering students around the world. From 1948 to 1958 he did work on noise control, creating standards that are used internationally today. “I looked into how quiet do spaces have to be to be pleasant for people,” he told an interviewer in 2009. “In other words, can you write a specification saying that if you’re going to have an office, the noise should not be any greater than so much? What are acceptable noise standards in a home, in a factory, in a concert hall? I wrote those.” At the advent of the jet age, Dr. Beranek’s work on noise control became a factor in the controversy over noise levels near the world’s airports when the Boeing 707 jet began flights to Europe from Idlewild (now Kennedy International) Airport in 1958. Despite claims by the airlines and Boeing that jets were no louder than propeller aircraft, Dr. Beranek’s tests showed otherwise, and the airlines were compelled to install mufflers on their jets and make steep climbs during takeoffs to control the noise levels. These standards were adopted around the world. Dr. Beranek was also a founder of a Boston television station, WCVB, and a major donor to arts institutions, including the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Leo Leroy Beranek was born on Sept 14, 1914, in Solon, Iowa. His mother died when he was 11. His father was a farmer and later an owner of a hardware and farm machinery store in Mount Vernon, Iowa. When he was a junior in high school, Dr. Beranek took a correspondence course on radio that sparked a love affair with the medium that lasted for the rest of his life. He opened a radio repair business as a high school senior and became known in Mount Vernon as “the radio man.” His business paid his tuition and living expenses at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, where he enrolled in fall 1931. He graduated with a degree in physics and mathematics in 1936. Advertisement Continue reading the main story During his senior year, a chance encounter outside the Mount Vernon town library changed his life. One afternoon, Dr. Beranek noticed a Cadillac with a flat tire stopped on the street. A middle-aged man emerged from the car, and Dr. Beranek offered to help him change the tire. He chatted with the grateful driver, Glenn Browning, a businessman from Massachusetts, who suggested he apply to Harvard for graduate studies in engineering. Mr. Browning had once taught at Harvard and offered himself as a reference. Dr. Beranek applied and was offered a full scholarship. With a master’s degree in physics and communication engineering from Harvard, he worked with a professor of acoustics, Frederick Hunt, and earned a doctorate in 1940. He became an assistant professor at Harvard that year and held that position until 1946. In 1943 Dr. Bernanek married Phyllis Knight. She died in 1982. He later married Gabriella Sohn, who survives him. Beside his son James, other survivors include another son, Thomas Beranek Haynes; two stepsons, and a granddaughter. During World War II, Dr. Beranek became director of Harvard’s Electroacoustic Lab, where he worked to improve voice communication with airplanes at the request of the military. Until then, voice communication from the ground to airplanes at high altitude was impossible. After the war, Dr. Beranek was recruited to teach at M.I.T., where he was named technical director of the engineering department’s acoustics laboratory. The administrative director of that lab was Richard Bolt, who later founded Bolt, Beranek & Newman with Dr. Beranek and Robert Newman, a former student of Dr. Bolt’s. The company was conceived as a center for leading-edge acoustic research. But Dr. Beranek changed its direction in the 1950s to include a focus on the nascent computer age. “As president, I decided to take B.B.N. into the field of man-machine systems because I felt acoustics was a limited field and no one seemed to be offering consulting services in that area,” Dr. Beranek said in a 2012 interview for this obituary. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He hired J.C.R. Licklider, a pioneering computer scientist from M.I.T., to lead the effort, and it was Dr. Licklider who persuaded him that the company needed to get involved in computers. Under Dr. Licklider, the company developed one of the best software research groups in the country and won many critical projects with the Department of Defense, NASA, the National Institutes of Health and other government agencies. Though Dr. Licklider left in 1962, the company became a favored destination for a new generation of software developers and was often referred to as the third university in Cambridge. “We bought our first digital computer from Digital Equipment Corporation, and with it we were able to attract some of the best minds from M.I.T. and Harvard, and this led to the ARPA contract to build the Arpanet,” Dr. Beranek said. “I never dreamed the internet would come into such widespread use, because the first users of the Arpanet were large mainframe computer owners,” he said. “This all changed when the personal computer became available. With the PC, I could see that computers were fun, and that is the real reason why all innovations come into widespread use.” Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.

The Rating Outlook is Stable. SECURITY The LOFT revenue bonds are secured by a six-cent levy per gallon of motor and other fuels sold in the county. Revenues are collected by the state and distributed to each county and its incorporated municipalities based on a distribution formula formalized in an inter-local agreement. KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrade of the county's IDR to 'AA+' from 'AA' reflects the application of Fitch's new 'U.S. Tax-Supported Rating Criteria' published on April 18, 2016 and specifically the county's strong operating performance including maintenance of high levels of reserves through the economic cycle supported by ample revenue and expenditure flexibility, and low combined liability burden of debt and pensions. Fitch expects the county's debt and pension liabilities to remain low going forward given limited debt plans, rapid amortization of existing debt, and participation in an adequately funded, state-administered pension plan. The rating upgrade to 'A+' from 'A' on the LOFT bonds reflects improved debt service coverage, negligible expected growth prospects, volatility of the pledged revenue stream but strong resilience through a moderate downturn scenario. The rating also reflects Fitch's expectation that LOFT revenues will not be leveraged to the 1.25x additional bonds test. Economic Resource Base The local economy is based on a diverse mix of aerospace, manufacturing, agriculture and tourism. The Kennedy Space Center (KSC) serves as both an area employment anchor and a tourist attraction. The presence of KSC, despite termination of the space shuttle program in 2011, and the county's highly trained workforce has stimulated the location of numerous aerospace and other technologically--related firms within the county. The aerospace industry within the county has been growing and expansions at Northrop Grumman, Boeing and Embraer are either planned or underway. Revenue Framework: 'aa' factor assessment Fitch expects county revenues to grow in line with inflation which is consistent with its slowly growing population and employment base. The county retains the legal ability to generate substantial additional revenues under its 10 mill property tax cap. Expenditure Framework: 'aa' factor assessment County expenditures cover a wide array of government services. Overall spending patterns are expected to align with future revenue growth. Management has significant expenditure flexibility through its partial control of headcount and moderate carrying costs, despite having made large spending cuts during the past recession. Long-Term Liability Burden: 'aaa' factor assessment The county's long-term liability burden that includes debt and net pension liability is modest at 4.2% of personal income. Fitch expects this metric to remain low given limited debt plans, rapid amortization of direct debt and adequate funding of the state-run pension plan. Operating Performance: 'aaa' factor assessment Management, through its considerable revenue and expenditure flexibility, is expected to maintain available reserves within a healthy 10% to 15% of expenditures through the economic cycle. RATING SENSITIVITIES CONTINUING STRUCTURAL BALANCE: Fitch expects that the county will maintain balanced operations at or above a level consistent with the rating. COVERAGE OF LOFT DEBT SERVICE: The rating on the LOFT bonds is sensitive to the level of debt service coverage provided by LOFT receipts. CREDIT PROFILE The county's economy was hit hard by the recession with employment falling by over 8% between 2006 and 2010 and unemployment rates topping 11% in 2011. Since 2011, economic activity has generally recovered but employment growth has been tepid, averaging 0.6% growth between 2010 and 2015. Factors which have hindered gains in employment include termination of the space shuttle in 2011, federal sequestration in 2013 and cutbacks in personnel in the county's schools, the largest employer. Unemployment rates have gradually declined since the 2011 peak and the May 2016 rate of 4.7% equaled those of the state and nation. Housing values declined by over 50% between mid-2006 and January 2012 according to the Zillow Group. Values have slowly risen since and were up 9.7% over the past 12 months but remain well below the pre-recession peak. Zillow projects a 4.5% increase in home values over the next year. The housing recovery has boosted the county's mostly residential tax base with steady growth since fiscal 2013. Revenue Framework Property taxes comprise the major source of general fund revenues and represented about 55% of total revenues and transfers in. Property tax revenues had declined both during and immediately after the recession as taxable values fell but, with the recovery of the tax base, have been on the upswing in recent years. Since fiscal 2012, the county has been gradually lowering its tax rate, tempering the rise in property taxes each year. Other major sources of revenue include intergovernmental revenues (17%) consisting mainly of state revenue sharing and half cent sales tax distributions and charges for county services (14.5%). Modest increases in county revenues are expected to continue going forward, in line with the county's slowly growing population and employment. This growth is anticipated to continue at a rate below U.S. GDP growth but consistent with inflation. The county's current tax rate of 5.47 mills allows for generation of substantial additional revenues under the state 10 mill property tax cap. Fitch estimates that the county could generate approximately $128 million in additional revenues if it chose to utilize the remaining property tax margin or about 60% of the fiscal 2016 general fund budget. Annual changes in the property tax rate are determined using a roll-back or revenue neutral rate, which is then adjusted for changes in the Florida per capita personal income. However, this limitation may be overridden by a super-majority or unanimous vote of the county board of commissioners. The county's charter limits the property tax levy such that budgeted revenues for the current fiscal year cannot increase by more than the lesser of 3% or CPI over budgeted revenues in the prior year. This limit can also be overridden by a supermajority vote of the commissioners but only on a finding of an emergency or critical need. Taxable property classified as new construction and other improvements are excluded from the calculation. The county also has the ability to increase various license and permit revenues and service charges that make up a smaller but still notable portion of its revenue base. Expenditure Framework The county provides a full array of government services to its citizens with the exception of primary education, which is provided by the county school board. Public safety represents the largest general fund expenditure item at 44% of the budget and includes policing activity and detention/correction operations. Fire rescue operations are reported in a separate emergency services fund. Public safety spending fell through fiscal 2012 but has since increased steadily through fiscal 2015. Over the long term, county spending has generally been in line with revenue growth. This trend is expected to continue in the future as service needs continue to grow modestly. During the recession, in response to significant revenue declines, county management scaled back spending utilizing layoffs, furlough days and across the board budgetary cuts. As a result, general fund spending fell by 20% between fiscals 2008 and 2012. Spending has since steadily increased by a cumulative 9% through fiscal 2015. The county retains significant cost cutting flexibility through its ability to temporarily control employee headcount and compensation. Officials have indicated that available measures to trim spending include layoffs, service level reductions, operating hour reductions and reducing employer contributions for health insurance. Carrying costs are moderate at about 12% of spending. Long-Term Liability Burden The county's long-term liability burden includes both debt and pension liabilities and is modest at 4.2% of personal income. This ratio is not expected to change substantially going forward given limited debt issuance plans and adequate pension funding levels. Debt levels are generally modest with total debt to personal income of 3.3%. Outstanding bonds consist primarily of limited ad valorem tax bonds and revenue bonds, including sales tax and various gas tax-secured bonds. The county has no unlimited tax general obligation bonds outstanding. Amortization of direct debt is rapid with over 70% of principal retired within the next 10 years. The county's five year capital improvement plan includes a manageable $370 million of projects of which almost 70% are attributable to enterprise operations. There are no firm plans for additional bonds. County employees participate in the Florida Retirement System (FRS), a statewide multiple employer cost sharing pension program. FRS is adequately funded with an 85.9% funding ratio as of June 30, 2015, based on Fitch's adjusted discount rate of 7%. The county's adjusted proportionate share of FRS net pension liability constitutes a modest 0.9% of personal income. Operating Performance County management has demonstrated its ability to adjust both revenues and spending when faced with economically driven downturns in revenues. To offset revenue declines experienced between fiscals 2010 and 2012, county officials trimmed spending by 15% while also raising tax rates and utilizing some fund balance to maintain operations. Fitch believes the county would continue to utilize its budgetary flexibility and solid reserves to offset the effects of a moderate recession-driven decline while maintaining reserves above the county's 10% minimum target. The county is expected to maintain available reserves within the range of 10% to 15% of spending as has been the case in the recent past. Fiscal 2015 general fund operations reported a modest surplus of about $3 million, raising unrestricted fund balance to $29 million or a healthy 11.9% of spending. Fiscal 2016 operations are expected to result in a modest surplus of about $1.7 million. LOFT Bonds Upgraded The rating upgrade to 'A+' from 'A' on the LOFT bonds reflects improved debt service coverage, slow expected growth prospects, historic volatility of the pledged revenue stream and strong resilience through a moderate downturn scenario. The rating also reflects Fitch's expectation that LOFT revenues will not be leveraged to the 1.25x additional bonds test. Pledged LOFT revenues consist of revenues received by the county from the first six cents of the local option fuel tax levied per net gallon on motor fuel sold within the county pursuant to Section 336.025(1)(a), Florida Statues. The state collects the LOFT and distributes it back to the county and its municipalities in accordance with an inter-local agreement between the county and municipalities within the county; however, the rating on the LOFT bonds is not tied to that of the county's IDR. Under the existing inter-local agreement, LOFT proceeds are allocated 50% based on population and 50% based on transportation expenditures made over the preceding five years. The county's share of LOFT distributions must be at least 47.14% of total county distributions. The inter-local agreement expires in 2037 coincident with the final maturity of the bonds. LOFT collections increased by over 25% in fiscal 2012 due to the installation of 24 large (6.3 million gallons) diesel storage tanks at Port Canaveral. Revenues were essentially flat in fiscals 2013 and 2014 but grew by 6.2% in fiscal 2015. Year-to-date (YTD) collections were up 10% from last fiscal year although the difference at the end of the fiscal year may narrow as a large true-up payment in September 2015 may not be repeated in 2016. Fitch expects more modest growth in LOFT revenues in the future. To evaluate the sensitivity of the LOFT to cyclical decline, Fitch considers both modeled revenue sensitivity results (using the same 1% decline in national GDP scenario that supports assessments in the IDR framework) and the largest decline in revenues over the period covered by the revenue sensitivity analysis. Based on the 14-year pledged revenue history FAST generates a 5% scenario decline in pledged revenues and the largest actual cumulative decline in historical revenues is a 6.5% decline in fiscal year 2008. Based on LOFT revenue of $9.5 million in fiscal 2015 which cover maximum annual debt service (MADS) by 1.63x, Fitch estimates the structure could tolerate a 38% drop in revenue which is 7.8x the scenario results and 6x the largest actual revenue decline in the review period. These results are consistent with an 'aa' level of coverage cushion. Assuming leverage to the 1.25x ABT, the scenario results are mixed. However, management has indicated that it has no intention of further leverage of the revenue stream. LOFT revenues in excess of debt service are used to fund pay-as-you-go road projects.

Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Lockheed, others in fray to supply single-engine jets to India There are primarily three manufacturers of these single-engine fighter jets which could be in the race – Lockheed Martin which manufacture the F-16’s, Boeing which makes Super Hornets and Swedish Saab that manufactures Gripen. Post Your Comments Share Cancel | 1 Comments Ronojoy Banerjee (more) Reporter, CNBC-TV18 | After signing the Rafale deal India has kick-started its process to acquire single-engine fighter jets. Last week the Ministry of Defence had issued request information for acquiring single-engine fighter jets. India is looking to acquire these jets to replace their old warhorse the MIG-21’s. Rafale jets are double-engine jets. There are primarily three manufacturers of these single-engine fighter jets who could be in the race – Lockheed Martin which manufactures the F-16’s, Boeing which makes Super Hornets and Swedish Saab that manufactures Gripen. CNBC-TV18 learns from sources that a team from Lockheed Martin in the US will be in India to meet senior officials at the defence ministry. They have also sought a meeting with the Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and hope to meet officials in the Prime Minister’s office as well. During these meetings the company will suggest manufacturing the F-16’s in India. They are also likely to state that once India’s requirements are met, then with government approval in future, they would be willing to export these to other countries and thereby make India and export hub for the company. If this happens, it could give a big boost to the local suppliers. However, a similar promise is likely to be made by Saab too – they have already said that they are willing to shift their manufacturing base to India. Boeing, too, is expected to make similar promises. Tags  Ministry of Defence Rafael deal F-16’s Super Hornets Boeing Swedish Saab Gripen Buy, Hold, Sell ?

The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 40 points, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most gains. The S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent, with energy rising approximately 1.4 percent to lead advancers. The energy sector had traded more than 2 percent higher earlier in the session, after the Energy Information Administration reported a 5.3 million crude oil drawdown. West Texas Intermediate futures for November delivery rose 2.6 percent to settle at $51.60 per barrel. "It's a combination of energy rising and better-than-expected earnings," said Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify Investments. "We're just riding that right now." The Nasdaq composite closed less than 0.1 percent higher. Earnings season carried on Wednesday, with eight of the 13 S&P components that posted results this morning beating Wall Street estimates, according to Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout. Morgan Stanley, Abbott Labs and BB&T were among the companies that exceeded expectations on both earnings per share and revenue. Morgan Stanley continued the trend of big banks beating forecasts on strong performances from trading. Dow component Intel also reported better-than-expected results Tuesday afternoon, but its stock fell nearly 6 percent on light revenue guidance. Companies scheduled to report are eBay, American Express and Mattel, among others. Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. In economic news, The Fed released the latest iteration of its so-called Beige Book, which summarizes economic conditions in the U.S. In it, the Fed said economic activity increased at a modest pace in most regions. "The report failed to move the needle in any way. This was as much an in-line report as we've had," said Adam Sarhan, CEO of Sarhan Capital. The Beige Book was expected to garner more attention than usual as investors search for more clues about when the central bank will raise interest rates. "Some of the economic news we've gotten has been pretty mixed, but it's been mostly good," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. Cardillo added he expects the Fed to raise rates in December. Other economic data released Wednesday included housing start and permits for September. Housing starts fell 9 percent last month, but permits spiked 6.3 percent. Also, U.S. mortgage applications rose 0.6 last week, as higher rates did not deter buyers. "The bizarre plunge in multi family starts is inexplicable but the rise in permits says it was an outlier," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note. Elsewhere in the economic calendar, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said the Fed can be patient and raise interest rates gradually. New York Fed President William Dudley is also scheduled to speak Wednesday. San Francisco Fed President John Williams also spoke, but did not comment on monetary policy. Market participants will also keep an eye on the U.S. presidential election, with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump scheduled to hold their third and final debate before the election. Clinton currently hold a double-digit lead over Trump, according to an NBC/ Wall Street Journalpoll released Sunday. "Tonight's debate offers Donald Trump one of his last opportunities to make a dent in the apparently insurmountable lead enjoyed by Hillary Clinton," said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, in a note. "With the former Secretary of State starting to pack her bags for the White House, I doubt that the E-Minis will move much overnight during the broadcast." "The election balloon is shrinking as we head into the third debate," said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management. He also said he expects the market to rally towards the end of the year. " People are going to be happy the election will be over, and that 's going to give them confidence." U.S. Treasurys were mixed, with the two-year note yield lower around 0.80 percent and the 10-year yield higher at 1.75 percent. The U.S. dollar traded flat to higher against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.097 and the yen around 103.4. Overseas, European stocks traded mostly higher, with the Stoxx 600 index rising 0.34 percent. In Asia, stocks closed mixed, with the Nikkei 225 rising 0.2 percent and the Hang Seng index falling 0.38 percent.

(U.S. Army photo/Brian Harris) Posted By: Richard Sisk October 19, 2016 AH-64 Apache helicopter gunships have been flying combat missions in support of the Iraqi security forces in the advance from the south on Mosul, a U.S. general said Wednesday. “They’ve been flying at night, supporting any nighttime operations that the Iraqis are doing” since the Mosul offensive started Monday, Army Maj. Gen. Gary Volesky said of the Boeing Co.-made helicopters in a video briefing from Baghdad to the Pentagon. “That platform has a lot of capability to see a long range at night and use its weapons system in a stand-off capacity to strike targets, and that’s what they’re doing,” said Volesky, commander of Combined Joint Forces Land Component Command-Operation Inherent Resolve, as well as commander of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault). The use of the Apaches had been an open question as the long-awaited push to retake Mosul began with coordinated advances from the south by the Iraqi security forces and from the east by Kurdish Peshmerga forces. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi had barred use of the Apaches in previous campaigns to retake Ramadi and Fallujah in Anbar province. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, on Tuesday said the Apaches were ready to join the fight but he could not confirm that they had gone into action. Apache helicopters have been in Iraq since the U.S. began the buildup against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in the summer of 2014 but they have been used sparingly, mostly to provide added security for visiting dignitaries in Baghdad.

Fuller Montana's Billings Flying Service, Inc. owns and operates a fleet of Boeing CH-47D Chinooks among its Bell Helicopter rotorcraft. The Chinooks are now nearing maximum flight hours allowed before service is needed, according to local news reports. Billings Flying Service would like to build its own hangar to perform services, but have been met with hurdles. After a lawsuit was filed and settled by surrounding property owners who feared too much noise and one zone change was approved earlier this year, a second zone change was required. It has recently been approved and should allow Billings Flying Service to proceed with construction and operation of its hangar. The company became the first civilian operator to type-certify the Chinook with the FAA in 2014, using them for firefighting and construction projects. Since then, the Chinooks have been fighting fires in multiple states. Widespread need for its capabilities this past summer led to the need for service. The Boeing CH-47 has the ability to lift up to 26,000 pounds. Billings Flying Service has its fleet fitted with three cargo hooks and a fire bucket, among other configurations.

Chief Executive Officer Peter Bellew said fare cuts aimed at boosting passenger numbers on Kuala Lumpur-London flights are bearing fruit, with the carrier’s market share up 9 percentage points in the past 11 weeks. The Asian company, which saw passenger confidence slump after two fatal crashes in 2014, now accounts for 53 per cent of traffic between the two cities, up from 40 per cent as recently as May, Bellew, who took over on July 1, said in an interview. British Airways has a 20 per cent market share, he said. Malaysia Air has begun selling return tickets between Kuala Lumpur and London for as little as £399 (RM2,052), undercutting BA by 4 to 5 per cent, Bellew said. It offers 2,000 seats a day on two Airbus Group SE A380 flights, versus about 500 at the UK carrier, which has a single Boeing Co. 787 service. Gulf carriers control about 7 per cent of the market, with 3 per cent of people travelling via Singapore, according to the CEO, who joined the company as chief operating officer in 2015 after spending nine years working under Ryanair Holdings Plc CEO Michael O’Leary. Malaysia Air is seeking to stimulate bookings after seeing demand collapse following 2014’s tragedies, when one jetliner vanished after veering off course and another was shot down over a war zone. Under Bellew, the carrier is revamping its fares to sell fewer bargain-basement tickets and offer less of a range between the highest and lowest prices, while discounting in strategically important markets such as the UK Business boost Even though BA is countering the price cuts, Malaysia Air, which is seeking to return to profit in 2018, will take whatever steps are necessary to remain “price leader” on the London route, the CEO said. British Airways said in response to Bellew’s remarks that it “successfully relaunched” daily services between its Heathrow hub and Kuala Lumpur in May 2015, while adding that it cannot disclose performance figures for individual routes because such information is “commercially sensitive”. Business-class bookings for flights next year on Malaysia Air’s Asian routes are showing a strong increase, and the carrier remains committed to retaining a premium offering even as low-cost specialists led by local rival AirAsia Bhd. expand, Bellew said. A further increase of 4 or 5 percentage points in the business-class load factor would allow the operation to break even in the fourth quarter of 2017 even with declining fares, he said. The domestic Firefly unit, which operates a fleet of 12 Avions de Transport Regional ATR 72 turboprops, will be brought closer to the main airline by admitting it to the the Enrich frequent flyer programme, making tickets interchangeable and more closely aligning fares, the executive said. Bellew said that Malaysia Air plans to add as many as five or six new routes to China from a shortlist of nine, with the first set to be announced before the end of November. The move will help deepen the carrier’s exposure to the outbound Chinese tourism market, with aircraft operating directly to resort destinations such as Penang and Kota Kinabalu, he said. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Nepal PM phones India’s Modi over rupee chaos Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to ‘fake’ news sites European equities drift higher United to delay taking Boeing jets in US$4.8b savings push Macau sets US$25b gaming target for 2017 below estimates Oil slumps as prospect of Trump victory roils global markets Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Malaysia growth push stymied by banks cautious on loans US stocks decline after rally as election takes centre stage BNM: Ringgit fell against most world currencies in third quarter Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Groin-flashing frog discovered in Australia An in-depth look at Mazda’s SKYACTIV-G engine Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Related Articles Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Malaysia Airlines bets on China, eyes 2019 IPO target More Malaysia-China flights to woo Chinese tourists First MAS GM dies at 81 MAS to fly to Kota Kinabalu, Kuching from Penang starting Nov 18 Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

 Wall Street is making a mistake about Ford CEO Mark Fields' plans for the future Matthew DeBord Oct. 17, 2016, 11:55 AM 4,363 facebook linkedin twitter email print Ford CEO Mark Fields.Ford See Also Ford Is Having A Bad Week, GM Is Having A Great One The Man Who Saved Ford From Bankruptcy May Retire Early Ford is buying Y Combinator shuttle-van startup Chariot in an all-cash deal Sales up, stock down. That's the reality at Ford these days, as the automaker has ridden a wave of recovering pickup truck and SUV sales, bouncing back from the darkest days of the Great Recession when General Motors and Chrysler — the other two members of the Detroit Big Three — went bankrupt. Ford shares, meanwhile, have slid 15% since the beginning of the year. The Wall Street Journal is starting to suggest that it might be CEO Mark Fields' fault.  Ford was famously rescued, without a government bailout or Chapter 11, by Alan Mulally, a former Boeing executive who took over at Ford before the financial crisis, quickly borrowed $25 billion, and articulated a "One Ford" plan that unified the entire company. The WSJ reported that since Fields took over in 2014, Ford has been headed toward a pivot under his leadership: to "Two Fords," one committed to the so-called "core" business of making and selling cars; the other seeking to establish Ford as a player in the future of mobility. Fields didn't just come to this realization — he's been pressing the idea at least for two years, but his efforts have intensified as many once-fanciful automotive technologies have gotten close to hitting the streets. Self-driving cars. Long-range electric vehicles. Vast ride-sharing services. Uber and Lyft are providing an alternative the the auto-industry's bedrock ownership model, and Detroit is starting to invest serious money in a Silicon-Valley powered vision of how we should get around. GM put $500 million into Lyft and bought Cruise Automation, a self-driving startup, while Ford just bought Chariot, a Bay Area van service and invested in a laser-radar company, Velodyne, to push autonomous tech forward. Back to basics? The assumption appears to be that Ford is getting out of its depth, away from basics, and that the markets want to see a return to the Mulally message: keep it simple. But it's not clear that if Fields jettisoned the futuristic talk, the markets would view Ford any more favorably. For years, the automaker has done nothing but sell highly profitable trucks and SUVs — and lots of them. And the stock has gone nowhere. (It was trading at $12 on Monday.) A tough year.Google Finance Practically speaking, Wall Street looks to be pricing in an auto downturn at some point in the next 12 months, at least predicting that there won't be additional sales growth in the US market, which set a record last year as 17.5 million vehicles rolled off dealer lots. But besides that, Fields hasn't really abandoned One Ford in any meaningful way. In fact, he can claim substantial credit for inspiring One Ford. Prior to Mulally's arrival in Dearborn, Fields came up with a plan he called the "Way Forward," which Mulally used as a basis for One Ford. It's more accurate to say that Fields is working to diversify One Ford so that Mulally's message can be flexibly applied to new opportunities, now that Ford isn't posting record quarterly losses. And he truly doesn't have a choice. There's agreement in the auto industry that although the traditional business is great, there's a major transformation afoot, and that anyone who ignores it to focus on the bottom line could get steamrolled. Fields saw Ford through the greatest crisis in its history. He isn't one to flirt with going there again.

Brown Norm Rothery Jason Heath Home Investing What Trump could mean for your portfolio What Trump could mean for your portfolio It makes for great TV. But for investors, the election is unnerving. Here’s how it could affect the markets   1 by Bryan Borzykowski October 17th, 2016 Online only.   1 Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email U.S. elections are known for their outsized hyperbole, but once the ballots are cast any lingering concerns about what it could mean for Canada-U.S. trade typically dissipate. But this is not your typical U.S. election. Canadian investors anxiously awaiting the outcome are smartly asking what it could mean for their portfolios. There is no shortage of bravado in the prognostications about what a Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton win would mean for the markets. Mark Cuban, tech entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, is convinced a Trump win would plunge stock markets and upend the bond market, should he find a way to follow through on a plan to renegotiate the U.S. national debt. Whereas Marc Faber, a respected market voice and author of the “Gloom, Boom & Doom Report”, cautions Clinton’s US$1 trillion tax hike “will destroy the whole world.” As divergent as these viewpoints are, the takeaway is clear: The outcome of the U.S. election will impact your money. Depending on who gets into the Oval Office, our economy, and our portfolios, could be in for a wild ride, even if it’s much less dramatic than the destruction of the world. If you’re looking for prognostications, there are hundreds—mostly in the event of a Republican win. Some have even the 13% run up in the S&P/TSX Composite this year is due in part to large U.S. investors positioning their portfolios in the event of a Trump win. Here’s a sample: Invest in companies that are sensitive to exchange rates like Dollarama and Baytex, because a Trump win would put pressure on the U.S. dollar and lift the loonie. Buy Lockheed Martin Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp. and Boeing Co., as they’d benefit from increased defence spending. Be on the lookout for The GEO Group, the private prison real estate investment trust, which would likely be an important cog in Trump’s pledge to round up and deport illegal immigrants. And lastly don’t forget Cemex, the Mexican cement company—because if they’re going to pay for the wall, then they aren’t going to buy American. For the political neophyte, reality TV has never been so captivating. For investors, it’s unnerving. If you’re rooting—or cringing—on the sidelines, Clinton is the better bet for your portfolio. Trump is such a divisive figure that markets around the world will likely experience more volatility under his watch, says Stephen Lingard, a portfolio manager with Franklin Templeton Solutions. The former First Lady, on the other hand, represents the status quo. Expect volatility if Trump beats the odds » Before you start altering your portfolio, here is a look at some of the larger ways a Clinton or Trump win would affect Canadian portfolios. Let’s start with Trump. Trump on trade Trump is trying to capitalize on a populist anti-trade sentiment in the U.S.  The Republican Presidential nominee’s feelings for the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the North American Free Trade Agreement is clear, repeatedly saying he would love to tear them up. At least when it comes to the TPP, Clinton and Trump appear to be somewhat on the same page. The Democratic Presidential Nominee agrees the TPP has its flaws, even though she once supported it, and now pledges to renegotiate the agreement if elected. Trade is the issue that will impact us the most, says Lingard. The North American economy has more than doubled in size since NAFTA was signed in 1994. According to Global Affairs Canada, “NAFTA has had an overwhelmingly positive effect on the Canadian economy,” and its increased trilateral trade within North American from $288 billion in 1993 to more than $1 trillion in 2015. If NAFTA changed in any significant way, Lingard says it could send Canada into a recession. Scrapping the TPP may not plunge Canada into recession since the agreement isn’t in force, but it could hobble future growth. In September, André Downs, chief economist at the department of Global Affairs Canada, said that the TPP would expand economic output by $4.3 billion thanks to increased access to hard-to-tap markets like Japan. Crossing the border could be harder under Trump » A Trump win would be positive for Canadian stocks Beyond trade, though, the differences between the two candidates are much more pronounced. Matthew Barasch a Canadian equity strategist at RBC Capital Markets, goes as far to say that Trump presidency would be good for Canada. Barasch zeros in on Trump’s tax cuts. “The broad cuts of the magnitude that Mr. Trump is calling for would most likely provide a big boost to the U.S. economy, at least for a period of time, and considering that the U.S. remains by far Canada’s largest trading partner, the flow through to Canadian growth would likely be fairly meaningful,” he writes in a note to clients. Are low interest rates doing more harm than good? If you are willing to put your portfolio before the environment then Trump is good news again. Barasch argues that Trump’s energy policy would be another positive for Canada. Trump is a major proponent of Keystone, a pipeline that would likely spur investment in the oil sands. Iran becomes another wildcard under a Trump presidency. “Should the nuclear agreement with Iran be jeopardized in any way and thus Iranian barrels be put at risk, the positive impact on oil prices could be significant,” writes Barasch in his note. On the flip side, Trump’s plan would reduce federal revenues by $9.5 trillion over 10 years, and that would require the government to massively reduce spending, which could negatively affect Americans, according to the Tax Policy Center. Will markets rally around Clinton? If Clinton gets elected, not much would change, says Bob Sewell, president and CEO of Oakville’s Bellwether Investment Management, though one policy that could impact Canadian health care companies is her desire to cap drug pricing. She’s also said that she’s against Keystone XL, but that she does want North America to invest more in clean energy, which our Prime Minister has expressed an interest in as well. Healthcare stocks might fall under Clinton, while energy companies and defence operations could see gains under Trump. It’s worth noting that overall, markets have done better under a Democrat president than a Republican one. On average, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has a 7% annualized return under a Democrat leader, while it’s only grown by 3% annualized under a Republican, according to Bespoke Investment Group. All that said, it’s likely that stocks will see more ups and downs as the election draws nearer, and especially if the race tightens even further, says Sewell. He’s getting more cautious and says that now’s not the time to be taking any sort of substantial risks. “Reduce your beta, reduce the volatility of your equity holdings and keep more cash in your pocket,” he says.   Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email Advertisement Advertisement    Show comments Hide comments (1) One comment on “What Trump could mean for your portfolio” Too many grammatical or spelling errors Reply ↓ Don Dutton on October 17, 2016 at 4:09 pm Leave a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Business Home LBoard COMMENT Is Zaid angling for a run as MP? Scott Ng Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Malaysia Airlines soars with London fare cuts FMT Reporters | October 19, 2016 Market share on Kuala Lumpur-London route has increased by 9 per cent in past 11 weeks, CEO Peter Bellow tells Bloomberg. KUALA LUMPUR: The fare reductions introduced by Malaysia Airlines for its Kuala Lumpur-London route is bearing fruit. Malaysia Airlines Bhd Chief Executive Officer Peter Bellew told Bloomberg the carrier’s market share had increased by 9 per cent in the past 11 weeks. Malaysia Airlines is selling return tickets between Kuala Lumpur and London for as little as 399 pounds (RM2,055), undercutting British Airways (BA) by 4 to 5 per cent. Bellew said it offered 2,000 seats a day on two Airbus Group SE A380 flights, versus about 500 at the UK carrier, which has a single Boeing Co 787 service. Passenger confidence slumped after two fatal crashes in 2014, but business has picked up since for Malaysia Airlines. It now accounts for 53 per cent of traffic between Kuala Lumpur and London, up from 40 per cent as recently as May. Bellew, who took over on July 1, told Bloomberg in an interview that BA had a 20 per cent market share. Gulf carriers control about 7 per cent of the market, with 3 per cent of people travelling via Singapore. Under Bellew, the carrier is revamping its fares to sell fewer bargain-basement tickets and offer less of a range between the highest and lowest prices, while discounting in strategically important markets such as the UK. Noting that BA was countering the price cuts, Bellew said Malaysia Airlines, which is seeking to return to profit in 2018, would take necessary measures to remain the “price leader” on the London route. British Airways said, in response to Bellew’s remarks, that it had “successfully relaunched” daily services between its Heathrow hub and Kuala Lumpur in May 2015. It said it could not disclose performance figures for individual routes because such information was “commercially sensitive,” Bloomberg reported. Business-class bookings for flights next year on Malaysia Airlines’ Asian routes were showing a strong increase, Bellew said. A further increase of 4 or 5 percentage points in the business-class load factor would allow the operation to break even in the fourth quarter of 2017 even with declining fares, he told Bloomberg.

Chief Executive Officer Peter Bellew said fare cuts aimed at boosting passenger numbers on Kuala Lumpur-London flights are bearing fruit, with the carrier’s market share up 9 percentage points in the past 11 weeks. The Asian company, which saw passenger confidence slump after two fatal crashes in 2014, now accounts for 53 percent of traffic between the two cities, up from 40 percent as recently as May, Bellew, who took over on July 1, said in an interview. British Airways has a 20 percent market share, he said. Peter Bellew. Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg Malaysia Air has begun selling return tickets between Kuala Lumpur and London for as little as 399 pounds ($491), undercutting BA by 4 to 5 percent, Bellew said. It offers 2,000 seats a day on two Airbus Group SE A380 flights, versus about 500 at the U.K. carrier, which has a single Boeing Co. 787 service. Gulf carriers control about 7 percent of the market, with 3 percent of people traveling via Singapore, according to the CEO, who joined the company as chief operating officer in 2015 after spending nine years working under Ryanair Holdings Plc CEO Michael O’Leary. Malaysia Air is seeking to stimulate bookings after seeing demand collapse following 2014’s tragedies, when one jetliner vanished after veering off course and another was shot down over a war zone. Under Bellew, the carrier is revamping its fares to sell fewer bargain-basement tickets and offer less of a range between the highest and lowest prices, while discounting in strategically important markets such as the U.K. Business Boost Even though BA is countering the price cuts, Malaysia Air, which is seeking to return to profit in 2018, will take whatever steps are necessary to remain “price leader” on the London route, the CEO said. British Airways said in response to Bellew’s remarks that it “successfully relaunched” daily services between its Heathrow hub and Kuala Lumpur in May 2015, while adding that it cannot disclose performance figures for individual routes because such information is “commercially sensitive.” Business-class bookings for flights next year on Malaysia Air’s Asian routes are showing a strong increase, and the carrier remains committed to retaining a premium offering even as low-cost specialists led by local rival AirAsia Bhd. expand, Bellew said. A further increase of 4 or 5 percentage points in the business-class load factor would allow the operation to break even in the fourth quarter of 2017 even with declining fares, he said. The domestic Firefly unit, which operates a fleet of 12 Avions de Transport Regional ATR 72 turboprops, will be brought closer to the main airline by admitting it to the the Enrich frequent flyer program, making tickets interchangeable and more closely aligning fares, the executive said. Bellew said that Malaysia Air plans to add as many as five or six new routes to China from a shortlist of nine, with the first set to be announced before the end of November. The move will help deepen the carrier’s exposure to the outbound Chinese tourism market, with aircraft operating directly to resort destinations such as Penang and Kota Kinabalu, he said.

The push in the personal transportation sector is strong, with all major manufacturers like Ford, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes, and GM (among others) all pushing their own hybrid and electric technology in next-level cars. Eventually, there won’t be a car on the road that has a fuel-powered drivetrain, but what the mass transportation sector? I’m not talking about your municipal public transportation service; no, I’m talking about long-distance travel or, more specifically, airplanes. You can look really hard, but you won’t find any in-service hybrid or electrical planes, but if NASA has its way, all that will change soon enough. How you ask? Well, the U.S. Government’s space agency has recently announced its newest facility – NASA’s Electric Aircraft Testbed (NEAT) – where engineers will design, develop, and test electric aircraft. That’s right! NASA is officially designing and testing all-electric aircraft. Things are still in the early stages, however, so don’t expect to board an all-electric Boeing anytime soon. But, NEAT ran its first test last September in which 600 volts of electricity to test an electric power system that was large enough to power a small, one- or two-person aircraft. “As large airline companies compete to reduce emissions, fuel burn, noise and maintenance costs, it is expected that more of their aircraft systems will shift to using electrical power,” Said Dr. Rodger Dyson – Technical Lead of NASA Glenn Hybrid Gas Propulsion. “What we’re hoping to learn now is how to make it more efficient and light-weight. Next year we’re going to upgrade the size of these motors – we’ll use the same technology to test the higher-power stuff next.” For now, NEAT is just in the beginning stages, but give it time and it will be a “world-class, reconfigurable testbed” that will be able to create and test systems rated at over 20 Megawatts of power – the massive amount of electrical energy it will take to propel a large passenger aircraft like the Boeing 747, for example. Note: The image above shows two engineers conducting the first test of an electric aircraft engine at NEAT Keep reading for the rest of the story. continue reading Source: NASA An Electrified Future is Coming Think about what you just read for a moment. Just 30 years ago, the concept of even electrical cars was dismissed fairly quickly. Fast forward to today, and we have electric cars buzzing around, and gaining momentum in the public eye every day. 30 years from now your children, or maybe even grandchildren, could be traveling across the country in an all-electric airplane that produces zero emissions. On a side note, I can’t help but think about how NEAT could implement solar power into these electric aircraft. Once it gets the point of testing larger, all-electric aircraft, I wouldn’t be surprised if we started seeing large jets layered in solar panels, potentially preventing the need to ever charge the aircraft. That is, of course, assuming we can manage to harness that much energy from the sun. Either way, electric transportation isn’t going away, and NEAT is making the first crucial strides in bringing electrification to aviation. Photo Credit: NASA What is your take?

Yinyi and Impro are major China-based companies employing thousands of people in operations around the world. People close to an ongoing auction of Doncasters, which is being handled by Goldman Sachs, said the Chinese companies' expressions of interest were tentative and may not lead to formal offers. Goldman is in the process of narrowing the field of bidders into a second round, they said. Midlands-based Doncasters, which traces its roots back to 1778, specialises in working with metals and alloys that are difficult to shape, and employs more than 5,000 people. It is expected to fetch well over £1bn from a sale and potentially as much as £1.5bn. If they do proceed with formal offers, the Chinese groups would be pitted against interest from private equity firms including Blackstone, Carlyle and Clayton Dubilier & Rice. One factor mitigating against any possible concern from the UK Government about Chinese ownership is that Doncasters is already in the hands of foreign backers; since 2006, it has been part of the portfolio of Dubai International Capital, a private investment vehicle of the emirate's ruling family which is now being wound down. In the three months since Theresa May entered Downing Street, a number of cross-border deals involving British companies have prompted suggestions from Downing Street that new scrutiny will be applied to foreign takeovers. Last week, it was reported that the Prime Minister wanted to introduce a new vetting system for such transactions in a bid "to get the best deal" for Britain, although no details have emerged about how such a regime would operate. Prospective deals involving Chinese investment into data centre operator Global Switch, Sheffield Forgemasters, a steel supplier to the UK's nuclear submarines, and the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station have sparked opposition from some parts of Whitehall. Doncasters supplies both the civil and military aerospace markets, although there is no suggestion that ministers would seek to block a takeover by a privately-owned Chinese company. In 2014, the British manufacturer made underlying pre-tax profit of about £136m, roughly flat on the previous year. Its accounts for 2015 are expected to be filed at Companies House shortly. A spokeswoman for Doncasters declined to comment.

File N&O photo i LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Wegmans giveaway I strongly urge our Chapel Hill/Orange County leaders to reconsider their proposed $4 million “giveaway” to Wegmans. They call it an incentive, but it’s clearly a giveaway. There is absolutely no need to lure a luxury grocery chain to a well-known, wealthy, “foodie” town. They’ve done their market research – they already want to come here. And our leaders’ other rationales for the incentives are flawed as well. Why incentivize low-paying, part-time jobs that offer no benefits? Save those dollars for the businesses we really need to attract – ones that offer real living wages and benefits that support a middle-class lifestyle. No new business is going to be created. Don’t we already have more than enough luxury grocery stores? Within an easy drive of the Wegman’s proposed location we have Whole Foods, Southern Season, Fresh Market, and Weaver Street. Even Harris Teeter has upped their game over the years. Existing businesses who have proven to be good citizens of the community will only see their pieces of the upscale food market shrink. If our leaders still think it’s a good idea to spend $4 million of local taxpayer dollars on a grocery store, spend them where it will actually do some good in this town. Use the money they foolishly want to give away to a store that’s probably going to build here anyway to fund incentives that will finally lure a full-service grocery store to the food desert that is downtown and slightly to its north. Jack and Jo Vest Chapel Hill 4 reasons to have voted no I don’t agree with the Town Council decision. 1) Subsidizing Wegmans is not fair to the other five grocery stores (Whole Foods, Trader Joes, Harris Teeter, Food Lion, and Fresh Market) in Chapel Hill. 2) If Chapel Hill leaders are going to subsidize a business, it should be one we don’t already have and one who pays their employees a wage that permits them to actually live in Chapel Hill. 3) Money should go to things we need ... like affordable housing and building a park on the Legion Road property. 4) Wegmans built stores in Cary without subsidies from Cary. Ken Larsen via Facebook For a grocery store? I have long supported bribes, er, incentives because that is how the game is played. A lack of incentives and for many years, an unwillingness to even consider them has meant no automobile plant and no aircraft plant while places like Other Carolina and Alabama plucked corporate gems like BMW, Airbus, Mercedes-Benz, Boeing and others. Those things generate permanent economic multipliers far in excess of the original spending. But $4 million? Or any amount of money. To lure a Wegmans? A grocery store? No, seriously? Dave Thompson via chapelhillnews.com An oasis of fru-fru Can we not? The Chapel Hill-Carrboro area is already overstuffed and catered-to already. We have: ▪ 2 Weaver Street Markets ▪ 4 Harris Teeters ▪ 2 Food Lions ▪ 1 Fresh Market ▪ 1 Trader Joe’s ▪ 1 Whole Foods ▪ 1 Southern Season ▪ 1 Lowe’s Foods ▪ 1 Super Walmart ▪ several ethnic markets ▪ farmer’s markets all week long, and ▪ a Target coming to downtown Franklin in 2017 It’s not an embarrassment of riches. It’s an embarassment. When I first got to town in 2006, I worked at the IFC Men’s Shelter & Community Kitchen as a social worker. To stay physically busy, I worked in the kitchen, as well. The fancy foods we had in that kitchen! Because shelf-space rotation required foods to be moved along to make room for EVEN fresher foods, these places were donating copious amounts of relatively fresh fine foods. Swedish rolls, star fruit, Thai larb mix, on and on and on. If foods could not be prepared for the whole meal, they didn’t work. What happened to them I don’t know and I’m sure good decisions were happening all along. What I am describing was 10 years ago, but the dynamic hasn’t changed. Chapel Hill-Carrboro is the opposite of a food desert; it’s an oasis of fru-fru foods. Don’t get me wrong: I adore unusual foods and I know Wegmans is popular among my friends. In the end, this store makes more sense in Hillsborough where they have only Food Lion and Walmart grocery options, or Chatham County, which is the direction of growth for the western Triangle. Lois Winkler via Facebook Our tax money’s worth? A few weeks ago the Chapel Hill News had an ad from the Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools for a New Developments in Education forum. Being new to the community I was taken aback by the fact that you had to pay to attend and that it was an hors d’oeurves and cash bar event at a country club. The topics that were being covered were topics that should be covered in an open town forum where a talk is given and the floor then opened for comments and questions. In fact there should be several forums at schools around the district where all may participate, especially on how tax dollars are allocated and spent. Taxes here are very high and 48 percent of that goes to the schools, yet looking at the state report card for the last two years I do not see outstanding scores. I was a teacher in a school system in Virginia for 20 years with a community very similar in makeup to the community here. Our taxes were lower with similar services you offer here. Our lowest elementary school had end of year (Standards of Learning) test scores of 72 percent. Our high schools had 84 percent in the lowest SOL and up to 96 percent in other SOLs – English, World History, American History, Algebra 1 and 2, Geometry, Biology, Earth Science and Chemistry. I think all in this community needs to take a good look at what is happening in the schools for the amount of taxes being paid. The community has a right to know what is happening in their schools funding-wise, and it should not be a country club, pay-to-come event. Linda Wells Chapel Hill More about the bombings Hans Wuerth’s column “Do we not hear the bombs, see the blood? (CHN, Aug. 31) invites a reaction. Mr. Wuerth’s view of aerial bombings is certainly heartfelt, though short on he facts. Let’s, for insight, consider the Allied bombing campaign of WWII, something he experienced firsthand in Stuttgart, his hometown. Certainly the Allied bombings of German cities were deadly and devastating. But this would not have occurred had Germany not instigated WWII by invading Poland in 1939. (Nor would Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been bombed had the Japanese not bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941.) Yes, thousands were victims in the Allied bombings, but at least 10 times more succumbed in the ground war, including those of the Holocaust and the Germans’ use of slave labor. Another point to be made is that the Gerham fuehrer did not favor the bombing of Allied cities, thus the German Luftwaffe had no large, long-range bombers necessary for a strategic campaign. Hitler’s war strategy was to invade, conquer and occupay. And once he conquered he did not desire detsroyed cities. What about the Blitz of London and other British cities? The Blitz, which cost the Germans in airmen and aircraft more than they gained, was simply Hitler’s being piqued at being thwarted by the British RAF Fighter Command in his plan to invade, conquer and enslave the British people. And to eliminate a powerful enemy on his western flank as he intended to invade the Soviets in the east. An enraged dictator can produce a foolish decision! Finaly, Mr. Wuerth might well realize his hope that aircraft cease being bombers and relegated to transportng people. Ballistic rockets, perfected by Dr. Wernher von Braun for his fuehrer, are much cheaper to produce and more deadly as no defense has yet to be perfected. Aa for the situation in Iraq and Syria, my sense is that absent aircraft bombings the savagery would continue, perhaps even increase. Robert Huddleston Chapel Hill Editor’s note: The writer, a combat fighter pilot in the European conflict says he never knowingly killed a civilian.

By Richard Tomkins   |   Oct. 18, 2016 at 7:53 AM Follow @upi Comments Sign up for our Security newsletter CANBERRA, Australia, Oct. 17 (UPI) -- Boeing Australia is to provide sustainment support for P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft flown by the Royal Australian Air Force. Australia's Department of Defense said that under a contract with the company the services will occur over the next four years. The government was quoted as saying the contract will result in local jobs. "Developing this kind of indigenous capability -- where we can maintain our own military hardware -- is critical for our national security and is good for Australian jobs," said Defense Industry Minister Christopher Pyne. "The P-8A is a world-class maritime patrol and response aircraft and Australian Defense industry support will be a critical enabler to our military's operational capability in the region." The P-8A from Boeing is used for anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, shipping interdiction and electronic signals intelligence missions. It has a maximum speed of more than 500 miles per hour and a combat radius of 1,200 nautical miles.

Several influential figures in the Ukraine believe pro-Russian mercenary Arseniy Pavlov, 33, was handed a death sentence because he knew who shot down the jet. WILL STEWART 12 Arseniy Pavlov, pictured here on his wedding day, was killed by Moscow because he knew too much about the MH17 crash, it has been claimed WILL STEWART 12 The pro-Russian Ukraine separatist was blown up alongside his bodyguard in a lift at his home WILL STEWART 12 The 33-year-old had spent the past years fighting against Ukraine forces in both Crimea and eastern Ukraine Russian troops storm Ukrainian bases in Crimea The Kuala Lumpur-bound Malaysia Airlines jet was blasted out of the sky in July 2014 killing all 298 on board. And Russian journalist Yulia Latynina believes Pavlov's death warrant was signed at the very highest level because he knew who shot down the doomed liner. He was "the one who knew who hit the Boeing", she said. related stories CRASH FACTS When was the MH17 plane crash, how many people died and has Malaysia Airlines recovered?

But Russia insists a pro-Ukrainian death squad killed Pavlov – nicknamed Motorola - after footage emerged of them giving the Nazi salute on camera following his death. And experts fear the murder could see Russian rebels and the Ukraine return to war before long. Pavlov and his bodyguard died in a bomb attack on a lift in his Donetsk apartment block, the latest of several attempts to assassinate him. WILL STEWART 12 And it is alleged during that time he came to know who shot down the Malaysia Airlines jet, leading to orders that he should be killed WILL STEWART 12 However, a Ukrainian group has claimed responsibility for the death in a video during which they perform a Nazi salute WILL STEWART 12 Pavlov was "the one who knew who hit the Boeing", a prominent journalist has said Blood stains were seen on the road outside after the men were removed from the lift. Footage supposedly from anti-Moscow rebel factions shows a group of fighters giving the Nazi salute after a masked figure declares: "Good day, this video is being recorded in Donetsk, where we have just liquidated the well-known terrorist Motorola." A man in a skeleton mask and speaking Russian and referring to other key pro-Kremlin rebel leaders, adds: "Zakharchenko, Plotnitsky, you're next." The authenticity of the footage could not be verified, but pro-Vladimir Putin forces are using it to blame Kiev for the death of the rebel leader, who is hailed as a hero by Russia. The warlord is known to have left the Donetsk region for Crimea on the 18 July, the day after the MH17's downing. A Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) found the plane was shot out of the sky by a Russian missile from a BUK M1 launcher, but it did not name those who it believes carried out the act.

The launcher had arrived from Russia.  And after the strike, it was driven back to Russian territory, according to the report. Moscow has strongly denied the allegations, and accused investigators of ignoring crucial evidence suggesting the Ukrainian army was to blame for the loss of the MH17. Pavlov’s actions during the conflict are thought to have earned him hundreds of enemies. He had boasted of executing several prisoners of war, saying: “ I shot 15 prisoners dead. I don't give a f***. No comment. I kill if I want to. I don't if I don't.” An earlier attempt on his life was made on 24 June. He is believed to have been awarded medals by Putin for his role in the military operation to return Crimea to Russian rule in defiance of international law.

Pro-Kremlin Russian analyst Igor Korotchenko warned: "In light of recent events, a new round of war in the Donbas, unfortunately, becomes almost inevitable." The Chechnya-conflict veteran continues to create problems in death, as it emerged this week that he was married TWICE. There were accusations that his wedding to Elena Kolenkina, 23, in June 2014, came when he was already married to a wife in Moscow with whom he had a five-year-old son. His wife in the Russian capital, Victoria Kondrashova, confirmed today he was married to her when he died. We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

On Sept. 9, the two-year-old Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) announced a nationally coordinated work stoppage and protest across American prisons. Organizers say there have been strikes at 29 prisons in 12 states — Virginia, Ohio, California, Florida, Alabama, South Carolina, Michigan, and more. "There are probably 20,000 prisoners on strike right now, at least, which is the biggest prison strike in history, but the information is really sketchy and spotty," the IWOC's Ben Turk told The Intercept last month. This new round of protests was meant to commemorate the 1971 takeover of Attica prison, which was brutally put down by the New York state government and its troopers. Just as the uprising of Attica's prisoners was in protest of abuse, racism, and abysmal prison conditions, the new wave of prison strikes has its own grievances: Mass incarceration, three-strikes laws, abusive and dismal conditions — but above all, prison labor. By some estimates, the prison labor economy brings in $2 billion annually, and employs 900,000 people or more. The labor is often used by state governments to offset costs in their own budgets, and many companies — including IBM, Boeing, Microsoft, AT&T, and Macy's — either currently make use of prison labor or have in the past. At Perry Correctional Institution in South Carolina, for example, where The New Yorker spoke with a striking inmate, the work can range from furniture manufacturing to kitchen duties, landscaping, and janitorial jobs. Across the nation, inmates make clothes, laundry supplies, name plates, park equipment, and food equipment, renovate buses, repair tires, and more. Supporters of prison labor argue that these work programs give inmates structure and a sense of meaning and purpose — along with increasing their chances of finding employment when they're released. And indeed, there's some research to back up those claims. The problem, critics say, is that inmates are required to work. They don't have a choice in the matter, and they're often punished (sometimes with solitary confinement) for refusing to work. Prisoners have essentially no way to argue for better compensation or better working conditions. And while inmates are ostensibly supposed to be paid prevailing wages, reality often falls far short of that. Fees, taxes, and deductions eat into inmates wages: everything from deductions for victims' compensation or restitution funds, child support, co-pays for medical treatment, or even to cover the overhead costs of the very work-release programs that give inmates the jobs in the first place. Actual pay at federal prisons runs from 12 to 40 cents an hour, and at state prison systems, sometimes the inmates are paid nothing. It would cost prison systems hundreds of millions more each year to pay all their inmates minimum wage. Hence the enormous incentive to get by on paying the inmates a pittance. But it's also the strikers' source of leverage: At this point, the prison systems can't operate without their (nearly free) labor. Almost two-thirds of the prisoners who work under these conditions are not white, versus just 30 percent of the American population as a whole that's non-white. The IWOC has clearly connected the dots between modern prison labor and America's shameful past use of slavery: "Overseers watch over our every move, and if we do not perform our appointed tasks to their liking, we are punished," the union's announcement read. "They may have replaced the whip with pepper spray, but many of the other torments remain: isolation, restraint positions, stripping off our clothes, and investigating our bodies as though we are animals." Getting solid information on the scale and nature of the strikes is difficult, since prison officials can maintain pretty tight control over the information that gets out of their facilities. The Department of Corrections, not surprisingly, has denied that any work stoppages are occurring. Inmates themselves, along with their families and the IWOC, had to coordinate their activities via mail, stealth conference calls, lawyers and advocates, social media, online forums, and the occasional smuggled cell phone. Prison strikes have a mixed record of success, and this round may already be winding down. If they don't break through now, organizers hope to boycott the outside world — namely, the companies that rely on prison labor. It's sort of the point of the American incarceration system to consign people to oblivion; to remove them from our shared social life as punishment for their crimes. But that's also what makes it so hard to show the outside world — or get it to care — when prisoners are the ones being victimized. Try 4 Risk-Free Issues of The Week magazine.

Also, if the operation to free Mosul (with a population of over 500,000 from the Islamic State) turns out to be a success, it will destroy terrorists’ base in Iraq, but it may lead to a new wave of refugees. Read also Russia urges France, US to be careful about actions in Iraq’s Mosul Alexander Shumilin, Director of the Center for Middle East Conflict Analysts at the Institute of the US and Canadian Studies told RBC newspaper that "the capture of Mosul will seriously diminish IS’ presence in Iraq and may become a watershed moment in the anti-terror campaign. According to Vladimir Sotnikov, a senior researcher with the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and director of the Russia - East - West Strategic Research and Analysis Center, "the operation is unique and has been prepared by all sides for a long time." "If the Iraqi forces get closer to the city and street clashes begin, the chances for success will increase," he stressed. However, Boris Dolgov, an expert at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, is more skeptical about the outcome of the operation. Dolgov explained to Nezavisimaya Gazeta that even if the city is retaken IS (terrorist organization banned in Russia) would not be utterly defeated, whereas Mosul would remain an important territory for the insurgents. He noted that financial support for IS goes through Mosul. Terrorists had also seized the Iraqi army’s military warehouses there. "If street fighting starts in Mosul the operation will linger on, and in this case aviation and heavy armor should not be used," Dolgov said, adding that "militants are likely to use civilians as human shields."   Izvestia: Russia and China to carry out joint military exercises regularly Concerns about the US global ballistic missile defense (BMD) system on the Korean Peninsula has pushed Moscow and Beijing a step closer to decide on launching joint military drills, which would include anti-missile exercises, on a perpetual basis, Izvestia writes on Tuesday. A source in the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry told the newspaper that the decision to carry out anti-missile exercises on a regular basis was made after the two countries had their first successful computer-assisted command-staff exercise on anti-missile defense in May 2016. The Russian and Chinese foreign ministries say the exercises are not aimed at any third country. However, the Beijing source told the newspaper that the danger of tensions escalating looms on the Korean Peninsula, with Washington being the primary threat.

In September, a joint exercise was carried out in the South China Sea by Russia and China, which will be continued further on in order to maintain military cooperation between Moscow and Beijing, Congyou told Izvestia. He added that "if certain countries assume this kind of cooperation between Moscow and Beijing is directed against them, this only means that they themselves have malicious intentions." Speaking about the agreement between the United States and South Korea on the THAAD anti-missile complex on the Korean Peninsula for potential protection from the North Korean threat, Gui Congyou said that both Russia and China are concerned that the system would not facilitate de-escalation of tensions in the area and undermine their security. "Regarding the issue of the US’ BMDs in Europe and the Asian-Pacific region, I can say that China and Russia have similar positions that this sort of action by the United States only shatters the strategic stability in the world and deepen tensions. We’re absolutely against it," he said.   Izvestia: More anti-Russia sanctions may bring down Europe’s aircraft industry Another round of sanctions against Russia to be considered at the upcoming EU summit in Brussels on October 20-21, possibly affecting some areas of military-industrial complex and aircraft manufacturing, will hurt European aircraft makers themselves. According to a source in one of Russia’s defense corporations speaking with Izvestia daily, European airline manufacturers cannot operate without Russia’s titanium supplies. Read also Sanctions have no effect on Boeing's Russian projects — company official "At present only one company in the world - Russia’s VSMPO-Avisma Corporation - produces titanium parts without which the construction of airplanes made of carbon fiber composite materials is impossible," the source said, adding that the materials have less weight than aircraft-grade aluminum and are more resistant. Moreover, they are used for constructing Boeing-787s, Dreamliner, Boeing-747-8s, Airbus A-350s and A-380s. "The Russian company cooperates with both Boeing and Airbus, and all titanium parts in their airplanes are of Russian origin," the source added. So far, Moscow is not considering reciprocal measures since it does not see economic sanctions as an efficient instrument of ironing out differences, Deputy Chairman of the State Duma’s (lower house of parliament) International Affairs Committee Aleksey Chepa told Izvestia. "All sanctions imposed against any country are counterproductive. I do not think that a new package of sanctions will affect aircraft manufacturing or the military-industrial complex, as western countries purchase both titanium and aluminum from Russia. I’m confident that the companies that have been cooperating with us for many years, will continue doing so as sanctions batter not only our economy but western companies and the EU’s economy as well," he explained.   Komsomolskaya Pravda: Truck toll system gaining traction The Platon system of charging fees for trucks and other long-haul vehicles is now yielding results despite the uproar against it earlier this year, Russia’s Special Presidential Envoy for Environmental Activity, Ecology and Transport Sergey Ivanov said in an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper. According to the official, people now acknowledge its necessity. The truck toll scheme known as Platon is a system of fees for heavy trucks weighing in excess of 12 tonnes for using the federal roads has been in effect since November 15, 2015. The plan is to raise the rate in the future from the initial 1.53 rubles (roughly 4 US cents) per kilometer. The money is to be earmarked for road repairs. Gallery 5 photo © Sergei Bobylev/TASS Major traffic jam on Moscow ring road as truck drivers protest new tax "All developed countries have this kind of system. Now that the funds are there and are being spent on construction of bridges and junctions, they say, "yes, it looks fine," he said. Also, the official criticized manufacturers for not properly using the existing road network. "Until recently there was no fee for using roads for consumers. As a result, we had a situation when manufacturers transported coal and metals on small distances - of 500 kilometers - on long-haul vehicles instead of using railroads. What will the condition of the roads be, if we are going to have 60-tonne trucks on them," he told the newspaper. According to Ivanov, high-quality highways are being constructed in Russia now, though most of them are federal highways, which have required trillions of rubles of investment over the past years. "However, the regional and municipal road network is a mess. Of course, they lack funds," he said, adding that he does not expect sufficient funds to be invested to provide "a totally free of charge road network" any time soon. Ivanov added that he sees no future for Russia without the development of the country’s transport infrastructure.   Gallery 10 photo © AP Photo/Sony Pictures Classics, Anna Matveeva Russian Academy Award winners and nominees RBC: Netflix buys Russian TV series for the first time The Sreda Production company, founded by producer Alexander Tsekalo, has sold the rights to its TV series ‘Silver Spoon’ in what has become the first transaction between the global streaming service and a Russian film producer on worldwide, readymade video on demand basis, RBC business daily writes. The series will be available on Netflix in autumn 2016, the newspaper says. Alexander Tsekalo told RBC that "the series had been sold at the international market price." "The deal makes me proud of the results of my own work and encourages to produce high-quality series," he added.

Rough Cut (no reporter narration). ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript (ROUGH CUT ONLY - NO REPORTER NARRATION) Japan News Network (JNN), a network of local broadcasters, put out dramatic footage on Wednesday (January 16) of passengers being evacuated from the ANA 787 Dreamliner which was forced to make an emergency landing at an airport in western Japan, following a malfunction in the plane's batteries. Japan's two leading airlines grounded their fleets of Boeing 787s on Wednesday following the incident which triggered renewed, global safety concerns over a plane many see as the future of commercial aviation. ANA flight 692 left Yamaguchi Airport in western Japan shortly after 8 a.m. local time (2300 GMT Tuesday) bound for Haneda Airport near Tokyo, a 65-minute flight. About 18 minutes into the flight, at 30,000 feet, the plane began a descent. It descended to 20,000 feet in about four minutes and made an emergency landing 16 minutes later, according to flight-tracking website Flightaware.com. A spokesman for Osaka airport authority said the plane landed in Takamatsu at 8:45 a.m. All 129 passengers and eight crew were evacuated safely via the plane's inflatable chutes. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said 5 people were slightly injured when they jumped out using the emergency chutes. All Nippon Airways Co said it was grounding all 17 of its 787s and Japan Airlines Co said it suspended all 787 flights scheduled for Wednesday. ANA said its planes could be back in the air as soon as Thursday (January 17) once checks were completed. The two carriers operate around half of the 50 Dreamliners delivered by Boeing to date. Wednesday's incident follows a series of mishaps for the new Dreamliner. The sophisticated plane, the world's first mainly carbon-composite airliner, has suffered fuel leaks, a battery fire, wiring problem, brake computer glitch and cracked cockpit window in recent days.

Lauren McMahnews.com.au@lauren_mcmah  Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend FOR air passengers who love to gaze out at wide blue yonder, few things are more frustrating than finding your carefully selected window seat and realising there’s no window next to it. It seems that in every few rows on a commercial jet, the windows don’t quite line up with the seats, rendering the window pretty much useless. So what’s the deal with this annoying design oddity? The team behind YouTube channel Today I Found Out has dug into the issue and shared the fairly rational explanation. And it is this: while aircraft manufacturers decide where the windows go, it’s up to the airlines to decide where the seats go — and neither decision is necessarily made with the other in mind. Manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus arrange where windows will be located in the cabin, with some thought as to where seats should go, and will pass on their seating recommendation to the airlines. The arrangement of rows and seats on the plane is totally up to the airline.Source:ThinkStock But airlines usually disregard those recommendations in favour of their own seating plans, usually so they can squeeze more and more rows of seats into the aircraft and decrease the seat pitch, or legroom, in order to raise more revenue and keep fares competitive. Tracks on the floor of aircraft cabins allow rows of seats to be pushed closer together or further apart at the airline’s discretion. It is also up to the airline to decide what seating configuration is used, such as a 3-4-3 arrangement, a 2-3-2, or the universally dreaded 3-5-3. So the reason windows don’t always match up with the seats is usually because the airline has crammed an extra couple of rows onto the plane, probably to make more money, and thrown the perfect alignment of seats and windows out of whack.

ExoMars, a joint mission between the European Space Agency and Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, has the main goal of exploring "whether life has ever existed on Mars," according to the ESA. The mission launched a trace gas orbiter (TGO) and the Schiaparelli module toward Mars in March of this year, and the TGO began orbiting Mars today. The Schiaparelli module was expected to land on the planet's surface, but contact was lost after it entered the planet's atmosphere, officials said. Scientists said they hoped to re-establish contact with the module. Space Race to Mars: Boeing CEO Says It Will Land People First FAA Approves First Commercial Spacecraft to Land on the Moon The TGO's primary objective is to search for evidence of methane and other atmospheric gases that could indicate whether there was ever — or is — life on Mars, according to the ESA. Schiaparelli's mission is to land on the planet and "test key technologies" in preparation for future ESA Mars missions.

Equal parts luxury automobile and space shuttle, the company’s flagship on-highway tractor has received a facelift and fine-tuning for the 2018 model year. Officially unveiled in September, I was able to take the new tractor on a roughly 200 mile jaunt through the Nevada desert and into California earlier this month with “out with the old, in with the new” on full display. Departing Henderson, Nevada, the first leg of the trip was mostly at highway speeds. The drive southbound on Interstate 15 provided fertile hunting ground to test Detroit’s refined adaptive cruise. The DT12’s skip-shift feature got my 400-horsepower DD15 up to speed quickly. I was following another 2018 Cascadia on the drive and used it as my pace vehicle. As we approached 65 mph, I set the cruise and tucked myself in line behind it. For 10 miles or more, I barely touched the brake or accelerator. When the truck ahead of me slowed, my Cascadia applied the engine brake to maintain a two-second-plus following distance, seamlessly doing the same when a car cut between us and disrupted the original two-second interval. At no point did I ever feel I had ceded control to the truck, and as we exited the highway, I let the adaptive cruise handle all of the deceleration; I only applied the Bendix disc brakes to hold us at the red light at the end of the ramp. Detroit’s fourth-generation Intelligent Powertrain Management uses GPS-based technology to maximize the DT12’s fuel economy performance by anticipating changes to road terrain. All of that happens without you really knowing it until you slip your fuel card into the pump. A brief stop to rotate trucks turned into a tourist attraction. About halfway into the drive, we pulled off onto a state highway in a Joshua Tree forest to shoot some pictures, an idea we shared with a large group of French tourists – a collection of about 50 people loosely scattered among the trees snapping photos of each other. By the time I could climb out of the cab, we became part of the roadside attraction. The dense groves of Joshua Trees emptied of tourists who now were snapping pictures of themselves with the truck – some on the outside, some in the driver’s seat. The French version of Facebook, I’m sure, was flooded with new profile pictures minutes later. Several dozen handshakes and a blast of the air horn later, we point the two-truck convoy toward Searchlight, Nevada. Back on the road, we found several long grades to challenge the Detroit powertrain, which responded to everything I threw at it. The smart-shifting DT12 consistently found the right power band from the 1,750 lb.-ft. of torque to get us up and back down as winds cut across the dry valleys. Standard enhancements that all minimize drag and dial down in-cab noise include an upper door seal, elliptical-shaped mirrors, a sloped hood, a bumper with an integrated air deflector and integrated antennas. Conversation in the cab was easy thanks to a third door seal and 3M’s Thinsulate; I’ve been in passenger cars with more wind noise. Freightliner worked with Teague, a designer of Boeing airplane interiors, to develop lighting, storage and ergonomic features. The result of that collaboration is a cab that feels more like a cockpit, with switches and controls intuitively placed within easy reach. The transmission and three-stage engine brake can be controlled via a blinker-style switch on the steering column, and ceiling-mounted LED lights offer more ambient cabin illumination to reduce eye strain. The new 5-inch instrument display, which is located front-and-center of the driver in the instrument cluster, is handy. With so much information available via a steering wheel-mounted toggle, I originally thought this might prove more distraction than beneficial. It’s easy to geek out with so much cool technology at your fingertips, but the ability to select which information is most important to you – from tire pressure to axle load – makes it easy to distinguish data with a quick glance downward. The one-piece windshield delivers an unexpected boost in visibility, as does the elimination of splits in the side windows. That’s a benefit you don’t really notice until you’re in the driver’s seat. Visibility in the previous-generation Cascadia wasn’t bad; it just wasn’t this good. My test truck was outfitted with the Elite Package, which included Oregon Ash wood-grain trim accents. My red sleeper also featured vented seats, a factory-installed refrigerator, a 40-inch liftable lower bunk, a flat-screen television mount, a 1,500-watt Xantrex inverter, an upper cargo shelf, the ParkSmart HVAC system with optimized idle, a full-size microwave cabinet, front and side overhead storage cabinets and a dimmable LED ambient light bar. Cascadia’s new front suspension – a 12,500-monoleaf design – provides a smoother ride and improved roll stiffness, and the steering gear was relocated further forward; that small change improved steering precision to a point that it rivals Freightliner’s German-engineered C-Class cousins. The Detroit Assurance 4.0 suite of safety systems includes Active Brake Assist that now provides full braking on stationary objects, Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane Departure Warning with optional video capture. The proprietary safety suite includes driver-friendly controls and is integrated seamlessly into the truck’s dashboard, engine and transmission electronics and can enhance driver safety by mitigating collisions. Thankfully, my three-hour drive was mostly uneventful, and I didn’t need to test much of this system beyond the audible lane departure warning. When Freightliner first introduced the Cascadia in May 2007, the company said it would offer 3 percent fuel savings over the Columbia and Century Class models that it ultimately would supplant. Freightliner estimates the integrated powertrain on the new truck will deliver 8 percent better fuel economy performance over the current-model Cascadia Evolution. Fuel efficiency gains are driven mostly by powertrain technology advancements and aerodynamic refinements, the fruits of Daimler Trucks North America’s participation in the U.S. Department of Energy’s SuperTruck project. My fully loaded Detroit 40K axle 6X2 averaged about 10 mpg, but we hit little traffic on the drive. It takes a lot of guts to completely reinvent a truck that is already the most efficient product on the road, especially when you consider that a 40 percent-plus market share is on the line. But with the 2018 Cascadia, Freightliner has hit home runs in style, efficiency and comfort.

Hide Caption 10 of 11 Photos: The plane that emits only water vapor Future air taxis – The researchers envision that the technology will be used to power regional inter-city flights used as air taxis in the near future. Hide Caption 11 of 11 Story highlights World's first 4-seater fuel cell plane took first flight Aircraft's only emission is water vapor Tech may be used to power air taxis in the near future (CNN)The dream of sustainable air travel is now one step closer to reality, after a team of researchers in Germany flew a plane that emits nothing but water vapor into the atmosphere. The plane runs on fuel cells -- devices producing an electrical current from a supply of hydrogen and oxygen -- aided by a battery for extra oomph during takeoff. The four-seater aircraft, called HY4, had its maiden flight from Stuttgart Airport in Germany in September. It's the result of a collaboration between aircraft manufacturer Pipistrel, fuel cell specialists Hydrogenics, the University of Ulm and the German Aerospace Center (DLR)'s Institute of Engineering and Thermodynamics. "This is the first time that somebody has built an airplane that can carry more than one person and which is driven by hydrogen," says Andre Thess, director of the Institute of Engineering Thermodynamics at DLR, who sees HY4 as a major leap toward decarbonizing air travel. The 'air taxi' of the future? Emission-free planes could be the air taxis of the future Read More The team aims to use fuel cells to power small and medium-sized passenger planes, which could change regional air travel and provide an alternative to carbon-emitting airplanes, buses and trains. Josef Kallo, HY4 project leader at DLR and a professor at the University of Ulm, thinks we could also see emission-free air taxis flying from city to city within the next 20 years. "Say you want to go between Irvine and Ventura in the Los Angeles area. It can take you between one and a half and three hours if there are traffic jams, but by plane it will take you around 35 to 40 minutes. "And within a controlled airspace you could have a lot of these planes flying around." The electrical system is also very quiet compared to conventional planes, as it does not have the same loud combustion roar as a jet engine, which makes it ideal for flying near residential areas, Kallo says. "I can envision having a lot of these planes landing in the middle of Los Angeles, for example." The team are also looking at placing the system in larger aircraft. HY4 is powered by a hybrid fuel cell Kallo, a pilot himself, says a 40-seater flying a distance of a thousand kilometers may not be far off. The ultimate goal is to cut carbon emissions from air travel, the researchers say. Although aviation contribute around 2% to the overall total of global greenhouse gas emissions, for someone looking to cut their personal carbon footprint, flying plays a major part. A flight from London to New York generates roughly as much emissions per person as the average European generates by heating their home for a whole year, according to the European Commission. Controlled explosions The aircraft is powered by a hybrid fuel cell and battery system. The fuel cells mix a supply of hydrogen and oxygen, which trigger a controlled explosion. This generates an electrical current to power the motor which drives the propeller. Researchers turn old plastic bottles into fuel The battery supplies additional power required for takeoff and climbing. The fuel cell itself is not unlike the science experiments mixing hydrogen and oxygen to spark a small explosion that some may remember from school, Thess says: "But there is no bang. Just electricity and water vapor as the exhaust gas. It's a way of taming this explosion and extracting electric energy directly from hydrogen and oxygen." NASA technology Fuel cells are reliable and provide a steady power flow while cruising, but they are not ideal for quick power boosts, which is where the battery comes in handy for takeoff and emergencies, Thess says. "In the unlikely event that all fuel cells break down, the power of the battery would still be sufficient for a safe emergency landing." Electric cars and NASA space shuttles already use hydrogen fuel cells for power. The system could theoretically be placed into any small or medium-sized aircraft, according to Thess. "In a similar way that a Rolls Royce engine can be attached to a Boeing Airbus, our battery hybrid fuel cell systems can in principle be integrated into any aircraft that's already powered with a battery or other means." The four-seater plane has a maximum distance of 1,500 kilometers Short range The maiden flight was the first step in showing off this technology to the world. Next on the plane's schedule is a tour around Europe and a flight between San Francisco and New York next year. Can a whole country run on renewable energy? There are limits, however, and researchers will spend the next three years testing the system's potential and find out just how high it can go and how it reacts to different temperatures and rapid changes in power requirements. This plane has an estimated range of 1,500 kilometers, but with a larger plane this could soon increase, Thess says. "Over the next few years DLR will work on developing a 19 passenger electrically powered aircraft." With energy storage among the main limitations, those hoping to fly long haul in an electric aircraft will have to wait. "The vision of having a thousand passengers go 10,000 kilometers could be feasible in 50 years or so," Kallo says. "Today, the maximum range is around 2,000 kilometers, but if I'm wrong, that would be nice." Content by LendingTree Rates hit 2.75% APR (15 yr).

After Trump mused that he might meet with the Russian leader immediately after winning the election, the Clinton camp pounced. “It's unclear why Donald Trump needs to meet with Vladimir Putin on Nov. 9 since he's already repeating all his talking points, pushing his policy agenda and taking advantage of his espionage operation,” Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin said in a statement released Tuesday. Clinton’s campaign again dinged Trump for his praise of Putin by promising that Clinton would “stand up to Putin in the face of his unacceptable behavior, not coddle him." Story Continued Below TRUMP (DIS)ORGANIZATION? — A security researcher is calling attention to vulnerable servers used by the Trump Organization, an umbrella group for the presidential candidate’s businesses. Among the sins pointed out by Kevin Beaumont: It’s running Windows Server 2003, which Microsoft stopped providing security updates for more than a year ago. “Running outdated software and operating systems for your publicly facing email infrastructure is problematic, especially when you're a high-profile organization,” Beaumont told Motherboard Tuesday. “During an election where cybersecurity is such a big issue, I was a little amazed at what I saw.” The Trump Organization defended itself in a statement: "The Trump Organization deploys best-in-class firewall and anti-vulnerability technology with constant 24/7 monitoring. Our infrastructure is vast and leverages multiple platforms, which are consistently monitored and upgraded using current cybersecurity best practices."

THE BEST DEFENSE IS A GOOD OFFENSE — As the world waits for the first clear sign of a U.S. response to the DNC hack, a White House cyber policy official promised Tuesday that the Obama administration was taking its deterrence responsibility seriously. “We realize that making defenses stronger isn’t enough,” Andrew Grotto, the National Security Council’s senior director for cybersecurity policy, said at FedScoop’s FEDTalks conference. Grotto acknowledged the need to use “all available tools” to disrupt and deter malicious actors, echoing frequently used administration language. “We have established a robust framework to guide and support these disruptive efforts,” Grotto added, pointing to, among other things, a 2012 presidential policy directive that established basic cyberspace principles. “Our policy is one of restraint,” Grotto promised, noting that there is a “robust” oversight process governing offensive cyber actions. And in a nod to the oft-stated difficulty of conducting attribution in cyberspace, Grotto said, “We’re investing heavily in our ability to attribute malicious cyber [activities], and we’re getting pretty good at it.” WATCHING THE WATCHMEN — “Despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars on security upgrades, U.S. media organizations have failed to properly protect their newsrooms from cyberattacks on their websites, communications systems and even editing platforms — opening themselves up to a chaos-creating hack around Election Day,” Darren Samuelsohn and Hadas Gold report for POLITICO. “In just the last month, BuzzFeed has been vandalized, and both Newsweek and a leading cybersecurity blog were knocked offline after publishing articles that hackers apparently didn’t appreciate. Federal law enforcement is investigating multiple attacks on news organizations, and journalists moderating the presidential debates say they’ve even gotten briefings from the FBI on proper cyber hygiene, prompting them to go back to paper and pens for prep work.” More here. YAHOO EARNINGS SOLID, BUT QUESTIONS LINGER — After a tumultuous period that included a massive hack affecting 500 million users and reports of a program that scans user messages per a government request, Yahoo announced third-quarter earnings (minus certain expenses) of 20 cents per share — profits that beat analyst expectations of 14 cents per share, Bloomberg reports. But, as Recode pointed out: “While it looks like a big beat, this result is primarily due to cost cuts and not massive growth in its businesses.” Yahoo canceled its earnings call, which meant no answers on the hack, the-who-knew-what-when or potential impact on the pending Verizon deal, which Verizon believes is now open to renegotiation. “We are busy preparing for integration with Verizon,” Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer said in a statement. FANCY BEAR ON THE PROWL — The Russian hacking group that cybersecurity researchers say was behind this summer’s DNC hack is at it again. ThreatConnect on Tuesday published a new blog post that details how “Fancy Bear,” which is believed to be connected to Russia’s military, carried out a spearphishing campaign against Bellingcat, a citizen journalist website based in the United Kingdom. Researchers at the security vendor performed a technical analysis of the domains, IP addresses, servers and registrants involved in the digital attack and found it synced up with Fancy Bear’s tactics, techniques and procedures. ** A message from Intuit Tax and Financial Center: Watch our video series – Talking Tax with Intuit – featuring experts with diverse experience in tax policy.

But *SPOILER ALERT* the problem has only grown worse. “Multiple new Mirai botnets have accumulated an additional 280,000 bots, bringing the count of Mirai bots to 493,000,” according to a blog post the firm published on Tuesday. “The true number of actual bots may be higher based on an incomplete view of the infrastructure.” HACKING UNDERWATER DRONES — That was a topic of discussion at a Tuesday forum sponsored by Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Elbit Systems and the Institute for Defense and Government Advancement on unmanned undersea vehicles. Participants at the Unmanned Maritime Systems conference in Arlington, Va., emphasized the need to make underwater drones "cyber proof" to prevent adversaries from taking control of their systems. "Right now, I can say it's not as secure as it needs to be," said one participant, who, like the others, operated under the Chatham House Rule protecting the identity and affiliation of speakers.

Coverage of Disruptive Science and Technology Forum About Contact Facebook twitter Google October 17, 2016 Lockheed proposes stealth fighter project with Mitsubishi Heavy air force, aircraft, japan, military, united states Facebook Twitter linkedin google Reddit Lockheed Martin has proposed developing a new Japanese stealth fighter with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the U.S. defense giant's president told The Nikkei. Lockheed Martin's proposal was made in response to a call from Japan's Ministry of Defense, which is weighing options to boost Japan's defensive capabilities in the face of rising regional tensions. Japan is looking to replace its aging fleet of around 90 F-2 fighters and is mulling three possibilities. The first would be for Japan to develop a new jet domestically. The second would be co-development with foreign defense contractors, such as Lockheed Martin. The third would be to buy more existing aircraft -- say, Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth jet. The Japanese ministry's deliberations are ongoing, with a second round of information requests to be made by the end of next March. "We will definitely respond [to this request], we will be a part of that process," Hewson said. A final decision is expected in fiscal 2018. Lockheed Martin rival Boeing has also proposed working with MHI on a replacement for the F-2. Alternatively, the Japanese contractor could opt to go it alone with its experimental stealth fighter, which made its maiden flight in April. Japan has already purchased 42 F-35s from Lockheed Martin to replace its F-4 fleet. The F-35 was originally developed by the U.S. and eight other countries, including the U.K. and Italy, in what has been described as the world's largest weapons program.

The Tax Policy Review Committee said it’s not about finding new money but making policies more fair to taxpayers. State representatives heard from local business owners and school districts protesting Act 388, which was passed 10 years ago. “What I am asking you, as a small business owner, I’m asking you for some relief we’ve provided to all other aspects of our society,” said Anderson County business owner Rockey Burgess. “And, with current legislations, we’ve not given relief to local folks like myself that are in small business. If we don’t get that relief, I’m telling you, more businesses such as mine, I employ on average 15 to 20 people, we’ll be shutting our doors.” The law reduces property tax to homeowners in exchange for a higher sales tax by one penny. Some say it’s a solution to taking the burden of funding schools off homeowners, but some school districts say it cripples their budgets. Others say it’s a business killer. “It’s been atrocious for local business,” Burgess said. “I’m a small business owner. I don’t have the economic incentives that are offered to your larger companies such as BMW, Boeing, all those others that have came into our state. With that being said, I’m faced with rising taxes.” One lawmaker suggested adjusting sales tax to two percent and eliminating exemptions. “Reducing the sales tax and income tax along with removing the exemptions to looking at the whole package,” said Berkeley Rep. Joe Daning, “and, you know, before anything was absolutely done, any exemptions went away, people would have the opportunity to justify it.” “But the elimination of sales tax exemptions would make it worse than what I’m prepared to sit here and imagine," said Lewis Gossett of the SC Manufacturers’ Alliance. The Tax Policy Review Committee will take those comments and decide next on legislation to change the tax codes. Copyright 2016 WIS.

MONEY Survey Shows Most Americans Believe Big Banks Will Disappear (and They'll Be Happy to See Them Go) Here are 5 good ways to avoid using big banks. By Minda Zetlin Minda Zetlin is a business technology writer and speaker, co-author of The Geek Gap, and former president of the American Society of Journalists and Authors. Sign up here for a once-a-week email and you'll never miss her columns. @MindaZetlin Co-author, 'The Geek Gap'@MindaZetlin WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Do you see big banks as dinosaurs that are failing to keep up with changing times and certain to become extinct? If you're like most Americans, the answer is yes. In a survey of more than 2,000 Americans released today by early stage venture firm Blumberg Capital, 57 percent of respondents believed traditional banks as we know them today will cease to exist within our lifetimes. If this prediction turns out to be right, most of us won't be a bit sorry. A whopping 80 percent of respondents say big banks are too focused on serving the 1 percent and big businesses at the expense of small businesses and average consumers. More than 60 percent of respondents said banks are charging them too much interest on their debt, and 76 percent believe banks don't properly serve those with low credit scores or bad employment histories. They also think traditional banks are failing at supporting entrepreneurs. Fifty-nine percent said they would rather either borrow money from or lend money to a family member or friend to grow a small business--instead of paying, or have their friends pay, high interest to a bank. It's pretty clear, we Americans don't much like our big banks. And, it turns out, we don't have to bother with them if we don't want to. If you'd like to say bye-bye to your own too-big-to-fail financial behemoth, here are some attractive alternatives: 1. Credit unions. In the last few decades, credit unions have really come into their own as full-fledged financial institutions that provide most or all of the same services big banks do. They differ from banks in some important ways: First, they are not-for-profit organizations intended to benefit their members rather than rake in the cash. That means they usually offer lower fees or no fees for account, lower overdraft fees, better interest rates on credit cards, and better savings account rates than traditional banks. Credit unions are governed democratically by their members, and they all have membership requirements. But for some, those requirements make it very easy to join. For instance, I bank at BECU, the Boeing Employees Credit Union, which anyone who is a Washington resident can join. 2. Community banks. Another great alternative to big banks is small, community-based banks, such as local savings bank. Before moving to Snohomish, Washington from Woodstock, New York, I did most of my banking at Ulster Savings Bank in Ulster County, and paid my mortgage to Rondout Savings Bank, named for the Rondout Creek and historic neighborhood of Kingston, New York. Both banks offer most of the services you'd expect from a large bank, with good service and lower fees. 3. Internet-only financial institutions. Blumberg has an interest in funding fin-tech companies, which of course is why it commissioned the survey. But internet-based no-branch banks are a great way to get away from traditional bank fees. My husband is a veteran, so we get our car and home insurance through USAA, for instance. Although you can't, say, drop in and pick up a cashier's check if you're making a large cash purchase, you can do most things you could do with a bricks-and-mortar bank. The bank saves a lot on overhead by not having physical branches, and those savings are often passed along in the form of higher interest rates on savings, lower interest rates on credit, and lower or no fees. Here's a list of the top ten online banks to get you started. 4. Online brokers. Tony Robbins basically wrote a whole book to tell you that you don't need a big fancy brokerage firm or traditional bank for your investments. Instead, consider low-cost online brokers which provide you with research and let you pick your own stocks, buying and selling at will. Or if you want to follow Warren Buffett's get-rich-slow advice and invest in exchange-traded index funds, you can do that as well. 5. Alternative investments and credit. These days, there are all sorts of ways to circumnavigate big banks when it comes to investing, borrowing, and other traditional banking functions. PayPal and other online financial institutions provide good alternatives to a traditional checking account where you can make deposits and payments. (You need an underlying bank account to make deposits to PayPal, but it can be a savings account.) As for investing, here are several alternatives to big banks and brokerage houses that you can use even if you have less than $500 to invest. If you're a borrower, consider online lending clubs or crowdfunding, especially to start a business. Or do what most of the survey respondents said they preferred and borrow from friends or family instead. Like this column? Sign up to subscribe to email alerts and you'll never miss a post.

And while his long avoidance of federal income taxes is extreme, it's also part of a larger problem. The most affluent and powerful parts of our society have too easy a time legally avoiding taxes. David Leonhardt David Leonhardt Photo by Contributed Photo /Times Free Press. Consider corporate taxes, which ultimately tend to be paid by the well-off, because they own the most stock. The official corporate rate is 35 percent, infamously higher than in any other advanced economy. Yet there are so many loopholes that companies often pay relatively little in tax. Many companies work hard to shroud how much they really pay, sprinkling various figures throughout their complex financial statements. But companies must report one number that provides a good glimpse. It's called cash taxes paid — the combined amount that a company pays in federal, state, local and even foreign taxes. I asked the analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence to calculate this number since 2007 for this country's 500 largest public companies, and the results reveal a broken tax system. Fixing it should be an early priority for the next president. A good case study is Amazon, which pays a rate much lower than its more traditional retail competitors. Between 2007 and last year, the company paid only 13 percent of its profits in taxes. Remember: That's not just federal taxes. It's federal, state, local and foreign taxes. How does Amazon get away with this? A tangle of tax breaks and loopholes, some enacted in the name of creating jobs despite meager evidence that they do. For many companies, the key move is opening offices in a low-tax country like Ireland and then claiming that much of their business flows through those offices. Put all these tax breaks together, and you end up with our system. AT&T and General Electric each paid a combined tax rate of only 18 percent since 2007, according to the S&P data. Coca-Cola, Apple and IBM paid 17 percent, and Alphabet (Google's parent) is at 16 percent. Boeing is at 8 percent, Facebook at 4 percent. "The tax code, on the business side and the personal side, is a rotting economic carcass," Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., told me. The billions of dollars in taxes being avoided by GE, Coca-Cola and others is money that can't be used to lift living standards for ordinary families: It can't be used to reduce their taxes and can't pay for schools, medical research or clean energy. There is another victim, too — one easily forgotten in this populist time. Many large companies do indeed pay a lot of taxes. For one reason or another, these companies can't take advantage of loopholes and must pay a rate much closer to the official one. Brick-and-mortar retailers, for example, aren't as politically popular as manufacturers or technology companies and haven't persuaded Congress to create a lot of special tax breaks. Retailers also can't easily pretend their business is based overseas. As a result, CVS, Home Depot, Wal-Mart and Target have all been paying a combined tax rate of more than 30 percent, more than twice as high as Amazon's rate. This system is cumbersome — causing companies to devote great effort to tax avoidance — and unfair. A better system could lift economic growth, by directing more of investors' money to truly promising companies, rather than tax-advantaged ones. As strong as the case for change is, corporate-tax reform will still cause a nasty political fight. Companies make millions of dollars from tax avoidance. To defend the status quo, some will devise clever arguments to suggest that a new system would somehow destroy jobs or otherwise wreak havoc. They will pretend they're just looking out for the rest of us. Don't be fooled.

Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint New Delhi: The Export-Import Bank of the US is looking to provide loans to India for procuring American equipment and technology for its booming airport sector that has investments worth at least $5 billion lined up for the next four years. Export-Import Bank chairman Fred Hochberg said he had held talks with civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju to expand India-US cooperation in the sector. “Airport screening, security screening, baggage screening, air traffic control—those are the kind of areas America has grown its expertise in and which we can finance,” Hochberg said in an interview earlier this month on the sidelines of World Economic Forum’s Indian Economic Summit. “Obviously security issues are paramount, so an effective and less expensive way of security screening is important,” he added. Hochberb’s statements indicate that technology such as advanced airport scanners could be on the cards for airport security soon. The aviation ministry has faced problems over buying technology for Indian airports in recent years. The ministry has not specified the nature of the problems. A second airport for Goa, cleared in August, is being built by GMR Airports Pvt. Ltd, which also operates the Delhi and Hyderabad airports. Bidding for a second airport for Mumbai in Navi Mumbai is nearing completion. The state-owned Airports Authority of India has said it plans to spend nearly $3 billion to expand airport infrastructure across the country. India aims to build 50 new airports in the next three years as part of a plan to boost regional connectivity. Of these, at least 10 will become operational over the next year, Raju has said. The finance ministry, which has so far given grants mostly for the North-Eastern airports, has announced that it will also give grants to fund such low cost airports. Besides this, some airports that have recently been modernized are lining up for further expansion, including the ones in Delhi, Hyderabad and Bengaluru. The hectic modernization activity comes on the back of double-digit growth in India’s domestic air traffic that is expected to reach 100 million passengers by 2017, up from 80 million in 2015. Globally, India recorded the fastest domestic air passenger growth of 18.8% in 2015, according to the International Air Transport Association. International traffic to and from India has also been growing rapidly and has touched double digits. Hochberg said India used to be EXIM Bank’s biggest customer but that position has now been taken by US neighbour Mexico. “Mexico is our largest portfolio. India’s was second, now it’s in the top five,” he said. “Just the last year or two (Exim has slowed down in India). We were very active in aircraft petrochemicals and power for a number of projects. Lot of renewables. (Then) there was a slight hiatus and now it’s been reactivated and the Prime Minister is... (keen on more growth). I expect to see more activity as a result of that,” he said. Hochberg said an old case where a lawsuit alleged that EXIM had failed to consider the economic impact of its loan guarantees for the purchase of wide-bodied Boeing aircraft by Air India has ended. “The court found in our favour in every single case,” he said. Hochberg said he did not agree with the view that Airbus was able to manage more aircraft deals than Boeing in India. “There is some (truth to the argument)” that Airbus has cornered new airlines such as Vistara, AirAsia India as also IndiGo and GoAir. “But if you think about Jet Airways, SpiceJet and Air India -- a mixed fleet -- then it’s a more nuanced picture than that,” he said. Many Indian airlines have been in the red for several years and continue to be loaded with debt. Hochberg said while there was no written rule that an airline had to be profitable to get EXIM loans, there was a mechanism in place. “We would back US goods but we need to get it paid back. We look at the overall business proposition of the airline because we make loans, we don’t make grants. That’s our criteria. We look at the repayment ability,” he said. Air India (which gets sovereign guarantees) and Jet Airways have done business with the bank. SpiceJet is yet to begin, he said. “I know they are actively working with Jet, Air India and so forth. I understand there is a campaign there but I don’t have any more details on that,” he added. SpiceJet reiterated earlier this month that it was looking to order dozens of planes in the coming months. Boeing has said, without specifying timelines, that it expects Jet Airways to order more planes.

(Lindsey Wasson / The Seattle Times) As leaders in King, Pierce and Snohomish counties, we represent 3.5 million people. And we share an interest in making sure that all of those people, and a million more to come, can get where they need to go. With Proposition 1, we have the plan. Now we need your vote. Share story By Dow Constantine, Dave Somers and Marilyn Strickland Special to The Times WE hear it all the time: Somebody’s got to do something about traffic. Gridlock is stealing time from our families and money from our pocketbooks. And with each new person — about 236 every day — congestion on our roads and highways gets worse and worse. For more than three years, commuters, community members and transportation experts participated in an intense conversation about how to move the greatest number of people — especially with increased backups on roads and highways. Dow Constantine is King County executive. And we have the solution: Proposition 1. Proposition 1 would add 62 new miles of light rail with 37 new stations, completing a network that would span 116 miles. Dave Somers is Snohomish County executive. And by expanding Sounder commuter rail, Proposition 1 would allow for 40 percent more passengers to travel from Lakewood, Tacoma, Puyallup, Sumner, Auburn, Kent and Tukwila. Proposition 1 would create bus rapid transit on Interstate 405 and Highway 522, add express buses and improve parking, bicycle and pedestrian access to stations. Marilyn Strickland is mayor of Tacoma. This is the comprehensive system our region has needed for 40 years. And light rail is key because it carries more people, more reliably. When completed, Proposition 1 would connect Everett, Tacoma, Ballard, West Seattle, Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland and Issaquah. Twenty hours of service each day, with a train every three to six minutes at peak times. We know our transportation future includes cars, buses, car-shares and autonomous vehicles. But nothing — not new highway lanes, not self-driving cars — can move the number of people, nor move them as reliably, as light rail. Proposition 1 wouldn’t make our highways traffic-free. With a million more of us living here over the next three decades, nothing will. Light rail does more than change commutes. It provides access to jobs and education.” But Proposition 1 would give you options to avoid getting stuck. Just ask the 100,000-plus riders who took light rail on Sept. 30 to the Huskies’ or Mariners’ games. No panicky apprehension about missing kickoff or the first pitch. No circling the neighborhood in search of parking. No staring at brake lights all the way home. Related Opinion content Op-Ed: Sound Transit’s pro-union rule stifles competition at taxpayer expense Editorial: Consider actual benefits from Sound Transit 3 Pro/con Op-Eds: Should voters approve Sound Transit 3 in November? Have you seen the faces of the tens of thousands more people who are leaving the car at home since light rail opened to Capitol Hill and at the University of Washington? Relaxed. Free from the stress of fighting traffic. Free from the worry of being late to work or late getting home to the kids or grandkids. And light rail does more than change commutes. It provides access to jobs and education. It encourages new investments in housing so people can live in vibrant neighborhoods linked by transit. It creates family-wage jobs. It provides an alternative to the automobile, our region’s single largest source of climate pollution. It improves our quality of life. The cost of Proposition 1 is $53.8 billion in year-of-expenditure dollars. It would increase the sales tax by 0.5 percent, license tabs by 0.8 percent and property tax by 25 cents for each $1,000 of assessed value. For the average adult, that’s $14 per month. (You can find the Sound Transit calculator here.) Opponents say the investments aren’t worth it. They throw around a lot of numbers and then claim the measure doesn’t pencil out. But remember, these folks always say, “Not this time, not this plan.” It’s true. Sometimes light rail or express bus isn’t right for a trip to the dry cleaner or day care. But that doesn’t mean we don’t need it. High-capacity systems are intended to move the most people quickly and predictably, especially at rush hour, to key destinations, including job centers like Costco, Amazon, Microsoft and Boeing. So it’s no surprise that those companies and many others support Proposition 1, along with environmental, labor and community groups. City councils including Bellevue’s, Issaquah’s, Redmond’s, Shoreline’s, Auburn’s, Tukwila’s, Kenmore’s and Tacoma’s have endorsed Proposition 1. This measure truly represents our entire region coming together around a common option to avoid gridlock and a stifled economy. Proposition 1 is an investment in our future. The benefits would begin as soon as the service expands and would continue long past the system’s completion. A Citizen Oversight Panel, our local elected officials and state, federal and private-sector auditors would oversee construction and operations. As leaders in King, Pierce and Snohomish counties, we represent 3.5 million people. And we share an interest in making sure that all of those people, and a million more to come, can get where they need to go. With Proposition 1, we have the plan. We have the capability. All we need is your vote. Dow Constantine is King County executive. Dave Somers is Snohomish County executive. Marilyn Strickland is mayor of Tacoma.

(Lindsey Wasson / The Seattle Times) As leaders in King, Pierce and Snohomish counties, we represent 3.5 million people. And we share an interest in making sure that all of those people, and a million more to come, can get where they need to go. With Proposition 1, we have the plan. Now we need your vote. Share story By Dow Constantine, Dave Somers and Marilyn Strickland Special to The Times WE hear it all the time: Somebody’s got to do something about traffic. Gridlock is stealing time from our families and money from our pocketbooks. And with each new person — about 236 every day — congestion on our roads and highways gets worse and worse. For more than three years, commuters, community members and transportation experts participated in an intense conversation about how to move the greatest number of people — especially with increased backups on roads and highways. Dow Constantine is King County executive. And we have the solution: Proposition 1. Proposition 1 would add 62 new miles of light rail with 37 new stations, completing a network that would span 116 miles. Dave Somers is Snohomish County executive. And by expanding Sounder commuter rail, Proposition 1 would allow for 40 percent more passengers to travel from Lakewood, Tacoma, Puyallup, Sumner, Auburn, Kent and Tukwila. Proposition 1 would create bus rapid transit on Interstate 405 and Highway 522, add express buses and improve parking, bicycle and pedestrian access to stations. Marilyn Strickland is mayor of Tacoma. This is the comprehensive system our region has needed for 40 years. And light rail is key because it carries more people, more reliably. When completed, Proposition 1 would connect Everett, Tacoma, Ballard, West Seattle, Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland and Issaquah. Twenty hours of service each day, with a train every three to six minutes at peak times. We know our transportation future includes cars, buses, car-shares and autonomous vehicles. But nothing — not new highway lanes, not self-driving cars — can move the number of people, nor move them as reliably, as light rail. Proposition 1 wouldn’t make our highways traffic-free. With a million more of us living here over the next three decades, nothing will. Light rail does more than change commutes. It provides access to jobs and education.” But Proposition 1 would give you options to avoid getting stuck. Just ask the 100,000-plus riders who took light rail on Sept. 30 to the Huskies’ or Mariners’ games. No panicky apprehension about missing kickoff or the first pitch. No circling the neighborhood in search of parking. No staring at brake lights all the way home. Related Opinion content Op-Ed: Sound Transit’s pro-union rule stifles competition at taxpayer expense Editorial: Consider actual benefits from Sound Transit 3 Pro/con Op-Eds: Should voters approve Sound Transit 3 in November? Have you seen the faces of the tens of thousands more people who are leaving the car at home since light rail opened to Capitol Hill and at the University of Washington? Relaxed. Free from the stress of fighting traffic. Free from the worry of being late to work or late getting home to the kids or grandkids. And light rail does more than change commutes. It provides access to jobs and education. It encourages new investments in housing so people can live in vibrant neighborhoods linked by transit. It creates family-wage jobs. It provides an alternative to the automobile, our region’s single largest source of climate pollution. It improves our quality of life. The cost of Proposition 1 is $53.8 billion in year-of-expenditure dollars. It would increase the sales tax by 0.5 percent, license tabs by 0.8 percent and property tax by 25 cents for each $1,000 of assessed value. For the average adult, that’s $14 per month. (You can find the Sound Transit calculator here.) Opponents say the investments aren’t worth it. They throw around a lot of numbers and then claim the measure doesn’t pencil out. But remember, these folks always say, “Not this time, not this plan.” It’s true. Sometimes light rail or express bus isn’t right for a trip to the dry cleaner or day care. But that doesn’t mean we don’t need it. High-capacity systems are intended to move the most people quickly and predictably, especially at rush hour, to key destinations, including job centers like Costco, Amazon, Microsoft and Boeing. So it’s no surprise that those companies and many others support Proposition 1, along with environmental, labor and community groups. City councils including Bellevue’s, Issaquah’s, Redmond’s, Shoreline’s, Auburn’s, Tukwila’s, Kenmore’s and Tacoma’s have endorsed Proposition 1. This measure truly represents our entire region coming together around a common option to avoid gridlock and a stifled economy. Proposition 1 is an investment in our future. The benefits would begin as soon as the service expands and would continue long past the system’s completion. A Citizen Oversight Panel, our local elected officials and state, federal and private-sector auditors would oversee construction and operations. As leaders in King, Pierce and Snohomish counties, we represent 3.5 million people. And we share an interest in making sure that all of those people, and a million more to come, can get where they need to go. With Proposition 1, we have the plan. We have the capability. All we need is your vote. Dow Constantine is King County executive. Dave Somers is Snohomish County executive. Marilyn Strickland is mayor of Tacoma.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE Istanbul's new airport is now seeking companies to start leasing spaces to in the first terminal building, which is planned to open Feb. 26, 2018 to serve 90 million passengers annually The Istanbul Grand Airport (IGA) company announced that space leasing processes have started for companies that want to form part of the Istanbul New Airport.While 128 airlines currently fly to 276 destinations in 110 countries from Istanbul's Atatürk International Airport, the third airport will double this number, hosting 250 airlines when completed. IGA will determine rental values per square meter based on the latest public-private cooperation wage scale issued by the General Directorate of State Airports Authority (DHMİ) before the Istanbul New Airport opens. The fee schedule will become official after receiving approval from the DHMİ. IGA has sent invitations to more than 60 airlines and airline service companies to submit their request forms by Nov. 18. The first terminal building, currently under construction on an area of 1.3 million square meters, will have capacity for 90 million passengers annually, and will eventually manage to host 110 million more. This is compared to Atatürk Airport, which currently serves over 60 million passengers on an annual basis with a terminal building of about 400,000 square meters. The first stage of the new airport is planned to open on Feb. 26, 2018. IGA Executive Chairman Hüseyin Keskin said that the company will offer an utterly different passenger and aviation experience in Turkey soon after the airport comes into operation, adding, "The trouble-fee progress of activities, from passenger to cargo services, and from hospitality services to duty-free spots, is crucial for us. With respect to square-meter rental fees, we abide by the fee schedule determined by DHMİ which is one of the most important architects of Turkey's aviation potential and it becoming a leading country in the aviation industry in the future."IGA's invitation for airline companies to make applications attracted great interest, according to Keskin, showing that airlines which already have operations in Turkey want to strengthen their presence, while new companies eye opportunities to offer services to passengers in the country. Keskin stated, "The IGA family are happy to give them this opportunity, make Turkey an important aviation hub and contribute to its competitive environment through this giant airport project." IGA, which was founded to carry out the construction work and operate the airport for 25 years, shared the latest aerial images of the number 1 runway through its social media accounts. Bulky planes like Airbus A380s and Boeing 747s can easily land and take off from the 3,750-meter-long and 60-meter-wide runway. Being constructed on an area of 76.5 million square meters, which is 35 kilometers from the city center, the airport project consists of four stages with different designs. The first phase of the project's first stage consists of two detached parallel runways 1,700 meters apart, two attached runways and a main terminal building that is capable of serving 90 million passengers. Following the finalization of construction work on the second phase of the first stage, the third detached parallel runway will come into service. When all phases are completed, the airport will be able to host 200 million passengers a year, as well as providing flights to more than 350 destinations and serving more than 150 airlines. The airport will provide 100,000 new jobs on its own and 1.5 million through secondary sectors. The 1.4 million-square-meter Cargo City within the airport's customs zone will include 300 cargo agency offices, on which the book-building process has already begun. There are three different price categories for 300 offices varying in size between 13 and 19 square meters.

The vendors are identified taking into account their revenue, technology, geographical presence, and end-users. The global torque sensor market was valued at USD 1.20 billion in 2015 and is likely to reach USD 1.92 billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR of almost 10% during the forecast period. The market is largely driven by the automotive industry, as torque sensors are widely used in various automobile components for torque measurement. Competitive vendor landscape The global torque sensor market is a highly technology intensive market. Vendors compete with each other on the basis of technological advances in their products and the delivery of high-quality and accuracy in measurement of torque. Industries require customized torque sensors to monitor and measure the torque acting on a variety of machine components. While large scale industries and MNCs prefer to procure torque sensors through well established players in the market, SMEs and small scale industries usually face budget constraints in procurement from larger vendors. Consecutively, SMEs focus on procurement of torque sensors via smaller domestic or local players, as they get customized solutions at affordable prices. Due to the presence of a large number of vendors, both large scale and small scale, the global torque sensor market is highly fragmented. The lack of technological standardization in the market further intensifies the competition, as vendors are open to use their preferred technologies for torque sensors. These technologies are governed by quality and safety standards. "Industries also have the flexibility to get customized torque sensors based on their preferences and thus, the scope of expansion in providing customized torque measurement solutions to industries is extensive," says Navin Rajendra, an industry expert at Technavio for sensors research.

Quotes in the article Lockheed Martin Corp LMT ▼ 265.93 -1.31 -0.49% Northrop Grumman Corp NOC ▼ 247.45 -3.67 -1.46% Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning system is a stealthy state-of-the art jet fighter designed to span the military services for the U.S. and its allies. There are three distinct models that take off and land in conventional ways, do short takeoffs and vertical landings, and that are launched from air craft carriers using a catapult. Last year, a squadron of F-35B fighters tailor made for the Marines was first declared ready for deployment, and this summer those aircraft withstood intensive testing at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. Also last August, the Air Force declared its F-35A Lightning II fighter jet “combat ready,” marking another important milestone for the controversial aircraft. “It has been trash-talked a lot, but this is one mean machine and it will prove its combat value,” Rebecca Grant, president of the Washington-based firm IRIS Independent Research and a consultant to the Air Force, told FoxNews.com. “It’s ready to go to war, it’s ready to keep the peace.” Ironically, just as the F-35 is getting up to speed, the Air Force and Navy have begun preliminary planning for a long-term successor to the single seat F-35 jet fighter – one that includes futuristic features that once seemed out of reach. Twenty years from now, fighter jets likely will contain the latest breakthroughs in stealth technology, sophisticated computer processing and algorithms, hypersonic weapons and “smart-skins.” Those smart-skins are sensors that would be built into the aircraft itself to reduce drag assure maximum connectivity with battle field intelligence-gathering technology. Writing last weekend in the on-line defense systems publication Scout Warrior, managing editor Kris Osborn observed that some of these unique characteristic may already have been on display early this year when Northrop Grumman aired a commercial during the Super Bowl revealing “a flashy first look” at its concept of a new sixth-generation fighter jet. Northrop Grumman is almost certain to be competing with Boeing-Lockheed and other major defense manufacturer for the contract to build the next generation of fighter jets when the time is ripe. “Maximum connectivity would mean massively increased communications and sensor technology such as having an ability to achieve real-time connectivity with satellites, other aircraft and anything that could provide relevant battlefield information,” Osborn wrote in assessing the evolving design. He said that the new aircraft might be equipped to fire hypersonic weapons, although such a design breakthrough would hinge on “successful progress with yet-to-be proven technologies such as scramjets traveling at hypersonic speeds.” So far, early testing of this technology has been a mixed bag.  Related: F-35 Nears Production, but It’s Still Having Trouble Booting Up  The Air Force and Navy reportedly are holding joint conceptual talks about the technologies and capabilities of the future sixth-generation fighter aircraft, according to Scout Warrior. While the Air Force has not yet identified a platform for the new aircraft, the Navy’s new aircraft will at least partly replace the existing inventory of F/A-18 Super Hornets, which will be retired beginning in 2035, according to Navy officials.

Veteran of the Week Lew McCreary� HIROSHI SAKAHARA of Conroe, Texas Hiro is second generation Japanese American (Nisei) and he is 93. At 18 he volunteered (US Army) after a six months stint harvesting sugar beets in Montana. The army told him that if a regiment (3000 men) of Japanese American could be raised and trained for a year they would fight in the European Theatre of War as the 442nd Regiment, serving in regimental combat teams. Even so, at that time other branches of US armed services discriminated against them early on. After training (Camp Shelby) they shipped out for Naples, Italy in converted Liberty ships then deployed up north of Rome. He was part of the 5th Army, traveling on foot and by truck to the front opposite the German adversaries. By late 42 they had pushed them back north as Hiro carried ammo at first, then the BAR (automatic rifle) itselfand made PFC. They dug fox holes each night led by American officersand later redeployed to southern France, then eastern France where they helped the US 36th Divisiona bunch of Texans who were temporarily cut off by the Axis Powers. They made Hiro an honorary Texan! He also received a Congressional Gold Medal in 2011. Combat in France was some of the most perilous because of winter and the German artillery that fired down burst salvos in the Bruyers Forest. Many officers and enlisted were casualties on Hill #140. Therefore they waited on replacements, then moved back to northern Italy. It was spring of 44 when Hiro pulled guard duty until May when Germany surrendered. He returned to New York harbor aboard an aircraft carrier and released in Utah during June. Hiro put his agricultural skills to use raising fruit in Idaho for a season before selling out and attending U. of Illinois and Purdue securing a B.A. in electrical engineering. It prepared him well for employment with major corporationslike Douglas Aircraft, Hercules Powder, Brown & Root, Fluor Corporation and Boeing Aircraft. During in a small prayer group membership in college he had earlier gotten saved, and married Alice. They raised four children together. Very paramount to Hiro...hed experienced the saving grace of Jesus Christ. Compared to his Shinto ancestors traditional beliefs in Japan, this spiritual awakening dramatically changed his personal life for eternity. Until recently Hiro lived in Sun City, TX., but now resides in assisted living near Rivershire to be closer to his daughter Ruth. Would Hiro change any aspects of his life journey had he the opportunity? Certainly notdespite the persecution endured due to President Roosevelts Internment Policy for Japanese Americans whose only flaw was having ancestors in Japan and Hiro is not bitter. Shortly after Pearl Harbor nearly 130,000 Japanese Americans spent most of WW II in 10 resettlement locations that were more like concentration camps. They were torn away from their homes, assets and even family pets. Known as Nisei (rhymes with we say), they were first sent to assembly points, then relocation centers before incarceration behind barbed wire fences, guards and machine guns. Most of these locations were in western USA, two in Texas, and with some in the midwest and east. Not a single resident alien Niseior American of Japanese ancestry, committed sabotage or espionage during WW IIand by 43-44 many had relocated westward from Midwestern and eastern camps. Unfortunately there had been more than 100 instances of US race-baiters committing arson, beatings and shootings against Nisei. By late 44 the Supreme Court ruled Nisei could not be detained, and the Pacific coast was also re-opened. By 1948 amounts of compensation had been distributed, but Hiros came in the 70s. Nisei received ill treatment despite the fact that 10,000 served America with honor in both theatres of war. Many sacrificed their lives for their homeland. What advice would Hiro give to graduating US seniors? Hiros response is to first develop a love relationship with Jesus Christ, then go to college and earn a degree.

Launch was delayed five minutes to give the team extra time to review their checklists, Orbital president Frank Culbertson told reporters. “It’s such a feeling of elation to see the vehicle take off... I’m very happy to see Antares back,” Orbital director of program engineering Amanda Davis said. The rocket carried a Cygnus capsule loaded with 2,400kg of food, supplies, equipment and science experiments for the space station, a US$100 billion laboratory in orbit about 400km above Earth. The capsule is expected to reach the station on Sunday after lingering several days in orbit to allow time for a Russian Soyuz capsule carrying three new crew members to reach the outpost on Friday. The Soyuz is slated to launch today from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. DOWNTIME The last Antares launch, on Oct. 28, 2014, ended in disaster a few seconds after liftoff due to a problem with the booster’s refurbished, Soviet-era engines. After the accident, Orbital sped up plans to replace the motors. During the downtime, Orbital bought rides for two Cygnus cargo ships aboard Atlas rockets, built and flown by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Orbital conducted a 30-second engine test firing of the Antares at the Virginia launch pad on May 31, but had never flown the refurbished rocket before Monday. The mission became more crucial for the US space agency after a Sept. 1 accident destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket operated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX and a US$200 million Israeli communications satellite. The accident, which occurred while the rocket was being fueled for a routine prelaunch test, has temporarily grounded SpaceX, the only company apart from Orbital contracted by NASA to fly cargo to the space station. Private contractors for the cargo runs became necessary following the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011. With SpaceX sidelined, NASA said it added extra food, clothing, laptop computers and spacesuit parts to the Cygnus cargo list. This story has been viewed 862 times. Comments will be moderated.

But if we are to sustain growth in air travel without aggravating global warming, we must quickly reduce aviation-related CO2 emissions. Such emissions are substantial and they are not covered by the Paris climate agreement that more than 190 countries agreed to last December. Fortunately, now is the perfect time to decouple aviation emissions from air-travel growth. Representatives from 191 countries convened in Montreal recently for the 39th Session of the United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). After decades of wrangling, they have agreed to an aviation-specific climate agreement. The new ICAO framework aims for “carbon-neutral growth” in international aviation from 2020, and has as its centerpiece a global market-based measure (GMBM) to help airlines to affordably cap their net emissions at 2020 levels. When implemented, it will be the first carbon-emissions cap on a global industry that does not noticeably increase costs for consumers. And airlines will buy emissions reductions from other economic sectors, thus funneling billions of dollars into low-carbon development around the world. For the first six years, the new framework will apply only to flights between countries that have voluntarily adopted it, which means that the ICAO will have to encourage adequate participation for the program to be effective. Some 64 countries have already signaled their willingness to sign on to the ICAO agreement, and together they account for nearly 80 percent of expected growth in CO2 emissions above 2020 levels. That isn’t 100 percent, but it’s a great start, and we can expect more countries to join when they see others reaping the benefits of low-carbon development. The airlines themselves will welcome a coherent global framework that establishes clear and predictable compliance metrics, rather than a regulatory patchwork that differs from country to country and complicates international operations. To minimize compliance costs — and because environmental sustainability is now a key competitive marker for customers and investors alike — airlines will likely encourage the countries where they do business to participate in the ICAO program. The new agreement provides a huge opportunity to prevent the emission of 2.5 billion tonnes of CO2 in the first 15 years — the equivalent of taking roughly 35 million cars off the road every year the program is in force. The agreement will also spur major manufacturers such as Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier, and Embraer — which are already investing in quieter, more fuel-efficient aircraft and efficiency improvements for existing models — to develop cleaner technologies that will allow them to buy fewer emissions offsets. However, the framework decided in Montreal is not complete, and crucial details need to be worked out quickly so airlines can begin to plan how they will meet the new environmental targets. Developed countries have already offered to help to implement the GMBM, which, it is hoped, will pave the way for investments in emerging economies that are becoming new aviation powerhouses. If the countries can leapfrog over old technologies, they can become new leaders in carbon-smart flying. They should seize the opportunity before them and join the ICAO framework so that their manufacturers have a clear and predictable path forward. At the Paris climate talks last year, we witnessed the power of global collective action to address climate change. No fewer than 187 countries — large and small, developed and developing — announced emissions-reduction targets in the months before the conference, which created the momentum to reach a landmark accord. With the Paris climate agreement on track to enter into force in the coming months — more rapidly than anyone ever thought possible — we still have that momentum. The ICAO agreement is the next wave in the international battle against climate change. Together, the two agreements will boost our chances of delivering environmentally sustainable economic growth. By cleaning up our carbon footprint now, future generations of air travelers from all countries will be able to look out their window onto a healthy planet.   Christiana Figueres was Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change from 2010 to 2016.

He promised to work with private companies, “to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space.” “We have set a cler goal vital to the next chapter of America’s story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time,” Obama wrote in an opinion editorial for CNN. He mentioned leading scientists and engineers from around the U.S. will soon meet in Pittsburgh to discuss the plan. In 2010 Obama set a goal to send humans to Mars by the 2030s. This reiteration demonstrates he is still committed six years later. The U.S. government has also awarded contracts to six companies to build prototypes for space habitats capable of sustaining human life in deep space. One of which is already attached to the International Space Station. These private companies will soon ferry astronauts to and from the ISS, wrote Obama. Private sector interests in space have been on the rise, such as Elon Musk’s SpaceX which has spent the last few years developing and testing reusable rockets. Musk recently revealed his plan to get humans to Mars in the next decade. He pitched the journey as insurance for the human race should we befall some catastrophic event, which he said is likely at some point. The SpaceX founder hopes to send a craft with at least 100 people to Mars in as little as 80 days of travel. Such a journey is likely to be incredibly challenging both technologically and economically, Musk acknowledged, and will require cooperation between both the private and public sectors. “Right now, we’re just trying to make as much progress as we can with the resources we have available to keep moving forward,” said Musk. “And if we show that this is possible, that this dream is real — not just a dream but something that can be made real — I think the support will snowball over time.” The increase in collaboration in space related projects between government and private entities has been the trend the last few years ; since 2011 when the U.S. ended their 30-year space shuttle program, losing the ability to send astronauts to the ISS. This duty has been picked up by private companies such as SpaceX and Boeing. “Just five years ago, US Companies were shut out of the global commercial launch market. Today, thanks to groundwork laid by the men and women of NASA, they own more than a third of it. More than 1,000 companies across nearly all 50 states are working on private space initiatives,” wrote Obama. “If we make our leadership in space even stronger in this century than it was in the last, we won’t just benefit from related advances in energy, medicine, agriculture and artificial intelligence, we’ll benefit from a better understanding of our environment and ourselves.” 2016governmentmarsObamapolitics About Luiz Brasil View all posts by Luiz Brasil → Tweet Pin It Related Posts Feature: Let’s help students and Ontario...

The Pressure is On for SLS Hardware in Upcoming Test by Kim Henry for MSFC News Huntsville AL (SPX) Oct 18, 2016 A test version of the launch vehicle stage adapter (LVSA) for NASA's Space Launch System rocket is loaded into the test stand at the agency's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Two simulators and four qualification articles of the upper part of the SLS will be stacked in the stand and subjected to forces similar to those experienced in flight. The LVSA joins the core stage simulator, which was loaded into the test stand Sept. 21. The other three qualification articles and the Orion simulator will complete the stack later this fall. Image courtesy NASA/MSFC/Brian Massey. For a larger version of this image please go here. Engineers are getting ready to put the pressure on hardware for the world's most powerful rocket, NASA's Space Launch System, as part of a rigorous test series to ensure each structure can withstand the incredible stresses of launch. SLS and the agency's Orion spacecraft will travel to new destinations in deep space as NASA continues to prepare for its Journey to Mars. "Not only is this series more cost effective by testing several qualification articles together, but it also helps us to understand how the flight-like hardware will interface together," said Mike Roberts, mechanical team lead in the Engineering Directorate at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. A 65-foot-tall test stand at Marshall is being readied for the upcoming test series, where two simulators and four qualification articles of the upper part of the SLS will be stacked and then pushed, pulled and twisted by forces similar to those experienced in flight. "We have to make sure all the hardware is structurally sound and will not compromise under the incredible amounts of force," said Dee VanCleave, lead test engineer for the structural loads test at Marshall. "The best way to verify these major structures are ready for launch is to test them." The qualification articles and simulators will be stacked in order from bottom to top in a test structure with "spiders" - given that name because the hardware has 8-16 legs that span out from the center. The spider's design helps distribute the load evenly in the test stand. The pieces are: + Core stage simulator - a duplicate of the top of the SLS core stage that is approximately 10 feet tall and 27.5 feet in diameter. It was designed and built at Marshall. + Launch vehicle stage adapter (LVSA) - connects the SLS core stage and the interim cryogenic propulsion stage (ICPS). The ICPS is a liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen-based system that will give Orion the big, in-space push needed to fly beyond the moon before it returns to Earth on the first flight of SLS in 2018. The LVSA test hardware is 26.5 feet tall, with a bottom diameter of 27.5 feet and a top diameter of 16.8 feet. It was designed and built by prime contractor Teledyne Brown Engineering of Huntsville. + Frangible joint assembly - part of the separation system on the SLS. The flight version will have small explosive devices installed that will separate the ICPS from the rest of the rocket in space. Only the structural part of the frangible joint assembly is included for this test series. It was designed and built by The Boeing Co. in Huntsville and United Launch Alliance of Decatur. + ICPS - The qualification test article, without the engine, is around 29 feet tall and 16.8 feet in diameter. It will be filled with liquid nitrogen for testing, rather than liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. "Liquid nitrogen is the safest cryogenic media to use for testing," VanCleave said. The ICPS was designed and built by Boeing and United Launch Alliance. + Orion stage adapter - connects the Orion to the ICPS. It is 4.8 feet tall, with a 16.8-foot bottom diameter and 18-foot top diameter. It was designed and built at Marshall. The adapter technology was used for Orion's first test flight in December 2014. + Orion spacecraft simulator - a replica of the bottom portion of the exploration vehicle that will carry the crew to space, provide emergency abort capability, sustain the crew during the space travel, and provide safe re-entry from deep space return velocities. + The simulator also was designed and built at Marshall, and is 4.5 feet tall and 18 feet in diameter. The qualification articles are almost exact to flight hardware specifications. The core stage simulator was loaded into the test stand Sept. 21, with the LVSA following on Oct. 12. The other three qualification articles and the Orion simulator will complete the stack later this fall. Testing is scheduled to begin in early 2017. Ready, Set, Test Approximately 50 test cases are planned for the series. The qualification test articles will be outfitted with 28 mechanical load lines, which will use hydraulic pressure to push and pull on the test articles. The ICPS tanks also will be filled with liquid nitrogen, which will subject the hardware to pressure as high as 56 pounds per square inch - relative to atmospheric pressure. More than 170,000 pounds of liquid nitrogen will be used in the tanks for most of the load cases, and 500,000 pounds of axial hydraulic force will be applied to the entire test stack. Engineers will not test to failure for this series. Data from the tests will be recorded through 1,900 instrumentation channels, measuring the strain on the test articles, temperature, deflection and other factors. The test data will be compared to computer models to verify the integrity of the hardware and ensure it can withstand the forces it will experience during flight. This also will be a type of practice run for assembly operations before the rocket hardware is stacked in the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center in Florida ahead of launch. The initial SLS configuration will have a minimum 70-metric-ton (77-ton) lift capability and be powered by twin solid rocket boosters and four RS-25 engines. The next planned upgrade of SLS will use a powerful exploration upper stage for more ambitious missions with a 105-metric-ton (115-ton) lift capacity. A third configuration will add a pair of advanced solid or liquid propellant boosters to provide a 130-metric-ton (143-ton) lift capacity. In each configuration, SLS will continue to use the same core stage and four RS-25 engines.

(AP) — One of NASA's main delivery companies made a triumphant comeback seen up and down the East Coast on Monday night, launching its first space station shipment from Virginia since a rocket explosion two years ago. It was the first flight of Orbital ATK's unmanned Antares rocket since the Oct. 28, 2014, blast that wrecked the pad and destroyed everything on the space station supply run. The launch provided a show for sky gazers along much of the East Coast. Reports poured in via Twitter from observers in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and even Raleigh, North Carolina. The Orbital ATK Antares rocket, with the Cygnus spacecraft onboard, launches from Pad-0A, Monday, Oct. 17, 2016 at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Wallops Island, Va. Orbital ATK's sixth contracted cargo resupply mission with NASA to the International Space Station is delivering over 5,000 pounds of science and research, crew supplies and vehicle hardware to the orbital laboratory and its crew. (Bill Ingalls/NASA via AP) For Antares' long-awaited return, the pad underwent a $15 million restoration, and the rocket got new Russian engines to replace the vintage ones from a half-century earlier. As the Antares streaked through the night sky from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility, it appeared as though all the work had paid off. Launch controllers applauded when the supply ship reached orbit and victory was declared. "It is great to be back," said Frank Culbertson, president of Orbital ATK's space systems group. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden described the launch as "magnificent" and personally thanked the Orbital ATK team. "It's been a very difficult two years, and I can't imagine what those of you in the Orbital team went through. I can't imagine how long you were holding your breath tonight," Bolden told the launch control crowd. "But you know, we made it and that's what's all important." Getting a lift from the Antares was Orbital ATK's Cygnus capsule, loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of food, equipment and research, including some experiments to study flames in space and the robotic toy ball Sphero, part of an educational effort. The Cygnus — named after the swan constellation — will have to hang around in orbit until Sunday before delivering the goods. That's because three astronauts are awaiting launch from Kazakhstan on Wednesday, which would get them to the space station on Friday. NASA wants the new crew to settle in before the Cygnus pulls up. This will be the sixth Cygnus to arrive at the orbiting outpost since 2013. While the Antares was being redesigned, Orbital ATK made good on two deliveries using another company's rockets flying from Cape Canaveral. NASA's other commercial shipper, SpaceX, has made nine station deliveries since 2012, but is currently grounded, pending an investigation into last month's rocket explosion during prelaunch testing at Cape Canaveral. Given the riskiness of space flight, Culbertson and other Orbital ATK officials expressed nervousness before the launch, but said they had full confidence in the rocket. Although it took longer to resume flights at Wallops than expected, he noted, "it was done right, and that was the most important thing." NASA has been relying on Orbital ATK and SpaceX to keep the space station stocked ever since the shuttles retired in 2011. Next up will be private flights for the station crews, as the space agency works on getting astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. SpaceX and Boeing are building capsules to carry U.S. astronauts to the 250-mile-high station; those launches are expected in the next couple of years. Until then, NASA will keep flying its astronauts on Russia's Soyuz spacecraft. The space station is currently home to an American, a Russian and a third astronaut from Japan. They will be joined by an American and two Russians. Orbital ATK weathered brief hurricane delays over the past 1½ weeks, then a bad cable at the pad on Sunday bumped the launch by a day. ___ Online: Orbital ATK: http://www.orbitalatk.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html The Orbital ATK Antares rocket lifts off from the the NASA Wallops Island flight facility in Wallops Island, Va., Monday, Oct. 17, 2016.

By Marcia Dunn / Associated Press CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — One of NASA’s main delivery companies made a triumphant comeback seen up and down the East Coast on Monday night, launching its first space station shipment from Virginia since a rocket explosion two years ago. It was the first flight of Orbital ATK’s unmanned Antares rocket since the Oct. 28, 2014, blast that wrecked the pad and destroyed everything on the space station supply run. The setback had touched off a wave of concern about the company and NASA, which relies on the commercial sector to fly cargo to the station. For Antares’ long-awaited return, the pad underwent a $15 million restoration, and the rocket got new Russian engines to replace the vintage ones from a half-century earlier. As the Antares streaked through the night sky from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility, it appeared as though all the work had paid off. Launch controllers applauded when the supply ship reached orbit and victory was declared. The launch provided a show for sky gazers along much of the East Coast. Reports poured in via Twitter from observers in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York, even Central Pennsylvania and Raleigh, N.C. Getting a lift from the Antares was Orbital ATK’s Cygnus capsule, loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of food, equipment and research, including some experiments to study flames in space and the robotic toy ball Sphero, part of an educational effort. Before the launch, Amanda Davis, of Orbital ATK, said that preparation had been going smoothly: “Everyone is feeling really good about today.” The Antares’ new engines are designed to give the rocket more reliability and performance, she said. Swapping out rocket engine sis no small feat. But they “checked out great” during testing, she said. The company has also upgraded its Cygnus spacecraft to be able to carry more cargo to the station. The Cygnus — named after the swan constellation — will have to hang around in orbit until Sunday before delivering the goods. That’s because three astronauts are awaiting launch from Kazakhstan on Wednesday, which would get them to the space station Friday. NASA wants the new crew to settle in before the Cygnus pulls up. This will be the sixth Cygnus to arrive at the orbiting outpost since 2013. While the Antares was being redesigned, Orbital ATK made good on two deliveries using another company’s rockets flying from Cape Canaveral. NASA’s other commercial shipper, SpaceX, has made nine station deliveries since 2012, but is currently grounded, pending an investigation into last month’s rocket explosion during prelaunch testing at Cape Canaveral. Given the riskiness of space flight, Orbital ATK officials expressed nervousness before the launch, but said they had full confidence in the rocket. NASA has been relying on Orbital ATK and SpaceX to keep the space station stocked ever since the shuttles retired in 2011. Next up will be private flights for the station crews, as the space agency works on getting astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. SpaceX and Boeing are building capsules to carry U.S. astronauts to the 250-mile-high station; those launches are expected in the next couple of years. Until then, NASA will keep flying its astronauts on Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft. The space station is currently home to an American, a Russian and a third astronaut from Japan. They will be joined by an American and two Russians. Orbital ATK weathered brief hurricane delays over the past 1½ weeks, then a bad cable at the pad on Sunday bumped the launch by a day. Amid the triumph Monday, however, there was some concern after NASA days earlier announced that its Juno spacecraft’s engines seem to be on the fritz as it orbits Jupiter. It’s not as if Juno is in grave danger, but scientists have opted to delay the next phase of the spacecraft’s mission until they can fully investigate the problem. The Washington Post contributed.

Published on October 17, 2016 at 10:32 pm Last update on October 17, 2016 at 10:33 pm By Sam Groves Let’s say you backup your computer to an external hard drive. Your computer works fine — better than fine, actually. Let’s say it’s the best computer in the world. But there’s a tiny chance that, for whatever reason, some or all of the data on that computer could be lost. Even if that doesn’t come to pass, your computer doesn’t have infinite storage space. Having a repository for excess data would be convenient, if nothing else. Over seven billion people live on Earth. That number is expected to exceed eleven billion by 2100. Our planet is supporting a growing population with a shrinking number of natural resources. Meanwhile, at present rates of global climate change, the next century will see a rise in temperature of somewhere between 2.5 and 10 degrees Fahrenheit. In many parts of the world, this will precede rising sea levels, more powerful storms, droughts, heat waves, crop failures as well as greater poverty and famine. The relatively stable climate Earth has enjoyed over the last ten thousand years may not survive the next hundred years. Anyway, out of an abundance of caution and a desire for convenience, you go to the store to buy this hard drive. By coincidence, there’s only one left in stock. It doesn’t come cheap, but it’s a prudent investment, and you’re glad you got to it before someone else did. Last week, President Obama declared in an op-ed for CNN that the United States would send humans to Mars by the 2030s “with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time.” He highlighted the role that the commercial space industry would play in this effort. Two weeks before that, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said he wants to send people to Mars by 2022 and build a city-sized colony of as many as one million people there in the next 40 to 100 years. The CEO of Boeing said he would beat Musk to it. The goal, in short, is to make human beings an interplanetary species. The commercial space industry will play an essential role in that process. But we have to make sure they don’t own Mars, and that means confronting the question of who, if anyone, can own the Red Planet, and more broadly, who can own outer space. The SPACE Act of 2015 allows US citizens to explore and exploit resources on celestial bodies, providing a framework for private property in outer space. But according to the Outer Space Treaty, effective since 1967, “outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.” The SPACE Act insists that allowing Americans to claim private property does not amount to a claim of sovereignty. But it’s not clear. We didn’t buy Mars like you buy a hard drive. But having purchased this hard drive, you would be troubled to learn that you didn’t own it and didn’t have a right to the storage space it provides. Should a day come when Mars can support human life, every human being should have a right to live there, just as we all have the right to live on Earth and just as you have a right to that hard drive. After all, Earth may be the most hospitable planet for life in our galaxy today. But things could go wrong, and someday we all might need our next-door neighbor.

X Close World Home > News > World < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 18 October 2016 | MYT 11:06 AM Orbital rocket blasts off on space station cargo run by irene klotz (Reuters) - An unmanned Antares rocket owned by Orbital ATK Inc blasted off from Virginia on Monday with a cargo ship for the International Space Station, marking the booster's return to flight two years after a previous version exploded at liftoff. The 14-story-tall rocket, powered by a pair of new Russian-made engines, lifted off from Wallops Island, Virginia, at 7:45 p.m. EDT (2340 GMT), a NASA TV broadcast showed. Launch was delayed five minutes to give the team extra time to review their checklists, Orbital President Frank Culbertson told reporters. "It’s such a feeling of elation to see the vehicle take off. ... I’m very happy to see Antares back," said Amanda Davis, Orbital’s director of programme engineering. The rocket carried a Cygnus capsule loaded with 5,290 pounds (2,400 kg) of food, supplies, equipment and science experiments for the space station, a $100-billion laboratory in orbit about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. The capsule is expected to reach the station on Sunday after lingering several days in orbit to allow time for a Russian Soyuz capsule carrying three new crew members to reach the outpost on Friday. The Soyuz is slated to launch Wednesday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The last Antares launch, on Oct. 28, 2014, ended in disaster a few seconds after liftoff due to a problem with the booster’s refurbished, Soviet-era engines. After the accident, Orbital sped up plans to replace the motors. During the downtime, Orbital bought rides for two Cygnus cargo ships aboard Atlas rockets, built and flown by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Orbital conducted a 30-second engine test firing of the Antares at the Virginia launch pad on May 31, but had never flown the refurbished rocket before Monday. The mission became more crucial for the U.S. space agency after a Sept. 1 accident destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket operated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX and a $200 million Israeli communications satellite. The accident, which occurred while the rocket was being fuelled for a routine prelaunch test, has temporarily grounded SpaceX, the only company apart from Orbital currently contracted by NASA to fly cargo to the space station. Private contractors for the cargo runs became necessary following the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011. With SpaceX sidelined, NASA said it added extra food, clothing, laptop computers and spacesuit parts to the Cygnus cargo list.

(AP) — One of NASA's main delivery companies made a triumphant comeback seen up and down the East Coast on Monday night, launching its first space station shipment from Virginia since a rocket explosion two years ago. It was the first flight of Orbital ATK's unmanned Antares rocket since the Oct. 28, 2014, blast that wrecked the pad and destroyed everything on the space station supply run. The launch provided a show for sky gazers along much of the East Coast. Reports poured in via Twitter from observers in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and even Raleigh, North Carolina. For Antares' long-awaited return, the pad underwent a $15 million restoration, and the rocket got new Russian engines to replace the vintage ones from a half-century earlier. As the Antares streaked through the night sky from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility, it appeared as though all the work had paid off. Launch controllers applauded when the supply ship reached orbit and victory was declared. "It is great to be back," said Frank Culbertson, president of Orbital ATK's space systems group. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden described the launch as "magnificent" and personally thanked the Orbital ATK team. "It's been a very difficult two years, and I can't imagine what those of you in the Orbital team went through. I can't imagine how long you were holding your breath tonight," Bolden told the launch control crowd. "But you know, we made it and that's what's all important." Getting a lift from the Antares was Orbital ATK's Cygnus capsule, loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of food, equipment and research, including some experiments to study flames in space and the robotic toy ball Sphero, part of an educational effort. The Cygnus — named after the swan constellation — will have to hang around in orbit until Sunday before delivering the goods. That's because three astronauts are awaiting launch from Kazakhstan on Wednesday, which would get them to the space station on Friday. NASA wants the new crew to settle in before the Cygnus pulls up. This will be the sixth Cygnus to arrive at the orbiting outpost since 2013. While the Antares was being redesigned, Orbital ATK made good on two deliveries using another company's rockets flying from Cape Canaveral. NASA's other commercial shipper, SpaceX, has made nine station deliveries since 2012, but is currently grounded, pending an investigation into last month's rocket explosion during prelaunch testing at Cape Canaveral. Given the riskiness of space flight, Culbertson and other Orbital ATK officials expressed nervousness before the launch, but said they had full confidence in the rocket. Although it took longer to resume flights at Wallops than expected, he noted, "it was done right, and that was the most important thing." NASA has been relying on Orbital ATK and SpaceX to keep the space station stocked ever since the shuttles retired in 2011. Next up will be private flights for the station crews, as the space agency works on getting astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. SpaceX and Boeing are building capsules to carry U.S. astronauts to the 250-mile-high station; those launches are expected in the next couple of years. Until then, NASA will keep flying its astronauts on Russia's Soyuz spacecraft. The space station is currently home to an American, a Russian and a third astronaut from Japan. They will be joined by an American and two Russians. Orbital ATK weathered brief hurricane delays over the past 1½ weeks, then a bad cable at the pad on Sunday bumped the launch by a day. ___ Online: Orbital ATK: http://www.orbitalatk.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Tags Science Space Launches Accidents Accidents And Disasters General News Transportation Space Exploration Aerospace And Defense Industry Industrial Products And Services Business Locations Virginia Florida United States North America Raleigh Russia North Carolina Eastern Europe Europe We have recently upgraded our commenting system.

It was the first flight of Orbital ATK's unmanned Antares rocket since the Oct. 28, 2014, blast that wrecked the pad and destroyed everything on the space station supply run. The launch provided a show for sky gazers along much of the East Coast. Reports poured in via Twitter from observers in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and even Raleigh, North Carolina. For Antares' long-awaited return, the pad underwent a $15 million restoration, and the rocket got new Russian engines to replace the vintage ones from a half-century earlier. As the Antares streaked through the night sky from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility, it appeared as though all the work had paid off. Launch controllers applauded when the supply ship reached orbit and victory was declared. "It is great to be back," said Frank Culbertson, president of Orbital ATK's space systems group. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden described the launch as "magnificent" and personally thanked the Orbital ATK team. "It's been a very difficult two years, and I can't imagine what those of you in the Orbital team went through. I can't imagine how long you were holding your breath tonight," Bolden told the launch control crowd. "But you know, we made it and that's what's all important." Getting a lift from the Antares was Orbital ATK's Cygnus capsule, loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of food, equipment and research, including some experiments to study flames in space and the robotic toy ball Sphero, part of an educational effort. The Cygnus — named after the swan constellation — will have to hang around in orbit until Sunday before delivering the goods. That's because three astronauts are awaiting launch from Kazakhstan on Wednesday, which would get them to the space station on Friday. NASA wants the new crew to settle in before the Cygnus pulls up. This will be the sixth Cygnus to arrive at the orbiting outpost since 2013. While the Antares was being redesigned, Orbital ATK made good on two deliveries using another company's rockets flying from Cape Canaveral. NASA's other commercial shipper, SpaceX, has made nine station deliveries since 2012, but is currently grounded, pending an investigation into last month's rocket explosion during prelaunch testing at Cape Canaveral. Given the riskiness of space flight, Culbertson and other Orbital ATK officials expressed nervousness before the launch, but said they had full confidence in the rocket. Although it took longer to resume flights at Wallops than expected, he noted, "it was done right, and that was the most important thing." NASA has been relying on Orbital ATK and SpaceX to keep the space station stocked ever since the shuttles retired in 2011. Next up will be private flights for the station crews, as the space agency works on getting astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. SpaceX and Boeing are building capsules to carry U.S. astronauts to the 250-mile-high station; those launches are expected in the next couple of years. Until then, NASA will keep flying its astronauts on Russia's Soyuz spacecraft. The space station is currently home to an American, a Russian and a third astronaut from Japan. They will be joined by an American and two Russians. Orbital ATK weathered brief hurricane delays over the past 1½ weeks, then a bad cable at the pad on Sunday bumped the launch by a day. ___ Online: Orbital ATK: http://www.orbitalatk.com/ NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The 14-story-tall rocket, powered by a pair of new Russian-made engines, lifted off from Wallops Island, Virginia, at 7:45 p.m. EDT (2340 GMT), a NASA TV broadcast showed. Launch was delayed five minutes to give the team extra time to review their checklists, Orbital President Frank Culbertson told reporters. "It's such a feeling of elation to see the vehicle take off. ... I'm very happy to see Antares back," said Amanda Davis, Orbital's director of program engineering. The rocket carried a Cygnus capsule loaded with 5,290 pounds (2,400 kg) of food, supplies, equipment and science experiments for the space station, a $100-billion laboratory in orbit about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. The capsule is expected to reach the station on Sunday after lingering several days in orbit to allow time for a Russian Soyuz capsule carrying three new crew members to reach the outpost on Friday. The Soyuz is slated to launch Wednesday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The last Antares launch, on Oct. 28, 2014, ended in disaster a few seconds after liftoff due to a problem with the booster's refurbished, Soviet-era engines. After the accident, Orbital sped up plans to replace the motors. During the downtime, Orbital bought rides for two Cygnus cargo ships aboard Atlas rockets, built and flown by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Orbital conducted a 30-second engine test firing of the Antares at the Virginia launch pad on May 31, but had never flown the refurbished rocket before Monday. The mission became more crucial for the U.S. space agency after a Sept. 1 accident destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX and a $200 million Israeli communications satellite. The accident, which occurred while the rocket was being fueled for a routine prelaunch test, has temporarily grounded SpaceX, the only company apart from Orbital currently contracted by NASA to fly cargo to the space station. Private contractors for the cargo runs became necessary following the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011. With SpaceX sidelined, NASA said it added extra food, clothing, laptop computers and spacesuit parts to the Cygnus cargo list.

Photographer: Junko Kimura/Getty Images Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Economics Productivity Won’t Save the World Satyajit Das is a former banker whose latest book is "A Banquet of Consequences." He is also the author of "Extreme Money" and "Traders, Guns & Money." Read More. Oct 18, 2016 6:00 PM EDT a | A By Satyajit Das Thomas Malthus was wrong for one simple reason. Humans have survived his 1798 forecast that growing populations wouldn’t be able to feed themselves because innovation and productivity gains allowed them to produce more and more with the same amount of labor and capital: Irrigation, fertilizers, higher-yielding plant species and mechanization have enabled farmers to grow 5 to 6 times the amount of grain from the same piece of land as a century ago. The problem is that similar productivity gains may no longer be possible -- or effective. There’s general agreement about the factors that improve productivity. Investment in machinery and equipment increases production levels and quality. Education and training improve worker skills. New products, technologies, organizational structures and work arrangements -- in other words, innovation -- raise efficiency. A healthy climate for entrepreneurship and competition encourages the creation of faster, smarter businesses. Unfortunately, there’s also general agreement that productivity gains are flatlining. In advanced economies, productivity growth has fallen below 1 percent annually, significantly lower than the 3 to 4 percent common in postwar decades and even less than the 2 to 2.5 percent of the last decades of the 20th century. Similar trend lines are beginning to appear in developing nations. Combined with stagnant or declining workforces, slowing productivity gains are a key factor suppressing growth worldwide. QuickTake Secular Stagnation What no one can agree on is why this is happening. Some economists think traditional measures designed for manufacturing-heavy economies simply aren’t detecting productivity gains in services, or the effect of newer, information-intensive technologies. There’s also a natural lag between the introduction of new technologies and their full effect. It may simply be too soon to see productivity improvements. Yet such factors have always been present to some degree; they’d also have affected earlier productivity estimates. The real issues are more fundamental -- and intractable. Take the shift from manufacturing to services. The latter may not lend themselves to improvements as easily as industrial processes. They can’t all be automated. Many are local and not globally traded, and so don’t benefit from international supply chains. It’s hard to improve on certain personal services. A one-hour massage always takes one hour. The non-routine and non-repetitive tasks involved in, say, healthcare and aged care can’t easily be sped up. The immense gains in education and skills over the last 50 years may not be repeatable. Rising costs have placed higher education beyond the reach of many. They’ve also forced graduates to start their working lives with significant debts, undercutting the attractiveness of going to college. The rise in contract or part-time jobs has contributed to de-skilling, since workers have little incentive to invest in training. A lack of retraining means that the skill levels of older workers -- a rising share of the workforce -- quickly become dated. Many “new” manufacturing technologies are already being extensively exploited. New energy technologies, such as fracking and renewables, aren’t breakthroughs comparable to the discovery of hydrocarbons or electricity itself; they require certain conditions, such as high oil prices, to be efficient. Many biotech, IT and financial innovations are focused on lifestyle, longevity, consumption and entertainment -- all of which have limited productivity benefits. In many ways and many places, it’s becoming harder to start and grow businesses. Regulations and class-action lawsuits have made doing business more complex and expensive. Anti-competitive behavior makes life tough for would-be disrupters, even in the technology sector. There’s now one major chipmaker (Intel), a few hardware makers, two dominant computer operating systems (Microsoft’s Windows and Apple), two dominant mobile operating systems (Android and iOS) and one major suite of business software (Microsoft’s Office). Cloud computing is the preserve of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. The internet is dominated by Google (search), Amazon (e-commerce) and Facebook (social networks). Among established companies, the frequently short tenures of chief executives and pressure to show short-term results work against productivity gains. Financial engineering to boost share prices is favored over risky, longer-term initiatives such as research and development or staff training. And finally, since 2008, unconventional monetary policies have clearly distorted the economy. Low interest rates have impeded the shift of capital from inefficient to more efficient enterprises or industries, allowing unproductive businesses to live on. This has left capital tied up in marginal firms and restricted the supply of credit to smaller, often more innovative companies. Even if productivity growth could be revived, it’s not clear those gains would have as much of an impact on living standards as in the past. Simply being able to make more stuff isn’t terribly helpful in an era of excess capacity and also weak aggregate demand. Many innovations actually eliminate jobs and depress wages. They allow a few creators to capture large benefits but don’t aid the majority of the population. A much-quoted study from Oxford University found that 47 percent of all jobs are threatened by automation. In 1967, Boeing employed 400 workers per each aircraft produced. By 2015, that number had dropped to 113 workers per aircraft, a decline of 72 percent. The company believes that the worker-to-aircraft ratio can be reduced another 60 percent in the next 20 years. Fewer workers mean even less demand. Given that consumption makes up 60 to 70 percent of economic activity in developed economies, productivity gains may thus depress rather than boost growth. Even if the world can solve this one conundrum, plenty more questions -- about employment, income and inequality -- await.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 18, 2016 12:18pm   Comments Share: Related These 11 Stocks Could Drop 70% 4 Out Of 7 Firms Initiate Bullish Coverage On Apptio Just 3 Weeks After Its IPO Apptio's (APTI) CEO Sunny Gupta Presents at Technology Business Management (TBM) Conference (Transcript) (Seeking Alpha) Barclays started coverage of Apptio Inc (NASDAQ: APTI) with an Equal-Weight rating and $23 price target, saying the company has attractive growth opportunities with its first mover advantage in the technology business management space. However, the valuation keeps the brokerage on the sidelines as it awaits a better entry point. Since the IPO, Apptio shares have gained 28 percent above the $16 deal pricing and are now trading at 4.0x 2017 estimated EV/Sales. Barclays said the price target of $23 represents 4.5x 2017 estimated EV/Sales, representing a 28 percent discount to its peer group average. “We believe the discount is justified given the company's growth profile. As Apptio demonstrates success increasing its customer base and accelerating revenue growth, we may have reason to consider the greater upside and adjust our target multiple as warranted,” analyst Raimo Lenschow wrote in a note. That said, the analyst is positive on the company’s fundamentals as it has delivered solid double-digit revenue growth of 21 percent. In addition, Lenschow believes the company faces limited competition and operates in an underpenetrated $6 billion total available market (TAM), which provides plenty of growth opportunities. Meanwhile, the company is poised for revenue and margin expansion with the mix increasingly shifting towards the faster growing subscription business. “With over 40% penetration of the Fortune 100, including names such as Microsoft and Boeing, Apptio demonstrates scalability and paves the way for expansion into the Global 10,000. The question remains whether it will experience comparable success with these companies as they have smaller IT budgets,” Lenschow highlighted. At time of writing, shares of Apptio were down 0.73 percent to $20.37.

(Bill Ingalls/NASA via AP) Special delivery to International Space Station lights up sky 2 years after catastrophe The Orbital ATK Antares rocket lifts off from the the NASA Wallops Island flight facility in Wallops Island, Va., Monday, Oct. 17, 2016. The rocket is carrying supplies to the International Space Station. (AP Photo/Steve Helber) By MARCIA DUNN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — One of NASA’s main delivery companies made a triumphant comeback seen up and down the East Coast on Monday night, launching its first space station shipment from Virginia since a rocket explosion two years ago. It was the first flight of Orbital ATK’s unmanned Antares rocket since the Oct. 28, 2014, blast that wrecked the pad and destroyed everything on the space station supply run. The launch provided a show for sky gazers along much of the East Coast. Reports poured in via Twitter from observers in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and even Raleigh, North Carolina. For Antares’ long-awaited return, the pad underwent a $15 million restoration, and the rocket got new Russian engines to replace the vintage ones from a half-century earlier. As the Antares streaked through the night sky from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility, it appeared as though all the work had paid off. Launch controllers applauded when the supply ship reached orbit and victory was declared. “It is great to be back,” said Frank Culbertson, president of Orbital ATK’s space systems group. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden described the launch as “magnificent” and personally thanked the Orbital ATK team. “It’s been a very difficult two years, and I can’t imagine what those of you in the Orbital team went through. I can’t imagine how long you were holding your breath tonight,” Bolden told the launch control crowd. “But you know, we made it and that’s what’s all important.” Getting a lift from the Antares was Orbital ATK’s Cygnus capsule, loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of food, equipment and research, including some experiments to study flames in space and the robotic toy ball Sphero, part of an educational effort. The Cygnus — named after the swan constellation — will have to hang around in orbit until Sunday before delivering the goods. That’s because three astronauts are awaiting launch from Kazakhstan on Wednesday, which would get them to the space station on Friday. NASA wants the new crew to settle in before the Cygnus pulls up.   This will be the sixth Cygnus to arrive at the orbiting outpost since 2013. While the Antares was being redesigned, Orbital ATK made good on two deliveries using another company’s rockets flying from Cape Canaveral.

The rocket is carrying supplies to the International Space Station. (AP Photo/Steve Helber) Tweet Change text size for the story Print Report an error CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — One of NASA’s main delivery companies made a triumphant comeback seen up and down the East Coast on Monday night, launching its first space station shipment from Virginia since a rocket explosion two years ago. It was the first flight of Orbital ATK’s unmanned Antares rocket since the Oct. 28, 2014, blast that wrecked the pad and destroyed everything on the space station supply run. The launch provided a show for sky gazers along much of the East Coast. Reports poured in via Twitter from observers in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and even Raleigh, North Carolina. For Antares’ long-awaited return, the pad underwent a $15 million restoration, and the rocket got new Russian engines to replace the vintage ones from a half-century earlier. As the Antares streaked through the night sky from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility, it appeared as though all the work had paid off. Launch controllers applauded when the supply ship reached orbit and victory was declared. “It is great to be back,” said Frank Culbertson, president of Orbital ATK’s space systems group. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden described the launch as “magnificent” and personally thanked the Orbital ATK team. “It’s been a very difficult two years, and I can’t imagine what those of you in the Orbital team went through. I can’t imagine how long you were holding your breath tonight,” Bolden told the launch control crowd. “But you know, we made it and that’s what’s all important.” Getting a lift from the Antares was Orbital ATK’s Cygnus capsule, loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of food, equipment and research, including some experiments to study flames in space and the robotic toy ball Sphero, part of an educational effort. The Cygnus — named after the swan constellation — will have to hang around in orbit until Sunday before delivering the goods. That’s because three astronauts are awaiting launch from Kazakhstan on Wednesday, which would get them to the space station on Friday. NASA wants the new crew to settle in before the Cygnus pulls up. This will be the sixth Cygnus to arrive at the orbiting outpost since 2013. While the Antares was being redesigned, Orbital ATK made good on two deliveries using another company’s rockets flying from Cape Canaveral.

By Marcia DunnThe Associated Press Mon., Oct. 17, 2016 CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA.—One of NASA’s main delivery companies launched its first space station shipment from Virginia in two years Monday night, lighting up the East Coast. It was the first flight of Orbital ATK’s unmanned Antares rocket since a launch explosion on Oct. 28, 2014, that wrecked the pad and destroyed everything on the space station supply run. For the long-awaited comeback, the pad underwent a $15 million (U.S.) restoration, and the Antares got new Russian engines to replace the vintage ones from a half-century earlier. As the Antares streaked through the night sky from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility, it appeared as though all the work had paid off. Launch controllers applauded when the supply ship reached orbit and victory was declared. The launch provided a show for sky gazers along much of the East Coast. Reports poured in via Twitter from observers in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York, even central Pennsylvania. The potential viewing area stretched as far south as Charleston, South Carolina, all the way up to Boston. Getting a lift from the Antares was Orbital ATK’s Cygnus capsule, loaded with more than 5,000 pounds (2,268 kilograms) of food, equipment and research, including some experiments to study flames in space and the robotic toy ball, Sphero, part of an educational effort.
