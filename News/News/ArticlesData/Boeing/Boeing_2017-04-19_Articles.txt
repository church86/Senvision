US President Donald Trump was inaugurated on 20 January. Photo: AFP That tally more than doubled the prior 2009 record of $53.2 million for President Barack Obama's first inauguration, which had topped the previous 2005 record of $42.3 million for President George W Bush, government records showed. The biggest donor by far to Mr Trump's inauguration was Sheldon Adelson, casino magnate and founder of Las Vegas Sands Corp. He gave $5 million, according to the 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee's filing with the Federal Election Commission. Mr Adelson declined to comment. Many of the companies that donated to Mr Trump, a Republican, have significant matters pending before the US government or have been invited to White House events. Many of the companies which made donations to the 2017 event also donated to Mr Obama's prior inauguration. For example, aerospace and defense groups Boeing and Lockheed Martin each donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund, the filing said. Boeing had donated $1 million to the 2013 Obama inauguration, according to the OpenSecrets website run by the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog. Money donated to the Trump inaugural committee fell into two categories, University of Virginia political analyst Larry Sabato said. "It's either make-up money or it's a continuation of support by people who are invested in Trump. You don't give this kind of money to get a few tickets to inaugural balls," he said. Mr Trump publicly criticized both Boeing and Lockheed Martin before his inauguration. In Twitter messages he said costs on Boeing's new Air Force One plane were "out of control" and urged the federal government to "Cancel order!" Mr Trump in December sent a Twitter message saying the cost of Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jet was also "out of control." White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Wednesday inaugurations had "pretty much been a nonpartisan activity ... this is a time-honored tradition, and I think a lot of Americans and companies and entities are proud to support the inaugural." Financial services companies and executives, who are eager for Mr Trump to roll back the 2008 regulatory reforms, were among the $1m donors to Mr Trump's big festivities, including Charles Schwab Corp, Bank of America, financier Henry Kravis and Cantor Fitzgerald chairman Howard Lutnick. Coal and oil companies were also prominent donors. Clifford Forrest, owner of the Rosebud Mining, gave $1m. AT&T gave nearly $2.1m in cash and services. It is seeking approval from the Trump administration to acquire Time Warner. AT&T donated $4.6m to the 2013 Obama inauguration, according to OpenSecrets. "For many years, AT&T has contributed to our nation's presidential inaugural celebrations," said AT&T spokesman Mike Balmoris. Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Kravis declined comment. Bank of America, Charles Schwab, Forrest and Lutnick did not immediately respond to a request for comment. - Reuters Tags: Donald Trump Share this Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share via email Share on Google Plus Share on Reddit Share on Linked In Copyright © 2017, Radio New Zealand Next story in World Australian citizenship to include test of 'values' Related Stories US to look at 'all of the threats posed by Iran' 1:53 pm today US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has accused Iran of 'alarming ongoing provocations' aimed at destabilising the Middle East.

Chairman and CEO Sheldon Adelson testifies in court in Las Vegas. Adelson donated $5 million to President Donald Trump’s inaugural festivities. (John Locher / Associated Press) By Rosalind S. Helderman and John Wagner Washington Post Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Casino magnate and Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson donated $5 million to President Donald Trump’s inaugural festivities, as corporate interests and lobbyists lifted the inaugural committee’s fundraising to record levels. In all, more than 45 individuals and companies donated at least $1 million each to the effort as Trump broke with the practice of most recent inaugural committees and placed no limits on corporate or individual donors. Major donors included Robert Mercer, the hedge fund manager who has been one of Trump’s biggest donors, Dow Chemical, and Phillip Ruffin, a longtime Trump friend and business partner. Several owners of National Football League teams gave $1 million, including Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder, Los Angeles Rams owner Stanley Kroenke, Houston Texans owner Robert McNair and a Trump friend who owns the New England Patriots, Robert Kraft, whose team is visiting the White House on Wednesday. Trump’s inaugural committee, which raised money to fund a concert and other celebrations surrounding his inauguration in January, announced Tuesday that it has raised $107 million, doubling a previous record set by President Barack Obama in 2009. A 510-page filing with the Federal Election Commission made public Wednesday provided details of donations, though it provided no information about how the committee spent its money, including how much money remained after the festivities. The committee has said it would donate leftover funds to charities but has not identified which charities will receive money or how much. But the new filing provides a window into the flood of support from wealthy individuals and major corporations that helped support the event, despite Trump’s campaign promises to “drain the swamp” and limit the role of money in Washington. Presidential inaugural committees have traditionally been a way for major donors to express their support for a new administration – and for donors who backed a president’s rivals during the campaign to make amends. The filing showed that more than 1,500 people and companies gave money to the effort. But more than two-thirds of the money raised came from big-dollar donors who contributed at least $500,000. Other corporate donors that gave $1 million included AT&T, Bank of America, Pfizer and Boeing. Boeing’s donations came after Trump took a shot at the company on Twitter in early December, threatening to cancel a contract to build new presidential jets. Since then, the company has built strong ties to the Trump White House, and Trump has visited a Boeing facility. In a statement, a company spokesman noted that the $1 million contribution matched one given to support Obama’s inaugural committee in 2013, and that the company had given to many inaugural committees before then. Another $1 million came from Marlene Ricketts, a member of the family that owns the Chicago Cubs. Trump had nominated her son Todd Ricketts to be deputy commerce secretary, but the Chicago Sun-Times reported Wednesday that he was withdrawing from consideration from the post after being unable to disentangle himself from his financial holdings. During his daily briefing Wednesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer was asked whether he was concerned about any real or perceived conflicts, given that many inaugural donors will be affected by actions taken by the Trump administration. “No,” Spicer responded, saying the situation is similar to that posed by campaign donations. “There’s disclosure on this for a reason, so you know what’s happening,” Spicer said. He added that helping fund inaugurals is “a time-honored tradition,” often done in a “bipartisan” fashion. The committee also pocketed money from one of Silicon Valley’s most controversial stars. Palmer Luckey, the 24-year-old co-founder of the Oculus Rift virtual-reality system, donated $100,000 on Jan. 4 through a shell company, Wings of Time, which itself was owned by another shell company named Fiendlord’s Keep that is wholly owned by Luckey, California business records show. Known for his breakout technology and a much-ridiculed 2015 Time magazine cover, Luckey became the face of virtual reality when Facebook bought Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Forbes last year called Luckey, a college dropout, one of America’s richest entrepreneurs under 40, estimating his net worth at $730 million. But Luckey was heavily criticized last year after he donated $10,000 to a pro-Trump Internet group called Nimble America, which was infamous for its off-color memes about Hillary Clinton, including a Pennsylvania highway billboard that called her “too big to jail.” Trailed by the scandal and a series of separate lawsuits, Luckey left Facebook last month. Messages left with Luckey and his attorney were not returned. The committee had been chaired by longtime Trump friend Tom Barrack, with fundraising efforts led by vice chairmen Woody Johnson and Elliott Broidy. Adelson is one of the most prolific donors in Republican politics. He endorsed Trump in May, and he and his wife, Miriam, contributed a total of more than $21.2 million to Trump’s campaign effort, including contributions to Trump’s campaign, Republican committees and a pro-Trump super PAC, according to federal finance disclosures. Trump has lavished praised and personal attention on the casino owner ever since. He met with Adelson at Trump Tower in New York before taking office and then seated the couple in prime seats on the dais when he took the oath. The Adelsons also joined Trump at a lunch with congressional leaders at the U.S. Capitol and dined at the White House in February. Adelson is a major supporter of Israeli causes and has pushed for the United States to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a Trump campaign promise that remains unfulfilled. When Sean Spicer incorrectly recounted the history of the Holocaust at a White House briefing last week, he called Adelson personally to apologize.

ACORN FILE PHOTO U.S. Rep. Steve Knight is spear­­heading an effort to save the remaining rocket test stands and preserve the Chumash cave paintings at the Santa Susana Field Lab in the southern hills of Simi Valley, north of Oak Park. On March 21, Knight (R-Simi Valley) sent a letter to Robert Lightfoot, NASA’s acting administrator, urging the preservation of the test stands and cave paintings due to their “legacy and symbolic importance.” “This is a two-pronged effort to make sure that we do everything we can to preserve some of the historical value of . . . what we’ve done in the space industry and also to make sure the American Indian sacred sites are guarded,” Knight told the Simi Valley Acorn on Tuesday. “We don’t want those (stands) to just get mowed over, because then what protections would there be for the sacred sites? This is not just a part of space history, it’s part of Southern California’s history.” In the letter, Knight cites the field lab’s involvement in the first American-made rocket engine in 1950; in 33 Saturn and Apollo missions, including the first mission to land a man on the moon in 1969; and in the work with the Space Shuttle starting in 1981. The 2,850-acre field lab had also been used for decades as a nuclear test site and for research in the development of ballistic missiles. Today, Boeing Co. owns 80 percent of the property, including Area IV where a partial nuclear meltdown occurred in 1959. The federal government owns the remaining 20 percent, including Area II, where six remaining historic rocket test stands and cave paintings are located. A complex multi- agency cleanup effort by Boeing, NASA, the Department of Toxic Substances Control and U.S Department of Energy has been underway at SSFL for nearly a decade. Per cleanup agreements, NASA began demolishing buildings on the federal government’s portion of the site in 2014, although takedown of the test stands was deferred in 2015 after some activists began calling for preservation. ‘Very troubling’ Denise Duffield, who is lobbying for a cleanup of the entire field lab to background standards— meaning all materials unnatural to the site would be removed—said it is impossible to remove all contamination from SSFL and preserve the test stands. “Most of the contamination on NASA’s property is located under and near the test stands. We’re talking about very toxic materials and in very high quantities,” Duffield said. She said Knight’s letter is “very troubling” and she’s concerned it will be used by NASA and Boeing to push for weaker cleanup standards. Current agreements in place require NASA to clean up Area II to background standards, while certain portions of the field lab under Boeing’s charge must be remediated to suburban residential standards— meaning people could live on-site without getting sick from contamination. (Despite the standards, Boeing intends to preserve its portion as open space.) “From a public health perspective, the SSFL site must be fully cleaned up before there is even consideration of designating it a park or national monument,” Duffield said. “Otherwise, the polluters will use the park status to (leave) gross quantities of toxic materials on the site that will continue to migrate and impact local communities.” But Knight argues that preserving the stands will not impede remediation. “The cleanup is still one of our highest priorities, ensuring that it’s cleaned up to . . . where people can go enjoy a recreational-type of place,” the congressman said. ‘Preserve and protect’ In 2015, activist Christina Walsh started a petition on change.org asking President Barack Obama to designate the site as a national monument in an effort to preserve the test stands and the cave paintings. Although the petition is what caused NASA to defer demolition of the test stands two years ago, it seems to have stalled, as no updates have been posted since July 2015. Knight said his letter—which was signed by U.S. Reps. Julia Brownley (D-Thousand Oaks), Ted Lieu (D-Los Angeles), Tony Cardenas (D-Van Nuys), Adam Schiff (D-Burbank) and Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks)—is separate from Walsh’s effort. In a statement provided in an email to the Acorn, Brownley said everything should be done to “preserve and protect important cultural and historic features,” a task she believes can be accomplished while still meeting cleanup requirements. “The beautiful cave paintings . . . juxtaposed with the test stands from NASA’s Mercury and Apollo era create a unique and remarkable cultural and historic connection between this ancient Native American astronomical observatory and religious shrine and the site’s role in propelling us into the modern space age,” Brownley said. Jennifer Stanfield, a NASA spokesperson, confirmed the agency has received Knight’s letter but declined to answer specific questions about what happens next. The agency only provided a statement saying NASA is as “equally committed to preserving the cultural legacy of the site” as it is to protecting human health and the environment. “We appreciate the significant public interest in the site’s rich history and at this time plan to continue to defer demolition of the historic test stand structures, unless they pose risks to safety, health or the environment that cannot be mitigated,” the statement reads.

April 10, 2017 by Jessica Lovering 32 Comments Author and pro-nuclear activist Michael Shellenberger recently wrote that the nuclear sector, to survive, must embark on a radical new course: create one company, comparable to Airbus in the aircraft sector, that will develop a standardized, efficient reactor design.  Josh Freed and Todd Allen of think tank the Third Way and Ted Nordhaus and Jessica Lovering of think tank The Breakthrough Institute argue that this approach will not solve anything. They believe the nuclear industry needs innovation rather than standardization. Article courtesy The Third Way. In a February 17 article (republished on Energy Post on February 27, editor) our colleague Michael Shellenberger calls for a massive, state-directed consolidation of the nuclear sector in developed economies. A single state-sponsored nuclear behemoth, consolidating the nuclear divisions of Toshiba, Westinghouse, General Electric, Areva, and EDF would deploy a single standardized light-water reactor design in the United States, Japan, Great Britain, and western Europe and compete with Korea, China, and Russia for export markets abroad. To assure demand for the new conglomerate’s product, low-cost public loans would encourage utilities in developed economies to build the new standardized reactor. As we discussed in a previous post, Shellenberger’s analysis is based upon a mischaracterization of the drivers of nuclear costs around the world. His follow-up proposal is further problematized by a misreading of recent developments in both the aviation and nuclear industries. In this post we consider what might be learned from the aviation industry, the geopolitical reasons why consolidation is unlikely, and how US policies and institutions will need to change in order to revive the nuclear industry. A cautionary tale The explicit model for Shellenberger’s proposal is Airbus, which competes with Boeing to divide the global market for wide-bodied aircraft. But if anything, Airbus offers a cautionary tale for the kind of problems an international industrial nuclear consortium might face. Many of those problems began with the huge bet that Airbus and its member companies made on the A380. The A380 was designed and built to take well-established aviation technology and scale it up, in order to capture economies of scale associated with carrying more people around the world on fewer planes. But Airbus massively misread the changing aviation market, designing an aircraft a third larger than a 747 to serve the traditional hub and spoke design of international air travel at precisely the moment greater fuel efficiency and longer ranges for smaller aircraft were disrupting that model, allowing cheap point to point international air travel that had historically not been feasible. If anything, Airbus offers a cautionary tale for the kind of problems an international industrial nuclear consortium might face Boeing by contrast anticipated that market and designed a new aircraft from the ground up to take advantage of it. The 787 may not have broken with jet propulsion technology, a fact that Shellenberger invokes in order to claim that it represented an incremental evolution of jet airplane design. But in multiple ways, the 787 represents precisely the sort of radical break from traditional aviation technology that Shellenberger rejects. Where the A380 was a third larger than a 747, the 787 was a third smaller than Boeing’s flagship.[i] The jet engines for the 787 were radically redesigned, with a hybrid electric jet propulsion system that dramatically improved fuel efficiency. The chassis was entirely built from carbon composites, the first large aircraft ever to be built primarily of carbon, not aluminum. The 787 has sold well and is now widely accepted to represent the future of long distance air travel. The A380 has seen poor sales and has mostly been purchased by state sponsored airlines, most famously Emirates. It is difficult to say to what degree Airbus’ consortia ownership contributed to its failed bet on the A380. But if there is an aviation analog to the approach to nuclear deployment that Shellenberger is advocating, it is Airbus and the A380, not Boeing and the 787. That, if nothing else, should give nuclear advocates pause when considering the sort of centralized, state-led, multinational nuclear consortium that Shellenberger is calling for. The geopolitics of nuclear energy There are multiple further challenges that agitate against the sort of multinational nuclear consortium that Shellenberger advocates. The various geopolitical imperatives that have driven nations to invest in substantial nuclear energy capacities have also historically driven nations to endeavor to indigenize their nuclear industries and supply chains. Most reactor fleets around the world started with licensing established reactor designs. Almost all, one way or another, can be traced back to early US light-water reactor designs. Japan bought and built reactors from GE and Westinghouse, later leasing these designs. France’s large fleet of reactors trace their origins to a Westinghouse design. While Korea initially built Canadian heavy-water reactors and French pressurized water reactors, its standardized reactor fleet is based on a pressurized reactor from Combustion Engineering, an American firm. The primary focus in all of those nations was then to indigenize the designs they had licensed and develop domestic supply chains such that their energy security could not be compromised by geopolitical competitors — that, after all, was the reason that most nations went nuclear in the first place. Absent some meaningful technological innovation, it’s not clear what Airbus Nuclear would have to offer that its competitors didn’t Shellenberger argues that those imperatives no longer hold. Russia and now Korea are building and even operating reactors in other countries. China is an investor in the proposed European Pressurized Reactor in Great Britain and is clearly ramping up its domestic nuclear industry with one eye squarely on the export market. And Great Britain has decided to allow state-owned foreign companies to build planned new reactors rather than rebuild its domestic industry. But once a nation has relinquished those geopolitical imperatives, it is unclear what else would motivate the kind of consortium that Shellenberger envisions. If Korean or Chinese companies are already producing standardized reactors based upon well established technologies, mature supply chains, and experience gleaned from multiple previous builds, what reason is there for the United States, Great Britain, and France to make large public investments to reinvent that particular wheel? The only ostensible reasons — safety and jobs — could as easily be achieved without the creation of a new consortium. Any foreign firm would have to go through the same licensing process in Great Britain or the United States as would the new consortium and would be subject to the same regulatory oversight during construction and operations. And any deal to have foreign firms build new plants in developed nations could include domestic content or manufacturing requirements to assure that there are substantial local employment benefits. Moreover, it is not clear what comparative advantage such a consortium would bring in export markets. China, Korea, and Russia already have first mover advantage and aren’t burdened by the sorts of complications that a multinational Airbus style consortium would have to navigate among its members before negotiating with its export targets. Absent some meaningful technological innovation, it’s not clear what Airbus Nuclear would have to offer that its competitors didn’t. Radical nuclear innovation must be informed by markets, end users, and modern fabrication and manufacturing methods Shellenberger does suggest that the member nations would also make large shared investments in “alternate” reactors. But if one accepts the basic premise of Shellenberger’s argument, it is hard to imagine why they would. He argues that technological innovation in reactor designs impedes learning-by-doing and that alternatives to light water reactors are unlikely to bring significant cost benefits. Why then invest in research and development for alternative reactors? Innovate or Die If Shellenberger’s proposal doesn’t hold up very well under scrutiny, it does help clarify the choice that nuclear advocates and policy-makers today face. The industry is in crisis. That crisis, at bottom, is the result of the industry’s inability to adapt to changing economic, institutional, and technological realities. Shellenberger argues that we can turn back the clock on those realities. Our view is that we cannot. In a world in which fossil fuels are cheap and abundant, not costly and scarce, nuclear will need to be substantially cheaper to build than it has historically been even under better circumstances. That sort of cost decline will not be possible so long as reactors are water-cooled and operated at high atmospheric pressures, requiring enormous containment structures, multiply redundant back-up cooling systems, and water cooling towers and ponds, which account for much of the cost associated with building light-water reactors[ii]. Nor will it be possible so long as nuclear reactors must be constructed on site one gigawatt at a time. At one GW scale, the only way to get learning-by-doing is to basically commit a substantial share of national generation to a single reactor type and design, as France and Korea have done. And as we note above, there are few places, if any, where there is likely to be sufficient geopolitical reason to do so. At 10 MW or 100 MW, by contrast, there is ample opportunity for learning by doing and economies of multiples for several reactor classes and designs, even in the absence of rapid demand growth or geopolitical imperatives. A radical break from the light water regime that would enable this sort of innovation is not a small undertaking and will require a major reorganization of the nuclear sector. State-led development of advanced designs, bringing together large incumbent firms and scientists from national laboratories failed in United States, France, Britain, Japan, and Germany in the 60’s and 70’s. It will likely fail as well in Korea, China, France, and Russia today. There is a growing advanced nuclear sector in United States that is ready to transform the nuclear industry if we are willing to give it the chance What will be necessary is not new physics. The basic physics of virtually all nuclear fission technologies has been well understood and demonstrated by America’s national laboratories since the late 1950’s. Rather, radical nuclear innovation must be informed by markets, end users, and modern fabrication and manufacturing methods. This is centrally a job for entrepreneurial engineers, not scientists at national laboratories, technocrats at the Department of Energy, or division heads at Westinghouse or General Electric. Public policy that empowers nuclear innovation and entrepreneurship will need to support engineers and start-ups, not direct them. Such a shift would be major, but not unprecedented. The era of cheap genetic decoding became a reality when decades of federal research and development was handed off to Craig Ventor, an entrepreneur who used technologies and basic science pioneered by federal scientists to develop a better and cheaper way to decode the human genome. This made possible the modern biotech sector, which was further enabled by important changes in the way that the FDA licensed and tested new drugs, and by changes to the federal tax code and to patent law that incentivized public institutions to get research out of their laboratories and into the hands of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. NASA over the last two decades has undergone a similar transformation, creating policies and incentives to support a diverse and growing commercial space industry where space flight was once the sole province of NASA and its large contractors. A strong federal program will support early innovation at universities to spawn new entrepreneurs, open up the national laboratories to provide start-ups with technical advice, test facilities, and test beds, reform NRC licensing for advanced reactors, and provide advanced market commitments and other competitive grants for companies that demonstrate that they can build reactors at economically competitive costs. None of these measures, individually or in sum, are any guarantee that we will develop cheap, economically competitive advanced nuclear reactors. But there is little reason to think that large light-water reactors have much future outside of a few rapidly growing state-led economies in Asia or that continuing, incremental innovation in light-water design is likely to change that. Today, there is a growing advanced nuclear sector in United States that is ready to transform the nuclear industry if we are willing to give it the chance. Innovation, in nuclear technology, business models, and the underlying structure of the sector, not revanchism, is what will be required to save America’s nuclear industry.

Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member Bentvels April 11, 2017 12:30 Such advanced new nuclear won’t arrive at the market before 2030. Then it meets an environment in which: – new utility scale PV-solar and Wind are offered for 1 – 3 cnt/KWh; – high efficient Power-to-Gas reached economy of scale. Covering longer (seasonal) dips in wind & solar production; – battery costs are decreased a factor X and more users disconnected from the grid as that became cheaper. etc. So that advanced new nuclear will have to deliver then at prices below 3cnts/KWh, which is ~5 times less than present new nuclear. Consider new designs such as the Molten Salt Reactor. Those imply: – very (corrosion) aggressive fluoride salt at temperatures of 650-700°C, so fast wear of the steel, etc. The proposed solution to deliver every 4 yrs a new reactor vessel doesn’t decrease the cost price. – two heat exchangers behind each other (radio-active molten salt => ‘normal’ molten salt => water). Heat exchangers are notorious vulnerable (killed a.o. SONGS). So, though MSR solves the high pressure reactor vessel problem, one gets other (possible more costly) problems back… Don’t see how MSR’s can produce 5 times cheaper than present new LWR/PWR’s. But may be HTGR offers more chance. Didn’t study it yet. Don’t see other serious candidates. -3  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member BobMeinetz April 11, 2017 17:18 Bas – as usual, you combine the rosiest of predictions for renewables with the most pessimistic ones for nuclear. Neither you nor I know for certain what will happen, but a safe assumption would be neither of your outlier predictions are realistic. They’re based on what you want, not what is viable. A safe assumption would be that both renewables technology and nuclear technology make modest improvements by 2030. That leaves renewables still wildly deficient in meeting the goals necessary to replace fossil fuels by 2100. We can thus either base our efforts on half-baked hopes, or what will likely happen. Is there really any decision to be made? 2  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member Bentvels April 11, 2017 22:17 To much honor for me. Essentially it are not my predictions but those of scientific studies, think-tank Agora, etc. Only my question: I don’t see how in 2030 new MSR’s can produce 5 times cheaper than present new LWR/PWR’s. Especially considering the extra difficulties such as: – the steel wear due to the aggressive salt at 700°C; – the double heat exchangers needed with ~650°C molten salt*); – the potential instabilities of the fuel containing molten salt (major cause of explosions in the process industry even the small ORNLE was not free of such instabilities; – the cleaning of the radio-active molten salt after 4yrs. ?? comes from me. But may be you can explain how? Or explain another design that may reach that lower cost level? _________ *) Even with the low temperatures (450°C) of LWR/PWR’s non-aggressive water, heat exchangers are already vulnerable and have to be replaced rather often early. An expensive operation that ended the life of NPP’s, such as that of twin reactor SONGS. -4  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member John Oneill April 12, 2017 12:24 Gas cooled reactors can work, but because gas is an inherently less efficient carrier of heat than liquids, they need much larger cores than other reactors for the same power output, and those must be engineered for high pressure. The British CO2-cooled reactors were thus rather expensive to build, although eventually the bugs were sorted out and they are still working well, but none were ever exported. For similar reasons, molten salt or metal cooled reactors should be much smaller than light water reactors – running at low pressure, they don’t need a huge containment building in case the water all boils. ( Some used a massive store of ice instead, but that has increased maintenance costs.) They should also all be far safer – cesium and iodine, the most problematic radioisotopes at Chernobyl and Fukushima, were problematic because of their low elemental boiling points, but they both bond chemically to lead, sodium, or fluorides, and so are stable to much higher temperatures. So, no forged pressure vessel with steel thirty centimetres thick. No huge dome with reinforced concrete a metre thick. Steam turbines half the size, the same as are used in thousands of supercritical coal plants. A reactor about the size of the tower base of an 8 MW windmill, but that makes 800 MW – and not just when the wind blows. There’s got to be savings there somewhere. 4  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member BobMeinetz April 12, 2017 15:44 John, I think you’ll find containment requirements are not significantly reduced with low-pressure cooling systems – in the U.S. at least, nuclear containment must withstand the impact of a fully-loaded commercial airliner. 0  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member Mark Heslep April 12, 2017 19:05 I would think a design i) without high pressure steam in the primary, ii) with a subterranean reactor, iii) with walk away safe decay heat, would make aircraft impact moot. 1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member EngineerPoet April 12, 2017 20:17 The containment is a steel vessel designed to hold anything that leaks out of the reactor.  The shield building goes around the containment; that is what has to handle impacts. 1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member BobMeinetz April 11, 2017 16:12 Jessica, Josh, Ted, and Todd – In the creation of a theoretical, ideal business model to foster the development of safe and inexpensive nuclear energy (which, I think, all agree is the goal here) Shellenberger’s model of Airbus reflects more accurately what is taking place in China. That model is working. First, government must remain intimately involved in both the design and regulation of new nuclear. Unlike genetic research, nuclear energy can’t be simply “handed off” to private investment when the materials it uses are highly toxic. Even if they aren’t easily weaponized, when released into the environment accidentally (or maliciously) they create big problems for society. And that private investors make horrible guardians of public interest has been demonstrated since time immemorial. Second, the Chinese are proving groundbreaking new designs are unnecessary. And in the U.S., the idea those designs are “just around the corner” is both inhibiting development of improved PWR designs and hastening the demise of perfectly-functional plants already in existence. Nuclear engineers worldwide have decades of experience and are now building designs which work, and work well. If it’s true that That sort of cost decline will not be possible so long as reactors are water-cooled and operated at high atmospheric pressures, requiring enormous containment structures, multiply redundant back-up cooling systems, and water cooling towers and ponds, which account for much of the cost associated with building light-water reactors. how are the Chinese able to build light-water reactors at one-fourth the cost of American ones? There’s no evidence – to date – that Chinese designs are unsafe, and it might be argued that “multiply redundant back-up cooling systems” are, from an engineering perspective, less safe than simple, durable, predictable ones. China’s publicly-financed and -run State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation, formed by the Chinese government in 2007, now partners with two private nuclear corporations. It’s succeeding spectacularly in its goal of building out nuclear quickly and inexpensively, and is similar to the Atomic Energy Commission/Westinghouse consortium which produced America’s first exclusively-commercial plant at Shippingport. So with the imperative of climate change we need to focus on what’s already been proven to work, not what we hope will work. That strategy is failing miserably with renewables/efficiency/storage, and we can learn from it. What’s wrong with the American business of nuclear energy has nothing to do with technology but with public misperceptions – ones shaped by fossil-fuel interests to guarantee their polluting fuel a profitable future. We can either base policy on those misperceptions or on science – sound familiar? 1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member Bentvels April 11, 2017 22:35 Since Fukushima and the associated improved safety requirements, major part of China’s reactor construction projects now also suffer from delays & costs overruns.

The French have already tried this solution, and while they pulled off the illusion of cheap, centralized, standardized nuclear for quite a long time, we’re finally getting a sense of what that model is actually costing the French taxpayer, including the now-apparent fact that only a miniscule fraction of the likely cost of decommissioning the existing fleet has been accrued. Not long ago (within the past 15 years) the Japanese model of a utility-government partnership in the construction and oversight of Japanese nuclear was being touted by US advocates as the blueprint for the future of nuclear. The failure to address even the simplest system vulnerabilities at Fukushima, vulnerabilities that had been identified for years but were swept under the carpet in the interest of cost and ensuring public confidence, blew that illusion wide open. Things may be different in China, but all of our experience tells us otherwise. Jessica et al. are dead right – while government has always and will always play a critical role in whatever future nuclear has, that role needs to put the failed paradigm of the past 50 year behind us and focus on a real future, one that has a chance of succeeding.

Nuclear energy is estimated to have saved 1.8 million lives since 1971, and is in 2014 the safest method of generating dispatchable electricity, hands-down. Possibly you were frightened by overblown media accounts of the Fukushima non-disaster which neither killed nor injured anyone. So I really have no idea how to respond to your alternative reality, and my interest in doing so (and to that of like-minded others) declines by the day. 0  |   -   Share          Member Sean April 16, 2017 03:02 It might be the safest because of all the regulations, however I doubt it is the cheapest. Or else we wouldn’t be seeing a massive switch to NG. 0  |   -   Share          Member BobMeinetz April 17, 2017 17:14 Sean, I’m continually amazed at this “cheapest” argument, because it has no relevance to American utilities whatsoever. Utilities are permitted, by public utility commissions, to charge ratepayers based on a cost-plus arrangement which varies by state. They are all regulated – otherwise, as natural monopolies, they could charge the public whatever exhorbitant fees they liked. So it makes no difference to utilities how much it costs to generate electricity – they pass the cost on to customers. In California, San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) was closed permanently in 2013 and replaced by supposedly “cheap” natural gas. Yet electricity rates in SONGS’s service area skyrocketed 56% within three years. Why? Sempra Energy, the owner of San Diego Gas & Electric, “sells itself” the natural gas it uses to generate electricity, and now bills its customers on a cost-plus arrangement for the gas as well as the electricity. See how this scam works? It’s permitted Sempra to recognize $17 billion in annual revenue, and PG&E is about to do exactly the same thing with Diablo Canyon (nuclear) Power Plant in Central California. 0  |   -   Share          Member Bentvels April 17, 2017 08:21 Bob, The estimation that nuclear is safest, is only made by fanatic pro-nuclear, using unrealistic figures such as 43 deaths due to Chernobyl*). etc. Nuclear is the most dangerous method, as the Germans also concluded. So they are removing all nuclear power plants with highest priority (done in 2022). _____ *) James Hansen etal., while an 2009 issue of the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences concluded 825,000 deaths before 2006, and we know that most deaths still have to come, as increased low level radiation has a latency period of 10 – 60 years before the health damage shows! Shown by a.o. the RERF studies regarding the Atomic bombs on Japan and similar as with smoking, asbestos, etc. Even the WHO now admits 16,000deaths while stating that no real estimation can be made. -3  |   -   Share          Member EngineerPoet April 14, 2017 20:34 I see lots of assertions here with no supporting evidence. we’re finally getting a sense of what that model is actually costing the French taxpayer, including the now-apparent fact that only a miniscule fraction of the likely cost of decommissioning the existing fleet has been accrued. If so, they’ve obviously not set aside funds like the American model. But so what.  If decommissioning is too expensive… refurbish instead.  Neutron embrittlement of the reactor vessel is the key limit on the plant’s life.  However, neutron damage can be annealed out.  This would require what amounts to the construction of a furnace inside the containment building, heating of the vessel to the annealing temperature, and cooling again at a controlled rate.  With the number of identical units built by France, engineering and construction of such a portable, segmented (to fit through small doors) furnace should be quite affordable. And then France would have another 40+ years of service from the same reactors, during which they would STILL put “Green” Germany and Denmark to shame for CO2 emissions. The failure to address even the simplest system vulnerabilities at Fukushima, vulnerabilities that had been identified for years but were swept under the carpet in the interest of cost and ensuring public confidence, blew that illusion wide open. It’s sad to see someone who is so ignorant, he can’t identify this as a Japanese cultural problem.  The head of TEPCO could not admit that seawalls had to be raised because it meant that somebody had made a mistake.  The mistake was actually 40-odd years ago, when the potential tsunami height had not been properly determined and the American designers of the original plant called for the bluff to be cut down many meters to reduce the power demands of pumping condenser cooling water uphill. The Onagawa plant, which received harder shaking and a bigger wave than Futaba, came through in fine shape.  Its hill wasn’t shaved down, and it served as a refugee center for townspeople in the aftermath. Then there’s the radiophobia of the Hiroshima Syndrome, which manifests today as bullying of Fukushima evacuees (who should have gone home long since and most never evacuated at all).  A cultural pathology… which you transmit and exacerbate here. Jessica et al. are dead right – while government has always and will always play a critical role in whatever future nuclear has, that role needs to put the failed paradigm of the past 50 year behind us and focus on a real future, one that has a chance of succeeding. When you get to hand-waving in terms like this, I know you’re lying… and projecting. We know “renewables” have no chance of succeeding.  People have known their fatal weaknesses for hundreds of years, which is why coal, oil and natural gas were adopted so quickly.  The only reason to push “Green” stuff is to maintain the markets for the sellers of coal, oil and natural gas.  So the planet burns; they’ll have their money. 1  |   -   Share          Member Bentvels April 17, 2017 09:38 EP, A few corrections of your wrong statements: Onagawa nuclear plant was only saved because a persistent engineer, Yanosoku Hirai, put huge efforts in his idea that the plant needed an high dike. When the tsunami came the 14.8meter high dike was just high enough…. Otherwise the plant probably had undergone the same fate as Fukushima as it’s not on a hill as you assume. Bullying Fukushima evacuees? Research found a 15% highly significant (P=0.001) increase of perinatal deaths in prefectures (areas up to 300km away) that were not evacuated despite the radio-active contamination (the (wrong) idea; little radiation increase, hence no harm). That increase was less in areas with less contamination and no increase was found in areas without contamination. So the Fukushima emitted radio-active material is the only viable explanation. Note that the increase won’t go away soon as the most important fall-out stuff has a half-life of ~30years. Your assumption: “We know “renewables” have no chance of succeeding.” is contradicted by many scientific studies. ‘Nuclear’ France govt institute ADEME concluded after simulation studies that for 2050 a renewable share of 80% regarding electricity generation would be the cheapest solution, while 100% renewable and 40% renewable would cost slightly more. So France installed in 2015 two laws: – One targets the reduction of nuclear from 75% now towards 50% in 2025 (a much faster reduction path than Germany followed); – One targets to increase the share of renewable fast. -3  |   -   Share          Member Jesper Antonsson April 17, 2017 20:39 Your junk-science on radiation isn’t worth commenting.

( My cousin lives in Ho Chi Minh City and is doing engineering on one of the coal plants. ) The Vietnamese government isn’t swayed by public misperceptions: it tells people what to think and makes sure they do. China, South Korea, and the UAE – the countries with the strongest LWR growth – are middle rank to wealthy countries. To head off climate change, we need the poor countries to be able to afford energy, and the rich ones to get their industrial heat and their transport fossil free, not just their electricity. So even though a French style government-directed buildout of light water reactors would be a good thing, I think we really do need a radically cheaper alternative. 2  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member BobMeinetz April 12, 2017 16:13 John, I’m hoping small modular reactors will fill an important void in CO2-free electricity generation in smaller economies. But for perspective, Vietnam’s total GHG emissions are less than 2% of the U.S.A.’s, and their per-capita emissions are 11% of ours. So it seems, to me, incumbent upon wealthier nations to get their act together and lead the way – to take some responsibility for the wealth they’ve (we’ve) amassed over the past two centuries as they’ve (we’ve) spewed carbon into everyone’s atmosphere. Highly-underrecognized is China’s recent conversion of a coal plant to a high-temperature gas reactor (HTGR) nuclear plant. If streamlined and cost-optimized, the process could not only bring nuclear electricity to smaller nations around the globe but realize the potential of synfuel production, using the HTGR’s high temperatures to create elemental hydrogen from water. 1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member Kgothier April 13, 2017 17:15 Both Michael and Jessica’s perspectives are valid, and relevant to the vital discussion Thomas Friedman advocates in his latest book, and we are all avoiding… Having practiced Community Development for decades, it has been my experience that all communities must first come to agreement about what they are, and want to be, before developing a clear, achievable path forward: (and that discussion can not be focused solely on our physical environment).

That tally more than doubled the prior 2009 record of $53.2 million for President Barack Obama's first inauguration, which had topped the previous 2005 record of $42.3 million for President George W. Bush, government records showed. The biggest donor by far to Trump's inauguration was Sheldon Adelson, casino magnate and founder of Las Vegas Sands Corp . He gave $5 million, according to the 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee's filing with the Federal Election Commission. Adelson declined comment. Many of the companies that donated to Trump, a Republican, have significant matters pending before the U.S. government or have been invited to White House events. Many of the companies which made donations to the 2017 event also donated to Obama's prior inauguration. For example, aerospace and defense groups Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp each donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund, the filing said. Boeing had donated $1 million to the 2013 Obama inauguration, according to the OpenSecrets website run by the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog. Money donated to the Trump inaugural committee falls into two categories, said Larry Sabato, political analyst at the University of Virginia. "It's either make-up money or it's a continuation of support by people who are invested in Trump. You don't give this kind of money to get a few tickets to inaugural balls," he said. Trump publicly criticized both Boeing and Lockheed Martin before his inauguration. In Twitter messages he said costs on Boeing's new Air Force One plane were "out of control" and urged the federal government to "Cancel order!" Trump in December sent a Twitter message saying the cost of Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jet was also "out of control." White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Wednesday that inaugurations have "pretty much been a nonpartisan activity ... This is a time-honored tradition, and I think a lot of Americans and companies and entities are proud to support the inaugural." Financial services companies and executives were among the $1-million donors to Trump's big festivities, including Charles Schwab Corp, Bank of America Corp, financier Henry Kravis and Cantor Fitzgerald Chairman Howard Lutnick. Their industry is eager for Trump to roll back regulatory reforms put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. Coal and oil companies were also prominent donors. Clifford Forrest, owner of the Rosebud Mining Co, gave $1 million. AT&T gave nearly $2.1 million in cash and services. It is seeking approval from the Trump administration to acquire Time Warner Inc. AT&T donated $4.6 million to the 2013 Obama inauguration, according to OpenSecrets. "For many years, AT&T has contributed to our nation's presidential inaugural celebrations," said AT&T spokesman Mike Balmoris. Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Kravis declined comment. Bank of America, Charles Schwab, Forrest and Lutnick did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Andy Bronson / The Herald) Aerospace blog Boeing honors top suppliers, three are from Washington Dan Catchpole Wed Apr 19th, 2017 3:51pm Business You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — Three Washington-based companies were among 13 recipients of Boeing’s 2016 Supplier of the Year awards this month. The companies beat out thousands of competitors for top honors from the aerospace giant. Last year, the Boeing Co. spent nearly $60 billion for parts and services from more than 13,000 vendors in all 50 states and 48 countries. Boeing’s success depends on having the “best team, and our supply chain is absolutely vital to those efforts,” the company’s chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, said in announcing the winners. Orion Industries won the Supplier of the Year award in the community engagement category. Orion is a supplier with a social mission. The non-profit organization aims to help people who often struggle to find long-term jobs. Working with the state, Orion seeks to get clients away from relying on jobs that are often short term and pay low wages. The non-profit provides training and other services to help clients launch higher paying and more stable careers, such as machining and manufacturing for the aerospace industry. Orion bids for work like any other supplier. It provides parts for every Boeing commercial jet. It has plants in Auburn and Mukilteo. Boeing honored Orion for making “strategic investments, engagements and advocacy to strengthen the communities where we live and work.” It is Orion’s third Supplier of the Year award. It won the outside manufacturing category in 2011 and corporate citizenship in 2015. Seattle-based Hoffman Construction Co. won the safety category. Hoffman built two new sprawling factory buildings at Boeing’s Everett plant. Both buildings are tied to Boeing’s new 777X jetliner. One is the Composite Wing Center, where Boeing is already making early production parts of the new jetliner’s advanced technology wing. The other houses Boeing’s new, highly-automated system for assembling fuselages for the 777 and 777X programs. GMN Aerospace, also based in Seattle, received the award for the alliance category. The company helps Boeing succeed by “sharing risk and through long-term relationships that support and advance Boeing’s strategic objectives,” Boeing said. The other category winners were: Environment: Nabtesco Corp., Gifu, Japan Collaboration: NIPPI Corp., Yokohama, Japan Support and Services: Victory Solutions, Inc., Huntsville, Alabama Production and Design: The EnCore Group, Huntington Beach, California Outstanding Performance: AVIC Xi’an Aircraft Industry (Group) Co., Xi’an, China Global Supplier Diversity: Gary Jet Center, Gary, Indiana Pathfinder: American Semiconductor, Boise, Idaho Technology: Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Canberra, Australia Advantage: AT&T, Dallas, Texas Innovation: University of Sheffield Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, Rotherham, United Kingdom   Most Read Mountlake Terrace teen charged with two counts of rape EVERETT — Prosecutors on Monday resurrected a rape charge against a teenager… Apr 18th, 2017 by Diana Hefley Silvertips coach Constantine out after division-title season EVERETT — Kevin Constantine is out as head coach of the Everett… Apr 18th, 2017 by Jesse Geleynse Teen sentenced to 6 months for abandoning baby in trash bin EVERETT — A 19-year-old who abandoned her newborn in a trash compactor… Apr 18th, 2017 by Rikki King What's Up With That?

(Photo: Olivier Douliery/CNP /AdMedia/Newscom) Commentary By Diane Katz / @Dianeskatz Diane Katz, who has analyzed and written on public policy issues for more than two decades, is a research fellow in regulatory policy at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research. President Donald Trump has apparently changed his mind about eliminating the crony Export-Import Bank, opting to “reform” the swamp rather than drain it. As bad as this flip-flop is, his excuses for doing so are downright pitiful. As a candidate in August 2015, Trump categorized the bank as “feather bedding,” adding, “I don’t like it. I think it’s a lot of excess baggage. I think it’s unnecessary. And when you think about free enterprise, it’s really not free enterprise.” He was right, of course, but that was then. On Friday, the president announced his intention to nominate former New Jersey Rep. Scott Garrett as bank president and former Rep. Spencer T. Bachus III to the Ex-Im board. If the two are confirmed, the bank will return to full operation after 21 months without a board quorum—which prohibited deals exceeding $10 million. And that means billions of taxpayer dollars to foreign firms and foreign governments with which to purchase exports from favored multinational companies such as Boeing, General Electric, and Caterpillar. The best course of action would be to eliminate the bank altogether. There is no shortage of private export financing, and the subsidies distort credit and labor markets. Perhaps worst of all, unsubsidized American companies are placed at a competitive disadvantage compared to the foreign firms collecting Ex-Im subsidies. (Delta, for example, loses out when Air India gets a sweetheart deal from Boeing by way of Ex-Im.) A Meritless Flip-Flop The White House is making much of the fact that Garrett has been a critic of Ex-Im, twice voting against renewal of the bank charter. That supposedly portends reform, although Congress has previously tried to do so without appreciable effect. No amount of bureaucratic tinkering can shield taxpayers from bailouts in the event that bank reserves run dry—as occurred in the 1980s—nor protect American businesses from the disadvantages of the U.S. government subsidizing their foreign competitors. In an April 12 interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump acknowledged that he had been “very much opposed” to the bank but changed his mind because “lots of small companies will really be helped. “But also maybe more importantly,” he said, “other countries give it, and … we lose a tremendous amount of business.” He also added, “So instinctively you would say it’s a ridiculous thing but actually it’s a very good thing and it actually makes money. You know, it actually could make a lot of money.” All of which is nonsense. Bank proponents focus on small firms to deflect attention from the fact that the vast majority of Ex-Im beneficiaries are titans of industry that are well-positioned to prosper without Ex-Im subsidies. They do not lack access to private capital, and most have billions of dollars of backorders with which to keep production going. In recent years, the bank supported less than half of 1 percent of small businesses—which in many cases aren’t so small. (The bank’s definition of “small business” includes manufacturers with as many as 1,500 employees and service firms and retailers with as much as $20.5 million in annual revenues.) On their own, businesses with fewer than 500 employees account for 98 percent of all firms exporting goods, and exports have reached high levels in recent years. In fiscal year 2016, for example, U.S. exports totaled $2.2 trillion, with Ex-Im supporting just 0.22 percent ($5 billion). That makes one thing very clear: Export financing obviously is not a problem for small firms in the aggregate. This is further validated by the fact that small businesses ranked “Exporting My Products/Services” as the least problematic of 75 business problems assessed in the 2016 annual survey by the National Federation of Independent Business Research Foundation. (The cost of health care ranked as the most severe problem. The president would do well to focus on that rather than resuscitate Ex-Im.) In the event that a small business cannot access private capital, it can seek to export through wholesalers or associate its business operations with larger firms or with global supply chains. The real beneficiaries are the big boys like Boeing (market cap $110 billion), and the extent to which the bank caters to the company is staggering. As of March 2014, at least 28 percent ($32 billion) of Ex-Im’s total portfolio was devoted to financing wide-body jets. In 2013, the bank authorized financing for the purchase of Boeing aircraft in 25 countries, including China, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates. Subsidies for air transport, in general, comprised more than 45 percent of all export subsidies that year. General Electric (market cap $256 billion) is another top Ex-Im beneficiary. The company began 2017 with a record backlog of $321 billion. Likewise, Caterpillar (market cap $54 billion) posted a backlog of $12 billion at the end of 2016. Ex-Im Doesn’t ‘Level the Playing Field’ The claim that U.S. companies will lose sales to foreign competitors without Ex-Im financing is also drivel. Economist Veronique de Rugy of the Mercatus Center has documented that only about a third of Ex-Im financing—which benefits just 2 percent of all U.S. exports—is designated in bank records as necessary to counter subsidized foreign competition. A whopping 66 percent of the financing classified as necessary to counteract foreign competition went to Boeing. In other words, Ex-Im Bank financing counteracts foreign subsidies for less than 1 percent of U.S. exports—with more than half the benefit accruing to Boeing. Finance costs are only one among a variety of factors that affect a purchaser’s choice of supplier. Availability, reliability, and stability all play significant parts in purchase decisions. There should be no question that U.S. firms are capable of competing successfully without corporate welfare. The claim of “competitive disadvantage” is further belied by the agreement among 31 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to abide by a set of financing rules covering loan term limits, minimum fees, and other practices. There is rarely such a thing as a “level playing field” in trade. Every country has advantages that others lack. The ingenuity and drive of American companies can, in many instances, trump the export subsidies doled out by foreign governments—assuming, of course, that tax and regulatory barriers do not further restrict free enterprise. It is silly for Ex-Im advocates to cite China’s massive subsidies as proof that Ex-Im is necessary. Do they really want America to emulate a country in which all the largest enterprises are owned by the state? As reported in The Wall Street Journal, almost 14 percent of China’s listed, nonfinancial companies’ profits are attributable to government support, according to an analysis by Wind Info. And let’s not forget that Trump campaigned on challenging China’s trade practices. He cannot now claim with any credibility that we must match its subsidies to stay competitive. An Anti-Market Institution Perhaps most disappointing, though, is the president’s defense of Ex-Im based on its potential to “make money.” That statement, out of all his others, insults the very concept of free enterprise and limited government. By that rationale, Washington should assume control of all profitable companies to feed its insatiable appetite for spending. In any event, the claim that Ex-Im is profitable is illusory: The bank uses “accrual” accounting, which does not factor in the risk of defaults related to bank financing. For example, under current accounting methods, bank officials claim that Ex-Im will return a $14 billion surplus to taxpayers in the next decade. But the Congressional Budget Office reported in 2014 that Ex–Im programs, if subjected to the fair value accounting methods required of private banks, actually operate at a deficit that will cost taxpayers some $2 billion over 10 years (in addition to the bank’s operating costs). Ex-Im advocates offer myriad excuses for maintaining government interference in export financing, including job creation, gaps in private investment, and government subsidies lavished on foreign firms. Such justifications do not stand up to the facts, and the purported benefits—if any—are not commensurate with the risk to taxpayers. The president has made a huge mistake on Ex-Im, but it isn’t too late for him to change direction—back to where he was in the first place. The Daily Signal depends on the support of readers like you.

This photo shows county representatives with Japanese officials on Friday, April 14, at the Chubu Centrair International Airport. Snohomish County airport officials have reached their first-ever agreement with a Japanese airport to work together to develop each other’s aerospace industries. County officials representing Paine Field Airport traveled to Chubu Centrair International Airport in Aichi Prefecture on April 14 to complete a memorandum of cooperation establishing a cooperative relationship between the airports. Aichi, located near the port city of Nagoya more than 200 miles from Tokyo, is known as an aerospace manufacturing hub. Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers said the agreement would benefit the county in multiple ways. “By facilitating a cooperative relationship between Paine Field Airport and Chubu Centrair Airport, we provide the opportunity for Snohomish County and Aichi Prefecture to work together to further the success of each region’s aerospace industry, as well as strengthen existing ties between our governments,” Somers said. The agreement will provide benefits to both airports and regions through the exchange of information for successfully operating airports that heavily support each region’s aerospace industry, specifically in aircraft manufacturing, as well as large air cargo freight and transportation. In addition, the airports will provide mutual assistance for projects carried out by both parties. Executive Director Kendee Yamaguchi of Somers’ office and County Councilmember Stephanie Wright traveled to Japan on the county’s behalf. Wright also serves as board treasurer of the Trade Development Alliance of Greater Seattle. “The aerospace industry and members of the community play an important role in the vitality of Snohomish County’s economy. I’m excited to see the further growth of our aerospace industry that this agreement will bring,” Wright said. Bill McSherry, vice president of Government Operations for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said Boeing supports the agreement. “These two airports, while continents apart, are linked by Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner,” he said. “In fact, both airports play an integral role in the manufacturing process of Boeing’s newest airplanes and are key to our long-term success.” Japan’s consulate general in Seattle, Masahiro Omura, said the agreement is part of an existing initiative for regional cooperation between aerospace manufacturing hubs in Washington State and central Japan. “This MOC is one of the latest achievements under the broader Memorandum of Cooperation on Economic and Trade Relations signed last June between the Governments of Japan and Washington State,” Omura said. The agreement signed last June highlights ten sectors for intended cooperation, and aerospace is one of them, with the aim of “…improving systems for developing, manufacturing and maintaining aircraft between the civil aerospace industries of Both Sides, together with promoting exchange of information and cooperation to benefit the cultivation of skilled labor in the appropriate fields of Both Sides.” Brian Bonlender, director of the Washington State Department of Commerce, said the agreement represents yet another example of the state’s proactive approach to engaging with business partners around the world. “Trade and international investment are vitally important to strengthening communities and our statewide economy,” Bonlender said. “Ever since Japan Airlines began using Moses Lake airfield in Grant County nearly 50 years ago, aerospace industry relationships have continued to thrive between our two regions.” Aerospace is the largest industry in Snohomish County. The county boasts 46,000 workers spanning 220 firms, including Boeing, Bombardier, Comac, Embraer and Sukoi, and employs 50 percent of the state’s aerospace workforce. Paine Field is home to The Boeing Company’s assembly plant for the 747, 767, 777, and 787 aircraft. Comments (0) If you wish to comment, please login. Username: Password: Join | Lost your password?

Although the firm created the cutting-edge helicopter with the US Army and Special Operations in mind, it has the potential to be used by the US Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps to carry out their specific missions. Because the X2 Technology is at the heart of RAIDER, it can carryout a variety of military missions including light assault, light attack, armed reconnaissance, close-air support, combat search and rescue, and unmanned applications. This machine is said to be a game changer for the military, as it can reach speeds that are double that of conventional helicopters. It is also designed for ‘high and hot’ operations and is capable of reaching altitudes of 10,000 feet in 95 degrees Fahrenheit heat.

Share this article Share 25 shares Sikorsky updated the craft with improved hovering capabilities and an internal aux fuel tank for extended range to 34 miles for increased endurance, New Atlas reported. And RAIDER is designed to refuel while in the air. The helicopter boasts a low acoustic signature, agility for close air support and fly-by-wire controls. But its weapons are what makes it the ultimate war machine. Strapped to the sides are hellfire missiles and rockets, RAIDER also packs a .50 caliber gun with 500 rounds and a 7.62 mm gun. RAIDER was designed and built by Sikorsky-Boeing, a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin. This machine is said to be a game changer for the military, as it can reach speeds that are double that of conventional helicopters Because the X2 Technology is at the heart of RAIDER, it can carryout a variety of military missions including light assault, light attack, armed reconnaissance, close-air support, combat search and rescue, and unmanned applications The debut of RAIDER comes just days after Lockheed unveiled a concept for another craft that could soon replace the Blackhawk helicopter. Dubbed SB>1 Defiant, the fly-by-wire concept, designed with two coaxial rotors and a pusher propeller, is said to speed through the air at nearly 300 mph and hover like a hummingbird.  The concept craft is also based on X2 Technology, allowing it to focus on speed, maneuverability and scalability.   It is also designed for ‘high and hot’ operations and is capable of reaching altitudes of 10,000 feet in 95 degrees Fahrenheit heat. 'The primary advantage that Defiant's going to offer over a traditional helicopter is, it's got twice the speed, two to three times the range, and is just an extremely maneuverable and agile platform,' said retired Marine Maj. Frank P. Conway, Boeing's experimental test pilot for both the SB>1 and the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor.  'Conway, who was a V-22 test pilot in the Marine Corps as well, flew me on a simulated ride in the SB>1.' 'He calls the Defiant 'a very hot, sexy aircraft.'  Defiant is currently being designed and built by Sikorsky-Boeing, a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin  The Defiant shown in the clip would cruise at 250 knots and hover at altitudes of 6,000 feet, David Szondy with New Atlas reported. This is more than a hundred miles an hour faster than the UH-60M Blackhawk transport, as it maxes out at 183 miles an hour. Dubbed SB>1 Defiant (pictured), the fly-by-wire concept, designed with two coaxial rotors and a pusher propeller, is said to speed through the air at nearly 300 mph and hover like a hummingbird It will also have the strength and power to carry more cargo than the average helicopters, but Lockheed is not giving all of its secrets away – it has yet to release the range and payload capacity. However, the firm is boasting about the machine's innovated design. The 'warcopter' would be equipped with foldable, ridged composite rotor blades that create less downwash when it lowers to the ground to drop off or pick off soldiers and supplies. Defiant is currently being designed and built by Sikorsky-Boeing, a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin. The  craft shown in the clip would cruise at 250 knots and hover at altitudes of 6,000 feet And the pusher propeller and active rudders will provider pilots with more stability when hovering, as a well a helping them quickly accelerate and decelerate while in flight. Defiant is designed to be more efficient when transporting soldiers – the cabin seats 12 people comfortably or eight medivac pallets - the Blackhawk can only carry 11 soldiers. The 'warcopter' would be equipped with foldable, ridged composite rotor blades that create less downwash when it lowers to the ground to drop off or pick off soldiers and supplies And there is weapon employments in all modes of flight. Lockheed also shared that the Defiant can also 'dramatically reduced acoustic signature', which means it is much quieter than traditional helicopters and can go undetected by surrounding enemies. Lockheed Martin’s Sikorsky and the Boeing Co. are still fabricating parts for the first Defiant, which is their entrant in the Army-run Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstration (JMR TD) program.  It will also have the strength and power to carry more cargo than the average helicopters, but Lockheed is not giving all of its secrets away – it has yet to release the range and payload capacity   Read more: Lockheed Martin details Sikorsky-Boeing Future Vertical Lift concept S-97 Raider co-axial helicopter showcased in new video Share or comment on this article e-mail 25 shares Most watched News videos Farmer gives very 'country' account of car crash and bee attack Players in disbelief as sex noises halt tennis match Irish woman's shocking racist rant against Indian passenger North Korean performance shows simulated bombing of US city Man shows 'incredible strength' to pull off one-armed push-ups 'Will my kids be okay?': PTSD sufferer asks Prince William Brutal footage shows bouncer punching woman in the face Former Patriot Aaron Hernandez found hanging in his prison cell AFL player receives awkward massage from female physio Dramatic moment drinker attacks landlady in pub beer garden 'Need some help?': Gronk crashes Spicer's press briefing Moment Two-year-old gets emotional when listening to opera Revealed: Disgraced Patriots star Aaron Hernandez may...

The latest in 3D printing news concerns Boeing which has announced plans to start using 3D-printed titanium parts in the 787 Dreamliner jet.  Boeing has partnered with Norwegian company Norsk Titanium—the company building and supplying the first 3D-printed structural components approved for use by the Federal Aviation Authority. Boeing estimates that by using the printed titanium parts, they could save up to $3 million in construction costs per plane built. Since the company produces approximately 144 planes per year, they stand to save up to $432 million annually.  While the parts are made by laying down layers of metal, built up additively, for a finished, single part, technically, the process is more like welding layers of metal dust. The end result components are robust because they involve fewer separated parts than traditionally-machined components, cheaper because they're built in one go and can be made to be more complex since they can be constructed from the inside out. Later this year, Norsk expects to get approval for its entire manufacturing process in order to produce even more commercial airplane parts for Boeing and other firms.  SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?  Will this open the floodgates for 3D printed parts in manufacturing? Do you think manufacturers could increase cost savings by incorporating more 3D printed parts? Tell us what you think by leaving your comments below.  Hydrophobic Material A recent discovery by researchers could be a game changer in hydrophobic technology.  The new material, developed at the University of Michigan, is a combination of fluorinated polyurethane elastomer and a specialized water-repellent molecule called “F-POSS”. The mixture can be easily sprayed onto just about any surface. What makes this different from other hydrophobic materials is its ultra-durability and self-healing nature. When molecules of the coating are scraped away, other molecules migrate to fill in the gaps. Researchers say the coating has the ability to restore water resistance hundreds of times when damaged. In tests, the material was abraded, scratched, burned, plasma-cleaned, flattened, sonicated and chemically attacked. After each assault, the material self-healed and continued being water resistant. Researchers say the new hydrophobic technology could be used to lower the resistance of ship hulls thus reducing fuel consumption.  Company HygraTek, with the help of the University, plans to bring the material to market with spray-on coatings a water-repellent fabrics possibly available by the end of the year. SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?  In what ways do you see this hydrophobic technology being used in a manufacturing environment? Tell us what you think in the comments below.

American taxpayers could soon find out if they got their money's worth from the costliest fighter jets in the U.S. arsenal, as new air-defense systems render the legacy fleet too vulnerable to lead the charge in contested airspace. Russia's S-400 system, which is deployed in Syria and spreading to other U.S. adversaries, poses a particular threat to "fourth generation" aircraft like the F-16, F-15 and F/A-18. Analysts and military officials believe that Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-22 and F-35 as well as Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-2 bomber could be the only aircraft effective against the S-400 due to their stealth capabilities. "Fourth gen will continue to have a role in some of these other areas we are looking," said Lt. Gen. Jerry Harris — the Air Force's deputy chief of staff for strategic plans, programs and requirements — after a Senate hearing in March. "But, again, as the world grows and these threats proliferate in Syria and Iran and other locations, they are going to push fourth gen out quicker than planned." The accelerated threat assessment comes as President Trump looks to add at least 100 combat aircraft to the U.S. fleet. He hasn't specified which models will be in the mix but has been critical of the F-35's $400 billion acquisition price tag, hinting it could be pitted against Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet and saying in February that he was "looking seriously at a big order." The implications for the defense industry extend beyond Lockheed's F-35, which several U.S. allies are buying in addition to the 2,443 the Pentagon is procuring for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. Boeing is trying to maintain a foothold in the combat aircraft market after losing the B-21 bomber contract to Northrop, and wants to keep its Super Hornet in production despite international demand for more advanced fighters. And last year, Congress asked the Air Force to assess the costs of restarting Lockheed's F-22 program, which was canceled in 2009 less than halfway through its production run due to spiraling costs. For now, the still-limited availability of fifth-generation fighters like the F-22 and F-35 means the backbone of the U.S. fighter fleet will continue to be older planes. The Air Force said earlier this month that it will extend the service life of the F-16 by 50% to 12,000 flight hours as the service hopes to keep the plane flying until the 2040s. And Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein recently sounded ambivalent about retiring the F-15 next decade as planned. IBD'S TAKE: The Aerospace/Defense industry group has climbed 19% since the election, as Trump promises to increase defense spending. Raytheon re-entered buy range, and Northrop is forming a cup-with-handle base with a 249.53 buy point while Lockheed looks to regain its 270 buy point. Boeing is consolidating in a flat base with a 185.81 buy point. Why The S-400 Is Different While U.S. airspace dominance has gone unquestioned for decades, the S-400's introduction has helped tip the scales, and growing tensions with Russia and its allies are making the skies above the Middle East more dangerous. After the U.S. launched Raytheon (RTN) Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase April 6 in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack by President Bashar Assad's forces, the Kremlin vowed to deploy more air defenses to Syria "very soon," according to Russia's Interfax. Until then, the U.S. had avoided Assad's military. But with the U.S. mission in Syria possibly expanding, American pilots may find themselves intentionally or unintentionally in the S-400's cross hairs. Russia already has one of its S-400 systems in western Syria near Turkey, but it's possible another could be among those deployed to beef up Syrian defenses. Russia claims the system can track 300 targets simultaneously and has an operational range of up to 250 nautical miles. China finalized an order for the S-400 in 2015 with delivery expected next year, and an even more advanced S-500 is in the works.  Moscow may be exaggerating the S-400's details. But what's widely accepted is that it represents a unique threat to the U.S. because of its ability to detect incoming aircraft from longer ranges. The S-400's radar can spot a fourth-generation fighter before the fighter's radar can pick up the air-defense system, according to Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS. A stealth fighter, however, would only be detectable at close range. The F-22 has 360-degree stealth, while the infrared signature of the F-35's engine makes it more vulnerable from the back, Bobbi noted. Still, he thinks the F-35 "would lead the parade" if and when it's deployed to Syria. Even before this month's Tomahawk missile strikes, the shift in the threat landscape was already becoming clear. "We think the only thing that can operate in and through that environment is going to be fifth generation," Harris told reporters after the March Senate hearing. F-22s are currently flying in Syria, where they flew their first-ever combat missions in 2014 as the U.S. began hitting Islamic State targets. The Pentagon wouldn't say if the recent attacks on the Assad regime moved up the timeline for deploying the F-35 to the Middle East, but a spokesperson for Air Combat Command said that commanders could request the stealth fighter if it met their needs. The Air Force deployed the F-35A to the U.K. earlier this month for NATO exercises. For more on top business trends and how to make more money in the stock market, follow IBD on Facebook. Balancing Stealth Vs. Firepower Maintaining a military edge comes at a cost. The Trump administration has vowed to boost Pentagon spending but is also scrutinizing individual programs. Earlier this year, Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a review of the F-35's costs as well as options for upgrading F/A-18 Super Hornets. The basic F-35A model costs about $95 million each under the latest production contract, but versions for the Navy and Marines are more expensive. The current Super Hornet version costs $52 million to $61 million, depending on the model. By the time F-22 production ended, the per-plane cost was about $140 million, though total procurement topped $60 billion to get 187 planes in operation. Advocates periodically have called for making more, even though Lockheed has shut down the production line. A 2011 RAND study put the cost of building 75 more F-22s at $13.7 billion to $17.4 billion in 2008 dollars. The Air Force has maintained that a restart would be too expensive and would take away resources from the F-35 and other programs. To be sure, fifth-generation fighters aren't invincible — and aren't invisible. "Even fifth generation would be challenged to penetrate in certain ranges against these very capable air-missile-defense systems," said Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments and a retired Air Force colonel, noting China has developed its own "very advanced" HQ-9 air-defense system. But he said the S-400 wouldn't create "no-go zones" for the U.S. and allies. And a trade-off of stealth fighters is that maintaining a low-observable radar profile means they can't carry as many missiles and bombs under their wings. As a result, fourth-generation fighters can bring more firepower, and there are ways to reduce their detectability too. Boeing has proposed a stealthier version of the Super Hornet, which would have a special radar-evading coating and wouldn't have fuel tanks under the wings, Dan Gillian, Boeing's F/A-18 and EA-18 program manager, said at an industry conference earlier this month. He added that the advanced Super Hornet would be "complementary" to the F-35 with its long-range infrared search-and-track system and deeper magazine that holds more munitions than the Navy's F-35C variant can. The F-35 As 'Quarterback' Fourth-generation fighters won't be obsolete and should continue playing a key role in combat as part of a one-two punch with their stealthier counterparts. Lockheed's website describes the F-35 as the "quarterback" of a joint strike force that can "share what it sees with other aircraft to expand situational awareness across the entire network of aircraft." Also, pitting a plane against an air-defense system or other threat in a head-to-head competition is the "wrong way to think," said Gunzinger. Instead, the focus should be on how fifth- and fourth-generation fighters — along with jamming aircraft like Boeing's EA-18G Growler, cyber operations and unmanned systems — can work together to take down a threat, he added. "It's a family of systems," said the Air Force's Harris. "It's going to be our fifth generation that goes into a threat environment like that and kick down the door. And then maybe after those threats have been suppressed, allow fourth generation back into the fight."

By Rachel Middleton April 19, 2017 04:53 BST Close Malaysia Airlines MH370 search to be suspended Reuters Authorities undertaking the search for the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 have come under fire from relatives of the passengers on board the Boeing 777, after they refused to release material pertaining to the missing aircraft. The Australian newspaper, which tried to obtain information via a Freedom of Information (FOI) request, said that the Australian Transport Safety Bureau's Chief Commissioner Greg Hood invoked the Transport Safety Investigation Act in rejecting the request. He said the act covers the FOI request for critical documents the ATSB claims support its "ghost flight" and "death dive" scenario, which officials claim resulted in the Boeing 777 going down in an unpiloted crash. The newspaper was trying to get access to the opinions of international experts, including those from the US and British air crash agencies, Boeing, aerospace group Thales and the British satellite group Inmarsat. The Australian claims that some ATSB officials are having "second thoughts" about the agency's official line that the pilots on board were either unconscious or dead at the end of the flight. In February, ATSB general manager for strategic capability, Colin McNamara threw out The Australian's FOI request, claiming the information could "cause damage to the international relations of the commonwealth." Following an internal review of McNamara's decision, Hood also refused to release the documents sought, saying: "The activities of the ATSB with respect in assisting the Malaysian investigation are covered by the TSI Act." He also warned that if a serving or former ATSB staff or consultant "discloses information to any person or to a court; and the information is restricted," they have breached the act. Any breach carries a two year jail sentence, The Australian reported. Malaysia says not hiding anything The fate of MH370 is one of aviation's biggest unsolved mysteriesReuters Meanwhile Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said that it was unfair to accuse the Malaysian and Australian governments of hiding information. He said that all next-of-kin of those on board the missing flight have been given access to the latest details on the investigation, which is published on a website and updated weekly. "Wait for a full investigation report to come out, then everyone will get to see it. We cannot give everybody these details," he said, reports FreeMalaysiaToday.com. He told the website that Malaysia was "very thankful to Australia and China, who have helped us all along." Malaysia's transport minister Liow Tiong Lai at a news conference about debris found on a beach in Mozambique.Reuters The final report on the investigation into the missing aircraft is expected to be released at the end of the year. He said that the seven-member International Civil Aviation Annexe 13 safety investigation team led by Kok Soo Chon, the former Malaysian Civil Aviation Department director-general, was working "around the clock to complete the investigation." The investigation team comprises aviation experts from the US, China, France, Australia as well as from Boeing and Inmarsat. MH370, with a total of 239 passengers and staff on board was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on 8 March, 2014 when it disappeared. Satellite tracking data appears to confirm that the plane crashed in the Indian Ocean, southwest of Australia, but a massive underwater search operation led by the ATSB and funded by Australia, China and Malaysia was called off in January 2017 after failing to locate the aircraft.

(Al Cannon Detention Center) VIEW PHOTO GALLERY3 photos AA NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCIV) - Authorities have arrested a second man in connection with a fake bomb threat made against Boeing’s North Charleston plant last year. Charleston County Aviation Authority Police say Devon Maurice Wigfall called in a bomb threat on behalf of Jermaine Mustapher on Sept. 22, 2016. Both have been arrested and charged with making bomb threats. Mustapher was arrested Monday, April 17, in Berkeley County after a traffic stop showed he was wanted in connection to the Boeing threat. RELATED | Boeing facility evacuated after threat; no bomb found Wigfall was arrested Oct. 19, 2016. Investigators say Mustapher was a contracted plumber working on the Boeing site. Wigfall told investigators Mustapher asked him to call his supervisor and say there was an emergency and that Mustapher needed to leave early. Instead, authorities say Wigfall told them he decided to call in a bomb threat. Boeing’s two main construction buildings were evacuated while police searched the area. No bomb was found. Officials say Wigfall used a prepaid phone to call in the threat, and used the *67 feature to hide his number, thinking no one would be able to trace it back to him. Police say they were able to get all the information they needed from Verizon, however. Phone records show Wifgall and Mustapher spoke on the phone four times the day the bomb threat was made. Investigators say when they questioned Mustapher in October, he insisted Wigfall was only an acquaintance of his and did not have his phone number, so they could not have spoken, despite a detective presenting him a copy of phone records showing their conversations. Mustapher was laid off from his contracted position at Boeing Oct. 19, the same day Wigfall was arrested. Wigfall was released from jail in March. Mustapher remains in jail. close Trending 1   Couple charged with severe beating of 7-week-old baby 2   Authorities investigate after woman found dead in Buncombe County home 3   Aaron Hernandez commits suicide in prison; prison launches death investigation 4   Impeachment of Cherokee chief goes before Grand Council 5   7 charged, 3 on the run after authorities seize 20 pounds of meth and $500,000 DON'T MISS OUT Stay Connected with WLOS Like Follow © 2016 Sinclair Broadcast Group TermsPrivacyFCC InfoEEO News In Pictures Buncombe County Fugitives (04-19-17) 7 charged, 3 on the run after authorities seize 20 pounds of meth and $500,000 Authorities investigate after woman found dead in Buncombe County home Baked Pie Company opens in South Asheville ShareTweet × Trending 1 Couple charged with severe beating of 7-week-old baby 2 Authorities investigate after woman found dead in Buncombe County home 3 Aaron Hernandez commits suicide in prison; prison launches death investigation 4 Impeachment of Cherokee chief goes before Grand Council 5 7 charged, 3 on the run after authorities seize 20 pounds of meth and $500,000 6 Top local stories we are following today 7 Baked Pie Company opens in South Asheville 8 Buncombe County Fugitives (04-19-17) 9 Riverbend Marketplace's Rue21 to close 10 Texas mom accused of holding lighter to baby's hand, sending videos of abuse to dad

(T) Stock Will Keep On Truckin’ With This Move UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH) Stock Is a Clear Winner After Q1 Beat View All Posts News of recent layoffs might have caused shares of Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) to lose some altitude over the past month, but don’t hold your breath waiting for BA stock to land. Source: Phillip Capper via Flickr Aimed at offsetting weak aircraft sales, the Chicago-based company will reduce its engineering workforce by about 1,800 people effective June 23. The announcement by the company sent BA stock down more than 1% on Monday. But ahead of its fiscal first-quarter 2017 earnings results due out next week, BA shares — up 15% year-to-date — can still fly higher. The Strengths for Boeing Stock Boeing is sitting in first class in terms of orders. The company, which recently signed a deal with Adient PLC (NYSE:ADNT) to create better, more functional aircraft seating for its airplanes, currently has a $473 billion backlog of aircraft orders with more than 5,700 commercial airplane orders it can still rely on. When it’s all said and done, Boeing will deliver between 765 to 800 planes this year, well above 2016 deliveries. Furthermore, BA expects 2017 revenue to be between $90.5 billion and $92.5 billion, much higher than analysts forecasted. And to say nothing about the umber of contracts Boeing has secured from the Pentagon. Most recently, the company secured a $983 million deal from the U.S. Air Force to provide engineering support services. And with the company enjoying higher revenue and margins in its Defense, Space & Security segment, BA stock is one to own ahead of next week’s results. For the three months that ended in March, Wall Street now expects Boeing to earn $1.96 per share on revenue of $21.48 billion, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company earned $1.74 per share on revenue of $22.63 billion. For the full year, ending in December, earnings are projected to rise 29% year-over-year to $9.36 per share, while revenue of $92.15 billion would decline 2.6% YoY. Indeed, the fact that revenue for both the quarter and full year are projected to decline would be discouraging. But declining revenues have stopped Boeing stock, which pays a 3.2% annual yield, from delivering almost 30% in earnings growth. To that end, Monday’s announcement regarding layoffs — aimed at cutting costs — could be a positive for BA, especially when it implies that the company’s $473 billion order backlog won’t be impacted. Bottom Line for BA Stock Boeing’s attractive combination of income and value should keep BA stock flying high for much of 2017. Combined with the company’s announcement on Mar. 27, saying it will raise list price of every one of its planes in order to recover higher manufacturing costs including labor, BA stock has no plans to crash land. As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

By Paul Blumenthal 1.5k 49 WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s inaugural committee raised $106.7 million, making the event the most expensive inauguration in U.S. history. Most of this money came from wealthy donors and corporations that chipped in at least $250,000 ― many of which have benefited from policies enacted by the president during his first weeks in office. One example is Boeing Company, which donated $1 million. The aerospace defense contractor is an ardent supporter of the Export-Import Bank, a government-backed lender that conservatives have targeted for elimination. Trump was skeptical of the bank during his presidential campaign, but did an about-face on April 12 when he announced plans to reinvigorate it. His decision came one day after an in-person meeting with Boeing CEO Jim McNerney. GEO Group, the nation’s second-largest private prison company, donated $250,000 to Trump’s inaugural committee. It had previously donated $225,000 to super PACs supporting his presidential campaign. Corrections Corporation of America in Tennessee, another private prison company, also gave $250,000 to the inaugural committee. Private prison companies have benefited significantly from Trump’s policies, perhaps more than any other private-sector industry. Under the leadership of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Department of Justice ended the Obama administration’s policy of phasing out the use of private prisons for federal incarceration.  The first few weeks of Trump’s administration have also been very good for mining, oil and chemical companies ― many of which were big supporters of his inauguration. Dow Chemical gave $1 million; Exxon Mobil Corp. gave $500,000; Chevron gave $525,000; Citgo and BP Corporation each gave $500,000. Coal company owners Joseph Craft and Christopher Cline each gave an additional $1 million, as did chemical and mining company head Clifford Forrest. Trump has picked oil, gas and chemical industry-friendly people to work in the Environmental Protection Agency. He nominated Scott Pruitt to head the EPA, and Nancy Beck, a former director at a chemical industry lobbyist group, is running the agency’s chemicals oversight office. Makan Delrahim, Trump’s choice to head the DOJ’s antitrust office, is a lawyer and lobbyist who has helped companies navigate the merger process. This selection may have been helpful for some major donors. Dow is currently in the middle of merger negotiations with the government over its attempt to join with rival DuPont.  And health insurer Anthem, which made a $1 million donation to Trump’s inaugural committee, was pursuing a merger with Cigna until a federal judge blocked the move in February. Jonathan Ernst / Reuters President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Freedom Ball in honor of his inauguration in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 20.  Other corporate giants that chipped in to help fund Trump’s lavish receptions, balls and inaugural parade include AT&T ($2 million), Bank of America ($1 million), Pfizer ($1 million), Qualcomm ($1 million), Reynolds American ($1 million), Fidelity ($750,000), Quicken Loans ($750,000), Florida Crystals Corp. ($500,000), Microsoft ($500,000), Altria ($500,000), Intel ($500,000), Amgen ($500,000) and General Motors ($498,650). Owners of NFL teams also gave big to Trump’s inauguration. The owners of the Jacksonville Jaguars, Los Angeles Rams, Dallas Cowboys, New England Patriots, Washington Redskins, New York Jets and Houston Texans each gave $1 million. Trump has repeatedly injected himself into controversies surrounding football. He attacked NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for protesting against police abusing African-Americans, and suggested that football had gone “soft” when it changed rules to address increasing evidence that the sport can cause severe neurological problems. Billionaire casino oligarch Sheldon Adelson was the largest donor, giving $5 million. Trump assailed Adelson’s influence over other candidates during the Republican Party primary, but the 83-year-old eventually wound up being the single largest donor to Trump’s general election campaign. The intensely pro-Israel Adelson has praised Trump’s policies on the country and has said that he will be “the best president for Israel ever.” One corporation stands out among those that donated to the president’s inauguration. Google gave $285,000, but just weeks later spoke out against Trump’s travel ban targeting people from Muslim-majority countries and joined a legal brief against it. The company also created a $4 million fund to be distributed among the American Civil Liberties Union, Immigrant Legal Resource Center, International Rescue Committee and the United Nations’ refugee agency.

A Laughable Attack from Pro-BAT Lobbyists Share article on Facebookshare Tweet articletweet Plus one article on Google Plus+1 Print Article Adjust font size AA AA AA AA AA AA AA by Veronique de Rugy April 19, 2017 2:07 PM You know you are doing something right when lobbyists and interest groups are attacking you and when their main line of attack is that you are allegedly a paid shill for some corporate interest. Case in point: Lobbyists for Boeing, GE, and other big interest groups united under the American Made Coalition banner sent out yet another e-mail protesting my position on the border-adjustment tax. This time around (there were others), the article that offended them is one I wrote with the Cato Institute’s Dan Mitchell in the Wall Street Journal. It’s worth noting that Dan Mitchell and I have a long track record of 1) fighting against destination-based taxes, which the border-adjustment tax is an example of, 2) fighting for tax competition, which would be undermined with a BAT, and 3) a very long track record of fighting for free-markets and against policies that would expand the government (whether they are being pushed by Democrats or Republicans). The coalition, on the other hand, is made up of actual lobbyists paid by special interests who think they will benefit from the measure, which makes their allegations of us being hired guns pretty laughable. In our article, we debunk the claim that other countries’ VATs are creating an unlevel playing field and are unfair to U.S. companies. As I have written many times in the Corner, I am sure it makes for a great sound bite but it is simply not true. Other countries’ tax systems are not the problem. The United States is the cause of our problems because of our super-higher corporate tax rate and worldwide tax system. Yet, the lobbyists from this American Made coalition and others are eagerly pushing this line to make the case that we need to impose a 20 percent tax on imports and exempt all exports. Interestingly, in their e-mail they make zero mention of this, even though it was the main point of our article. So of course, being the optimist that I am, I am hoping that it means they have given up on using this misleading argument! Instead, they complain about a paragraph in our article that argues that currencies are unlikely to fully and rapidly adjust. They write: And while de Rugy and co-author Daniel Mitchell have to reach all the way back to 2005 to find a study that supports their position, more recent work done by the Department of Treasury and others makes clear that when other countries have incorporated border adjustments into their tax codes, the currency markets worked to protect consumers: The Office of Tax Analysis asserts in a January 2017 report that border adjustment does not have trade effects because after-tax prices on domestic goods have risen relative to foreign prices as anticipated. An April 2017 report from the Peterson Institute for International Economics drew a similar conclusion, asserting countries implementing border-adjusted consumption taxes experienced a rise in real exchange rates. Leaving aside the fact that there is much more than one article raising questions about the likelihood of a full and rapid currency adjustment, it’s pretty interesting that they should mention the two articles above to make their case to the contrary. For instance, the Peterson Institute article looks at examples of adjustments after the implementation of a VAT and finds that currency will ultimately adjust but that it may take up to three years, which I wouldn’t call an “immediate adjustment.” I would add that such an amount of transition time could be lethal for some companies. The Peterson study also notes that the VAT study findings do require some serious caveats if you want to apply it to the House Republican Tax Blueprint. First, border-adjusting the corporate income tax “differs in important ways” from implementing a VAT. This in turn may have important consequences in terms of how and how much adjustments happen. Second, the “United is special” and such an adjustment “might disrupt the global financial system given the dollar’s dominant role in finance.” Third, the dominance may mean a failure to adjust fully and a need for prices to go up. They write: Alternatively, the special role of the dollar could mean that the nominal exchange rate responds only partially to trade pressures, especially if other countries resist the corresponding depreciation of their currencies. Limits on dollar appreciation would force the adjustment to come through US prices and wages instead. It would take time for prices and wages to reach a new equilibrium, because wages are set in advance through contracts, and the Federal Reserve may not accommodate the full shift. Fourth, and this is a biggie, the House proposal requires a large 25 percent adjustment of our currency to avoid disruption after the introduction of the 20 percent BAT. As the authors, Caroline Freund and Joseph E. Gagnon, note, “Whether adjustment eventually comes through a 25 percent dollar appreciation or a 25 percent increase in US wages and prices or some combination of the two, these adjustments are large, and much larger than the events studied in this paper, and hence more likely to be disruptive.” In other words, I don’t think this study makes a strong case for their position. I could go on and on but I am happy to settle for this: There is a great deal of uncertainty around the issue and asserting that we know for sure that the adjustment will be big enough and immediate lacks real humility. Currency traders and strategists — whose jobs and pay are based on observing and predicting the changes in a $5.1 trillion-per-day currency market — say the following: You’d be hard-pressed to find anyone in the market who believes it will result in the greenback strengthening 25 percent, as the plan suggests. Part of the reason has to do with what they see as a misinterpretation of the underlying theory when applied to the real world. But just as important is the fundamental failure of politicians to appreciate how unpredictable the vast, foreign-exchange market can be, especially when global economic drivers collide and trillions of dollars change hands every day. “The FX market is the most difficult thing to forecast, and to build an inter-generational tax reform based on the assumption of what the FX market will do is a laughable notion,” David Woo, the head of global rates and FX strategy at Bank of America, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. I could also add that being such a cheerleader for large adjustment ignores that they alone are likely to cause unpleasant major distortions. Finally, once again the lobbyists are unhappy that Mitchell and I ignore the rest of the Republican tax plan to focus on the BAT. But that point doesn’t hold water. Sure, we like the rest of the plan a lot. Sure we believe that it would be great to implement it without a BAT. Sure, we know that the rest of the plan would trigger economic growth. But agreeing to a BAT because the rest of the plan is great is like saying that it is always a good idea to buy an awesome house in a bad neighborhood. It’s not — and most people will decide to pass on the awesome house to get their second- or third-favorite house rather than live in that neighborhood. The same is true here. We would love the plan without the BAT. But with it, it’s not a risk worth taking, especially considering that there are other things that can be done — better neighborhoods and second-best houses if you will. The Corner The one and only.

News Local news Clout Street Boeing gives $1 million to Trump inauguration committee, among many Illinois donors The presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. Katherine SkibaContact ReporterChicago Tribune Privacy Policy The Boeing Co. and MacNeil Automotive Products Ltd. of Bolingbrook gave $1 million each to the record-breaking fundraising effort to pay for President Donald Trump's inauguration, putting them among scores of Illinois contributors. The top individual donors from Illinois included Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein of Lake Forest, who gave a combined $500,000 to Trump's inauguration committee. Richard Uihlein owns the shipping, packaging and industrial supply firm Uline and has been a major contributor to Republican causes in Illinois and across the country. The inaugural committee filed a report showing it raised in excess of $106.7 million, a record-shattering sum for a presidential swearing-in. As they released the names of donors and their gifts as required, Trump's inaugural planners said in a statement that the events they put on made for "one of the most accessible and affordable inaugurations for the public in recent history." Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said Wednesday that the $1 million donation hewed to the firm's tradition of giving to inauguration committees. In December before he was sworn in, Trump tweeted that the costs of a planned upgrade for Air Force One being handled by Boeing were "out of control." He added: "Cancel order!" Billionaires, corporations, NFL owners helped Trump raise record $107 million for inauguration Nancy Benac and Julie Bykowicz Billionaires, corporations and NFL owners opened their wallets in a big way to help President Donald Trump raise a record-shattering $107 million for his inaugural festivities, records released by the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday show.

Billionaires, corporations and NFL owners opened their wallets in a big way to help President Donald Trump raise a record-shattering $107 million for his inaugural festivities, records released by the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday show. The amount about doubled the record set by President... (Nancy Benac and Julie Bykowicz) "We contributed to this inauguration continuing our bipartisan tradition of support the Boeing Company has given to inaugurations, Democratic and Republican, for many years now," said Johndroe, vice president of communications for government operations. He said the company expected nothing in return. MacNeil Automotive Products, another million-dollar donor, does business as WeatherTech and makes accessories such as car floor mats and cargo liners. In an interview Wednesday, CEO David MacNeil said he went to Trump's inauguration — his first — with two of his three children and attended some associated events. But he said "there were a lot of people at the events" and he didn't think his gift led to any special perks. MacNeil said he supports Trumps' pro-jobs focus. "I really want to support America, I want to support the office of the president of the United States and I completely agree with his message about American jobs, American manufacturing and buy American," he said. And the Uihleins scored good seats to the swearing-in, when Richard Uihlein sported a black ball cap that read: "01.20.17. just can't wait!" The couple said then that they had attended a candlelit dinner with Trump at Union Station in Washington a day earlier. Other major Illinois donors include oil and gas giant BP Corp. North America, which has a campus in Naperville and gave $500,000. The Jennifer Pritzker Revocable Trust in Evanston and the Brown Legacy Group in Chicago gave $250,000 each. Jennifer Pritzker is one of the billionaire heirs to the Hyatt hotel chain. Brown Legacy Group works to develop companies, especially in the health care sector. "Yes, BP made a significant contribution to Presidential Inaugural Committee and looks forward to working with President Trump and his administration to devise energy policies that encourage investment and job creation while also protecting the environment and securing America's energy future," Geoff Morrell, senior vice president of U.S. communications and external affairs for BP America Inc., said in a statement. Three donors from Illinois each gave $100,000. Hedge fund manager Ken Griffin of Chicago, a major backer of Gov. Bruce Rauner, was among them. Griffin is founder and CEO of Citadel, where a spokesman declined to comment. Investor Muneer Satter of Oak Brook and James Liautaud of Champaign, the founder of Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches, also reached the six-figure mark. The report, given to the Federal Election Commission, showed many Illinoisans chipped in for Trump's inaugural festivities in smaller amounts even though the state favored Democrat Hillary Clinton in the election. Some of the other Illinois donors did not respond to requests for comment; others could not be reached. kskiba@chicagotribune.com Twitter @KatherineSkiba Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune Donald Trump Ken Griffin Lake Forest Bolingbrook Federal Election Commission Targeted by Obama, DeVry and other for-profit colleges rebounding under Trump Future hazy for 100,000 Illinoisans brought to U.S. illegally as children Thousands crowd Daley Plaza for Tax Day march to demand Trump release tax returns Sports Breaking Eat.Drink.Do.

On July 1, 2002, a passenger jet collided with Boeing cargo airplane. 71 people died, including 52 children. Children and wife of architect from Vladikavkaz Vitaly Kaloyev were among them. About two years later, Kaloyev killed air traffic controller Peter Nielsen, who was considered to be the main culprit of the accident. He was sentenced to eight years in prison. There are still many different view on the events of those days: some people sided with grieving father, others condemned Kaloyev for committing a monstrous crime. Documentary book about Vitaly Kaloyev "Collision" was presented in Moscow yesterday. In this book, Kaloyev tells about the events that changed his life, about the murder of Peter Nielsen and whether it was an accident. Author of the book, Ksenia Kaspari, said that as a journalist, she wrote a lot about this tragedy. "This story shocked me. There were a lot of unknown facts. When Kaloyev was released, my acquaintances from Hollywood came to me and asked to find him. They wanted to buy all the rights for his history for 10 thousand dollars," she said. "After some time I visited him in Vladikavkaz. First time, I spent a week there. Vitaly Konstantinovich and I talked endlessly for the entire week. Thanks to him, I saw the North Caucasus for the first time, visited both Ingushetia and Grozny, because he was deputy head of the Ministry of Construction and Architecture of North Ossetia at that time. He traveled a lot and I accompanied him. We talked, and talked, and talked. He told me a lot about all the circumstances, about everything he felt," Kaspari said. Commenting on Kaloyev's actions on the day of murder, Kaspari noted: "He simply had no choice. Proud Caucasian man was pushed to the wall and told: 'Take the money and shut up.' Of course, he couldn't stand this situation and acted the way he did." According to writer, this book presents a slightly different version of the Nielsen murder, because story that we all know, that Kaloyev came to Nielsen, showed him pictures of his children, Nielsen pushed his hand, pictures fell to the ground and Kaloyev didn't remember what happened next - it's not how it happened. "You will learn what really happened in my book, I don't want to spoil it... It could have be avoided if Nielsen acted differently, that's for sure. Vitaly Konstantinovich himself talks about this all the time. Vitaly Kaloyev expected an apology. It was very important for him. If Nielsen said: 'Forgive me, I wanted to talk with you, but bureaucrats, lawyers didn't allow me to,' then Vitaly Konstantinovich would never do what he did." 1215 views Articles Russia Russian news Society Vitaly Koloyev Ksenia Kaspari More ...

The president's inaugural committee raised $106.7 million, about double what was raised for President Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration, a Federal Election Commission filing shows. The biggest chunk of that haul came from casino magnate and major Republican donor Sheldon Adelson, who contributed $5 million. The inauguration festivities took place on the weekend of Jan. 20, and many top donors got access to Trump and top administration officials. The donors did not need to be disclosed until 90 days after the inauguration. Donors who gave more than $1 million, for instance, received tickets to a luncheon with Cabinet appointees and congressional leaders. Contributors who chipped in $500,000 could attend a dinner with Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen. Here are other notable contributors, which include huge corporations and wealthy individuals. The contributors are based on an initial CNBC review of the filings. Donations appeared to come in sums as small as $50 and as large as $5 million. Telecom giant AT&T gave more than $2 million for the event. Part of the sum was listed as an in-kind payment for mobile equipment and software. Financial companies showed up frequently in the filing. Bank of America gave $1 million, while JPMorgan Chase and American Financial Group gave $500,000 each. Shares of banks have performed well since Trump's election, partly due to his pledges to roll back regulations on the financial industry. Energy companies, which Trump has pledged to empower through his efforts to roll back environmental regulations, also gave heavily to his inaugural committee. Chevron Products contributed $525,000, Citgo Petroleum gave $500,000, Exxon chipped in $500,000 and Murray Energy gave $300,000. Anadarko Petroleum and Continental Resource gave $100,000 each. Technology companies also show up on the report. Microsoft gave $500,000, part of which is listed as an in-kind contribution for equipment. Intel contributed $500,000, while Google gave $285,000. Businesses that Trump has publicly criticized also made major contributions to the inaugural committee. Boeing, which the president has criticized for the cost of its Air Force One contract, gave $1 million. General Motors, which Trump has slammed for putting some of its production outside of the United States, gave $498,650, partly in-kind contributions for vehicle expenses. Individual business and investing giants also gave huge contributions to the inauguration. Hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen gave $1 million, as did Robert Mercer, a major Republican donor. Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone CEO and chairman of Trump's business council, contributed $250,000. John Paulson, a hedge fund manager and Trump campaign advisor, also donated $250,000. Another hedge fund manager, Kenneth Griffin, gave $100,000. Sports team owners also had a major role in funding Trump's inauguration. Kraft Group, founded by New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, gave $1 million. The team visited the White House on Wednesday to celebrate its Super Bowl win. Houston Texans owner Robert McNair gave $1 million. The Madison Square Garden Company, which owns the New York Knicks and New York Rangers, also contributed $1 million.

Source: Sikorsky Sikorsky-Boeing foresees no special challenges in scaling-up the technology developed for the X2 compound helicopter into the larger SB>1 Defiant that is being built for the US Army's Joint MultiRole - Technology Demonstrator (JMR-TD)/Future Vertical Lift (FVL) effort. An artist's impression of the SB&gt;1 Defiant, which Sikorsky-Boeing is developing for the US Army's Joint MultiRole - Technology Demonstrator (JMR-TD)/ Future Vertical Lift (FVL) effort. (Sikorsky) Speaking to reporters on 18 April, programme leaders said that recently aired comments in the media that the X2's rigid co-axial rotor and pusher propeller technology could not be scaled-up into the Defiant were wide of the mark, and that there should be no problems in doing so. "There have been some comments as to whether the X2 scales-up to the [Defiant]. There are some issues with regard to the loads on the rotors increasing as they increase in size, but at this time they are not a challenge. We had the Critical Design Review at the beginning of 2016, and the design was closed-out at that time. We are meeting all of the predictions, and I don't see any restrictions on what we can do to this vehicle in terms of scalability," Sikorsky Vice-President of Future Vertical Lift and Mission Systems, Dan Spoor, said. Developed by Sikorsky to cruise comfortably at 250 kt while retaining excellent low-speed handling, efficient hovering, and safe autorotation combined with a seamless and simple transition to high-speed flight, the X2 incorporated a number of advanced technologies that included fly-by-wire flight controls, counter-rotating all-composite rigid rotor blades, hub drag reduction, active vibration control and an integrated auxiliary propulsion system that included a pusher propeller that was driven by the same gear box that also turned the main rotors. Weighing 6,000 lb (2,722 kg) and accommodating a crew of just two, the X2 was significantly smaller than the 32,000 lb (14,515 kg) and up to 18-person Defiant. Partly in order to help bridge this gap, Sikorsky developed its X-2-derived S-97 Raider, which weighs in at 11,000 lb (4,990 kg) and can accommodate up to eight crew and passengers.

The first flight of the partnership's Joint MultiRole - Technology Demonstrator (JMR-TD) platform will now take place in the first half of 2018 rather than during the latter half of 2017, as was the US Army's original schedule, though this will have no impact on the service's future FVL acquisition plans, programme leaders told reporters. "Honestly, nothing significant has happened that has caused us delay - we have not encountered any problems," Sikorsky Vice President of Future Vertical Lift and Mission Systems, Dan Spoor, said, adding, "It is just a process that we have been following, and while some things have not been happening as quickly as we would like there has been no negative elements [to our programme]. "We are marching down the path, and have stayed lock-step with our customer who fully understands and supports where we are because there is the belief that when we do fly we will have already validated all of our components, and we will have a much more risk-reduced flight test programme. The flight test programme will probably last for a year, and as we start to fly the aircraft and expand the envelope we will be doing it with more confidence than would be the case without the [current] risk-reduction effort. "Based on all of our conversations with the customer, we believe that our flight test programme fully supports their needs and [the delay] will not have a negative impact on their [FVL] acquisition strategy at all." The other party in the US Army's JMR-TD effort, Bell Helicopter, remains on course to fly its V-280 Valor tiltrotor before the end of the year.

(Reuters photo) - + The Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) has been delayed five times and faces rising costs, yet its future as the vanguard of Japanese-built passenger jets seems assured by the corporate muscle behind it and a government set on reviving an aerospace industry dismantled after World War II. The delays -- the new 90-seat plane was due to take off in 2013, but the first delivery is not now seen until 2020 -- have dented its chances of commercial success as established regional jet makers, Brazil's Embraer SA and Canada's Bombardier Inc, catch up with its innovations, and China and Russia flex their aerospace ambitions. But the Japanese government's primary goal isn't to make money for Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp, the MRJ's manufacturer, rather it's to have the plane cement an industry revival that failed to take off half a century ago with Japan's last passenger plane, the YS-11. "Rather than a simple question of whether it makes a profit or loss, what is more important is will it over the longer term be the foundation of a strong aerospace industry," a government source who is helping the programme told Reuters. He asked not to be identified as he is not authorized to talk to the media. Presentation documents prepared by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, seen by Reuters, see the MRJ as the first in a three-generation programme stretching beyond 2060. With the plane still awaiting US-standard certification for commercial flights, signed-up customers are banking on the backing of big-name Japanese companies to see the project through. Mitsubishi Aircraft is 64%-owned by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, with Toyota Motor Corp and Mitsubishi Corp each holding a 10% stake. Other shareholders include state-owned Development Bank of Japan, Sumitomo Corp and Mitsui & Co. "Not a bad list," says Jep Thornton, a partner at Aerolease Aviation in Florida which has ordered 10 of the planes. "This is coming from the government sector, the financial sector and the investor sector." Launch customer All Nippon Airways, Japan's biggest carrier, says it won't walk away from its order for 15 MRJs even as it has to keep older aircraft flying and leases four Boeing 737-800 aircraft to make up for a capacity shortfall. "We want this plane in our fleet and although we have been on stand-by for a while, we await it with anticipation," said Yuji Hirako, who runs All Nippon Airways. RE-WIRING The plane's latest delay, announced in January, can be dated back more than 20 years -- six years before Mitsubishi even considered a passenger jet -- when a Boeing 747 plunged into the Atlantic, killing 230 people. Investigators blamed a short circuit that ignited a fuel tank fire, prompting the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) to tighten wiring certification in 2007. Mitsubishi, which had by then begun work on the MRJ, overlooked the change, said two people with knowledge of the project. "Mitsubishi was clearly aware of it but did not apply it to the design," said one, who didn't want to be named as he is not authorised to talk to the media. Hundreds of engineers wiring the MRJ did so without using a common design framework incorporating the new rule. So, when asked by Japanese regulators certifying the jet to FAA standards how it complied with the stricter standard, Mitsubishi Aircraft faced a time-consuming task to explain each twist and turn in the 23,000 wires snaking through the plane's fuselage. "They decided it would be easier to start from scratch," the second person said. In response to Reuters queries, Mitsubishi Aircraft said: "We were aware of the regulation in our early phase of design, so it is not accurate to say we overlooked the regulation. Our design was made reflecting the regulations, but we made a subsequent decision to relocate certain systems for a better design. System location was the main reason for requiring wiring changes and the re-routing ensures we meet the highest safety standards." Four of the five delays so far have been caused to some degree by similar failures to document work for certification, forcing engineers to redo some of their work, said Yugo Fukuhara, vice president and general manager of sales and marketing at Mitsubishi Aircraft, adding the company is hiring ex-Boeing engineers and other foreign experts to help it better navigate FAA rules. BREAKING EVEN? Mitsubishi Aircraft has orders for 233 MRJs, and aims to sell more than 1,000 of the planes over two decades. The company declined to say how many planes it has to sell to break even. Based on presentations by Mitsubishi Heavy, the first four delays doubled the MRJ's development cost, and the latest delay could add another 30% -- taking total spending to 350 billion yen ($3.17 billion), equivalent to the value of 67 list-price MRJs. At the average operating margin of 7.84% at commercial planemakers including Embraer, Boeing Co and Airbus SAS over the past three years, the profit per MRJ plane would be $3.7 million, according to Reuters calculations. At that rate of return, Mitsubishi Aircraft would need to sell more than 800 of the planes to cover its costs. "Assume a very conservative 30% discount to the list price, then re-do. That probably brings us to 1,200 jets, and they'll never get there," said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at Teal Group, when asked about Reuters' estimate. A more realistic number, he says, would be 30 aircraft a year over 25 years, adding up to sales of around 750 MRJs. "We understand that the commercial aircraft business is a long-term investment, and we expect to absorb the development costs over the long run," Mitsubishi Aircraft told Reuters. "We see this as the creation of a new industry, establishing supply chains and a regulatory certification process," said Fukuhara, the sales and marketing manager, in his office at Nagoya Airport. "I don't think it will end with the MRJ."

Analysts said the move was part of the government’s wider goal of creating a defence contract industry where private companies played a key role in supplying military technology that could also have civilian applications, similar to how Lockheed Martin and Boeing operated in the United States. The contracting is overseen by the PLA’s arms procurement wing, the Equipment Development Department, which released information for more than 2,000 projects on its website, according to the PLA Daily. How China’s defence industry can learn from its rival Japan: PLA veteran Interested companies would have to put together a proposal that met the requirements listed on the website and submit it for evaluation, the report said. Some 531 of the requirements involved classified information, and their inclusion could help set clearer standards for bids, the report quoted an unnamed officer as saying. Beijing first began taking down the wall separating civilian and military technologies in the 1980s, but the PLA still relies on just a handful of state behemoths to supply most of its needs. The integration received a substantial push in 2015 when President Xi Jinping, who chairs the policymaking Central Military Commission, elevated it to a national priority. This past January, he authorised the creation of the Central Commission for Integrated Military and Civilian Development to coordinate policies and decisions towards that end. But obstacles remain, with a major one being trust, according to He Qisong, a defence policy specialist at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law. PLA allows civilian firms to supply kit “When it comes to key technologies in the defence industry, private companies can hardly gain any trust from the army in matters involving secrecy,” He said. Retired PLA major general Xu Guangyu said new laws were needed to clarify obligations of businesses handling classified work, as well as to define the commercial benefits they could reap from cooperation with the military. Xu, a senior researcher at Beijing-based research group the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, said although the PLA had previously invited companies to take part in R&D, the latest round of projects was announced in a high-profile way. “With this information, private companies can know what’s required to work with the army,” Xu said. “China has a large number of private companies with many that are industry leaders, and the military can make use of the private companies’ potential.”   Most Popular Viewed 1 Plug pulled on US interview with wanted Chinese tycoon 2 Storm looms as Xi tries to clean up China’s financial industry 3 45 years of grappling with Vancouver unaffordability 4 Notorious Hong Kong gangster Yip Kai-foon, who inspired hit film, dead at 55 5 Don’t mess with Kim, he thinks he’s his grandfather Shared 1 Plug pulled on US interview with wanted Chinese tycoon 2 Interpol issues red notice for Chinese tycoon after corruption claim 3 Canto-pop’s Aaron Kwok weds model Moka Fang 4 Storm looms as Xi tries to clean up China’s financial industry 5 Notorious Hong Kong gangster Yip Kai-foon, who inspired hit film, dead at 55 Commented 1 Artist Ai Weiwei takes to social media after HSBC rejects application 2 Notorious Hong Kong gangster Yip Kai-foon, who inspired hit film, dead at 55 3 US vice-president to North Korea: ‘The sword stands ready’ 4 Don’t mess with Kim, he thinks he’s his grandfather 5 Plug pulled on US interview with wanted Chinese tycoon Promotions Order your FREE copy of the MICE BIZ 2017 SCMP Invites you to Le French May “Paris Ballet Legend - A Night With The Stars”       You may also like Hong Kong Diamond design for future MTR station falls flat amid delays 18 Apr 2017 - 12:48pm 18 Zero Carbon Building reveals Hong Kong's eco-home potential In partnership with: HKT PREMIER China China launches revamped ‘green cards’ to lure foreign talent 18 Apr 2017 - 10:43pm 14 [SCMP Archive] Mothers’ love Sponsored by: Hong Kong International School Hong Kong Hong Kong hikers warned as deaths exceed 2016 total in four months 17 Apr 2017 - 10:53pm 19 Hong Kong Hong Kong pay TV firm i-Cable takes ‘important step’ to stay afloat 18 Apr 2017 - 10:55pm 3 China How students cheated in China’s imperial civil service exams 18 Apr 2017 - 11:35am 4 Hong Kong Yip Kai-foon, Hong Kong's ‘King of Thieves’ dies in hospital Apr 19th 2017, 5:10pm China More Chinese flocking back home after studying abroad 17 Apr 2017 - 8:27am 73 Hong Kong ‘Nano’ flats on the rise amid high property prices 17 Apr 2017 - 10:59pm 9 Insight & Opinion How culture shock means sure turbulence on US-China flights 18 Apr 2017 - 9:07am 26 China ‘Hong Kong separatism’ on Communist Party security agenda 16 Apr 2017 - 8:13am 34 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

Obama limited contributions to $50,000 in 2009 but lifted that cap four years later. WASHINGTON: Billionaires, corporations and NFL owners opened their wallets in a big way to help President Donald Trump raise a record-shattering $107 million for his inaugural festivities, records released by the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday show. The amount about doubled the record set by President Barack Obama eight years ago. After giving $5 million, Las Vegas gaming billionaire Sheldon Adelson and his wife had prime seats for Trump's swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20 and gained access to a private lunch with the new president and lawmakers at the Capitol. Phil Ruffin, another casino mogul and close friend of Trump, gave $1 million. All the seven-figure contributions fed into a fundraising total that dwarfed the amounts raised for past inaugurations _ yet produced an event that was largely viewed as lower-key than previous swearing-in festivities. Trump's inaugural committee doesn't have to disclose what it spent the money on or how much was left over. But it did promise to "identify and evaluate charities that will receive contributions left from the excess monies raised." NFL owners who chipped in $1 million each included Dan Snyder of the Redskins, Stan Kroenke of the Rams, the Patriots' Bob Kraft via the Kraft Group, Bob McNair of the Texans and the Jaguars' Shahid Kahn. Businesses that donated at the $1 million level included Bank of America, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Pfizer, Allied Wallet, Access Industries, Qualcomm. Health care, energy and beverage companies were among the many businesses giving $250,000 or more. Companies also gave huge in-kind contributions of goods and services, including $2.1 million from AT&T for mobile equipment and software, nearly $500,000 in "vehicle expenses" from General Motors, $500,000 in equipment from Microsoft, $300,000 in food and beverages from Coca Cola, $257,000 from Pepsi and more than $500,000 in delivery services from FedEx. Trump placed no restrictions on the amount of money that donors could give. Obama limited contributions to $50,000 in 2009 but lifted that cap four years later. In a statement, the inaugural committee said the multiday event "was one of the most accessible and affordable inaugurations for the public in recent history." The inaugural committee's 510-page filing about its donors is not yet available in a data-downloadable format, and converting it will take days or weeks, according to the FEC. Trump's inaugural involved less hoopla than others in recent years. He held three inaugural balls, compared with the 10 that Obama had at his first inaugural. Trump's team shortened its parade to about 90 minutes. The longest parade, with 73 bands and 59 floats, lasted more than 4 1/2 hours, at Dwight Eisenhower's first inauguration in 1953. Trump's inaugural team failed to attract the kind of pricey A-list performers who turned out in force for Obama. Trump's headliners included teen singer Jackie Evancho, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Radio City Rockettes. The committee put on a free opening day concert and charged $50 per ticket to two of its balls. The Armed Services Ball was free. Inaugural chairman Tom Barrack had said the aim of the inauguration was to capture the "soft sensuality" of Washington. Trump's $107 million fundraising total is "an awful lot of money _ it's roughly what we spent on two," said Steve Kerrigan, who was CEO for Obama's inaugural committee in 2013 and chief of staff in 2009. Kerrigan said the inaugural events may have served as an opportunity for donors who held back during the presidential campaign to try to curry favor by showing support for the incoming president. Billionaire investor Paul Singer, for example, gave $1 million after long expressing skepticism about Trump. He's since visited the president at the White House. Inaugural officials didn't return requests for comment. Their release promised more details about charitable giving at a later date, "when the organization's books are fully closed." After raising about $55 million in 2009, Obama used excess funds to help pay for the White House Easter Egg Roll and other events, his former inaugural committee chief executive officer said. For Obama's second inaugural in 2013, his committee raised about $43 million. Former President George W Bush raised $40 million to $42 million for each of his two inaugurations. In the past, questions have been raised about Trump's follow-through on his commitments to make charitable donations. For example, he pledged in January 2016 to donate millions to veterans from a highly publicized fundraiser, including $1 million of his own money. Much of that money was distributed in May 2016, after The Washington Post pressed him about whether he had followed through on his promise.

Trump’s $107 million fundraising total is ‘‘an awful lot of money — it’s roughly what we spent on two,’’ said Steve Kerrigan, who was CEO for Obama’s inaugural committee in 2013 and chief of staff in 2009. Kerrigan said the inaugural events may have served as an opportunity for donors who held back during the presidential campaign to try to curry favor by showing support for the incoming president. Billionaire investor Paul Singer, for example, gave $1 million after long expressing skepticism about Trump. He’s since visited the president at the White House. Inaugural officials didn’t return requests for comment. Their release promised more details about charitable giving at a later date, ‘‘when the organization’s books are fully closed.’’ After raising about $55 million in 2009, Obama used excess funds to help pay for the White House Easter Egg Roll and other events, his former inaugural committee chief executive officer said. For Obama’s second inaugural in 2013, his committee raised about $43 million. Former President George W. Bush raised $40 million to $42 million for each of his two inaugurations. In the past, questions have been raised about Trump’s follow-through on his commitments to make charitable donations. For example, he pledged in January 2016 to donate millions to veterans from a highly publicized fundraiser, including $1 million of his own money. Much of that money was distributed in May 2016, after The Washington Post pressed him about whether he had followed through on his promise. Loading comments...

While some details of the X-37B space plane, known as as Orbital Test Vehicle-4 (OTV-4) ,payload have been revealed - we still do not know exactly what's on board the spacecraft, or its mission. Theories have ranged from it being a space bomber, to a clandestine probe designed to 'take out' spy satellites. Scroll down for video  One of the most mysterious craft ever to be flown by the US military has now been in orbit for a record 700 days. The X-37B space plane, known as as Orbital Test Vehicle-4 (OTV-4), broke the record on earlier this month after surpassing 674 days. Pictured is an artist's impression THE X-37B MYSTERY The U.S. Air Force's unmanned X-37B space plane has flown three previous secret missions to date. Each time it has carried a mystery payload on long-duration flights in Earth orbit. The spacecraft looks similar to Nasa's space shuttle but is much smaller. The X-37B is about 29ft (8.8m) long and 9.5ft (2.9 m) tall. It has a wingspan of just less than 15ft (4.6 m). At launch, it weighs 11,000lbs (4,990kg). The craft is taken into orbit on a rocket but lands like the space shuttle by gliding down to Earth. While its main mission payload is a mystery, Nasa has revealed it has a materials experiment aboard. The Planetary Society is tagging along with a solar-sail demo.  Ten CubeSat nanosatellites are also taking a piggyback ride into orbit.  The previous record was 674 days, set during OTV-3, which lasted from December 2012 to October 2014. Earlier X-37B flights have been known to land at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, and recent plans to consolidate launch and landing activities could mean vehicles touch down at the Shuttle Landing Facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center,Space.com reports. But, where and when the mysterious space plane will really land remains a mystery. ‘The landing date will be determined based on the completion of the program’s on-orbit demonstrations and objectives for this mission,’ Captain Annmarie Annicelli, an Air Force Spokeswoman, told Space.com. ‘While the program has the capability to land at either KSC or Vandenberg, the landing location is determined by a variety of factors.’ The X-37B space plane, an experimental program run by the Air Force, launched atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on May 20, 2015. It's said to be one of the most mysterious craft ever to be flown by the US military.  Last month, experts claimed it may be about to finally return to Earth - almost two years later.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Antarctica's warming surface is covered in a vast network of...

Share this article Share 110 shares 'The historic Shuttle Landing Facility at the Florida spaceport is preparing to once again host an end of mission landing as the Air Force's X-37B mini spaceplane prepares to return from a near two year mission on orbit,' nasaspaceflight.com said in February. However, the Air Force claimed the movement was simply a test exercise, meaning the mission continues. There is no official word on exactly how long this one will stay up, although report suggest it will return to Earth later this year  'The X-37 is still on-orbit.  'The program is conducting a regularly scheduled exercise this week,' said Capt. Annmarie Annicelli, media operations officer at the Pentagon's Air Force Press Desk.  Nasaspaceflight.com says even if there is a test, the landing equipment has been left in place for a possible landing.  Theories have ranged from it being a space bomber, to a clandestine probe on a mission to 'take out' spy satellites. Pictured is the Atlas V rocket carrying the mysterious payload moments (left) after launch last year, and just before (right) TOP 4 CONSPIRACY THEORIES  The space plane is a spy plane: The leading theory appears to be that the unmanned space plane is a shuttle-shaped surveillance vehicle.  It could be a space bomber: This is the least likely theory, according tot Seven Aftergood, a secrecy expert at the Federation of American Scientists. He claims the US doesn't need this capability.  It is on a mission is to 'take out' satellites: This activity would be easily traceable, making it unlikely to stay a secret.  The X-37B deploys spy satellites: Instead of destroying them, the theory suggests that the space plane's orbit matches up to where deployed satellites would work best for spying on other countries. The mystery vehicle, essentially a technology test bed, is designed to orbit the Earth and then land like one of Nasa's old shuttles. According to X-37B manufacturer Boeing, the space plane operates in low-earth orbit, between 110 (177km) and 500 miles (800km) above earth. By comparison, the International Space Station orbits at about 220 miles (350km).  While its main mission payload is a mystery, Nasa has revealed it has a materials experiment aboard, while the Planetary Society is tagging along with a solar-sail demo.   Called LightSail, it uses a propulsion system that uses the pressure of photons from the sun, a technique known as solar sailing.  Nine other CubeSat nanosatellites are also taking a piggyback ride into orbit.  The space plane - one of two of the same design - is operated robotically, without anyone on board, and is reusable. It is 29ft (8.8m) long — about one-fourth the size of a Nasa shuttle. The longest X-37B flight lasted about 675 days; touchdown was last October. There is no official word on exactly how long this one will stay up, although report suggest it will return to Earth later this year. When the plane does return, it will land in Nasa's Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida. Like a shuttle, X-37B is blasted into orbit by a rocket. However, it lands using a runway like a normal aircraft. The X-37B is too small to carry people onboard, but does have a cargo bay similar to that of a pickup truck, which is just large enough to carry a small satellite A former KSC space-shuttle facility will enable the Air Force 'to efficiently land, recover, refurbish and relaunch the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV),' Boeing representatives told Space.com. In an unprecedented disclosure, last year the Department of Defense did reveal some details about the X-37B's main mission. '[We] are investigating an experimental propulsion system on the X-37B on Mission 4,' Captain Chris Hoyler, an Air Force spokesman, told Space.com.  'The Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office will also host a number of advance materials onboard the X-37B for Nasa to study the durability of various materials in the space environment,' Hoyler added.  He added the vehicle's mission 'cannot be specified' but that it will enhance 'the development of the concept of operations for reusable space vehicles'. The US Air Force's top secret X-37B space plane was caught on camera last year by a team of amateur astronomers. South African astronomer Greg Roberts captured this of the space plane in two-second–long exposures just a few weeks after launch An infrared view of the X-37B unmanned spacecraft landing at Vandenberg Air Force Base. The purpose of the U.S. military's space plane is classified Spaceflightnow.com revealed more details of the flight, which is described as a 'hall thruster electric propulsion test.' It is intended to improve performance of the units onboard Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) military communications spacecraft, officials claim. AEHF satellites' Hall thrusters are 4.5-kilowatt units that use electricity and xenon to produce thrust for moving satellites in space. The benefit of using electric propulsion is that its xenon fuel weighs much less than traditional hydrazine. This technology could help in the development of technologies to control satellites with better accuracy.  The X-program has bounced between several federal agencies, Nasa among them, since 1999. The plane has been in space for a total of 674 days, far more than its two previous flights which lasted 225 and 469 days However, experts claim that refining an advanced manoeuvring thruster is probably just a small part of the vehicle's true mission set.  One leading secrecy expert previously told DailyMail.com the drone is 'very likely' be used to test technologies that will increase spying capabilities of the US. 'The US government has a bottomless appetite for sensitive information,' said Steven Aftergood, a secrecy expert at the Federation of American Scientists. 'As powerful as our intelligence satellites may be, they also have their limitations - most notably the limitations imposed by their orbital parameters. 'It's conceivable that a spy plane would introduce new versatility into overhead reconnaissance.'  One secrecy expert has told DailyMail.com that the drone (artist's impression ) is 'likely' to be a spy plane. The program's first mission launched in April 2010 and landed in December that year The X-37B space drone, otherwise known as the Orbital Test Vehicle, is blasted into orbit by a rocket. However, it lands using a runway like a normal aircraft.  The X-37B is too small to carry people onboard, but does have a cargo bay similar to that of a pickup truck, which is just large enough to carry a small satellite. The X-program has bounced between several federal agencies, Nasa among them, since 1999. The program's first mission launched in April 2010 and landed in December that year. The second space plane took off on March 2011 and came back to Earth in June 2012.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, Pool, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — It was huge. Big money from billionaires, corporations and a roster of NFL owners poured into Donald Trump's inaugural committee in record-shattering amounts — to pull off an event that was considerably lower-key than previous inaugural celebrations. That leaves a bit of a mystery: What the $107 million was spent for and how much was left over — the excess, if any, to go to charity. It also raises a new round of questions about the influence of money in politics, this time for a president who promised to "drain the swamp" of Washington. Contribution records from Trump's inaugural committee, released Wednesday by the Federal Election Commission, show the president who railed as a candidate against the corrupting influence of big-money donors was only too willing to accept top-dollar checks for his swearing-in festivities. Trump's total take was about double the previous record set by Barack Obama, who collected $53 million in contributions in 2009, and had money left over to spend on the annual Easter egg roll and other White House events. Trump's top inaugural donor was Las Vegas gambling billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who gave $5 million. He and his wife came away with prime seats for Trump's swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20 and gained access to a private lunch with the new president and lawmakers at the Capitol. Phil Ruffin, another casino mogul and close friend of Trump, was among dozens of donors who gave $1 million each. At least eight NFL team owners kicked in big money for the inauguration. Seven of them, including Patriots owner Bob Kraft, whose team won the Super Bowl and visited the White House on Wednesday, gave $1 million apiece. Kraft's donation came via his limited liability company. Trump plans to name the New York Jets' Woody Johnson, one of those million-dollar donors, to be the country's ambassador to the United Kingdom. Asked whether the president feels conflicted about his committee accepting so much corporate and wealthy donor money, spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday that financing the inaugural is "a time-honored tradition" and there are "a lot of people who really take pride in helping us show the world a peaceful transformation of power." Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit pro-transparency group, countered: "If you take Trump at his word that when political figures accept large amounts of money from corporate interests or special interests that they're indebted to those big donors, there's certainly reason to question what donors to Trump's inaugural committee might expect in return." As is often the case with campaigns and inaugurations, some of the donations came from people doing business with the federal government. Billionaire Texan Kelcy Warren, whose company is building the Dakota Access Pipeline, gave the inaugural committee $250,000. Christopher Cline, a billionaire coal magnate who owns Foresight Energy Partners, gave $1 million. Trump has vowed to bring back coal jobs, and his administration quickly approved the Dakota pipeline. Businesses that donated at the $1 million level included Bank of America, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Pfizer and Qualcomm. Companies also gave big in-kind contributions of goods and services, including nearly $500,000 in "vehicle expenses" from General Motors. AT&T made combined in-kind and cash donations of $2.1 million, and Microsoft's combined total was $500,000. Casino mogul Steve Wynn donated entertainers and production work valued at $729,000 for the Chairman's Ball, where the band Alabama and Wynn's ShowStoppers performed, according to Wynn spokesman Michael Weaver. Russian-America businessman Alexander Shustorovich also was among the $1 million donors to Trump's inauguration committee. The Republican National Committee refused a contribution from the U.S. citizen in 2000, citing news reports at the time that cautioned about his ties to Russian business. In more recent years, he's given money to the party, to 2012 candidate Mitt Romney, and to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, FEC records show. Donations from foreign nationals are banned. But the socialist administration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro made a $500,000 donation through Citgo Petroleum, a U.S. affiliate of Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA. PDVSA recently offered up a nearly 50 percent stake in Citgo as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan from Russian firm Rosneft. The deal drew criticism from Republicans who worry it sets the stage for Vladimir Putin to take control of American oil. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

The inauguration offered donors who had held back during the presidential campaign a chance to show belated support for the incoming president. Billionaire investor Paul Singer gave $1 million after long expressing skepticism about Trump. Like Singer, Chicago hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, conspicuously avoided giving money to Trump's campaign during the general election. Griffin gave the Trump inaugural $100,000. While the government sets strict contribution limits on political campaigns, the only federal restrictions on donations to inaugural committees are a ban on foreign nationals, according to Fischer, of the Campaign Legal Center. Past presidents-elect have tended to set voluntary limits on their inaugural fundraising, but Trump's only restriction was to ban money from lobbyists, he said. Obama in 2009 set a $50,000 cap on individual contributions and banned money from corporations, political action committees and lobbyists. He lifted those caps in 2013, when he raised about $43 million for a lower-key event. Inaugural committees have broad leeway in how they spend their money and what they do with the leftovers, although some limitations apply, according to Fischer. As a 501(c)(4) organization, for example, the committee could use some of the money to give bonuses to staff, but IRS rules say the committee couldn't operate primarily to benefit a small group of individuals. Federal campaigns wouldn't be able receive the money because it was raised outside contribution limits, he said. Trump's inaugural committee has promised to "identify and evaluate charities that will receive contributions left from the excess monies raised." ___ On Twitter follow Nancy Benac at: http://twitter.com/nbenac and Julie Bykowicz at http://twitter.com/bykowicz Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The amount about doubled the record set by Barack Obama eight years ago. After giving $5m, the Las Vegas gaming billionaire Sheldon Adelson and his wife had prime seats for Trump’s swearing-in ceremony on 20 January and gained access to a private lunch with the new president and lawmakers at the Capitol. Phil Ruffin, another casino mogul and close friend of Trump, gave $1m. Obama’s inauguration in 2009 vs Trump’s in 2017 – then and now Read more All the seven-figure contributions fed into a fundraising total that dwarfed the amounts raised for past inaugurations – yet produced an event that was largely viewed as lower-key than previous swearing-in festivities. Trump’s inaugural committee does not have to disclose what it spent the money on or how much was left over. But it did promise to “identify and evaluate charities that will receive contributions left from the excess monies raised”. NFL owners who chipped in $1m each included Dan Snyder of Washington, Stan Kroenke of the Rams, the Patriots’ Robert Kraft via the Kraft Group, Bob McNair of the Texans and the Jaguars’ Shahid Khan. Kroenke is also the largest shareholder of Arsenal football club in the UK. Businesses that donated at the $1m level included Bank of America, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Pfizer, Allied Wallet, Access Industries, Qualcomm. Healthcare, energy and beverage companies were among the many businesses giving $250,000 or more. Companies also gave huge in-kind contributions of goods and services, including $2.1m from AT&T for mobile equipment and software, nearly $500,000 in “vehicle expenses” from General Motors, $500,000 in equipment from Microsoft, $300,000 in food and beverages from Coca-Cola, $257,000 from Pepsi and more than $500,000 in delivery services from FedEx. Trump placed no restrictions on the amount of money that donors could give. Obama limited contributions to $50,000 in 2009 but lifted that cap four years later. In a statement, the inaugural committee said the multiday event “was one of the most accessible and affordable inaugurations for the public in recent history”. The inaugural committee’s 510-page filing about its donors is not yet available in a data-downloadable format, and converting it will take days or weeks, according to the FEC. Trump’s inaugural involved less hoopla than others in recent years. He held three inaugural balls, compared with the 10 that Obama had at his first inaugural. Trump’s team shortened its parade to about 90 minutes. The longest parade, with 73 bands and 59 floats, lasted more than four and a half hours at Dwight Eisenhower’s first inauguration in 1953. Trump’s inaugural team failed to attract the kind of pricey A-list performers who turned out in force for Obama. Trump’s headliners included teen singer Jackie Evancho, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Radio City Rockettes. The committee put on a free opening-day concert and charged $50 a ticket to two of its balls. The Armed Services Ball was free. The inaugural chairman, Tom Barrack, had said the aim of the inauguration was to capture the “soft sensuality” of Washington. The stars won’t do the presidential inauguration? Hand it to the family Von Trump Read more Trump’s $107m fundraising total was “an awful lot of money – it’s roughly what we spent on two”, said Steve Kerrigan, who was CEO for Obama’s inaugural committee in 2013 and chief of staff in 2009. Kerrigan said the inaugural events may have served as an opportunity for donors who held back during the presidential campaign to try to curry favor by showing support for the incoming president. Billionaire investor Paul Singer, for example, gave $1m after long expressing skepticism about Trump. He has since visited the president at the White House. Inaugural officials did not return requests for comment. Their release promised more details about charitable giving at a later date, “when the organization’s books are fully closed”. After raising about $55m in 2009, Obama used excess funds to help pay for the White House Easter Egg Roll and other events, his former inaugural committee chief executive officer said. For Obama’s second inaugural in 2013, his committee raised about $43m. George W Bush raised $40m to $42m for each of his two inaugurations. In the past, questions have been raised about Trump’s follow-through on his commitments to make charitable donations. For example, he pledged in January 2016 to donate millions to veterans from a highly publicized fundraiser, including $1m of his own money. Much of that money was distributed in May 2016, after the Washington Post pressed him about whether he had followed through on his promise.

And it's served as the foundation to free trade. Pictured: Rio Douro (river of gold) may be the world's most beautiful wine region averaging 200 miles through northern Portugal. By Patrick Gillespie NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- It all started with wine from Portugal. And it's served as the foundation to free trade. A key trade theory turns 200 years old Wednesday. The marquee birthday comes at a time when President Trump is trying to redefine U.S. trade with other countries. Published on April 19, 1817, British economist David Ricardo used a now famous example of wine from Portugal versus cloth from England to talk about trade in a paper entitled: "On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation." His theory was that it took fewer workers in Portugal, a country with a long history of wine making, to make wine than it does to make cloth in that country. And it took fewer workers to make cloth in England, a textile powerhouse at the time, than to produce wine there. Thus, Portugal should export its wine to England, while England should export cloth to Portugal. Workers weren't the only factor. Other considerations were equipment, skills and the value of currencies. The idea in a nut shell: Focus on your biggest advantages and sell them to other countries. Ricardo called it "comparative advantage." The main concept: You focus on the products you're most efficient at making and ship them to other countries. Then other countries focus on what they're most productive at making and export those products to you. "The idea of comparative advantage has been an essential part of every economists' intellectual toolkit," Dartmouth professor and former Reagan trade adviser Doug Irwin wrote in a blog post Wednesday. The same concept is true today in the U.S. economy. Consider this example: the U.S. is a leader in manufacturing airplanes. Boeing exports its jets to countries and airlines around the world. For instance, Boeing sells planes to Avianca, the Colombian airline. Colombia doesn't have much of an airplane manufacturing industry. But Colombia does have a robust coffee industry. And Americans love coffee. So, Ricardo's theory plays out on a very basic level in this interaction -- the U.S. imports loads of coffee from Colombia while Colombia buys U.S.-made planes. More broadly, Ricardo's idea plays out across the global economy. The strength of the U.S. is largely in services like education and it has a trade surplus in services with the world. Mexico produces goods like car parts and it has a goods surplus with the U.S. and many other nations. The problem in Trump's view is that Mexico, for instance, is selling more goods to the U.S. than the U.S. is selling to Mexico. That creates a trade deficit. Trump wants to eliminate that, but hasn't shared any details on how he would do it. Ricardo's timeless theory could be tested again when the Trump administration renegotiates NAFTA, the free trade deal with Mexico and Canada, this year. The U.S. though, with its Napa and Sonoma Valleys, does have at least one notable, comparative advantage over Mexico and Canada: Wine. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The launch is scheduled for Tuesday morning and for the first time, NASA cameras will provide live 360-degree video of the rocket heading toward space. (AP Photo/John Raoux) 108SHARES ShareTweetGoogleReddit LinkedinSubscribeMail Sign up to receive our weekly newsletter of the most popular space stories: A delayed resupply mission to the International Space Station (ISS) carrying more than 7,600 pounds (3,450 kg) of food, water, clothing, equipment, and science experiments successfully launched from Cape Canaveral on Tuesday, April 18. The Orbital ATK Cygnus cargo vehicle was launched on a 191-foot (58-meter) Atlas V rocket at 11:11 AM EDT (1511 Universal Time). While Orbital has its own Antares rocket, this mission used ULA’s Atlas V because it has a heavier cargo carrying capacity. Initially scheduled for last month, the mission, a partnership between NASA and commercial spaceflight company United Launch Alliance (ULA), was delayed because of problems with the Atlas V’s hydraulic system. ULA itself is a partnership between two companies, Lockheed Martin and Boeing. The launch was broadcast live on Youtube by NASA, ULA, and Orbital ATK providing a 360-degree panoramic view to observers. Viewers could watch the launch with or without virtual reality goggles. Anyone using a personal computer, tablet, or smartphone had access to the 360-degree view, along with the ability to manipulate the video, altering the perspective to place themselves close to the rocket as it lifted off, launch commentator George Diller said. “We are sorry we missed Easter, but we’re pretty sure they’ll be excited about their Easter baskets and whatever great things International Space Station science put on board for them,” noted Orbital ATK Space Systems group president Frank Culbertson regarding the ISS astronauts. This launch was the seventh of ten resupply missions running through 2018 by Orbital ATK, according to a $3.1-billion contract between the company and NASA. NASA also has resupply mission contracts with SpaceX and with Sierra Nevada Corporation. The latter’s first mission, using its Dream Chaser, will launch in 2019. Cygnus and its supplies will arrive at the ISS on Saturday.

By NANCY BENAC and JULIE BYKOWICZ / Associated Press WASHINGTON — Billionaires, corporations and NFL owners opened their wallets in a big way to help President Donald Trump raise a record-shattering $107 million for his inaugural festivities, records released by the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday show.

The amount about doubled the record set by President Barack Obama eight years ago. After giving $5 million, Las Vegas gaming billionaire Sheldon Adelson and his wife had prime seats for Trump's swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20 and gained access to a private lunch with the new president and lawmakers at the Capitol. Phil Ruffin, another casino mogul and close friend of Trump, gave $1 million. All the seven-figure contributions fed into a fundraising total that dwarfed the amounts raised for past inaugurations — yet produced an event that was largely viewed as lower-key than previous swearing-in festivities. Trump's inaugural committee doesn't have to disclose what it spent the money on or how much was left over. But it did promise to "identify and evaluate charities that will receive contributions left from the excess monies raised." NFL owners who chipped in $1 million each included Dan Snyder of the Redskins, Stan Kroenke of the Rams, the Patriots' Bob Kraft via the Kraft Group, Bob McNair of the Texans and the Jaguars' Shahid Kahn. Businesses that donated at the $1 million level included Bank of America, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Pfizer, Allied Wallet, Access Industries, Qualcomm. Health care, energy and beverage companies were among the many businesses giving $250,000 or more. Three official inaugural balls took place Jan. 20 in Washington. President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and their wives and children attended. First Lady Melania Trump wore a simple off-the-shoulder white gown designed by Herve Pierre. Ivanka Trump donned a glitzy Carolina Herrera gown. While many in the fashion industry were outspoken during the campaign about not dressing the first family due to political differences, Herrera said it would be "an honor." Companies also gave huge in-kind contributions of goods and services, including $2.1 million from AT&T for mobile equipment and software, nearly $500,000 in "vehicle expenses" from General Motors, $500,000 in equipment from Microsoft, $300,000 in food and beverages from Coca Cola, $257,000 from Pepsi and more than $500,000 in delivery services from FedEx. Trump placed no restrictions on the amount of money that donors could give. Obama limited contributions to $50,000 in 2009 but lifted that cap four years later. In a statement, the inaugural committee said the multiday event "was one of the most accessible and affordable inaugurations for the public in recent history." The inaugural committee's 510-page filing about its donors is not yet available in a data-downloadable format, and converting it will take days or weeks, according to the FEC. Trump's inaugural involved less hoopla than others in recent years. He held three inaugural balls, compared with the 10 that Obama had at his first inaugural. Trump's team shortened its parade to about 90 minutes. The longest parade, with 73 bands and 59 floats, lasted more than 4 1/2 hours, at Dwight Eisenhower's first inauguration in 1953. Trump's inaugural team failed to attract the kind of pricey A-list performers who turned out in force for Obama. Trump's headliners included teen singer Jackie Evancho, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Radio City Rockettes. The committee put on a free opening day concert and charged $50 per ticket to two of its balls. The Armed Services Ball was free. Inaugural chairman Tom Barrack had said the aim of the inauguration was to capture the "soft sensuality" of Washington. Trump's $107 million fundraising total is "an awful lot of money — it's roughly what we spent on two," said Steve Kerrigan, who was CEO for Obama's inaugural committee in 2013 and chief of staff in 2009. Kerrigan said the inaugural events may have served as an opportunity for donors who held back during the presidential campaign to try to curry favor by showing support for the incoming president. Billionaire investor Paul Singer, for example, gave $1 million after long expressing skepticism about Trump. He's since visited the president at the White House. Inaugural officials didn't return requests for comment. Their release promised more details about charitable giving at a later date, "when the organization's books are fully closed." After raising about $55 million in 2009, Obama used excess funds to help pay for the White House Easter Egg Roll and other events, his former inaugural committee chief executive officer said. For Obama's second inaugural in 2013, his committee raised about $43 million. Former President George W. Bush raised $40 million to $42 million for each of his two inaugurations. In the past, questions have been raised about Trump's follow-through on his commitments to make charitable donations. For example, he pledged in January 2016 to donate millions to veterans from a highly publicized fundraiser, including $1 million of his own money. Much of that money was distributed in May 2016, after The Washington Post pressed him about whether he had followed through on his promise.

Big money from billionaires, corporations and a roster of NFL owners poured into Donald Trump's inaugural committee in record-shattering amounts — to pull off an event that was considerably lower-key than previous inaugural celebrations. That leaves a bit of a mystery: What the $107 million was spent for and how much was left over — the excess, if any, to go to charity. It also raises a new round of questions about the influence of money in politics, this time for a president who promised to "drain the swamp" of Washington. Contribution records from Trump's inaugural committee, released Wednesday by the Federal Election Commission, show the president who railed as a candidate against the corrupting influence of big-money donors was only too willing to accept top-dollar checks for his swearing-in festivities. Trump's total take was about double the previous record set by Barack Obama, who collected $53 million in contributions in 2009, and had money left over to spend on the annual Easter egg roll and other White House events. Trump's top inaugural donor was Las Vegas gambling billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who gave $5 million. He and his wife came away with prime seats for Trump's swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20 and gained access to a private lunch with the new president and lawmakers at the Capitol. Phil Ruffin, another casino mogul and close friend of Trump, was among dozens of donors who gave $1 million each. At least eight NFL team owners kicked in big money for the inauguration. Seven of them, including Patriots owner Bob Kraft, whose team won the Super Bowl and visited the White House on Wednesday, gave $1 million apiece. Kraft's donation came via his limited liability company. Trump plans to name the New York Jets' Woody Johnson, one of those million-dollar donors, to be the country's ambassador to the United Kingdom. Asked whether the president feels conflicted about his committee accepting so much corporate and wealthy donor money, spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday that financing the inaugural is "a time-honoured tradition" and there are "a lot of people who really take pride in helping us show the world a peaceful transformation of power." Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center, a non-profit pro-transparency group, countered: "If you take Trump at his word that when political figures accept large amounts of money from corporate interests or special interests that they're indebted to those big donors, there's certainly reason to question what donors to Trump's inaugural committee might expect in return." As is often the case with campaigns and inaugurations, some of the donations came from people doing business with the federal government. Billionaire Texan Kelcy Warren, whose company is building the Dakota Access Pipeline, gave the inaugural committee $250,000. Christopher Cline, a billionaire coal magnate who owns Foresight Energy Partners, gave $1 million. Trump has vowed to bring back coal jobs, and his administration quickly approved the Dakota pipeline. Businesses that donated at the $1 million level included Bank of America, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Pfizer and Qualcomm. Companies also gave big in-kind contributions of goods and services, including nearly $500,000 in "vehicle expenses" from General Motors. AT&T made combined in-kind and cash donations of $2.1 million, and Microsoft's combined total was $500,000. Casino mogul Steve Wynn donated entertainers and production work valued at $729,000 for the Chairman's Ball, where the band Alabama and Wynn's ShowStoppers performed, according to Wynn spokesman Michael Weaver. Russian-America businessman Alexander Shustorovich also was among the $1 million donors to Trump's inauguration committee. The Republican National Committee refused a contribution from the U.S. citizen in 2000, citing news reports at the time that cautioned about his ties to Russian business. In more recent years, he's given money to the party, to 2012 candidate Mitt Romney, and to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, FEC records show. Donations from foreign nationals are banned. But the socialist administration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro made a $500,000 donation through Citgo Petroleum, a U.S. affiliate of Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA. PDVSA recently offered up a nearly 50 per cent stake in Citgo as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan from Russian firm Rosneft. The deal drew criticism from Republicans who worry it sets the stage for Vladimir Putin to take control of American oil. The inauguration offered donors who had held back during the presidential campaign a chance to show belated support for the incoming president. Billionaire investor Paul Singer gave $1 million after long expressing skepticism about Trump. Like Singer, Chicago hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, conspicuously avoided giving money to Trump's campaign during the general election. Griffin gave the Trump inaugural $100,000. While the government sets strict contribution limits on political campaigns, the only federal restrictions on donations to inaugural committees are a ban on foreign nationals, according to Fischer, of the Campaign Legal Center. Past presidents-elect have tended to set voluntary limits on their inaugural fundraising, but Trump's only restriction was to ban money from lobbyists, he said. Obama in 2009 set a $50,000 cap on individual contributions and banned money from corporations, political action committees and lobbyists. He lifted those caps in 2013, when he raised about $43 million for a lower-key event. Inaugural committees have broad leeway in how they spend their money and what they do with the leftovers, although some limitations apply, according to Fischer. As a 501(c)(4) organization, for example, the committee could use some of the money to give bonuses to staff, but IRS rules say the committee couldn't operate primarily to benefit a small group of individuals. Federal campaigns wouldn't be able receive the money because it was raised outside contribution limits, he said. Trump's inaugural committee has promised to "identify and evaluate charities that will receive contributions left from the excess monies raised." ___ On Twitter follow Nancy Benac at: http://twitter.com/nbenac and Julie Bykowicz at http://twitter.com/bykowicz Julie Bykowicz And Nancy Benac, The Associated Press ©2017 The Canadian Press Share Twitter Facebook Google+ Reddit Forward Topics:  International Listen live News Talk Sports Traffic Weather Search Local Provincial National International All Topics RSS Feeds The Brent Loucks Show 6:00am 8:30am Gormley 8:30am 12:30pm Saskatchewan Afternoon 1:00pm 3:00pm The Green Zone 3:00pm 6:00pm All Shows Schedule Podcasts On Demand Contests Events Adopt A Family Auction Insider The Green Zone Game Day with Wray Prime Time Sports Riders Local Provincial National Traffic Updates Highway Hotline Report a Pothole Latest Traffic Apr 19 Road Work For Wednesday Apr 18 Road Work For Tuesday Apr 17 Road Work For Monday loading weather... © 650 CKOM .

While the government sets strict contribution limits on political campaigns, the only federal restrictions on donations to inaugural committees are a ban on foreign nationals, according to Fischer, of the Campaign Legal Center. Past presidents-elect have tended to set voluntary limits on their inaugural fundraising, but Trump's only restriction was to ban money from lobbyists, he said. Obama in 2009 set a $50,000 cap on individual contributions and banned money from corporations, political action committees and lobbyists. He lifted those caps in 2013, when he raised about $43 million for a lower-key event. Inaugural committees have broad leeway in how they spend their money and what they do with the leftovers, although some limitations apply, according to Fischer. As a 501(c)(4) organization, for example, the committee could use some of the money to give bonuses to staff, but IRS rules say the committee couldn't operate primarily to benefit a small group of individuals. Federal campaigns wouldn't be able receive the money because it was raised outside contribution limits, he said. Trump's inaugural committee has promised to "identify and evaluate charities that will receive contributions left from the excess monies raised." ___ On Twitter follow Nancy Benac at: http://twitter.com/nbenac and Julie Bykowicz at http://twitter.com/bykowicz Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Like us on Facebook. Like The Denton Record-Chronicle's Facebook Page WASHINGTON (AP) -- Billionaires, corporations and NFL owners opened their wallets in a big way to help President Donald Trump raise a record-shattering $107 million for his inaugural festivities, records released by the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday show. The amount about doubled the record set by President Barack Obama eight years ago. After giving $5 million, Las Vegas gaming billionaire Sheldon Adelson and his wife had prime seats for Trump's swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20 and gained access to a private lunch with the new president and lawmakers at the Capitol. Phil Ruffin, another casino mogul and close friend of Trump, gave $1 million. All the seven-figure contributions fed into a fundraising total that dwarfed the amounts raised for past inaugurations -- yet produced an event that was largely viewed as lower-key than previous swearing-in festivities. Trump's inaugural committee doesn't have to disclose what it spent the money on or how much was left over. But it did promise to "identify and evaluate charities that will receive contributions left from the excess monies raised." NFL owners who chipped in $1 million each included Dan Snyder of the Redskins, Stan Kroenke of the Rams, the Patriots' Bob Kraft via the Kraft Group, Bob McNair of the Texans and the Jaguars' Shahid Kahn. Businesses that donated at the $1 million level included Bank of America, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Pfizer, Allied Wallet, Access Industries, Qualcomm. Health care, energy and beverage companies were among the many businesses giving $250,000 or more. Companies also gave huge in-kind contributions of goods and services, including $2.1 million from AT&T for mobile equipment and software, nearly $500,000 in "vehicle expenses" from General Motors, $500,000 in equipment from Microsoft, $300,000 in food and beverages from Coca Cola, $257,000 from Pepsi and more than $500,000 in delivery services from FedEx. Trump placed no restrictions on the amount of money that donors could give. Obama limited contributions to $50,000 in 2009 but lifted that cap four years later. In a statement, the inaugural committee said the multiday event "was one of the most accessible and affordable inaugurations for the public in recent history." The inaugural committee's 510-page filing about its donors is not yet available in a data-downloadable format, and converting it will take days or weeks, according to the FEC. Trump's inaugural involved less hoopla than others in recent years. He held three inaugural balls, compared with the 10 that Obama had at his first inaugural. Trump's team shortened its parade to about 90 minutes. The longest parade, with 73 bands and 59 floats, lasted more than 4 1/2 hours, at Dwight Eisenhower's first inauguration in 1953. Trump's inaugural team failed to attract the kind of pricey A-list performers who turned out in force for Obama. Trump's headliners included teen singer Jackie Evancho, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Radio City Rockettes. The committee put on a free opening day concert and charged $50 per ticket to two of its balls. The Armed Services Ball was free. Inaugural chairman Tom Barrack had said the aim of the inauguration was to capture the "soft sensuality" of Washington. Trump's $107 million fundraising total is "an awful lot of money -- it's roughly what we spent on two," said Steve Kerrigan, who was CEO for Obama's inaugural committee in 2013 and chief of staff in 2009. Kerrigan said the inaugural events may have served as an opportunity for donors who held back during the presidential campaign to try to curry favor by showing support for the incoming president. Billionaire investor Paul Singer, for example, gave $1 million after long expressing skepticism about Trump. He's since visited the president at the White House. Inaugural officials didn't return requests for comment. Their release promised more details about charitable giving at a later date, "when the organization's books are fully closed." After raising about $55 million in 2009, Obama used excess funds to help pay for the White House Easter Egg Roll and other events, his former inaugural committee chief executive officer said. For Obama's second inaugural in 2013, his committee raised about $43 million. Former President George W. Bush raised $40 million to $42 million for each of his two inaugurations. In the past, questions have been raised about Trump's follow-through on his commitments to make charitable donations. For example, he pledged in January 2016 to donate millions to veterans from a highly publicized fundraiser, including $1 million of his own money. Much of that money was distributed in May 2016, after The Washington Post pressed him about whether he had followed through on his promise.

The first flight of the partnership's Joint MultiRole - Technology Demonstrator (JMR-TD) platform will now take place in the first half of 2018 rather than during the latter half of 2017, as was the US Army's original schedule, though this will have no impact on the service's future FVL acquisition plans, programme leaders told reporters. "Honestly, nothing significant has happened that has caused us delay - we have not encountered any problems," Sikorsky Vice President of Future Vertical Lift and Mission Systems, Dan Spoor, said, adding, "It is just a process that we have been following, and while some things have not been happening as quickly as we would like there has been no negative elements [to our programme]. "We are marching down the path, and have stayed lock-step with our customer who fully understands and supports where we are because there is the belief that when we do fly we will have already validated all of our components, and we will have a much more risk-reduced flight test programme. The flight test programme will probably last for a year, and as we start to fly the aircraft and expand the envelope we will be doing it with more confidence than would be the case without the [current] risk-reduction effort. "Based on all of our conversations with the customer, we believe that our flight test programme fully supports their needs and [the delay] will not have a negative impact on their [FVL] acquisition strategy at all." The other party in the US Army's JMR-TD effort, Bell Helicopter, remains on course to fly its V-280 Valor tiltrotor before the end of the year. An artist's impression of the SB&gt;1 Defiant, which Sikorsky-Boeing is developing for the US Army's Joint MultiRole - Technology Demonstrator (JMR-TD)/ Future Vertical Lift (FVL) effort. The first flight, that was supposed to take place in 2017, will now occur in 2018. (Sikorsky) Want to read more?

Hauling a battery pack in a car for propulsion is fairly easy compared to dragging one in the air. Below is the state and promise of the electric airplane — the new wild frontier. Electric Vehicles In Air, In Water, & On Land Have Different Battery Needs When I first read about electric flying cars, airplanes, and helicopters back in 2009, I thought it would be best to wait until the price and weight of lithium batteries went down before getting excited. It sounds as if we might finally be at the right moment when technology is starting to deliver on its promise to take to the sky. As mentioned above, bringing into the air a battery pack for propulsion is a whole new level of complexity compared to an electric land-based vehicle. Back in 2009, I got up close to the now defunct project Angelena II, a project of the port of Los Angeles turning a 1960s yacht into an official plug-in hybrid vessel. It was a daring project and well ahead of its time. Unfortunately, it drew the ire of the foaming-at-the-mouth local mainstream media. The media furiously angled the story at how the public port was using its public money converting a yacht. The project was really about creating the future of efficient seagoing vessels. The Angelena II took to the water with a very promising state-of-the-art plug-in hybrid (PHEV) system, but the project shut down after several ups and downs. One thing that became quickly apparent then was that there are various types of batteries for EVs. Batteries that favor power are great for electric cars since they power the cars quickly to move in and out of traffic. However, sea vessels need more constant energy and storage than raw power. The trade-off is like an Atkinson cycle engine that is more efficient than an Otto cycle engine meant for raw power (if you happen to know engines). The Angelena II chose lithium-phosphates, the same one Boeing probably should have chosen on its original 787 to avoid a dangerous, fiery result. The fairly new electric flight industry is working out these problems. You can’t just put a giant version of a Tesla battery pack into an airplane and expect that to be the right choice for an airplane. 6 Electric Airplane Takeoffs We’ve covered a few electric airplanes on CleanTechnica and on our sister publications EV Obsession and Gas2. Below is a summary of several standout contenders in the space. Hamilton aEro I recently wrote an article about the potential of the Hamilton aEro and its financially accessible kit for an aerobatic electric airplane. This is the ideal plane, in my eyes, since its electric power plant is perfectly suited for its short flight time. Zunum Aero Another potential player in the bigger passenger flight industry is Zunum Aero, which squarely aims at short regional air travel with ~100 passengers per flight. This means that the company can potentially cover short regional flights without customers having to fly to bigger and nightmarish airport hubs. The company makes you dream of flying from San Jose to Pasadena, California, or Martha’s Vineyard (Massachusetts) to Hartford (Connecticut) directly … and potentially daily. Excalibur This doesn’t mean the big boys are absent from the picture either. While Boeing has invested in Zunum’s Aero, DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) is lending funds to a funky and definitely particular-looking hybrid design. The Excalibur is an electric VTOL (Vertical TakeOff and Landing) aircraft that will rely on Rolls Royce’s AE 1107C engine (pushing 7,000 HP at the shaft) and Honeywell’s generators, with an ingenious 24 ducted fans electric distributed propulsion (EDP) system. In a nutshell, the distributed ducted fan thrust comes from a synchronous electric drive system, which enables the Aurora to hover efficiently or fly at high speed. However, the real news lies in the efficient design of a light electric motor that delivers enough torque to take onboard a light electric airplane. Extra 330LE Then Siemens steps in. As well as being involved with the Hamilton aEro, Siemens has an electric propulsion system for aircraft in the Extra 330LE aerobatic plane, which recently set two speed records. The first was a top speed of 337.50 kilometers per hour (209.713 mph) over 3 kilometers (1 mile) for an electric aircraft with a takeoff weight under 1,000 kilograms (about 2,250 lbs). The other was a top speed record of 342.86 km/h (213 mph) for an electric aircraft with a takeoff weight of over 1,000 kilograms. Airbus E-Fan X Finally, one more giant has taken up the electric flight challenge directly. Airbus proposed the e-Fan two-seater prototype flown at the Farnborough Airshow in the UK in July 2014. Although production of the aircraft was halted this month, Airbus decided to go for a larger E-Fan X. The E-Fan X will open up a family of larger, more powerful personal aircraft that could fly within 3 years. Using a four-motor platform based on the Cri-Cri, four MGM Compro units, each engine uses contra-rotating propellers producing 60 HP. Airbus claims series production would begin based on a four-seat E-Fan 4.0 touring aircraft. Wright Electrics Airplanes Finally, this leaves us with Wright Electric’s bold plans. This is a new electric aircraft startup that claims all-electric commercial flights from London to Paris within a decade. Although the battery technology might not be there yet, a lot can happen and has happened in 10 years. Electric cars barely reached the 60-mile range a decade ago and now are dipping their toes north of 200. The EPA recently announced the Tesla 100D has an official range of 335 miles. Wright Electric still plans to fly electric but has changed its goal from every short flight being electric in 10 years to every short flight being electric within 20 years. Its first plane is designed for flights from New York to Boston, London to Paris, and Seoul to Jeju. Electric airplanes are the final frontier in many ways. Although experts believe helicopters are a long way from being commercially viable, VTOL electric vehicles will go hand in hand with electric airplanes in the next decade.

Eager to spread the news about those amazing full torque electric vehicles, he started writing in 2007. Since then, his passion led to cover renewable energy, test drive many cars, do podcasts and film everything that is new and efficient. Nicolas offers an in depth look at the e-mobility world through interviews and the many contacts he made in those industries. "There are more solutions than obstacles."

Frustrated passengers anxiously check the time as they inch closer to the glass and metal X-ray scanners. It can be tough for even an experienced traveler, but for those with developmental disabilities, including autism, the experience can be overwhelming. That’s why The Arc, a US organization devoted to assisting people with developmental and intellectual disabilities, sponsors a program for kids and their parents that recently took place in Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport for the second year. The organizers of Wings for Autism designed the program to allow kids with autism to become familiar with airports, airport procedures, and the TSA ahead of family travel. Since 2011, 44 airports around the country have participated in the program, with the cooperation of various airlines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that autism affects one in 68 children and that about one in six children had a “developmental disability in 2006 to 2008, ranging from mild disabilities such as speech and language impairments to serious developmental disabilities, such as intellectual disabilities, cerebral palsy, and autism.” Sarah Bal, The Arc’s public relations director, explained that the program is designed to acclimate children on all parts of the autism spectrum to airport procedures, sounds, and chaos. In Atlanta, the need becomes clear as families participating in Wings for Autism exit the airport train to Terminal E as hundreds criss-cross the halls, making their way to escalators and elevators. Bal said the program has helped 2,000 families since it began six years ago at the Charles River Center in Needham, Massachusetts. The program takes families through the experiences of entering the airport, getting boarding passes, going through security and boarding a plane. Daniel Williams is 10 years old, plays baseball, loves airplanes, and lives with autism. He recites Boeing models, the amount of fuel the 777 can carry, and can’t wait to get aboard the aircraft waiting at the end of the jetway. Routine is everything, his mother Daria Williams explained. Each night, he lays out his clothes, then in the morning he wakes up, has his breakfast with his brothers, and rides the bus to school with his little brother. Airport security, like any other disruption to the schedule, can cause problems. Daria said this experience is invaluable and looks forward to summer travel because of it. Turning the travel date into an event marked on the calendar is one tip that Captain Erich Ries offered the families, speaking aboard the Airbus A330 they used. Ries, a Delta captain, flies a Boeing 717, and loves to travel with his 10-year-old son, Drew, who also has autism. Among Ries’ tips: Make sure the child has a bag packed with “that little taste of home,” and rehearse procedures for the travel day in advance to minimize surprises. A few rows away from Ries, 10-year-old Daniel buckles his seatbelt, shows his little brother how to do the same, and begins adjusting the window shade. “The wing is so big,” he told family surrounding him. Nearby, 5-year-old Nathaniel Underwood is preparing for his family’s June trip to Hartford, Connecticut, where his mother, Sonya Underwood, will continue her education as an airplane engine mechanic. Sandy Rice spent the morning holding children’s hands, answering parents’ questions, and keeping much of the event flowing smoothly. She works for the TSA, knows airport procedures and has an air of calm authority. Her 20-year-old son has autism and is nonverbal. Rice and has worked with “Wings for Autism” since 2016. She knows what many parents with kids with autism have experienced, and what many of these parents will experience. She emphasized that parents use the TSA Cares program, in which a TSA agent meets a traveling family and walks them from the airport’s front doors to the terminal gate, to help make air travel as easy as possible. Flight attendants welcome the participants aboard the plane, as they would during a normal flight. The children board, find seats, and listen to safety announcements. The sounds of the plane echo throughout the cabin: the loudspeaker, the air conditioners and the whirring motors. The plane never moves. Two of the last children off the plane are Daniel Williams and Nathaniel Underwood. Nathaniel’s mother mentioned what a good experience it was — Nathaniel was fascinated with the interactive screen on the seat in front of him — his. Both boys were interested in the high-tech cockpit. Daniel’s day at the airport reinforced his love of planes and his dream of becoming an airline pilot. His mother said that while this experience has made her less anxious about travel, it has also given her son more inspiration. “This will drive him … he’ll remember this forever,” she said.

Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Updated 3 hours ago WASHINGTON — It was huge. Big money from billionaires, corporations and a roster of NFL owners poured into Donald Trump's inaugural committee in record-shattering amounts — to pull off an event that was considerably lower-key than previous inaugural celebrations. That leaves a bit of a mystery: What the $107 million was spent for and how much was left over — the excess, if any, to go to charity. It also raises a new round of questions about the influence of money in politics, this time for a president who promised to “drain the swamp” of Washington. Contribution records from Trump's inaugural committee, released Wednesday by the Federal Election Commission, show the president who railed as a candidate against the corrupting influence of big-money donors was only too willing to accept top-dollar checks for his swearing-in festivities. Trump's total take was about double the previous record set by Barack Obama, who collected $53 million in contributions in 2009, and had money left over to spend on the annual Easter egg roll and other White House events. Trump's top inaugural donor was Las Vegas gambling billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who gave $5 million. He and his wife came away with prime seats for Trump's swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20 and gained access to a private lunch with the new president and lawmakers at the Capitol. Phil Ruffin, another casino mogul and close friend of Trump, was among dozens of donors who gave $1 million each. At least eight NFL team owners kicked in big money for the inauguration. Seven of them, including Patriots owner Bob Kraft, whose team won the Super Bowl and visited the White House on Wednesday, gave $1 million apiece. Kraft's donation came via his limited liability company. Trump plans to name the New York Jets' Woody Johnson, one of those million-dollar donors, to be the country's ambassador to the United Kingdom. Asked whether the president feels conflicted about his committee accepting so much corporate and wealthy donor money, spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday that financing the inaugural is “a time-honored tradition” and there are “a lot of people who really take pride in helping us show the world a peaceful transformation of power.” Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit pro-transparency group, countered: “If you take Trump at his word that when political figures accept large amounts of money from corporate interests or special interests that they're indebted to those big donors, there's certainly reason to question what donors to Trump's inaugural committee might expect in return.” As is often the case with campaigns and inaugurations, some of the donations came from people doing business with the federal government. Billionaire Texan Kelcy Warren, whose company is building the Dakota Access Pipeline, gave the inaugural committee $250,000. Christopher Cline, a billionaire coal magnate who owns Foresight Energy Partners, gave $1 million. Trump has vowed to bring back coal jobs, and his administration quickly approved the Dakota pipeline. Businesses that donated at the $1 million level included Bank of America, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Pfizer and Qualcomm. Companies also gave big in-kind contributions of goods and services, including nearly $500,000 in “vehicle expenses” from General Motors. AT&T made combined in-kind and cash donations of $2.1 million, and Microsoft's combined total was $500,000. Casino mogul Steve Wynn donated entertainers and production work valued at $729,000 for the Chairman's Ball, where the band Alabama and Wynn's ShowStoppers performed, according to Wynn spokesman Michael Weaver. Russian-America businessman Alexander Shustorovich also was among the $1 million donors to Trump's inauguration committee. The Republican National Committee refused a contribution from the U.S. citizen in 2000, citing news reports at the time that cautioned about his ties to Russian business. In more recent years, he's given money to the party, to 2012 candidate Mitt Romney, and to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, FEC records show. Donations from foreign nationals are banned. But the socialist administration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro made a $500,000 donation through Citgo Petroleum, a U.S. affiliate of Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA. PDVSA recently offered up a nearly 50 percent stake in Citgo as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan from Russian firm Rosneft. The deal drew criticism from Republicans who worry it sets the stage for Vladimir Putin to take control of American oil. The inauguration offered donors who had held back during the presidential campaign a chance to show belated support for the incoming president. Billionaire investor Paul Singer gave $1 million after long expressing skepticism about Trump. Like Singer, Chicago hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, conspicuously avoided giving money to Trump's campaign during the general election. Griffin gave the Trump inaugural $100,000. While the government sets strict contribution limits on political campaigns, the only federal restrictions on donations to inaugural committees are a ban on foreign nationals, according to Fischer, of the Campaign Legal Center. Past presidents-elect have tended to set voluntary limits on their inaugural fundraising, but Trump's only restriction was to ban money from lobbyists, he said. Obama in 2009 set a $50,000 cap on individual contributions and banned money from corporations, political action committees and lobbyists. He lifted those caps in 2013, when he raised about $43 million for a lower-key event. Inaugural committees have broad leeway in how they spend their money and what they do with the leftovers, although some limitations apply, according to Fischer. As a 501(c)(4) organization, for example, the committee could use some of the money to give bonuses to staff, but IRS rules say the committee couldn't operate primarily to benefit a small group of individuals. Federal campaigns wouldn't be able receive the money because it was raised outside contribution limits, he said. Trump's inaugural committee has promised to “identify and evaluate charities that will receive contributions left from the excess monies raised.” More Politics Census: Young women in America favor jobs outside the home Trump must decide whether to support or undermine Obamacare Mayor, 2 challengers debate Pittsburgh's progress and future How Democrats turned a little-known election into a national referendum on Trump Georgia House race down to 2 candidates, plus Trump, Pelosi TribLIVE commenting policy You are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service.

Big money from billionaires, corporations and a roster of NFL owners poured into Donald Trump’s inaugural committee in record-shattering amounts – to pull off an event that was considerably lower-key than previous inaugural celebrations. That leaves a bit of a mystery: What the $107 million was spent for and how much was left over – the excess, if any, to go to charity. It also raises a new round of questions about the influence of money in politics, this time for a president who promised to “drain the swamp” of Washington. Contribution records from Trump’s inaugural committee, released Wednesday by the Federal Election Commission, show the president who railed as a candidate against the corrupting influence of big-money donors was only too willing to accept top-dollar checks for his swearing-in festivities. Trump’s total take was about double the previous record set by Barack Obama, who collected $53 million in contributions in 2009, and had money left over to spend on the annual Easter egg roll and other White House events. Trump’s top inaugural donor was Las Vegas gambling billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who gave $5 million. He and his wife came away with prime seats for Trump’s swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20 and gained access to a private lunch with the new president and lawmakers at the Capitol. Phil Ruffin, another casino mogul and close friend of Trump, was among dozens of donors who gave $1 million each. At least eight NFL team owners kicked in big money for the inauguration. Seven of them, including Patriots owner Bob Kraft, whose team won the Super Bowl and visited the White House on Wednesday, gave $1 million apiece. Kraft’s donation came via his limited liability company. Trump plans to name the New York Jets’ Woody Johnson, one of those million-dollar donors, to be the country’s ambassador to the United Kingdom. Asked whether the president feels conflicted about his committee accepting so much corporate and wealthy donor money, spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday that financing the inaugural is “a time-honored tradition” and there are “a lot of people who really take pride in helping us show the world a peaceful transformation of power.” Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit pro-transparency group, countered: “If you take Trump at his word that when political figures accept large amounts of money from corporate interests or special interests that they’re indebted to those big donors, there’s certainly reason to question what donors to Trump’s inaugural committee might expect in return.” As is often the case with campaigns and inaugurations, some of the donations came from people doing business with the federal government. Billionaire Texan Kelcy Warren, whose company is building the Dakota Access Pipeline, gave the inaugural committee $250,000. Christopher Cline, a billionaire coal magnate who owns Foresight Energy Partners, gave $1 million. Trump has vowed to bring back coal jobs, and his administration quickly approved the Dakota pipeline. Businesses that donated at the $1 million level included Bank of America, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Pfizer and Qualcomm. Companies also gave big in-kind contributions of goods and services, including nearly $500,000 in “vehicle expenses” from General Motors. AT&T made combined in-kind and cash donations of $2.1 million, and Microsoft’s combined total was $500,000. Casino mogul Steve Wynn donated entertainers and production work valued at $729,000 for the Chairman’s Ball, where the band Alabama and Wynn’s ShowStoppers performed, according to Wynn spokesman Michael Weaver. Russian-American businessman Alexander Shustorovich also was among the $1 million donors to Trump’s inauguration committee. The Republican National Committee refused a contribution from the U.S. citizen in 2000, citing news reports at the time that cautioned about his ties to Russian business. In more recent years, he’s given money to the party, to 2012 candidate Mitt Romney, and to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, FEC records show. Donations from foreign nationals are banned. But the socialist administration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro made a $500,000 donation through Citgo Petroleum, a U.S. affiliate of Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA. PDVSA recently offered up a nearly 50 percent stake in Citgo as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan from Russian firm Rosneft. The deal drew criticism from Republicans who worry it sets the stage for Vladimir Putin to take control of American oil.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Military Rotorcraft Market size and CAGR Growth Analysis & 2017-2027 Forecasts Report Rapidly changing global security scenario and the growing importance of unconventional missions and urban warfare have resulted in change of roles for helicopters in the modern warfare strategies. Unlike their traditional roles, rotorcrafts are being used as part of the comprehensive mission parameters, which calls for integration of advanced and multiple capabilities in rotorcrafts. As the existing helicopters are unable to fulfill these roles, countries are focusing on either developing or procuring helicopters with multiple mission modes, which is currently driving the demand for military helicopters across the world. Apart from this, growing disputes over maritime borders and offshore natural resources are the primary drivers of the growing demand for maritime helicopters with multi-mission capabilities. Despite facing financial constraints, major defense spenders are driven by the growing need for the helicopters with advanced capabilities and challenges from internal and external security threats. Browse the full report @ www.orbisresearch.com/reports/index/the-global-military-r… . The primary forces driving large scale military modernization plans in this region are territorial disputes and the high threat of terrorism.

Big money from billionaires, corporations and a roster of NFL owners poured into Donald Trump's inaugural committee in record-shattering amounts - to pull off an event that was considerably lower-key than previous inaugural celebrations. That leaves a bit of a mystery: What the $107 million was spent for and how much was left over - the excess, if any, to go to charity. It also raises a new round of questions about the influence of money in politics, this time for a president who promised to "drain the swamp" of Washington. Contribution records from Trump's inaugural committee, released Wednesday by the Federal Election Commission, show the president who railed as a candidate against the corrupting influence of big-money donors was only too willing to accept top-dollar checks for his swearing-in festivities. Trump's total take was about double the previous record set by Barack Obama, who collected $53 million in contributions in 2009, and had money left over to spend on the annual Easter egg roll and other White House events. Trump's top inaugural donor was Las Vegas gambling billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who gave $5 million. He and his wife came away with prime seats for Trump's swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20 and gained access to a private lunch with the new president and lawmakers at the Capitol. Phil Ruffin, another casino mogul and close friend of Trump, was among dozens of donors who gave $1 million each. At least eight NFL team owners kicked in big money for the inauguration. Seven of them, including Patriots owner Bob Kraft, whose team won the Super Bowl and visited the White House on Wednesday, gave $1 million apiece. Kraft's donation came via his limited liability company. Trump plans to name the New York Jets' Woody Johnson, one of those million-dollar donors, to be the country's ambassador to the United Kingdom. Asked whether the president feels conflicted about his committee accepting so much corporate and wealthy donor money, spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday that financing the inaugural is "a time-honored tradition" and there are "a lot of people who really take pride in helping us show the world a peaceful transformation of power." Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit pro-transparency group, countered: "If you take Trump at his word that when political figures accept large amounts of money from corporate interests or special interests that they're indebted to those big donors, there's certainly reason to question what donors to Trump's inaugural committee might expect in return." As is often the case with campaigns and inaugurations, some of the donations came from people doing business with the federal government. Billionaire Texan Kelcy Warren, whose company is building the Dakota Access Pipeline, gave the inaugural committee $250,000. Christopher Cline, a billionaire coal magnate who owns Foresight Energy Partners, gave $1 million. Trump has vowed to bring back coal jobs, and his administration quickly approved the Dakota pipeline. Businesses that donated at the $1 million level included Bank of America, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Pfizer and Qualcomm. Companies also gave big in-kind contributions of goods and services, including nearly $500,000 in "vehicle expenses" from General Motors. AT&T made combined in-kind and cash donations of $2.1 million, and Microsoft's combined total was $500,000. Casino mogul Steve Wynn donated entertainers and production work valued at $729,000 for the Chairman's Ball, where the band Alabama and Wynn's ShowStoppers performed, according to Wynn spokesman Michael Weaver. Russian-America businessman Alexander Shustorovich also was among the $1 million donors to Trump's inauguration committee. The Republican National Committee refused a contribution from the U.S. citizen in 2000, citing news reports at the time that cautioned about his ties to Russian business. In more recent years, he's given money to the party, to 2012 candidate Mitt Romney, and to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, FEC records show. Donations from foreign nationals are banned. But the socialist administration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro made a $500,000 donation through Citgo Petroleum, a U.S. affiliate of Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA. PDVSA recently offered up a nearly 50 percent stake in Citgo as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan from Russian firm Rosneft. The deal drew criticism from Republicans who worry it sets the stage for Vladimir Putin to take control of American oil. The inauguration offered donors who had held back during the presidential campaign a chance to show belated support for the incoming president. Billionaire investor Paul Singer gave $1 million after long expressing skepticism about Trump. Like Singer, Chicago hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, conspicuously avoided giving money to Trump's campaign during the general election. Griffin gave the Trump inaugural $100,000. While the government sets strict contribution limits on political campaigns, the only federal restrictions on donations to inaugural committees are a ban on foreign nationals, according to Fischer, of the Campaign Legal Center. Past presidents-elect have tended to set voluntary limits on their inaugural fundraising, but Trump's only restriction was to ban money from lobbyists, he said. Obama in 2009 set a $50,000 cap on individual contributions and banned money from corporations, political action committees and lobbyists. He lifted those caps in 2013, when he raised about $43 million for a lower-key event. Inaugural committees have broad leeway in how they spend their money and what they do with the leftovers, although some limitations apply, according to Fischer. As a 501(c)(4) organization, for example, the committee could use some of the money to give bonuses to staff, but IRS rules say the committee couldn't operate primarily to benefit a small group of individuals. Federal campaigns wouldn't be able receive the money because it was raised outside contribution limits, he said. Trump's inaugural committee has promised to "identify and evaluate charities that will receive contributions left from the excess monies raised." ___ On Twitter follow Nancy Benac at: http://twitter.com/nbenac and Julie Bykowicz at http://twitter.com/bykowicz Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Where The Money Went Is Another Story By Danielle Kurtzleben • 5 hours ago TweetShareGoogle+Email President Trump waves to supporters as he walks the parade route with first lady Melania Trump after being sworn in on Jan. 20. An inauguration is an expensive party to throw, and President Trump got plenty of help putting his on. Financial Election Commission disclosures released on Wednesday show that some uberwealthy donors helped Trump defray the cost: Million-dollar givers included investment firm founder Charles Schwab, mining entrepreneur Christopher Cline and Bank of America. Investor and casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson spent $5 million. Those megadonors contributed to Trump's monster inauguration haul of nearly $107 million, the FEC forms show. That sum doubles President Barack Obama's then-record inauguration donations in 2009, which totaled around $53 million. Though this report shows how much money Trump's inauguration brought in, it does not detail exactly how that money was spent. Presidential inauguration committees do not have to disclose that to the FEC. Donations to the inauguration may come after a victory, but they can still have the basic message of a campaign donation ("You are a politician I like, and I would like to support you with a few dollars"). But then, sometimes donations can fulfill another purpose. "It's also a way for those who stayed away from Trump early on — didn't give to his campaign or superPACs, didn't help fund the convention, maybe backed another horse — to get on board with the incoming administration," said Viveca Novak, spokesperson at the Center for Responsive Politics, in an email. In addition, big donors to Trump's inauguration received special inauguration-weekend treats: tickets to the swearing-in and their names printed on inauguration programs, for example, according to an inauguration brochure first published by the Center for Public Integrity. The money also bought time with the president and vice president — those donating more than $500,000 were treated to dinner with Vice President Pence and his wife, Karen. The highest donors — those spending $1 million or more — gained access to a "Leadership Luncheon," which was "an exclusive event with select Cabinet appointees and House and Senate leadership." It's not exactly new for a presidential inauguration committee to take in corporate money. Though Obama's 2009 inauguration didn't accept corporate donations, his 2013 inauguration brought in money from AT&T and Microsoft, among others. Some companies are bipartisan in their support: Boeing and Chevron, for example, both donated to Obama's 2013 inauguration and Trump's inauguration alike. Those kinds of large donations, as well as the fact that the committee doesn't have to tell the FEC how it spent the money, are part of what one expert considers a relatively loose system governing how inaugurations are financed. "Really, there's very limited rules on how an inaugural committee has to spend the money, much less report how they spend the money," said Brendan Fischer, director of the federal and FEC legal program at the Campaign Legal Center. There are also few restrictions on where any leftover money might go after an inauguration, Fischer said. As a 501(c)(4) — a type of nonprofit — an inaugural committee couldn't, for example, donate the money to a political campaign. However, as Colby College professor and campaign finance expert Anthony Corrado told NPR, it could potentially give the funds to another 501(c)(4) — perhaps one that promotes the president's agenda. Trump's committee has said that any leftover money from this year's inauguration will be given to charity, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. For his part, Fischer thinks the Inauguration Day donations should have some of the strictures of campaign donations. "There's no reason to think that a million-dollar contribution made after Election Day would be any less corrupting or pose any less risk of influence than a million-dollar contribution made before Election Day," he said. While the donors were high-profile, taxpayers can end up footing a large part of the inauguration bill. An inauguration can be a massively expensive affair — ahead of this year's, the New York Times estimated the cost at $200 million. The Trump inauguration committee would account for only part of that; the Washington Post estimated before the event that the committee would spend somewhere around $70 million. The federal government also pays for specific parts of the festivities. For example, as the Times reported, federal money covers security, which may have cost around $100 million. Copyright 2017 NPR.

WASHINGTON (AP) >> It was huge. Big money from billionaires, corporations and a roster of NFL owners poured into Donald Trump’s inaugural committee in record-shattering amounts — to pull off an event that was considerably lower-key than previous inaugural celebrations. That leaves a bit of a mystery: What the $107 million was spent for and how much was left over — the excess, if any, to go to charity. It also raises a new round of questions about the influence of money in politics, this time for a president who promised to “drain the swamp” of Washington. Contribution records from Trump’s inaugural committee, released today by the Federal Election Commission, show the president who railed as a candidate against the corrupting influence of big-money donors was only too willing to accept top-dollar checks for his swearing-in festivities. Trump’s total take was about double the previous record set by Barack Obama, who collected $53 million in contributions in 2009, and had money left over to spend on the annual Easter egg roll and other White House events. Trump’s top inaugural donor was Las Vegas gambling billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who gave $5 million. He and his wife came away with prime seats for Trump’s swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20 and gained access to a private lunch with the new president and lawmakers at the Capitol. Phil Ruffin, another casino mogul and close friend of Trump, was among dozens of donors who gave $1 million each. At least eight NFL team owners kicked in big money for the inauguration. Seven of them, including Patriots owner Bob Kraft, whose team won the Super Bowl and visited the White House on Wednesday, gave $1 million apiece. Kraft’s donation came via his limited liability company. Trump plans to name the New York Jets’ Woody Johnson, one of those million-dollar donors, to be the country’s ambassador to the United Kingdom. Asked whether the president feels conflicted about his committee accepting so much corporate and wealthy donor money, spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday that financing the inaugural is “a time-honored tradition” and there are “a lot of people who really take pride in helping us show the world a peaceful transformation of power.” Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit pro-transparency group, countered: “If you take Trump at his word that when political figures accept large amounts of money from corporate interests or special interests that they’re indebted to those big donors, there’s certainly reason to question what donors to Trump’s inaugural committee might expect in return.” As is often the case with campaigns and inaugurations, some of the donations came from people doing business with the federal government. Billionaire Texan Kelcy Warren, whose company is building the Dakota Access Pipeline, gave the inaugural committee $250,000. Christopher Cline, a billionaire coal magnate who owns Foresight Energy Partners, gave $1 million. Trump has vowed to bring back coal jobs, and his administration quickly approved the Dakota pipeline. Businesses that donated at the $1 million level included Bank of America, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Pfizer and Qualcomm. Companies also gave big in-kind contributions of goods and services, including nearly $500,000 in “vehicle expenses” from General Motors. AT&T made combined in-kind and cash donations of $2.1 million, and Microsoft’s combined total was $500,000. Casino mogul Steve Wynn donated entertainers and production work valued at $729,000 for the Chairman’s Ball, where the band Alabama and Wynn’s ShowStoppers performed, according to Wynn spokesman Michael Weaver. Russian-America businessman Alexander Shustorovich also was among the $1 million donors to Trump’s inauguration committee. The Republican National Committee refused a contribution from the U.S. citizen in 2000, citing news reports at the time that cautioned about his ties to Russian business. In more recent years, he’s given money to the party, to 2012 candidate Mitt Romney, and to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, FEC records show. Donations from foreign nationals are banned. But the socialist administration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro made a $500,000 donation through Citgo Petroleum, a U.S. affiliate of Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA. PDVSA recently offered up a nearly 50 percent stake in Citgo as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan from Russian firm Rosneft. The deal drew criticism from Republicans who worry it sets the stage for Vladimir Putin to take control of American oil. The inauguration offered donors who had held back during the presidential campaign a chance to show belated support for the incoming president. Billionaire investor Paul Singer gave $1 million after long expressing skepticism about Trump. Like Singer, Chicago hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, conspicuously avoided giving money to Trump’s campaign during the general election. Griffin gave the Trump inaugural $100,000. While the government sets strict contribution limits on political campaigns, the only federal restrictions on donations to inaugural committees are a ban on foreign nationals, according to Fischer, of the Campaign Legal Center. Past presidents-elect have tended to set voluntary limits on their inaugural fundraising, but Trump’s only restriction was to ban money from lobbyists, he said. Obama in 2009 set a $50,000 cap on individual contributions and banned money from corporations, political action committees and lobbyists. He lifted those caps in 2013, when he raised about $43 million for a lower-key event. Inaugural committees have broad leeway in how they spend their money and what they do with the leftovers, although some limitations apply, according to Fischer. As a 501(c)(4) organization, for example, the committee could use some of the money to give bonuses to staff, but IRS rules say the committee couldn’t operate primarily to benefit a small group of individuals. Federal campaigns wouldn’t be able receive the money because it was raised outside contribution limits, he said. Trump’s inaugural committee has promised to “identify and evaluate charities that will receive contributions left from the excess monies raised.” Get the latest news by email Sign Up Share this: PREV NEXT Most Read Ex-NFL star Aaron Hernandez hangs himself in his prison cell Man slashed across the neck at North Shore market Missing Marine found dead on Koolau trail Bill O’Reilly out at Fox News Channel after 20 years Isle retirees making most out of HECO rate program Comments () By participating in online discussions you acknowledge that you have agreed to the TERMS OF SERVICE.

That's essentially what the passenger dragged from a United Airlines flight this week in a scuffle with security that went viral could do if the carrier decides to settle with him out of court, legal experts say. And yes, the airline would want to settle quickly and quietly with Dr. David Dao instead of go to trial, the experts add. That's so that this case — after throwing United into a storm of bad publicity — goes away. "In an instance like this, it would be beyond insanity to do anything more than bring [Dao] into a conference room and basically say there's a check on the desk, it's signed, just fill in the amount," said New York trial attorney Randy Zelin.

His attorney, Thomas Demetrio, said he's still determining what a potential lawsuit might look like, but is girding for a fight with United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz. "Mr. Munoz, believe me, he will have a team of lawyers that will get involved and there will be litigation," Demetrio said at a news conference Thursday. "It's not that easy." It's not. Such lawsuits can take months, and in many cases years, to wind through the system, as sides go head-to-head over who was at fault and how much in damages is actually owed. High-profile cases can put pressure on the negotiations, said Kenneth Quinn, a partner who represents airlines at the D.C. law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. Dao's legal team can try to argue that United breached its own contract by booting him, but the airline could also claim that Dao's obstinate refusal is what set off the chaotic chain of events. Related: How Do Airlines Select Who to Remove From Overbooked Flights? Quinn said that United would have a hard time swaying a jury because of the videos that show the 69-year-old Dao being forcibly removed, clearly upsetting his fellow passengers. His lawyers say he fell and lost two front teeth and suffered a broken nose and concussion. But ultimately, airlines don't like going to court, and more than 95 percent of cases involving them are settled, Quinn estimated. "Money isn't the issue for them — it's about the precedent and signal it sends if an airline goes to trial and loses," he added. "They don't want another case of a person not following crew instructions in the hopes they hit some financial windfall." Often, these lawsuits are settled confidentially, which means the amounts that plaintiffs are paid aren't publicly disclosed. That was the case when 11 passengers sued Southwest Airlines, Boeing and the city of Chicago in 2006 for fear, distress and physical harm following a botched plane landing that resulted in one death when the aircraft barreled out of the airport and into an intersection.

In another case, 72 passengers agreed to settle confidentially when an Asiana Airlines flight slammed into a runway at San Francisco International Airport in 2013, killing three. The family of a teenage girl who was killed by emergency vehicles after the crash also dropped a lawsuit in exchange for a settlement. It took 20 months after the accident before attorneys announced a settlement. Dao appears to have the upper hand in his case. Munoz apologized repeatedly for the passenger's treatment, saying on national television this week that he "can't be" at fault and what happened to him was the result of a "system failure." The airline is conducting an internal investigation and has pledged to no longer allow officers on board to physically pull booked and seated customers off its planes. Related: Here's Why It's Legal for Airlines to Kick You Off Your Flight Demetrio on Thursday said he wants Dao to ultimately be a "poster child" for airline reform. But Zelin warns that if United feels like Dao is expecting too much, they'll be quick to draw a line: "You don't want to be viewed as a pinata where people can line up and wait for you to break out your checkbook." Meanwhile, airlines can anticipate more of these viral incidents brewing into lawsuits, Quinn added, as passengers become trained to hit record on their cellphones. "The instantaneous videotaping occurring with over 3 million people flying a day changes the nature of an airline's response and crisis management," Quinn said. "It's no longer a letter of complaint being filed — it's videos on the internet, and social media outrage and CEOs responding instantaneously. So much more comes into play."

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, Pool, File) A Vegas gambling billionaire donates $5M; 7 NFL team owners cough up $1M each. Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) Washington • It was huge. Big money from billionaires, corporations and a roster of NFL owners poured into Donald Trump's inaugural committee in record-shattering amounts — to pull off an event that was considerably lower-key than previous inaugural celebrations. That leaves a bit of a mystery: What the $107 million was spent for and how much was left over — the excess, if any, to go to charity. It also raises a new round of questions about the influence of money in politics, this time for a president who promised to "drain the swamp" of Washington. Contribution records from Trump's inaugural committee, released Wednesday by the Federal Election Commission, show the president who railed as a candidate against the corrupting influence of big-money donors was only too willing to accept top-dollar checks for his swearing-in festivities. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Trump's total take was about double the previous record set by Barack Obama, who collected $53 million in contributions in 2009, and had money left over to spend on the annual Easter egg roll and other White House events. Trump's top inaugural donor was Las Vegas gambling billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who gave $5 million. He and his wife gained access to a private lunch with the new president and lawmakers at the Capitol. Phil Ruffin, another casino mogul and close friend of Trump, was among dozens of donors who gave $1 million each. At least eight NFL team owners kicked in big money for the inauguration. Seven of them, including Patriots owner Bob Kraft, whose team won the Super Bowl and visited the White House on Wednesday, gave $1 million apiece. Kraft's donation came via his limited liability company. Trump plans to name the New York Jets' Woody Johnson, one of those million-dollar donors, to be the country's ambassador to the United Kingdom. Asked whether the president feels conflicted about his committee accepting so much corporate and wealthy-donor money, spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday that financing the inaugural is "a time-honored tradition" and there are "a lot of people who really take pride in helping us show the world a peaceful transformation of power." Billionaire Texan Kelcy Warren, whose company is building the Dakota Access Pipeline, gave the inaugural committee $250,000. Christopher Cline, a billionaire coal magnate who owns Foresight Energy Partners, gave $1 million. Trump has vowed to bring back coal jobs, and his administration quickly approved the Dakota pipeline. Businesses that donated at the $1 million level included Bank of America, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Pfizer and Qualcomm. Companies also gave big in-kind contributions of goods and services, including nearly $500,000 in "vehicle expenses" from General Motors. AT&T made combined in-kind and cash donations of $2.1 million, and Microsoft's combined total was $500,000. Russian-America businessman Alexander Shustorovich also was among the $1 million donors to Trump's inauguration committee. The Republican National Committee refused a contribution from the U.S. citizen in 2000, citing news reports at the time that cautioned about his ties to Russian business. In more recent years, he's given money to the party, to 2012 candidate Mitt Romney, and to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, FEC records show.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES 'Trust gap' hounds the Mormon church, research shows Rift widens over Huntsman Cancer Institute CEO's firing Monson: Jazz have one key to advance in the playoffs -- Rudy Gobert's health Monson: Kalani Sitake is quietly picking up the trash at BYU Washington Post Editorial: Turkey's ugly election Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Traffic Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

That leaves a bit of a mystery: What the $107 million was spent for and how much was left over - the excess, if any, to go to charity.

Phil Ruffin, another casino mogul and close friend of Trump, was among dozens of donors who gave $1 million each. At least eight NFL team owners kicked in big money for the inauguration. Seven of them, including Patriots owner Bob Kraft, whose team won the Super Bowl and visited the White House on Wednesday, gave $1 million apiece. Kraft's donation came via his limited liability company. Trump plans to name the New York Jets' Woody Johnson, one of those million-dollar donors, to be the country's ambassador to the United Kingdom. Asked whether the president feels conflicted about his committee accepting so much corporate and wealthy donor money, spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday that financing the inaugural is "a time-honored tradition" and there are "a lot of people who really take pride in helping us show the world a peaceful transformation of power." Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit pro-transparency group, countered: "If you take Trump at his word that when political figures accept large amounts of money from corporate interests or special interests that they're indebted to those big donors, there's certainly reason to question what donors to Trump's inaugural committee might expect in return." As is often the case with campaigns and inaugurations, some of the donations came from people doing business with the federal government. Billionaire Texan Kelcy Warren, whose company is building the Dakota Access Pipeline, gave the inaugural committee $250,000. Christopher Cline, a billionaire coal magnate who owns Foresight Energy Partners, gave $1 million. Trump has vowed to bring back coal jobs, and his administration quickly approved the Dakota pipeline. Businesses that donated at the $1 million level included Bank of America, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Pfizer and Qualcomm. Companies also gave big in-kind contributions of goods and services, including nearly $500,000 in "vehicle expenses" from General Motors. AT&T made combined in-kind and cash donations of $2.1 million, and Microsoft's combined total was $500,000. Casino mogul Steve Wynn donated entertainers and production work valued at $729,000 for the Chairman's Ball, where the band Alabama and Wynn's ShowStoppers performed, according to Wynn spokesman Michael Weaver. Russian-America businessman Alexander Shustorovich also was among the $1 million donors to Trump's inauguration committee. The Republican National Committee refused a contribution from the U.S. citizen in 2000, citing news reports at the time that cautioned about his ties to Russian business. In more recent years, he's given money to the party, to 2012 candidate Mitt Romney, and to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, FEC records show. Donations from foreign nationals are banned. But the socialist administration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro made a $500,000 donation through Citgo Petroleum, a U.S. affiliate of Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA. PDVSA recently offered up a nearly 50 percent stake in Citgo as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan from Russian firm Rosneft. The deal drew criticism from Republicans who worry it sets the stage for Vladimir Putin to take control of American oil. The inauguration offered donors who had held back during the presidential campaign a chance to show belated support for the incoming president. Billionaire investor Paul Singer gave $1 million after long expressing skepticism about Trump. Like Singer, Chicago hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, conspicuously avoided giving money to Trump's campaign during the general election. Griffin gave the Trump inaugural $100,000. While the government sets strict contribution limits on political campaigns, the only federal restrictions on donations to inaugural committees are a ban on foreign nationals, according to Fischer, of the Campaign Legal Center. Past presidents-elect have tended to set voluntary limits on their inaugural fundraising, but Trump's only restriction was to ban money from lobbyists, he said. Obama in 2009 set a $50,000 cap on individual contributions and banned money from corporations, political action committees and lobbyists. He lifted those caps in 2013, when he raised about $43 million for a lower-key event. Inaugural committees have broad leeway in how they spend their money and what they do with the leftovers, although some limitations apply, according to Fischer. As a 501(c)(4) organization, for example, the committee could use some of the money to give bonuses to staff, but IRS rules say the committee couldn't operate primarily to benefit a small group of individuals. Federal campaigns wouldn't be able receive the money because it was raised outside contribution limits, he said. Trump's inaugural committee has promised to "identify and evaluate charities that will receive contributions left from the excess monies raised." ___ On Twitter follow Nancy Benac at: http://twitter.com/nbenac and Julie Bykowicz at http://twitter.com/bykowicz Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Big money from billionaires, corporations and a roster of NFL owners poured into Donald Trump‘s inaugural committee in record-shattering amounts – to pull off an event that was considerably lower-key than previous inaugural celebrations. Story continues below That leaves a bit of a mystery: What the $107 million was spent for and how much was left over – the excess, if any, to go to charity. It also raises a new round of questions about the influence of money in politics, this time for a president who promised to “drain the swamp” of Washington. READ MORE: Tom Brady, 30 other New England Patriots pass on Donald Trump White House visit Contribution records from Trump’s inaugural committee, released Wednesday by the Federal Election Commission, show the president who railed as a candidate against the corrupting influence of big-money donors was only too willing to accept top-dollar checks for his swearing-in festivities. Trump’s total take was about double the previous record set by Barack Obama, who collected $53 million in contributions in 2009, and had money left over to spend on the annual Easter egg roll and other White House events. WATCH: Trump sets his sights set on Canada Trump’s top inaugural donor was Las Vegas gambling billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who gave $5 million. He and his wife came away with prime seats for Trump’s swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20 and gained access to a private lunch with the new president and lawmakers at the Capitol. Phil Ruffin, another casino mogul and close friend of Trump, was among dozens of donors who gave $1 million each. At least eight NFL team owners kicked in big money for the inauguration. Seven of them, including Patriots owner Bob Kraft, whose team won the Super Bowl and visited the White House on Wednesday, gave $1 million apiece. Kraft’s donation came via his limited liability company. Trump plans to name the New York Jets’ Woody Johnson, one of those million-dollar donors, to be the country’s ambassador to the United Kingdom. READ MORE: Canadian envoy downplaying talk of potential trade rift with the U.S. Asked whether the president feels conflicted about his committee accepting so much corporate and wealthy donor money, spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday that financing the inaugural is “a time-honoured tradition” and there are “a lot of people who really take pride in helping us show the world a peaceful transformation of power.” Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center, a non-profit pro-transparency group, countered: “If you take Trump at his word that when political figures accept large amounts of money from corporate interests or special interests that they’re indebted to those big donors, there’s certainly reason to question what donors to Trump’s inaugural committee might expect in return.” As is often the case with campaigns and inaugurations, some of the donations came from people doing business with the federal government. WATCH: Trump spokesperson stands by claim inauguration ‘most watched’ ever Billionaire Texan Kelcy Warren, whose company is building the Dakota Access Pipeline, gave the inaugural committee $250,000. Christopher Cline, a billionaire coal magnate who owns Foresight Energy Partners, gave $1 million. Trump has vowed to bring back coal jobs, and his administration quickly approved the Dakota pipeline. Businesses that donated at the $1 million level included Bank of America, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Pfizer and Qualcomm. Companies also gave huge in-kind contributions of goods and services, including $2.1 million from AT&T for mobile equipment and software, nearly $500,000 in “vehicle expenses” from General Motors and $500,000 in equipment from Microsoft.

Russian-America businessman Alexander Shustorovich also was among the $1 million donors to Trump’s inauguration committee. The Republican National Committee refused a contribution from the U.S. citizen in 2000, citing news reports at the time that cautioned about his ties to Russian business. In more recent years, he’s given money to the party, to 2012 candidate Mitt Romney, and to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, FEC records show. The inauguration offered donors who had held back during the presidential campaign a chance to show belated support for the incoming president. Billionaire investor Paul Singer gave $1 million after long expressing skepticism about Trump. Like Singer, Chicago hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, conspicuously avoided giving money to Trump’s campaign during the general election. Griffin gave the Trump inaugural $100,000. READ MORE: Why did Donald Trump attack the Canadian dairy industry? While the government sets strict contribution limits on political campaigns, the only federal restrictions on donations to inaugural committees are a ban on foreign nationals, according to Fischer, of the Campaign Legal Center. Past presidents-elect have tended to set voluntary limits on their inaugural fundraising, but Trump’s only restriction was to ban money from lobbyists, he said. Obama in 2009 set a $50,000 cap on individual contributions and banned money from corporations, political action committees and lobbyists. He lifted those caps in 2013, when he raised about $43 million for a lower-key event.

But the socialist administration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro made a $500,000 donation through Citgo Petroleum, a U.S. affiliate of Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA. PDVSA recently offered up a nearly 50 percent stake in Citgo as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan from Russian firm Rosneft. The deal drew criticism from Republicans who worry it sets the stage for Vladimir Putin to take control of American oil. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

Russian-America businessman Alexander Shustorovich also was among the $1 million donors to Trump's inauguration committee. The Republican National Committee refused a contribution from the U.S. citizen in 2000, citing news reports at the time that cautioned about his ties to Russian business. In more recent years, he's given money to the party, to 2012 candidate Mitt Romney, and to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, FEC records show. Donations from foreign nationals are banned. But the socialist administration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro made a $500,000 donation through Citgo Petroleum, a U.S. affiliate of Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA. PDVSA recently offered up a nearly 50 percent stake in Citgo as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan from Russian firm Rosneft. The deal drew criticism from Republicans who worry it sets the stage for Vladimir Putin to take control of American oil. The inauguration offered donors who had held back during the presidential campaign a chance to show belated support for the incoming president. Billionaire investor Paul Singer gave $1 million after long expressing skepticism about Trump. Like Singer, Chicago hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, conspicuously avoided giving money to Trump's campaign during the general election. Griffin gave the Trump inaugural $100,000. While the government sets strict contribution limits on political campaigns, the only federal restrictions on donations to inaugural committees are a ban on foreign nationals, according to Fischer, of the Campaign Legal Center. Past presidents-elect have tended to set voluntary limits on their inaugural fundraising, but Trump's only restriction was to ban money from lobbyists, he said. Obama in 2009 set a $50,000 cap on individual contributions and banned money from corporations, political action committees and lobbyists. He lifted those caps in 2013, when he raised about $43 million for a lower-key event. Inaugural committees have broad leeway in how they spend their money and what they do with the leftovers, although some limitations apply, according to Fischer. As a 501(c)(4) organization, for example, the committee could use some of the money to give bonuses to staff, but IRS rules say the committee couldn't operate primarily to benefit a small group of individuals. Federal campaigns wouldn't be able receive the money because it was raised outside contribution limits, he said. Trump's inaugural committee has promised to "identify and evaluate charities that will receive contributions left from the excess monies raised." ___ On Twitter follow Nancy Benac at: http://twitter.com/nbenac and Julie Bykowicz at http://twitter.com/bykowicz Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Getty Images President Trump waves to supporters as he walks the parade route with first lady Melania Trump after being sworn in on Jan. 20. Getty Images An inauguration is an expensive party to throw, and President Trump got plenty of help putting his on. Financial Election Commission disclosures released on Wednesday show that some uberwealthy donors helped Trump defray the cost: Million-dollar givers included investment firm founder Charles Schwab, mining entrepreneur Christopher Cline and Bank of America. Investor and casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson spent $5 million. Those megadonors contributed to Trump's monster inauguration haul of nearly $107 million, the FEC forms show. That sum doubles President Barack Obama's then-record inauguration donations in 2009, which totaled around $53 million. Though this report shows how much money Trump's inauguration brought in, it does not detail exactly how that money was spent. Presidential inauguration committees do not have to disclose that to the FEC. Donations to the inauguration may come after a victory, but they can still have the basic message of a campaign donation ("You are a politician I like, and I would like to support you with a few dollars"). But then, sometimes donations can fulfill another purpose. Politics Simple Beats Nuance, Which Is Part Of Why Trump Isn't Releasing Those Tax Returns "It's also a way for those who stayed away from Trump early on — didn't give to his campaign or superPACs, didn't help fund the convention, maybe backed another horse — to get on board with the incoming administration," said Viveca Novak, spokesperson at the Center for Responsive Politics, in an email. In addition, big donors to Trump's inauguration received special inauguration-weekend treats: tickets to the swearing-in and their names printed on inauguration programs, for example, according to an inauguration brochure first published by the Center for Public Integrity. The money also bought time with the president and vice president — those donating more than $500,000 were treated to dinner with Vice President Pence and his wife, Karen. The highest donors — those spending $1 million or more — gained access to a "Leadership Luncheon," which was "an exclusive event with select Cabinet appointees and House and Senate leadership." Politics What Trump's Taxes Would Not Show About His Finances It's not exactly new for a presidential inauguration committee to take in corporate money. Though Obama's 2009 inauguration didn't accept corporate donations, his 2013 inauguration brought in money from AT&T and Microsoft, among others. Some companies are bipartisan in their support: Boeing and Chevron, for example, both donated to Obama's 2013 inauguration and Trump's inauguration alike. Those kinds of large donations, as well as the fact that the committee doesn't have to tell the FEC how it spent the money, are part of what one expert considers a relatively loose system governing how inaugurations are financed. "Really, there's very limited rules on how an inaugural committee has to spend the money, much less report how they spend the money," said Brendan Fischer, director of the federal and FEC legal program at the Campaign Legal Center. There are also few restrictions on where any leftover money might go after an inauguration, Fischer said. As a 501(c)(4) — a type of nonprofit — an inaugural committee couldn't, for example, donate the money to a political campaign. However, as Colby College professor and campaign finance expert Anthony Corrado told NPR, it could potentially give the funds to another 501(c)(4) — perhaps one that promotes the president's agenda. Trump's committee has said that any leftover money from this year's inauguration will be given to charity, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. For his part, Fischer thinks the Inauguration Day donations should have some of the strictures of campaign donations. "There's no reason to think that a million-dollar contribution made after Election Day would be any less corrupting or pose any less risk of influence than a million-dollar contribution made before Election Day," he said. Politics Security Will Be Massive At Trump's Inauguration While the donors were high-profile, taxpayers can end up footing a large part of the inauguration bill. An inauguration can be a massively expensive affair — ahead of this year's, the New York Times estimated the cost at $200 million. The Trump inauguration committee would account for only part of that; the Washington Post estimated before the event that the committee would spend somewhere around $70 million. The federal government also pays for specific parts of the festivities. For example, as the Times reported, federal money covers security, which may have cost around $100 million.

The order, which Trump will sign in Wisconsin this afternoon, will direct Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to lead an investigation into government procurement practices at federal agencies, with a focus on rooting out weak monitoring, enforcement and compliance efforts. It will also task four agencies with re-examining all programs under which workers enter the United States from abroad” [Politico]. Politics New Cold War “US deploys ‘a few dozen’ troops to Somalia: Pentagon” [Al Jazeera]. Swell. 2016 Post Mortem “Trump’s Wisconsin win was an aftershock of the Great Recession” [WaPo]. Eight years later… Some shock! About a new book on Janesville, Wisconsin, which nearly flipped to Trump. This: “To this day, most Washington elites don’t fully grasp just how painful the Great Recession was for tens of millions of Americans. Government spending increased, and the military-industrial complex prospered, so D.C. denizens were mostly insulated from the economic crisis.” And this: “Importantly, Janesville is not part of the Rust Belt. Places like Youngstown, Ohio, and Pittsburgh have been decaying for decades. But this area was faring relatively well until the 2000s. Generations of Janesville kids, going back to 1923, grew up excited to follow their dads onto the assembly line so they too could make Chevys. They saw a union card, not a college degree, as the ticket to a respectable middle-class livelihood. So the plant closure was a profound shock to the system.” “‘Shattered’ Charts Hillary Clinton’s Course Into the Iceberg” (ha) [New York Times]. “In chronicling these missteps, ‘Shattered’ creates a picture of a shockingly inept campaign hobbled by hubris and unforced errors, and haunted by a sense of self-pity and doom, summed up in one Clinton aide’s mantra throughout the campaign: ‘We’re not allowed to have nice things.'” No nice things. So Clinton delivered the same message internally she delivered to voters. “‘Shattered’ offers a number of gratifying revelations. Among them: Mrs. Clinton’s tinkering with a certain computer server. Not that server—a different one” [Wall Street Journal]. After losing to Mr. Obama in the protracted 2008 primary, she was convinced that she had lost because some staffers—she wasn’t sure who—had been disloyal. So she “instructed a trusted aide to access the campaign’s server and download the [email] messages sent and received by top staffers.” This tells us, first, that Mrs. Clinton possesses an almost Nixonian paranoia about treachery and, second, that her use of a private email server at the State Department was never the naive “mistake” she pretended it was. In fact, she didn’t want anyone reading her emails the way she was reading those of her 2008 staffers. Plausible, at least. 2017 GA-06: Voting today. GA-06: “It’s not clear what to expect Tuesday night, however. It’s hard to estimate how many people will vote, and the public polls are of fairly low quality. One prediction: It’s likely that the first votes counted will be misleadingly good for Mr. Ossoff” [New York Times]. “There is no reasonable way to look at the polls and conclude that Mr. Ossoff is likely to get to 50 percent. But it would not take an especially unusual polling error, at least for a special election, for him to pull it off.” GA-06: “WaPo’s Bob Costa gives us his take: ‘This district has been the launching pad for big foot conservative Georgia Republicans ever since Gingrich won the seat in ‘78. Then came Johnny Isakson and Tom Price. As Ralph Reed told me, this explains why 11 Republicans are clamoring to be the next congressman. Get a base in the wealthy Atlanta suburbs and you’ve probably got yourself a political future. The chaotic GOP scramble hasn’t been pretty but as long as Ossoff remains below 50 percent Tuesday, it’ll still probably be a GOP district come June, when and if the run-off comes. Ossoff has done well but the Atlanta ‘burbs aren’t the swing Philly ‘burbs… yet.'” [Politico]. GA-06: “Georgia special election: one local penny for every $10 in national cash” [Center for Public Integrity]. GA-06: Ossoff: “I’m focused on bringing fresh leadership, accountability and bipartisan problem solving to Washington to cut wasteful spending and grow metro Atlanta’s economy into the Silicon Valley of the South” [Newsweek]. Eesh. Sounds like the Dems backing Ossoff read Listen, Liberal and said “Yeah, let’s do more of that.” Realignment and Legitimacy DNC Deckchair Perez and Sanders kick off the DNC unity tour in Portland, Maine: Crowd goes wild at mention of Bernie Sanders. Some crowd members &#39;boo&#39; at mention of DNC Chair Tom Perez. #NEWSCENTERnow pic.twitter.com/iFX4So1eWp &mdash; Kristina Rex (@KristinaRex) April 17, 2017 Be interesting to see if this keeps happening… “And in recent weeks, former President Bill Clinton told new Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez that he didn’t want the Democratic Party ‘to be simply the party of Bernie,’ according to a source familiar with that conversation” [The Hill]. Marching orders? “An aide to Clinton refuted the characterization, saying the former president has always said the strength of Democratic Party is its inclusiveness. A DNC spokesperson said Perez says the conversation didn’t happen.” “DNC Announces Members Of Unity Reform Commission” [HuffPo]. “The commission will now begin the process of discussing reforms to the party’s presidential nominating process, including hot-button issues like the role of super-delegates and caucuses. It will present its recommendations to the DNC by January 2018.” Sanders had also already named his selections to the commission. They are Cohen, the vice chair; former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner; former Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver; former Sanders New York delegate Nomiki Konst; Jim Zogby, founder of the Arab-American Institute; former Berkeley, California Mayor Gus Newport; former Nevada Assemblywoman Lucy Flores; and Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb. The DNC declined to name the three members Perez picked and a spokesman for Clinton did not respond to a request for information on her appointments. “The Upstate New York congressman who faced overflowing crowds of protesters at town hall meetings managed to raise a record amount of money after the protests gained national attention” [Syracuse.com]. “U.S. Rep. Tom Reed raised $585,282 in the first quarter of the year, a personal high for the fourth-term Republican from Corning.” What if Dems had a positive, policy-driven message? I guess we’ll never know. “Moderate Republican House members have had a much tougher recess than conservatives when it comes to Trumpcare. Members from purple districts have had to weather angry liberals and disappointed conservatives, while conservatives have largely emerged as heroes” [Axios]. “With different factions of the GOP pointing fingers at one another, the blame game is only effective if members’ constituents are angry with their representative. Right now, it seems like the Freedom Caucus is actually being celebrated for blocking Trumpcare, which was extremely unpopular nationally.” And then there’s this: There&#39;s a sharp drop in Democratic Party favorability among Dem-leaning independents https://t.co/3lv2aPqlhp pic.twitter.com/HaoNfU5SJa &mdash; Pew Research Center (@pewresearch) April 17, 2017 Clearly, Democrats need to talk more about Putin and keep pushing for war. Stats Watch Industrial Production, March 2017: “A weather-related surge in utility output masks what is otherwise a weak industrial production report for March” [Econoday]. “[M]anufacturing production, where a small gain was expected, fell. … [I]t’s manufacturing that represents the vast core of this report and it points to a quarter-end fizzle for a factory sector where unusually strong readings in sentiment reports have not panned out to strength in definitive data like today’s report.” And: “Very modest growth continues from the lows following the crash in oil capex, and note that the numbers are not inflation adjusted” [Mosler Economics]. Housing Starts, March 2017: “The first quarter ended with a thud for housing starts which fell a very steep 6.8 percent” [Econoday]. “[S]trength is entirely on the multi-family side… March data are often difficult when seasonal factors, including heavy weather, are often at play. But the weakness in starts and strength in permits do point to a possible and favorable theme for the first-half economy in general: weakness in the first quarter followed by a sizable rebound in the second.” Huh? “Favorable theme”? Huh? But and: “Multi-family is frequently volatile month-to-month, and has seen especially wild swings over the last six months” [Calculated Risk]. “Starts were up 9.2% in March 2017 compared to March 2016, and starts are up 8.1% year-to-date. My guess is starts will increase around 3% to 7% in 2017. This is a solid start to 2017, however the comparison was pretty easy in March.” Retail: “Warehouses like these are becoming a way of life for many urbanites. Instead of spending the afternoon choosing items off store shelves and standing in a checkout line, city dwellers of the future will tap a few buttons on hand-held devices and a part-human, part-machine warehouse crew in a nearby industrial district will handle the transaction from start to finish. The weekly shopping is done in 10 minutes, and the shopper never has to leave the house” [Wall Street Journal]. Debt: “Loan growth stalls despite profit, trading gains at some U.S. banks” [Reuters]. “Big U.S. banks revealed more evidence of a slowdown in loan growth in their earnings reports on Thursday, though executives assured there is still healthy demand from borrowers and no reason to worry about the state of the economy.” I’m not an expert in bank executive-ese. Is “no reason to worry” like “the dreaded vote of confidence” in baseball? Commodities: “Companies controlled by Israeli mining magnate Beny Steinmetz sued fellow billionaire George Soros, claiming he cost them at least $10 billion through a defamation campaign that stripped them of rights to an iron ore deposit in Guinea and other business opportunities around the world” [Bloomberg]. Shipping: “Within the maritime industry, non-compliance in container packing comes in several flavours, such as container weight mis-declaration, cargo mis-declaration, undeclared hazardous cargo, and lack of identification marks such as proper labelling” [Lloyd’s Loading]. “Whatever the flavour, this non-compliance has caused, and continues to cause, a lot of damage across the shipping and freight industry, both in terms of money and lives, and places the entire supply chain under risk.” No hard numbers, though. Shipping: “Los Angeles reported a 29% year-on-year rise in containers handled in March to 788,524 teu due to a post-Lunar New Year jump in cargo from Asia as well as more US retailers transporting goods before the new vessel alliance network operations kicked in on April 1” [Lloyd’s List]. Shipping: “J.B. Hunt operated fewer trucks last quarter, and the results show few signs that the carrier will want to add capacity anytime soon” [Wall Street Journal]. The Bezzle: “Do Independent Directors Curb Financial Fraud? The Evidence and Proposals for Further Reform” [The Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation]. “One would have hoped these SOX-created independent watchdogs would reduce the incidents of securities fraud and result in better governance. Yet, our analysis of the number of class action settlements for claims of financial fraud for settlements greater than $10 million shows no significant decrease since the adoption of SOX.” Labor Power: “The Boeing Co. will shed more employees as it faces new orders and production slow down for some of the company’s current commercial jets. According to reports Monday morning, the company plans to fire ‘hundreds’ more engineers this year with the cuts scheduled to begin on June 23” [247 Wall Street].

Health Care “How Dumping ACA Exchanges Boosted UnitedHealth’s Profits” [247 Wall Street]. “Trumpcare’s demise offers an important lesson about economic policy more generally. The more universal a program is, the greater the number of Americans will become advocates for its preservation. This is a fact that conservatives know and fear thanks to Medicare and social security, but many establishment liberals since the Democratic Party’s neoliberal turn have failed to understand — or perhaps some Clintonites understand it all too well” [Jacobin]. Gaia “Gas Leak At BP Oil Well In Alaska Has Been Stopped” [NPR]. “Bacteria-busting toothpastes that help prevent cavities in your teeth could be making small dents in the community of microbes in your gut—possibly allowing antibiotic-resistant bacteria to fill in—preliminary data suggests” [Ars Technica]. “The data is preliminary—it has not been peer-reviewed or published in a journal yet—and the study was small, including women and infants from only 39 households. But, the findings fall in line with several other studies that found that triclosan and other common antimicrobials can cause subtle disruptions in all-powerful gut microbiomes.” “It stands to reason that as global warming intensifies certain weather patterns and creates stronger storms, inflight encounters with strong turbulence will increase. Until recently, however, there haven’t been any formal studies linking climate change with rougher flying. Now there are. A new paper published by atmospheric scientist Paul Williams from the University of Reading suggests that instances of strong, potentially dangerous turbulence will increase significantly by the middle of the century” [Ask the Pilot]. “I’ve been flying across the North Atlantic since 1997. My observations are just that, and are purely anecdotal, but what I’ve experienced more or less meshes with the research. It’s become bumpier and windier, on average, and storms seem to be larger and more widespread. Most notably, it’s no longer uncommon to encounter thunderstorms even in the colder months.” Class Warfare “In a survey of Americans ages 31 to 37, the Fed bank found that, although having a college degree substantially boosted one’s likelihood of owning a house, those still paying off debt for their bachelor’s degrees had homeownership rates several percentage points lower than that of their peers without student loans. The gap was larger among graduates with associate’s degrees, and the homeownership rate of associate degree holders who took on student debt was closer to that of Americans with no degree than to that of their fellow associate’s degree grads with no debt” [International Business Times]. “Andrew Sullivan has a post where he argues that the economic success of Asians in the United States suggests that the lack of financial success of other groups cannot be chalked up to racism” [Jacobin]. “Asian economic success also varies a lot by group…. Some Asian groups are doing well, but others are doing very poorly. Cambodians and Hmong people, for instance, have poverty rates that are similar to those of blacks, Natives, and Latinos. Statements like the one Sullivan made do not just wave over the complicated history of the matter. They also mislead people about the current situation of Asians in America.” The rise of the robots: Minsky reflecting on a conversation with Joan Robinson about who will buy the output when the robots &quot;take over.&quot; 😂https://t.co/ieeh2o6ih3 pic.twitter.com/aF4KbusYIl &mdash; Stephanie Kelton (@StephanieKelton) April 17, 2017 News of the Wired “Email, in other words, is regulated like a physical record, but we treat it as a conversation.

Nearly everyone — 89 percent — admitted to using company email for gossip, jokes, and insults, and 9 percent shared romantic or pornographic material. It’s no wonder that a quarter of companies reported having employee email subpoenaed and another quarter reported firing someone that year for email misuse.” “But there’s a dark side to [FaceBook’s] Free Basics that has the potential to do more harm than good — a side that suggests that Zuckerberg doesn’t get Africa after all. The app is essentially a cheap version of the internet, a fact that by itself implies that some people aren’t good enough to merit the whole thing. Even worse, it’s a version of the internet that gives Facebook — and by extension the corporations and governments that partner with Facebook — total control over what its users can access” [Foreign Policy].

Donate $25$50$75$100 00300 This entry was posted in Guest Post, Water Cooler on April 18, 2017 by Lambert Strether. About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Way more interesting that it sounds. First off, this is awesome and I’m glad it’s being done. Secondly, Ballmer is really something: As he looked for a new endeavor — before he decided to buy the Clippers — his wife, Connie, encouraged him to help with some of her philanthropic efforts, an idea he initially rejected. “But come on, doesn’t the government take care of the poor, the sick, the old?” Mr. Ballmer recalled telling her. After all, he pointed out, he happily paid a lot of taxes, and he figured that all that tax money should create a sufficient social safety net. Reminds one of The Christmas Carol. And he also dumps on his own search engine: His first instinct, naturally, was to go to a search engine. “My favorite one, of course: I go to Bing,” he said. “And by the way, I check it with Google, just to make sure there’s nothing I’m missing.” Nobody goes from Google to Bing to make sure they didn’t miss anything.

That she’s the most accomplished woman of her “trailblazing” generation in politics? A real “trailblazer” was the first woman elected to Congress from Montana, Jeannette Rankin, who had the gumption to vote against both WWI and WWII. As far as the Boomer generation is concerned, who could have risen in the ranks and ran in both 2004 and 2008 if Hilary had bowed out of politics? I remember in 2004 how much fun Carol Mosley Braun was in the debates. When the men were squabbling, she acted like a great den mother. She was bright and funny. Oh, where were all the precious darling glass ceiling breaking supporters for Carol? The bigger picture always is that the most interesting original people do not enter the “field of politics”, so we get, as Not Tim Geithner says, “the front row kids”.

Seeking the Dem nom was the only reason you’ve heard of him unless you’re a Vermonter because it got him on TV. The Greens have ballot access in 40-odd states and offered him their nom when Clinton won, I assume he didn’t take them up on it because if Trump won a three-way race the Dem establishment would use Sanders as a lesson in why you gotta STFU and GOTV or else you get the GOP.

But politically, it’s a very good idea for a representative to live in the district, and historically, when someone from outside of a district is elected, he usually has relocated to that district rather quickly.

And, additionally, I have seen the same thing as you report; the check-out stations are served by one person constantly at a kiosk, slowing down and complicating the process anyway. Why not have that person running a check-out in the first place. More assininity from some tool in the C-suite. Reply ↓ Carolinian April 18, 2017 at 6:07 pm Personally I love self-checkout because I don’t like standing in line. I suspect stores provide this more as a convenience for the impatient as most customers still prefer human cashiers and there’s often no waiting at the diy lanes. Reply ↓ Blkwhiskey April 18, 2017 at 8:39 pm Read “Shadow Work” by Ivan Illich. It will challenge your perspective on the checkouts. Reply ↓ a different chris April 18, 2017 at 8:43 pm Nothing personal, but you’re delusional. I check on and regularly beat anybody who goes self-checkout at the same time I get in the regular line. A human cashier is so much faster processing your crap than you are it isn’t even funny, I get my stuff checked thru and get entertained by the self-checkouters at the same time. Reply ↓ Carolinian April 18, 2017 at 11:14 pm I’m probably as fast as the regular cashiers but the point, as I said above, is that there’s hardly any line waiting for the self-check. Of course when stores are very busy and there is a line waiting for self-check then you may well be stuck behind some person fumbling for the code of that cucumber. And the reason there’s less of a line at the self-check is that most people do indeed prefer a human cashier to an intimidating machine. Which is why I believe that stores have these things to be competitive with other stores, not necessarily to screw over their workers. Convenience is a selling point and for some customers the self-check is more convenient even though you refuse to believe it (I won’t call you delusional). Reply ↓ a different chris April 18, 2017 at 8:41 pm Lowe’s didn’t have anybody, zero, nada, at the regular checkouts last time I went. I do not do self-checkout “no matter what” now – or at least that’s what I thought until I had no other way of buying the bolts/washers/nuts I needed. Yes there was one lady standing at a little table between the 4 self checkout units. And guess what? — if you had something that didn’t have a barcode on it, you had to take it over to her and she would pound on some keys and then send that back over to your now obviously misnamed “self” serve station which you would return to and… gah it’s all just so sad. And of course bolts/washers/nuts don’t have barcodes on them. But you know, who goes to Lowes to buy stuff like that? Besides everybody.

Luckily, most of us have been taught by our peers and mentors at Wellesley in a productive way. It is vital that we encourage people to correct and learn from their mistakes rather than berate them for a lack of education they could not control …. This being said, if people are given the resources to learn and either continue to speak hate speech or refuse to adapt their beliefs, then hostility may be warranted. If people continue to support racist politicians or pay for speakers that prop up speech that will lead to the harm of others, then it is critical to take the appropriate measures to hold them accountable for their actions. It is important to note that our preference for education over beration regards students who may have not been given the chance to learn. Rather, we are not referring to those who have already had the incentive to learn and should have taken the opportunities to do so…. We at The Wellesley News, are not interested in any type of tone policing. The emotional labor required to educate people is immense and is additional weight that is put on those who are already forced to defend their human rights. There is no denying that problematic opinions need to be addressed in order to stop Wellesley from becoming a place where hate speech and casual discrimination is okay. However, as a community we need to make an effort to have this dialogue in a constructive and educational way in order to build our community up. Talk-back, protest videos and personal correspondences are also ways to have a constructive dialogue. Let us first bridge the gap between students in our community before we resort to personal attacks.” http://web.archive.org/web/20170414124916/http://thewellesleynews.com/2017/04/12/free-speech-is-not-violated-at-wellesley/ All righty then. I have 1000% confidence that none of these students ever read Mao. And yet…. Some students and professors are clearly headed for the re-education camps.

It will present its recommendations to the DNC by January 2018.” Sanders had also already named his selections to the commission. They are Cohen, the vice chair; former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner; former Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver; former Sanders New York delegate Nomiki Konst; Jim Zogby, founder of the Arab-American Institute; former Berkeley, California Mayor Gus Newport; former Nevada Assemblywoman Lucy Flores; and Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb. The DNC declined to name the three members Perez picked and a spokesman for Clinton did not respond to a request for information on her appointments. What happened to the popular vote?

Yeah, I remember those big gains the Democrats made in the Senate in 2016… nevertheless, of course, ka-ching. (big analytics requires big data and big donors). However, I expect about as much from this group as from the Democratic Party Platform Committee (another group with rhetorical declarations of “unity”) .

Normally square footage range is about 2,200-2,500, with at least one and often two ample second floor decks (usually off the master suite and the living room). Some also have yards or ground floor patios. And they have become pricey as demand for beach property just grows and grows.

Reply ↓ Cujo359 April 18, 2017 at 7:58 pm As someone who worked in defense contracting for 25 years, I can tell you that “buy American” won’t be enough to keep wages high. Many contract personnel work on time and materials contracts, meaning that they do the same work that civil service employees of the Dept. of Defense might do, not build products for DoD. For any DoD facility that is in an area where it is one of few employers, or the only major employer, contract changes are inevitably a race to the bottom when it comes to salary and benefits for the contract employees. They either accept the new terms that the contract winner offers, which is almost inevitably less than the old contractor offered, or they look for work elsewhere.

I would like my programs to run with minimal tweaking on my part. Any advice? My goal was to give at little money as possible to Silicon Valley, protect my privacy as best I can, and have a machine to write on, surf on, etc. Any thoughts on the Scrivener problem?

It is recycled Dell with an SSD instead of spinning rust (a 128 GB one is now under $50 USD or a 256GB one for $80 USD if you keep an eye out for periodic sales). I have been using Thinkpads since the 90’s and still have 3 in the house, of recent vintage, with various flavors of Linux on it and they are still very solid machines, especially the W and T series. The Lenovo X series are relatively flimsier, but they also weight a lot less. Just search to see if any peripherials you want to keep will work with the Linux of your choice. Most do so out of the box these days, usually with less hassle than with Windows. But there are some (Canon, I’m looking at you) that doesn’t. I have a Canon printer/scanner/fax combo which works only with Windows, until a Windows 10 upgrade broke the scanner also. And the user experience with common flavors of Linux is actually closer to Windows 7 or Windows XP than Microsoft’s recent offerings. Please search the web for “scrivener wine” to see how Scrivener fans have been coping with no official support for Linux. There are even you tube videos. You don’t even need the used Thinkpad to come with Linux pre-installed. You just need a USB stick (at least 8 GB in size) and create a bootable USB from the downloaded Linux image (plenty of tutorials on the web). You can then install via the USB stick, which can be repurposed after the installation. I can tell you, from personal experience of installing both Mint 18 and Windows 10 within the last month that the Mint 18 installation took much less effort in front of the box and clock time to go from bare metal to a working system compared to Windows 10. I strongly recommend an SSD upgrade if your “new” laptop does not have one, it gives a noticable performance boost. And the small form factor hard disk in laptops do have a relatively short service life because it has to work in a fairly harsh environment. Good luck.

Reply ↓ Marina Bart April 18, 2017 at 11:28 pm YOU GUYS ARE MY HEROES. I still have to process all of this advice, but if I understand things correctly so far, I’m going to buy some laptop with Mint 18 on it or get a separate stick with Mint 18 on it, then I’m downloading Wine after installing Mint, then I’m installing my existing Windows copy of Scrivener. Then I’m probably coming back here to whine and beg for help because some tiny patch or bit of code or driver is off somehow. Then I get to go back to writing long screeds on here in the middle of the night. It’s win/win — for me, at least. Reply ↓ Mark Alexander April 19, 2017 at 2:33 pm Your plan sounds right to me. I did essentially the same process for my wife’s ThinkPad running Mint 17: installed Wine, then installed a Windows-only weaving program via Wine. If you happen to have a generic Windows installation disc (not a Lenovo-specific one) and a license key, you could also install VirtualBox in Mint, then install Windows in a virtual machine. That would provide a better level of compatibility if you have trouble with specific applications running on Wine. BTW, on Linux you don’t download programs in the same way you do on Windows, where you have to visit the software manufacturer’s web site and then download some monster installer. On Mint there are two programs: “Software Manager” (somewhat user-friendly) and “Package Manager” (less user-friendly), both under the the “Start Menu”. They offer thousands of pre-built programs to install. The only ones I haven’t found this way are proprietary or closed-source things like Chrome. Reply ↓ allan April 18, 2017 at 9:16 pm Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s memoir made him $245 a copy [Gannett] Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s low-selling 2014 memoir netted him another $218,100 last year, pushing his total book payments to $783,000 over the past four years, according to his tax returns. Cuomo’s 2016 tax records, which his office made available for review Tuesday, showed the latest round of payments from HarperCollins, the major publisher that gave him a lucrative book deal in 2013. The governor’s memoir — All Things Possible: Setbacks and Success in Politics in Life — did not perform well: Just 3,200 copies sold since its release, including just 100 copies over the past two years, according to NPD Books, which tracks book sales nationwide. It was a money-loser for HarperCollins, which ultimately paid Cuomo about $245 per book sold. It retailed at $29.99. … Sad.

Controversial fund manager Steven A. Cohen was among the million-dollar donors to the Trump inauguration, according to a federal filing. Cohen now runs family office Point72 Asset Management, as an insider-trading settlement forced what was then SAC Capital to stop taking outside money. Cohen will be able to manage outside money next year, under terms of a Securities and Exchange Commission agreement. A message left with Point72 wasn’t returned. Cohen contributed $1 million to the inaugural, according to the Federal Election Commission. Cohen wasn’t the only donor from the financial sector, which counted Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, discount brokerage founder Charles Schwab SCHW, +0.98% , former Soros Fund Management chief investment officer Scott Bessent, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts co-founder Henry Kravis, and hedge-fund investor and conservative donor Robert Mercer among its million-dollar club. Marlene Ricketts, the husband of TD Ameritrade AMTD, +1.37% founder Joe Ricketts, also gave $1 million.

The biggest contributor was Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas Sands LVS, -0.32% founder and major Republican donor, who donated $5 million. The owners of the sports franchises the Dallas Cowboys, Houston Texans, Jacksonville Jaguars, Los Angeles Rams, New England Patriots and Washington Redskins each contributed $1 million, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers co-chairman Ed Glazer added $250,000.

 UPDATE 1-U.S. cargo ship blasts off for space station with supplies, experiments Reuters Apr. 18, 2017, 12:04 PM 14 facebook linkedin twitter email print (Adds quote from United Launch Alliance) By Irene Klotz CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., April 18 (Reuters) - A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket lifted off from Florida on Tuesday, propelling a cargo capsule filled with supplies and science experiments toward the International Space Station. The 19-story booster soared off its seaside launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 11:11 a.m. EDT/1511 GMT. NASA broadcast an unprecedented 360-degree view of the launch via YouTube, in a debut of new video technology. "A beautiful launch," said Vern Thorp, a United Launch Alliance manager. "It looks like we nailed the orbit once again." Atop the rocket was an Orbital ATK Cygnus capsule loaded with more than 7,600 pounds (3,450 kg) of food, supplies and experiments for the station, a $100 billion research lab flying about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. The Cygnus is scheduled to reach the station, a project of 15 nations, on Saturday. Its cargo includes a greenhouse that the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration is testing to grow food for astronauts on long missions. The capsule also carries 38 shoebox-sized satellites and a high school student's science project that will test how telomeres, which are structures at the ends of chromosomes, are affected by microgravity. As people age, telomeres tend to shorten. Preliminary results from a study of astronaut twins, however, show the telomeres of former astronaut Scott Kelly, who spent nearly a year aboard the station in 2015 and 2016, actually lengthened during his time in orbit, the opposite of what was expected. "The researchers are kind of scratching their heads at that," space station associate scientist Tara Ruttley said during a press conference on Monday. Tuesday's successful launch followed a month's delay while United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co, resolved a technical issue with the rocket's hydraulic system. The Cygnus cargo ship is the seventh of 10 planned missions through 2018 under Orbital's space station resupply contract with NASA, worth up to $3.1 billion. NASA also hired privately owned SpaceX to fly cargo to the station. In 2019, privately owned Sierra Nevada Corp will begin operating a third U.S. supply line to the station. Russia and Japan also fly cargo ships to the station. By the time the Cygnus arrives, the station will have two new crew members. NASA astronaut Jack Fischer and Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin are scheduled for launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 3:13 a.m. EDT/0713 GMT on Thursday, docking at the station about six hours later.

(AP) - John Glenn's trailblazing legacy took flight Tuesday as a cargo ship bearing his name rocketed toward the International Space Station. An Atlas rocket provided the late morning lift to orbit, just as it did for Glenn 55 years ago. The commercial cargo ship, dubbed the S.S. John Glenn, holds nearly 7,700 pounds (3,500 kilograms) of food, equipment and research for the space station. It's due there Saturday, two days after the arrival of two fresh astronauts. NASA's shipper, Orbital ATK, asked Glenn's widow, Annie, for permission to use his name for the spacecraft, following his December death. Glenn, an original Mercury 7 astronaut, became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. He launched again in 1998 aboard shuttle Discovery at age 77, the oldest person ever in space. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery two weeks ago. "It is clearly a chance one more time to show John Glenn's name emblazoned in space," said Frank Culbertson, a former astronaut who now heads Orbital ATK's space systems group. Glenn was a courageous, pioneering leader who always promoted space and set a good example, Culbertson noted. "And I hope that putting his name on the space station is an inspiration to the next generation to aspire to do similar things, push the boundaries," he said. Besides supplies, the capsule contains a banner showing Glenn in his orange space shuttle launch suit - it's the first thing the station astronauts will see when they open the craft - as well as memorabilia for his family. Because the launch was delayed a month by hydraulic problems at the pad and on the rocket, no Glenn family members were able to make it to Cape Canaveral, according to Culbertson. Orbital ATK - one of NASA's prime delivery services for the space station, along with SpaceX - normally uses its own Virginia-based Antares rockets to launch its Cygnus cargo ships, named after the swan constellation. But it opted for the United Launch Alliance's bigger Atlas V rocket in order to carry up a heftier load. A new, larger greenhouse is flying up, along with equipment needed for a spacewalk next month. "Looks like we nailed the orbit once again," said Vern Thorp, a manager for the rocket maker. NASA's 360-degree video streaming of the launch - the first such attempt for a live broadcast - didn't go as well. Something went wrong moments before liftoff, and the video skipped over the actual rising of the rocket from the pad. NASA said it would try again, perhaps on an upcoming SpaceX delivery mission. Mission Control beamed up the launch broadcast for the three astronauts at the space station, which is orbiting 250 miles (about 400 kilometers) high. The American, Russian and Frenchman will be joined Thursday by another American and Russian who will take off from Kazakhstan. SpaceX and Boeing are developing new capsules that could fly U.S. astronauts to the space station as early as next year. Boeing's Starliner capsule will fly on the Atlas V. It was the last launch commentary for NASA spokesman George Diller, who is retiring next month after 37 years. His was the voice at liftoff for the final space shuttle flight, by Atlantis, in 2011, as well as the send-off of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and all five Hubble-servicing missions - hundreds of rocket launches in all. "We're really, really going to miss hearing your golden voice on console during launch, George," said Kennedy Space Center's director, Robert Cabana, patting him on the back. Diller said his time at the space agency has been a "heck of a ride." "I couldn't do better if I'd been riding a rocket." ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Orbital ATK: https://www.orbitalatk.com/ Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

With no such cap in place, President Trump's inaugural committee says it raised twice as much at a whopping $107 million, reports the Washington Post. According to a Federal Election Commission filing, casino mogul Sheldon Adelson gave $5 million, Boeing and Kraft Group each gave $1 million, Quicken Loans donated $750,000, and Microsoft and Citgo Petroleum each gave $500,000, reports Politico. Google, Pepsi, Ford, and UPS each donated $250,000.

But airlines have stubbornly resisted innovation to improve customer service and technology has only made it worse By Farhad Manjoo Published: 18:04 April 19, 2017   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE There are many reasons for the sorry state of commercial aviation in America. When it comes to your routinely terrible flight — not to mention the sort of exceptional horror that took place aboard United Airlines Flight 3411 this past weekend — regulatory failures as well as consolidation, which the authorities have allowed to occur unabated for decades, can be blamed. But I come to you as a technology columnist to tell you that technology, too, has failed you. People in Silicon Valley pride themselves on their capacity to upend entrenched industries. Uber defeated taxi cartels. Airbnb made getting a room cheaper and more accessible. Streaming services are undoing the cable business. Yet the airline industry has not just stubbornly resisted innovation to improve customer service — in many ways, technology has only fuelled the industry’s race to the bottom. Everything about United Flight 3411 — overselling, underpaying for seats when they are oversold, a cultish refusal to offer immediate contrition, an overall attitude that brutish capitalism is the best that non-elite customers can expect from this fallen world — is baked into the airline industry’s business model. And that business model has been accelerated by tech. Travel search engines rank airlines based on price rather than friendliness or quality of service. Online checking, airport kiosks and apps allow airlines to serve customers with fewer and fewer workers. What we are witnessing is the basest, ugliest form of tech-abetted, bottom-seeking capitalism — one concerned with prices and profits above all else, with little regard for quality of service, for friendliness, or even for the dignity of customers. “The airline industry has been on a steady downward trajectory when it comes to customer service for nearly 40 years,” said Henry H. Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry research firm. He noted that American carriers were improving on some metrics — on-time service is up, baggage loss is down and prices keep getting better. Deteriorating quality of service What keeps deteriorating are comfort and quality of service for low-end passengers (that is, most people). Leg-room keeps shrinking. Airlines keep tacking on separate fees for amenities we used to consider part of the flight. And customers keep going along with it. “Consumers have shown that they’re willing to put up with an awful lot, including lack of legroom, lack of amenities, mediocre or worse customer service, dirty aeroplanes and more to save money,” Harteveldt said. “And the airline industry has evolved to meet that desire” for cheap fares. Part of the problem is how we buy tickets today. The whole system is mercilessly transactional. When you search online, you look for price and travel times, and perhaps you consider some airline loyalty programme. Customer service — that is, how the airline treats you — isn’t often part of the transaction. As a result, airlines have little incentive to reform themselves. “Airline executives will tell you they don’t view themselves as being service companies,” Harteveldt said. “They want Wall Street to view them as industrial companies, and they want consumers to view them as transportation providers. Customer service is just not what the airlines are about.” Initial response to debacle You can see this in United’s initial response to what happened on Flight 3411: “I apologise for having to reaccommodate these customers,” Oscar Munoz, United’s chief executive, said in a statement dripping with all the warmth of a ransom note. In a letter to employees, he repeatedly suggested that the customer, not the airline, was at fault. After all, the passenger was offered a bountiful $1,000 (Dh3,673) in United vouchers for his trouble. It was an offer he couldn’t refuse; as a United spokesman told The Times, the passenger was “asked several times, politely,” for his seat before anyone beat him up. It took two days — and a plunge in United’s stock price — for the airline to offer a real apology. “I want you to know that we take full responsibility and we will work to make it right,” Munoz said in a statement on Tuesday. Can technology improve how airlines work? Some people have ideas for how that may happen. One of them is obvious and sensible: customer reviews. Last year TripAdvisor, the travel reviews site that has become indispensable for hotel bookings, began rating airlines. Its new rankings, released this week, show that overall, airlines get an average rating of 3.7 out of 5 from customers. Emirates and Singapore airlines are rated the best in the world; two US airlines, JetBlue and Alaska, made TripAdvisor’s Top 10 list. But Delta was the only major US airline to receive TripAdvisor’s seal of approval. United and American Airlines did not meet the site’s minimum threshold, though Bryan Saltzburg, senior vice-president for TripAdvisor’s global flight business, said that the two have been improving. Reviewers’ warnings One can imagine how such reviews could prompt improvements in airlines. If instead of just price, travel search engines included prominent warnings from reviewers — “This airline might give you a bloody lip while kicking you from your seat, 1-star!” — that could alter travellers’ calculations in booking. “That would be a good idea — a filter on travel search that says, ‘Click this filter and it might cost you a few dollars more, but we’ll bias you towards airlines that treat their customers well’,” said Paul English, co-founder of the travel search company Kayak who now runs another travel start-up, Lola. That’s small potatoes, though. A bigger disruption would come from altering how we pay for airfares. In the same way that Netflix changed the DVD business by charging a monthly fee, some consultants argue that a membership fee could radically improve flying. “We’ve prototyped a subscription airline in the past, and it basically gets the airline out of the business of reducing service for offering the lowest fares,” said Devin Liddell, principal brand strategist for Teague, a design firm that works with Boeing and other transportation companies. Some start-ups have tried a monthly subscription model, and none have taken off. But airline start-ups face high capital costs; a new business model might work, Liddell said, if an established airline tries it as a way to break free from the accepted way of doing things. Long-term competition You might wonder why an airline would dare try such a thing. After all, airlines are doing well; profits are up across the globe, despite your annoyance about flying. Liddell warned of long-term competition from other kinds of transportation. If self-driving cars make driving easier and more comfortable, midrange flights would face competition. Counting the time it takes to clear airport security and get to and from the airport, it takes just as long to drive between some places — Los Angeles to San Francisco, say — as to fly. If self-driving technology makes driving much more comfortable, too, lots of people might abandon planes for cars, Liddell said. An even longer-term idea is the Hyperloop, Elon Musk’s vision for superfast tunnel travel. It’s a pretty speculative idea, but if it works, airlines would need to radically alter how they work. For now, though, none of that hurts the commercial air business. Airlines are safe from self-driving cars and the Hyperloop. They’re content to feed you ever-worse service for lower prices, because that’s what the web wants. Your only technological hope for better service is your smartphone camera and the viral push of social networks: If you are violently kicked off your flight, at least your fellow passengers will post a video to Facebook. — New York Times News Service Farhad Manjoo is a technology writer at the New York Times Agreement Poll Do you agree with this article?

Sajjan’s here on a week-long visit to strengthen defence ties between Canada and India. Edited excerpts: What did you discuss with Defence Minister Arun Jailtey and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj? We discussed Canada-India defence relationship with greater focus on all our joint exercises with our tri-services. We also talked about how our defence industries can benefit. We do recommend experience from our defence industry and some of the equipment we need in our military that has been battle tested involving some great research and development. So, we looked at avenues where we can further these discussions. During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Canada in 2015, there was a decision to have a joint working group on counter-terrorism and enhancing naval linkages. Was that discussed? Yes, we discussed that. In fact, we have one of our naval ships — HMCS Winnipeg — coming in May. So, those were discussed. On counter-terrorism, our officials have been discussing a lot. In fact, my Deputy Minister met the Deputy National Security Advisor of India. So, these discussions are always ongoing to make sure that we battle terrorism together because both our nations were attacked. Can you elaborate more on the HMCS Winnipeg frigate coming to India? Our commander of the navy is looking at how we can operate together. I have personally witnessed this when I was in Hawaii during the RIMPAC (Rim of the Pacific Exercise) and we had our largest deployment. I saw some Indian ships as well. So, we do always see how we can operate together and allow joint exercises by naval personnel. Are you looking to seal some big-ticket defence deals with India? We have a very good defence industry that is operating here in India, we would like to increase that as well. I met our companies here during the trip and will be meeting some Indian defence companies as well. So, good progress has been made. We need to look at expanding that. Everything from aerospace to some of our capabilities in forensics to helicopters, I think there is greater opportunity for Canadian companies to build and support India’s defence industry. What potential do you see for Canadian defence firms in India’s proposed $12-billion fighter jet programme? Canada is not in the fighter jet business. But, we do provide some of the technologies and avionics that the fighters need. We do have companies that provide systems to some of these jet companies, like Lockheed Martin or Boeing, and many other companies. So, those companies that have a proven track record do have an opportunity to form joint ventures with these companies that will benefit the Indian Air Force as well. The Indian Navy has said it will be building aircraft carriers. How are Canadian defence firms viewing this? We are also building our own ships. We do not have aircraft carriers. But for building a haul you need to have the right systems coinciding, and that is where the real work comes in. So, other companies from around the world will be assisting us with our national ship-building strategy and that will be an opportunity for Canada to be part of those projects as well. When you have a greater country-to-country dialogue in defence relationships it allows our defence companies to be predictable in their approaches. India is now focussed on achieving self-reliance in defence. How do you view the market in such a scenario? Every nation makes its own decisions and how they want to support their own military. For us, we have other challenges. We did a full defence policy review looking at modernising our systems. Canada can advise India and we also have several challenges on regional security, and have a lot of expertise to provide. Since you talked about a defence policy review in your country, what are your views on India’s Defence Procurement Procedure? Procurement is a challenge for every nation. India has to work out what suits best for them. I have always said procurement system should work because our men and women in uniform should have the right tools in their hands. You said Canada would like to see stability in South Asia. How do view the tension between India and Pakistan? We are hopeful that India and Pakistan will continue with the dialogue and continue to de-escalate the situation. Regional tension does not help anybody. India can play a greater role as they already do with the UN. We are already dealing with conflicts in the world. Tensions between these two countries take away their ability to have an impact on other parts of the world. Maintaining a dialogue allows you to always have fruitful discussions. The last thing you want is not having a dialogue and increasing tensions.

The Trump committee raised a record $107 million, more than twice the previous record-holder, President Barack Obama's 2009 inaugural committee, which brought in $53 million. Unlike Trump, the 2009 committee did not accept corporate contributions and limited individual donations to a maximum of $50,000. Obama took corporate donations in 2013 for his second inaugural. Trump banks $8 million for 2020 Several of the $1 million corporate donors were directly affected by actions taken by Trump since he became president in January. The biggest individual donor to the inaugural committee was casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who with his wife Miriam contributed $20 million to a pro-Trump super political action committee, had contributed $1.5 million to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, which nominated Trump. Adelson is a leading opponent of online gambling, which is permitted in New Jersey. Trump's attorney general, Jeff Sessions, told the Senate Judiciary Committee in January that he would revisit the 2011 U.S. Justice Department ruling that paved the way for New Jersey-based casinos to offer online gambling to state residents. Johnson, who reportedly is in line to become U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom, was a finance vice chair of the Trump inaugural committee. He was a vice chair of the Trump-Republican National Committee joint fundraising committee during the campaign. Other $1 million donors to the former owner of the New Jersey Generals of the defunct United States Football League included: Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder, Texas owner Robert McNair, Madison Square Garden, owner of the New York Knicks, Rangers and Liberty, also contributed $1 million. The Major League Baseball commissioner's office donated $100,000 as did NFL Ventures, the sales and marketing arm of the National Football League. Marlene Ricketts, whose family owns the Chicago Cubs, was another $1 million donor. She and her husband Joe backed Trump after initially contributing almost $6 million to a super PAC trying to derail his nomination. Hedge fund manager Steven Cohen, who gave $3 million to the super PAC backing Gov. Chris Christie's presidential campaign, was another $1 million donor to the Trump inaugural committee. Cohen is a minority owner of Christie's favorite baseball team, the New York Mets. The drug company Pfizer gave $1 million. Trump railed against the pharmaceutical industry before taking office, saying they were "getting away with murder."  He took a softer tone after meeting with drug company executives at the White House, asking them to lower prices and move manufacturing back to the U.S., while offering to streamline the process for approving drugs and cut regulations on the industry. Boeing, which gave $1 million, was a strong supporter of the Export-Import Bank, which Trump attacked on the campaign trail but recently praised and nominated former Rep. Scott Garrett (R-5th Dist.) as its president. Bank of America was another $1 million donor. Trump has promised to roll back the regulations designed to address the financial industry practices that helped lead to the Great Recession under President George W. Bush. AT&T also donated $1 million. Trump earlier this month signed legislation removing privacy protections, allowing  AT&T and other Internet service providers, allowing them to sell their customers' personal data without permission. "This resolution tells the companies charged with running the country's broadband networks that they no longer have to be reasonable when it comes to their customers' data," said Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-6th Dist.), the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, during debate on the measure. Jonathan D. Salant may be reached at jsalant@njadvancemedia.com.

By Franz-Stefan Gady for The Diplomat April 19, 2017               This week, Russia’s Pacific Fleet — the country’s second biggest fleet — conducted an antisubmarine warfare exercise in waters off the Russian territory of Khabarovsk in the country’s Far East. The drill involved long-range Tupolev Tu-142MZ maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare aircraft of the 568th Independent Composite Aviation Regiment, based at Kamenny Ruchey Airbase, executing a simulated attack on an enemy submarine. According to Russian media reports, the target was a submerged Russian diesel-electric submarine. “In the given district, anti-submarine warfare specialists have imitated the elimination of a Pacific Fleet diesel-electric sub that pretended to be an ‘enemy’ submarine,” Pacific Fleet spokesman Vladimir Matveyev told Tass news agency on April 18.Enjoying this article?

While the report does not mention what type of submarine was used in the exercise, it is likely that a Type 877 Kilo-class diesel-electric attack submarine stood in for the enemy boat. Russia’s Pacific Fleet currently operates eight Type 877 subs. However, it is unclear how many of the boats are in fact operational. Russia’s Pacific Fleet is also slated to receive six improved Project 636.3 Kilo-class (aka Vashavyanka-class) diesel-electric attack submarines by 2021. As I explained in September 2016: The Project 636.3 Kilo-class is an improved variant of the original Project 877 Kilo-class design. The updated version is slightly longer in length — the sub’s submerged displacement is around 4,000 tons —  and feature improved engines, an improved combat system, as well as new noise reduction technology. The submarine has a crew of around 50 and can conduct patrols for up to 45 days.  The Tupolev Tu-142MZ is the latest variant of the Tu-142, which was originally designed by the Tupolev design bureau and built by the Kuibyshev Aviation and Taganrog Machinery Plants from the late 1960s to the early 1990s. The variant currently in service with Russian Naval Aviation reportedly features a modern avionics suite and advanced anti-submarine warfare equipment. Russia currently operates 14 Tu-142MZ aircraft, although their operational readiness is unknown. India retired its fleet of eight four-engine Tupolev-142MK-E (along with five Ilyushin-38 aircraft) in March of this year after 29 years in service. In lieu, the Indian Navy has acquired U.S.-made Boeing Poseidon 8I Neptune advanced maritime patrol/anti-submarine warfare aircraft. Russia’s naval aviation arm, along with the Russian Air Force, has been stepping up its activities in the Asia-Pacific region over the last three years and has again assumed regular long-range patrols. As I reported last week, two Tupolev Tu-95MS strategic bombers and one Ilyushin Il-20 maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare aircraft conducted patrols along the perimeter of Japanese airspace on April 12. (However, media reports of two additional T-142 aircraft sent to the Sea of Japan appear to have been unfounded.) “According to a newly released MoD statistic, encounters with Russian military aircraft rose 4.5 percent over the last fiscal year to 301 scrambles,” I explained. “In comparison, fiscal year 2015 saw 288 JASDF sorties in reaction to Russian military aircraft. With 473 JASDF scrambles, 2014 remains the top year for Russian incursions. Overall, the MoD reports that the JASDF scrambled its fighter jets 1,168 times in fiscal year 2016, up from 873 in 2015.” The Russian Air Force is also currently standing up a new long-range heavy bomber division consisting of Tu-95MS and Tu-22M3 long-range bombers in the country’s Far East. It is unclear whether the unit is already operational.

(Reuters photo) WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump is getting hammered by critics for what they say is his dubious commitment to the "Buy American, Hire American" policy that he is promoting on faulty premise, even as his hardline nationalist supporters are in raptures that he is putting "America First." From pointing out that the product line from his own companies are made abroad (including Made in India sports coats) to taunting that his properties, estates, and businesses employ a large number of immigrants, detractors eviscerated the US President for double standards after he went on a blue-collar road show on Tuesday to expound American First vision. He promoted it with an executive diktat aimed, among other things, at reforming the H1B visa program that has helped grow the Indian IT industry. That vision is faulty, industry leaders both in manufacturing and services said, echoing similar views from Trump's political opponents and academics with expertize in the matter, all of whom argued that foreign workers actually contributed to the US economy and rejected the claim that they took over "American jobs." While industry leaders said Trump's executive order to "Buy American" will simply bump up the cost of the $1 trillion infrastructure spending (or yield less from it) that he has proposed, analysts such as Linda Lim, a University of Michigan scholar who studies political economy, warned that it will also result in foreign governments enacting similar strictures against American products, throwing sand in the global trade engine. "Think Boeing airplanes and Microsoft software, both of which currently have large global market share," she cautioned, even as Trump kept up his refrain about American infrastructure projects having to use American steel, foregoing cheaper steel from countries such an China and India. In fact, the United States Chamber of Commerce pointed out whenever the government has enacted domestic sourcing rules in the past, "the resulting experience has been higher overall construction costs, increased compliance burdens, reduced competition, and disruption of supply chains without significant American job creation." Trump's diktat to "Hire Americans" by demonizing the H1B program also met with a similarly measured response from NASSCOM, the Indian software industry body, which, while sounding sanguine about its effect on the Indian companies, said restrictions on guest worker visas would "hurt thousands of US. businesses and their efforts to be more competitive by hindering access to needed talent." "In general, we believe that the current campaign to discredit our sector is driven by persistent myths, such as the ideas that H-1B visa holders are 'cheap labor' and 'displace American workers' who train their replacements, none of which is accurate," Nasscom said. "The H-1B visa system exists specifically because of the persistent shortage of highly-skilled domestic talent in the United States." But claiming that the "American people voted to end the theft of American prosperity," Trump, who lost the popular vote in the 2016 Presidential election, threw out the red meat of "America First" to his base, even as reports suggested some of his more hardline supporters are starting to get disillusioned that he is not nationalistic enough.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Military Rotorcraft Market Forecast US$26.9 Billion Revenue by 2027 from US$17.9 Billion in 2017 Global military rotorcraft market is expected to value US$17.9 Billion in 2017, and grow at a CAGR of 4.14%, to value US$26.9 Billion by 2027. The cumulative global expenditure on military rotorcraft over the forecast period (2017-2027) is estimated at US$235.1 Billion. The demand for rotorcraft is expected to be driven by the need to replace aging fleets and enhance capabilities pertaining to disaster relief operations. Rapidly changing global security scenario and the growing importance of unconventional missions and urban warfare have resulted in change of roles for helicopters in the modern warfare strategies. Unlike their traditional roles, rotorcrafts are being used as part of the comprehensive mission parameters, which calls for integration of advanced and multiple capabilities in rotorcrafts. Sample of Report Available @ www.reportsnreports.com/contacts/requestsample.aspx?name=… OR Check for Discount @ www.reportsnreports.com/contacts/discount.aspx?name=964755 Furthermore, Military rotorcraft is being increasingly utilized in various types of operation such as patrolling, combat and peacekeeping. For example, in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Sudan military rotorcrafts were actively used for peacekeeping operations. They also play vital role in troop transportation, search and rescue, and reconnaissance roles. Asia Pacific region is expected to account for the highest spending on rotorcraft globally, accounting for 37.2% of the market, followed by North America, which will account for 30.5%. China’s growing assertiveness in territorial disputes with its neighbors, an ongoing arms race among Asian countries, and strong economic growth are the primary drivers of the region’s rotorcraft market, which is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 3.91%, to reach US$9.7 Billion by 2027. Europe, which is the third largest market, is emerging from an economic crisis and is thus expected to witness only marginal growth over the forecast period; the region is expected to account for 17.1% of the total market. The Middle East region is expected to be one of the fastest growing markets for rotorcraft over the forecast period, with a CAGR of 5.37%, due to the huge demand from various countries buoyed by strong economic growth and robust modernization plans.

The 19-story booster soared off its seaside launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 11:11am EDT/3:11pm GMT. NASA broadcast an unprecedented 360-degree view of the launch via YouTube, in a debut of new video technology. "A beautiful launch," said Vern Thorp, a United Launch Alliance manager. "It looks like we nailed the orbit once again."   Atop the rocket was an Orbital ATK Cygnus capsule loaded with more than 7,600 pounds (3,450kg) of food, supplies and experiments for the station, a $100 billion research lab flying about 250 miles (400km) above Earth. The Cygnus is scheduled to reach the station, a project of 15 nations, on Saturday. Its cargo includes a greenhouse that the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration is testing to grow food for astronauts on long missions. The capsule also carries 38 shoebox-sized satellites and a high school student's science project that will test how telomeres, which are structures at the ends of chromosomes, are affected by microgravity. As people age, telomeres tend to shorten. Preliminary results from a study of astronaut twins, however, show the telomeres of former astronaut Scott Kelly, who spent nearly a year aboard the station in 2015 and 2016, actually lengthened during his time in orbit, the opposite of what was expected. "The researchers are kind of scratching their heads at that," space station associate scientist Tara Ruttley said during a press conference on Monday. Tuesday's successful launch followed a month's delay while United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co, resolved a technical issue with the rocket's hydraulic system. The Cygnus cargo ship is the seventh of 10 planned missions through 2018 under Orbital's space station resupply contract with NASA, worth up to $3.1 billion (roughly Rs. 20,022 crores). NASA also hired privately owned SpaceX to fly cargo to the station. In 2019, privately owned Sierra Nevada Corp will begin operating a third US supply line to the station. Russia and Japan also fly cargo ships to the station. By the time the Cygnus arrives, the station will have two new crew members.

Pestano   |   April 19, 2017 at 9:53 AM Follow @upi Comments April 19 (UPI) -- Malaysia Airlines said it has become the first carrier to enlist to a satellite flight tracking system that will monitor the location of company's fleet worldwide. The U.S.-based Aireon, FlightAware and SITAONAIR aviation industry firms developed a service -- called FlightTracker -- that will soon launch in which satellites are used to track planes in areas where there is currently no surveillance. The service will provide more regular updates on the location of airplanes, particularly when traveling in remote areas such as oceans. Airplanes will not need new avionics or modifications to use the service, which will become operational in 2018. "Real-time global aircraft tracking has long been a goal of the aviation community," Malaysia Airlines COO Capt. Izham Ismail said in a statement. "We are proud to be the first airline to adopt this solution." RELATEDLawsuit alleges Boeing at fault for MH370 crash The announcement follows the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which vanished from radar screens on March 8, 2014, after leaving Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia en route to Beijing with 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board. Malaysian authorities concluded the flight had ended in the Indian Ocean, but no confirmed MH370 debris was found until last year when a right wing flaperon was discovered on Reunion Island, east of Madagascar. Officials indefinitely suspended the search for the airplane in January. "Malaysia Airlines has taken a lead role in the industry since the tragic events of 2014. Real-time, global flight tracking, anywhere on the planet will further its safety goals, by allowing Malaysia Airlines to track its aircraft anytime, anywhere," Aireon CEO Don Thoma said in a statement.

The test is part of a life-extension program for the bomb to improve its safety, security and reliability. (U.S. Air Force photo/Staff Sgt. Brandi Hansen)6PRINT | E-MAILKIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE, N.M. -- An Air Force F-16 aircraft released an inert B61 nuclear bomb in a test recently, demonstrating the aircraft's capability to deliver the weapon and testing the functioning of the weapon's non-nuclear components, including the arming and fire control system, radar altimeter, spin rocket motors and weapons control computer.The F-16 from the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron at Nellis AFB, Nevada, released the weapon over the Nellis Test and Training Range Complex in the first test use of the upgraded B61, known as the B61-12, with the F-16 aircraft.The test was conducted under a life-extension program for the B61, which is refurbishing both its nuclear and non-nuclear components to extend the bomb’s service life, while improving its safety, security and reliability. When completed, the new B61-12 version will replace four versions of the B61 bomb currently in the U.S. nuclear stockpile, streamlining production and logistics.The B61-12 life-extension program is managed by the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center in conjunction with the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration.“The B61-12 gravity bomb ensures the current capability for the air-delivered leg of the U.S. strategic nuclear triad well into the future for both bombers and dual-capable aircraft supporting NATO,” said Paul Waugh, AFNWC’s Air-Delivered Capabilities director. The B61-12 will be compatible with the B-2A, B-21, F-15E, F-16C/D, F-16 MLU, F-35 and PA-200 aircraft.The non-nuclear bomb assembly used for the flight test was designed and manufactured by Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory as federally funded research and development centers operating under NNSA. The tail-kit assembly mated to the NNSA front-end was designed by the Boeing Company under an AFNWC contract.About 200 personnel in AFNWC’s Air-Delivered Capabilities Directorate deliver, sustain and support air-delivered nuclear weapon systems. The directorate is headquartered at Kirtland AFB and oversees locations at Eglin AFB, Florida; Joint Base San Antonio, Texas; Ramstein AB, Germany; Robins AFB, Georgia; Tinker AFB, Oklahoma; and Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.The center is responsible for synchronizing all aspects of nuclear material management on behalf of Air Force Materiel Command in direct support of Air Force Global Strike Command. Headquartered at Kirtland AFB, the center has about 1,900 personnel at 17 locations worldwide....

The launch is scheduled for Tuesday morning and for the first time, NASA cameras will provide live 360-degree video of the rocket heading toward space. (AP Photo/John Raoux) CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — John Glenn's trailblazing legacy took flight Tuesday as a cargo ship bearing his name rocketed toward the International Space Station. An Atlas rocket provided the late morning lift to orbit, just as it did for Glenn 55 years ago. The commercial cargo ship, dubbed the S.S. John Glenn, holds nearly 7,700 pounds (3,500 kilograms) of food, equipment and research for the space station. It's due there Saturday, two days after the arrival of two fresh astronauts. NASA's shipper, Orbital ATK, asked Glenn's widow, Annie, for permission to use his name for the spacecraft, following his December death. Glenn, an original Mercury 7 astronaut, became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. He launched again in 1998 aboard shuttle Discovery at age 77, the oldest person ever in space. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery two weeks ago. "It is clearly a chance one more time to show John Glenn's name emblazoned in space," said Frank Culbertson, a former astronaut who now heads Orbital ATK's space systems group. Glenn was a courageous, pioneering leader who always promoted space and set a good example, Culbertson noted. "And I hope that putting his name on the space station is an inspiration to the next generation to aspire to do similar things, push the boundaries," he said. Besides supplies, the capsule contains a banner showing Glenn in his orange space shuttle launch suit — it's the first thing the station astronauts will see when they open the craft — as well as memorabilia for his family. Because the launch was delayed a month by hydraulic problems at the pad and on the rocket, no Glenn family members were able to make it to Cape Canaveral, according to Culbertson. Orbital ATK — one of NASA's prime delivery services for the space station, along with SpaceX — normally uses its own Virginia-based Antares rockets to launch its Cygnus cargo ships, named after the swan constellation. But it opted for the United Launch Alliance's bigger Atlas V rocket in order to carry up a heftier load. A new, larger greenhouse is flying up, along with equipment needed for a spacewalk next month. "Looks like we nailed the orbit once again," said Vern Thorp, a manager for the rocket maker. NASA's 360-degree video streaming of the launch — the first such attempt for a live broadcast — didn't go as well. Something went wrong moments before liftoff, and the video skipped over the actual rising of the rocket from the pad. NASA said it would try again, perhaps on an upcoming SpaceX delivery mission. Mission Control beamed up the launch broadcast for the three astronauts at the space station, which is orbiting 250 miles (about 400 kilometres) high. The American, Russian and Frenchman will be joined Thursday by another American and Russian who will take off from Kazakhstan. SpaceX and Boeing are developing new capsules that could fly U.S. astronauts to the space station as early as next year. Boeing's Starliner capsule will fly on the Atlas V. It was the last launch commentary for NASA spokesman George Diller, who is retiring next month after 37 years. His was the voice at liftoff for the final space shuttle flight, by Atlantis, in 2011, as well as the send-off of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and all five Hubble-servicing missions — hundreds of rocket launches in all. "We're really, really going to miss hearing your golden voice on console during launch, George," said Kennedy Space Center's director, Robert Cabana, patting him on the back. Diller said his time at the space agency has been a "heck of a ride." "I couldn't do better if I'd been riding a rocket." ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Orbital ATK: https://www.orbitalatk.com/ © Copyright 2017 Prince George Citizen Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Sonu Nigam Vijay Mallya TTV Dinakaran Donald Trump IPL 2017 News Sci/Tech WATCH: Cargo ship, a project of 15 nations, blasts off for space station with supplies, experiments NASA (Reuters) Shares2 Wed, 19 Apr 2017-10:30am , Reuters The Cygnus, a project of 15 nations, is scheduled to reach the station on Saturday A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket lifted off from Florida on Tuesday, propelling a cargo capsule filled with supplies and science experiments toward the International Space Station. The 19-story booster soared off its seaside launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 11:11 a.m. EDT/1511 GMT. NASA broadcast an unprecedented 360-degree view of the launch via YouTube, in a debut of new video technology. "A beautiful launch," said Vern Thorp, a United Launch Alliance manager. "It looks like we nailed the orbit once again." Atop the rocket was an Orbital ATK (OA.N) Cygnus capsule loaded with more than 7,600 pounds (3,450 kg) of food, supplies and experiments for the station, a $100 billion research lab flying about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. The Cygnus is scheduled to reach the station, a project of 15 nations, on Saturday. Its cargo includes a greenhouse that the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration is testing to grow food for astronauts on long missions. The capsule also carries 38 shoebox-sized satellites and a high school student's science project that will test how telomeres, which are structures at the ends of chromosomes, are affected by microgravity. As people age, telomeres tend to shorten. Preliminary results from a study of astronaut twins, however, show the telomeres of former astronaut Scott Kelly, who spent nearly a year aboard the station in 2015 and 2016, actually lengthened during his time in orbit, the opposite of what was expected. "The researchers are kind of scratching their heads at that," space station associate scientist Tara Ruttley said during a press conference on Monday. Tuesday's successful launch followed a month's delay while United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N), resolved a technical issue with the rocket's hydraulic system. The Cygnus cargo ship is the seventh of 10 planned missions through 2018 under Orbital's space station resupply contract with NASA, worth up to $3.1 billion. NASA also hired privately owned SpaceX to fly cargo to the station. In 2019, privately owned Sierra Nevada Corp will begin operating a third U.S. supply line to the station. Russia and Japan also fly cargo ships to the station. By the time the Cygnus arrives, the station will have two new crew members. NASA astronaut Jack Fischer and Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin are scheduled for launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 3:13 a.m. EDT/0713 GMT on Thursday, docking at the station about six hours later.

 California may be the most desirable place to live in the US, but employers can't recruit 'high-performers' thanks to insane housing prices Tanza Loudenback Apr. 14, 2017, 7:27 PM 40,660 facebook linkedin twitter email print Los Angeles-based businesses may be in danger of being priced out of the region. Melpomene/Shutterstock The effect of California's housing crisis is reaching new heights. According to a new report from the University of Southern California and the Los Angeles Business Council, exorbitant housing costs in Los Angeles, the second most populous city in the US, are inhibiting employers from attracting "high-performers," or top talent, to their companies. For the study — which was led by Raphael Bostic, a USC Price School of Public Policy Professor and the newly appointed head of the Atlanta Federal Reserve — USC surveyed 14 of Los Angeles' largest employers, which account for nearly 200,000 jobs in the region. Nearly 60% of the employers say Los Angeles' high cost of living impacts employee retention, with 75% naming housing costs as a specific concern, according to the survey results. Further, 10 employers (71%) view high housing costs as "a barrier" to hiring new mid- and upper-level employees. "This study shows that high housing costs are burdening our leading employers, either by having to develop special hiring packages, or subsidizing transportation and relocation costs," Bostic said. By contrast, most of the employers surveyed said no special outreach or programs have been put in place to retain lower-skilled workers because local supply is abundant. "It's concerning that high housing costs could lead to Los Angeles losing its competitive edge in recruiting top talent. That would be devastating to our economy," Mary Leslie, president of the Los Angeles Business Council, said. In 2015, Boeing moved a manufacturing facility from Long Beach to Seattle likely to escape Southern California housing costs despite the state's pleas for it to stay, the report said. And Los Angeles-based SpaceX opened an engineering office in Seattle the same year in an effort to hire top talent who "just refuse to live in LA," founder Elon Musk previously said. Southern California's real estate market has been red hot for a few years now, thanks to low mortgage rates, a strengthening economy, and dwindling home supply. Zillow pegs the median home value in Los Angeles at $616,900 and the median rent at about $2,860. That's compared to $195,700 and $1,500 for the US as a whole. "Though we have yet to see a critical mass of businesses priced out of the region, this is an area of concern," Bostic said. "There's ample evidence to show that the time is now to implement strategies to reduce housing costs.” But while expensive housing has become ubiquitous with cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, overpaying for housing is a widespread problem.

Sriwijaya Air commercial director Toto Nursatyo said it will launch three new routes in June for Jakarta to Nanning, Jakarta to Haikou, and Denpasar to Nanning. “China is our main target for international market. The three will add to our existing eight flights to China,” Nursatyo told Xinhua. Last year, Sriwijaya carried around 600,000 foreign visitors, with 350,000 coming from China. It expects to double the number of its international passengers to 1 million in 2017 including 650,000 Chinese tourists, he said. In total, Sriwijaya is targeting overall passenger numbers to 15 million by year-end from 11.4 million passengers in 2016. Nursatyo said to achieve that goal, Sriwijaya is slated to welcome 13 new aircrafts this year, including two Boeing 777s. The company currently operates 52 aircraft on 55 domestic and international routes. Nursatyo said the main destinations for Chinese tourists are Bali, Jakarta, and Manado in North Sulawesi. The company also hoped to fly Chinese tourists to five more destinations including Bintan, Belitung, Lake Toba, Tarakan and Ternate by charter flights this year. Meanwhile, two other airlines, Garuda Indonesia and Indonesia AirAsia are also setting up for expansions in China. Garuda Indonesia CEO Pahala N. Mansury said it plans to fly from Denpasar to Chengdu this year. The state-owned airline currently operates regular flights between Jakarta and Denpasar to three Chinese cities including Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai. Indonesia AirAsia CEO Dendy Kurniawan said it will fly from Jakarta to Shenzhen, as well as from Jakarta to China’s Macao Special Administrative Region this year. “This is our real action to support the Tourism Ministry’s program to bring in 15 million foreign tourists in… Post navigation ACT schools pull out of online NAPLAN testing China builds panda-themed library Search for: Recent Posts Katy Perry gets heavily trolled after she posts Goddess Kali’s picture on Instagram!

An Atlas V rocket carrying an Orbital ATK Cygnus cargo spacecraft packed with science experiments and crew supplies was on its way to the International Space Station Tuesday. (Reuters) By Marcia DunnThe Associated Press Tues., April 18, 2017 CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA.—John Glenn’s trailblazing legacy took flight Tuesday as a cargo ship bearing his name rocketed toward the International Space Station. An Atlas rocket provided the late morning lift to orbit, just as it did for Glenn 55 years ago. The commercial cargo ship, dubbed the S.S. John Glenn, holds nearly 7,700 pounds of food, equipment and research for the space station. It’s due there Saturday, two days after the arrival of two fresh astronauts. NASA’s shipper, Orbital ATK, asked Glenn’s widow, Annie, for permission to use his name for the spacecraft, following his December death. Glenn, an original Mercury 7 astronaut, became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. He launched again in 1998 aboard shuttle Discovery at age 77, the oldest person ever in space. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery two weeks ago. Article Continued Below “It is clearly a chance one more time to show John Glenn’s name emblazoned in space,” said Frank Culbertson, a former astronaut who now heads Orbital ATK’s space systems group. American space hero John Glenn’s legacy took flight as a cargo ship bearing his name toward the International Space Station.  (John Raoux / The Associated Press)   Glenn was a courageous, pioneering leader who always promoted space and set a good example, Culbertson noted. “And I hope that putting his name on the space station is an inspiration to the next generation to aspire to do similar things, push the boundaries,” he said.

John Glenn of Ohio has died at 95 Photos: John Glenn, American space hero, dies at 95 Besides supplies, the capsule contains a banner showing Glenn in his orange space shuttle launch suit — it’s the first thing the station astronauts will see when they open the craft — as well as memorabilia for his family. Because the launch was delayed a month by hydraulic problems at the pad and on the rocket, no Glenn family members were able to make it to Cape Canaveral, according to Culbertson. Orbital ATK — one of NASA’s prime delivery services for the space station, along with SpaceX — normally uses its own Virginia-based Antares rockets to launch its Cygnus cargo ships, named after the swan constellation. But it opted for the United Launch Alliance’s bigger Atlas V rocket in order to carry up a heftier load. A new, larger greenhouse is flying up, along with equipment needed for a spacewalk next month. “Looks like we nailed the orbit once again,” said Vern Thorp, a manager for the rocket maker. NASA’s 360-degree video streaming of the launch — the first such attempt for a live broadcast — didn’t go as well. Something went wrong moments before liftoff, and the video skipped over the actual rising of the rocket from the pad. NASA said it would try again, perhaps on an upcoming SpaceX delivery mission. Mission Control beamed up the launch broadcast for the three astronauts at the space station, which is orbiting about 400 kilometres high. The American, Russian and Frenchman will be joined Thursday by another American and Russian who will take off from Kazakhstan. SpaceX and Boeing are developing new capsules that could fly U.S. astronauts to the space station as early as next year. Boeing’s Starliner capsule will fly on the Atlas V. It was the last launch commentary for NASA spokesman George Diller, who is retiring next month after 37 years. His was the voice at liftoff for the final space shuttle flight, by Atlantis, in 2011, as well as the send-off of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and all five Hubble-servicing missions — hundreds of rocket launches in all. “We’re really, really going to miss hearing your golden voice on console during launch, George,” said Kennedy Space Center’s director, Robert Cabana, patting him on the back. Diller said his time at the space agency has been a “heck of a ride.” “I couldn’t do better if I’d been riding a rocket.” Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

The burly, bearded artist, who was in the financial hub for three days to visit his exhibition, said he did not try to open accounts at other banks, but that he had no difficulty in the past when he opened a bank account in Beijing. Ai, arguably one of the world's most high-profile contemporary artists and a well-known critic of China, said an HSBC staff member told him he had provided all the necessary documents, but still rejected his application. Read more Ai Weiwei to build hundreds of fences for an exhibit on immigration “I was surprised, I asked him why, he said it was for commercial reasons,” Ai told Reuters. “He said you just can't open an account here ... It's very hard to imagine it's not due to a political reason. But I have no evidence,” he added. Confidentiality concerns did not allow HSBC to discuss individual cases, the bank said in a written reply to Reuters. “However, HSBC does not decline to open bank accounts because of individuals' political views,” it said. HSBC is among many banks in the region to have stepped up oversight of bank accounts to help guard against money laundering and terrorist financing. Hong Kong leader-elect Carrie Lam has previously acknowledged the difficulties some foreigners and overseas businesses face in opening bank accounts there.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said these “extraordinary price rises” have costs taxpayers “tens of millions of pounds”. Getty Ai described his dealings with HSBC on social media, prompting criticism of the bank and renewed debate over whether big corporations in Hong Kong are wary of offending China. The former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997, has experienced a tumultuous few years, with pro-democracy protests quelled in what many residents view as creeping interference by Beijing in its affairs. In 2015, toymaker Lego refused a bulk order of toy bricks by the artist because it would not endorse their use in projects with “a political agenda.” It later backed down, saying it would no longer ask customers their plans for the product. Ai, who helped design Beijing's “Bird's Nest” stadium for the 2008 Olympics, lost favour with the Chinese government when he began campaigning for justice for children crushed to death by shoddily constructed buildings in an earthquake that year. Since leaving China in the summer of 2015, the prominent advocate for human rights has been based largely in the German capital of Berlin.

Next recently came unstuck with a move into fancier fashion, forsaking the basics that it made its name with. You wouldn’t expect that from Primark. The odd lapse in judgement. The occasional tasteless offering. There's always a dash of controversy in the mix (see recent news stories). But you wouldn't ever expect Primark to forget what it's all about.  You would expect to find a women’s leather style biker jacket for £14, a pair of ripped jeans to go with it for £1 less and a T shirt for a fiver.  Small wonder that people flock to its stores in spite of its occasional PR snafus. And not just in Britain either. The format is being successfully exported.   The business doesn’t do internet sales, because when you sell clothes at its price points the economics of factoring delivery costs into the equation don’t work. But it does have an active web presence, particularly on social media where lots of its customers are to be found.  Click and collect? You can see it coming. Analysts have been speculating about it. You're just not gong to get its clothes delivered to your door.  Primark's promise to absorb the extra costs imposed by the weak pound should only enhance its appeal. Next is doing the opposite, a brave move when its customers incomes are stagnating.  Care to guess which of the two will do better in the long run?  Business picture of the day 35 show all Business picture of the day 1/35 Rome’s Trevi Fountain generates €1.4m for city’s charities in 2016 - Thursday April 13 Rome’s Trevi Fountain was a veritable cash cow for the Eternal city’s charities in 2016, according to new data.

The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering.

About us Membership Contact us Thu April 20, 2017 Home Society Economy Politics Sports Culture Multimedia U.S. says Iran complying with nuclear deal, yet vows inter-agency review  Politics April 19, 2017 TEHRAN – In a press statement on Tuesday, the U.S. Department of State notified the Congress that Iran is complying with the nuclear deal, the very first such notification under the Trump administration.  “The U.S. Department of State certified to U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan today that Iran is compliant through April 18th with its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a letter to Paul D. Ryan, speaker of the House of Representatives.  Iran and the 5+1 group - the U.S., Britain, France, China and Russia plus Germany - finalized the text of the nuclear deal in Vienna in July 2015. It went into effect in January 16, 2016.  The accord put some limits on Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of economic and financial sanctions against the country.  Under the deal, the State Department must notify Congress every 90 days on Iran's compliance under the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the official name for the nuclear accord.  While admitting that Tehran has honored the accord fully, Tillerson noted: "President Donald J. Trump has directed a National Security Council-led interagency review of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that will evaluate whether suspension of sanctions related to Iran pursuant to the JCPOA is vital to the national security interests of the United States," Tillerson further said, giving no more details.  During his presidential trail, Trump attacked the deal vehemently, branding it the agreement "the worst deal ever negotiated” and vowed to “rip up” it.  In an apparent reversal, later on Trump softened his tone, saying that he would "police that contract so tough they don't have a chance." As part of the nuclear accord, the U.S. has committed to provide sanctions relief if Iran meets its obligations and the secretary of state will retain the authority to waive all nuclear-related sanctions authorized by the legislation. If the Trump administration tries to alter the deal or to re-impose sanctions, it could prompt Iran to violate a range of obligations, like the disabling of nuclear facilities and the sharp limits on reprocessing uranium. That, in turn, could unwind the deal, and with it, President Obama’s signature foreign policy achievement. For Trump, the nuclear agreement will pose an early test between the pull of his campaign statements and the push of political realities.  In an interview with the BBC, former CIA director, John O. Brennan, said that ending the agreement would be “disastrous” and “the height of folly.” Soon, President Trump must decide whether to extend executive order waivers the Obama administration used to suspend some of the non-nuclear sanctions imposed on Iran and how scrupulously to hold Iran to account for infractions of the JCPOA.  The test of that will come on May 19, when the president must decide whether to extend executive waivers that the Obama administration used to suspend some sanctions.” On March 1, 2017, Laurence Norman of the Wall Street Journal reported that European officials are growing in confidence President Trump will not shred the nuclear accord.  Positive signs are emerging, which make it costly for the U.S. to unwind the deal.  Early April, the American plane maker Boing said it had agreed to sell $3 billion in airplanes to an Iranian airline, deepening the American manufacturer's bet on the Iranian market following the lifting of sanctions. The company agreed to sell 30 units of the 737 MAX aircraft to Aseman Airlines, which also acquired the rights to buy another 30 at a later date.  Days before, media outlets said the first new Boeing commercial jetliner could be delivered in a month.  People familiar with the issue say the Boeing deal will be one reason they think Trump will be forced to honor the deal given the number of jobs it creates in the U.S.  According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States.  In February, Trump toured a Boeing plant in February and touted the firm's work as proof of a coming American manufacturing renaissance.

By Agamoni Ghosh April 19, 2017 12:47 BST More than 500,000 pieces of space junk are tracked every day by NasaWikipedia Space junk from various obsolete satellites if not dealt with soon could increase catastrophic collisions in our galaxy, scientists have warned. A team of scientists from Southampton University led by Dr Hugh Lewis, senior lecturer in aerospace engineering, performed a 200-year simulation to predict possible consequences of such a rise in orbital traffic. A supercomputer that was fed all of the information concluded that mega-constellation satellites boost the risks of a catastrophic collision by almost 50%. The team proposes that players who own and launch these satellites should dispose of old ones within five years. "Junk is dangerous. While some will de-orbit naturally after 5-10 years, some will drift indefinitely. Disposal isn't easy either - even to get a ship into orbit is very costly, and then there's the issue of securing the junk in space before you can even consider getting rid of it," Dr Lewis told Sputnik News. Concerns have increased over the growth in space debris, especially from private space explorers who have launched scores of communications satellites and plan to launch hundreds more in future. In particular, technologies like nano satellites that include the famous CubeSats (a type of miniature satellite for space research) are a grave concern. As of now, there are nearly 1,300 working satellites in orbit. But the number will significantly bump up as private players like SpaceX, Boeing and more launch their satellites in the coming years. OneWeb, which hopes to launch in 2018 has planned 648 satellites, while Boeing plans a 2,900-satellite fleet. Elon Musk-led SpaceX plans a 4,000-strong swarm of satellites.

While the gender pay gap is often presumed to open up later on in people’s careers, economists at jobs website Glassdoor found that in the US men earned median base pay of $56,957 (£44,409) compared to $50,426 for women in the five years after they graduated - a gap of 11.5 per cent. The study concluded that more than half of the gap is due to “occupational sorting”, meaning men cluster into degree subjects that result in higher-paying careers than their female counterparts. Read more Critics say new gender gap reporting rules don't go far enough The research did not assess whether the paths that men tend to choose are more highly paid because they are more economically valuable or simply because men tend to choose them. The study, which compared 47,000 CVs with self-reported salary data found men outnumber women in almost every science and engineering field at university, with particularly dramatic differences in areas such as physics and computer science.  Under-representation of women on these courses fuels pay imbalances because the skills they teach tend to be highly rewarded, Glassdoor’s economists said. Read more Critics say new gender gap reporting rules don't go far enough Cut the gender pay gap by increasing paternity leave, MPs say Why the gender pay gap isn't just a 'women's issue' Government is failing to tackle massive gender pay gap Women hold just 12% of jobs paying £150,000 or more Nine of the ten highest-paying university subjects are male-dominated, while six out of ten of the lowest paying are majority female, according to the study, which looked at salary data in the five years after graduation. There are also large gender discrepancies within certain fields, with the worst examples being in healthcare administration where women earn 22 per cent les than men, mathematics (18 per cent) and biology (13 per cent). According to the data, women enjoy higher pay in some fields such as architecture (14 per cent more), social work and advertising. Exact gaps may be smaller or larger than this as the sample size for some subjects was relatively small. (Glassdoor) While the research demonstrates that the pay gap opens up in the years immediately following graduation and establishes a correlation between course taken at university and salary achieved, the researchers admit proving that the course chosen causes the pay disparity is fraught with difficulty. "Many factors other than college major affect career paths and pay, they are beyond the scope of this study," the report stated. Dr. Andrew Chamberlain, Glassdoor chief economist said “You would expect new grads to find a level playing field when it comes to pay, but they generally don’t. Glassdoor’s analysis shows an 11.5 per cent average pay gap among new grads in the early years of their careers.” “When we isolate by major, pay gaps remain because men and women are sorting into different jobs after graduating - a clear sign of societal pressures and gender norms at play in the career paths of young workers.” Business picture of the day 35 show all Business picture of the day 1/35 Rome’s Trevi Fountain generates €1.4m for city’s charities in 2016 - Thursday April 13 Rome’s Trevi Fountain was a veritable cash cow for the Eternal city’s charities in 2016, according to new data.

The oval-cut 59.6 carat jewel, discovered in a mine in Africa by De Beers in 1999, is the largest fancy vivid pink diamond, categorised as “flawless” or “internally flawless”, that the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) has ever graded. It sold after a five-minute bidding war, that started at $56m, to Hong Kong jewellery retailer Chow Tai Fook at Sotheby's.

According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

Getty 16/35 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said these “extraordinary price rises” have costs taxpayers “tens of millions of pounds”. Getty The gender pay gap has narrowed but remains stubbornly high in many countries around the world. In the UK women earn 17 per cent less than men according to the latest OECD figures.  Research published in February showed that large UK companies are now appointing less women to board-level positions than they were two years ago. Last year, Nicky Morgan, the women and equalities minister, expressed concern that efforts to appoint more women to top business jobs had stalled. “There are still more people called John chairing FTSE 100 boards than there are women,” said Ms Morgan. Under new rules introduced this month the UK’s largest companies will have 12 months to meet a deadline to publish their gender pay gap figures, but critics have said that the reporting won’t be granular enough to facilitate real change. “As is stands, the reporting won’t reveal whether men and women are paid equally for doing the same or comparable jobs. It will simply show the mean and median difference in pay and bonus remuneration across a particular company,” said Suzanne Horne, an employment law partner at Paul Hastings.

It’s got to go!  He didn’t quite put it that way when he warned MPs that billions of pounds in tax payers’ money are likely to be poured down the drain on the day his boss announced the general election (and there could hardly have been a better day to bury the bad news). Read more Philip Hammond tells people to 'live in the real world' about RBS No, what he said was a little more wordy, and a little more official sounding. We have to “live in the real world”, he explained. “Our policy remains to return the bank to private hands as soon as we can achieve fair value for the shares, recognising that fair value could well be below what the previous government paid for them.” The problem with that, of course, is the message it sends to the City. It says to investors that it’s pointless to buy into RBS at anything other than a knock-down price. It encourages them to behave like the people who will frequent markets late in the day because they know there will be bargains to be had.  If you know the majority shareholder is willing to take a thumping loss, why pay more? Mr Hammond has, with his words, put a rock solid ceiling on the price.  Read more Philip Hammond tells people to 'live in the real world' about RBS RBS and NatWest banks to close more than 150 branches costing 470 jobs RBS pays big bonuses, Standard Life loses exec on day to bury news There was no reason for him to do so. The difference between our market trader and Mr Hammond is that the latter’s goods are not perishable. He can wait to sell RBS for as long as he wants.  He has already made it clear that the state, which spent £45bn on bailing RBS out remember, won’t sell until the small matter of a vast forthcoming US penalty for the involvement RBS had in selling dodgy mortgage-backed securities in the run up to the financial crisis is settled.  Then there is the bank’s previous scandalous treatment of small business borrowers, which also needs to be dealt with, not to mention a lawsuit being brought by shareholders over the bank’s £12bn rights issue during the financial crisis. The case will be heard at the High Court next month in the absence of a settlement.  With all that to be put to bed, there are quite a few years to go before the sale process can realistically be restarted, which makes the latest statement all the more questionable.  But the Chancellor’s announcement isn’t only flawed when it comes from a tactical standpoint, however. There is also a principle at stake.  The Government has made great play of the importance of being fiscally responsible, and of (eventually) balancing the budget. That’s what that national insurance rise for the self employed (since reversed) was all about. And all the cuts imposed on the most vulnerable in society.  That’s why pay rises for teachers, nurses, doctors, have been capped so that their salaries have started to fall in real terms. We have to live within our means! Yet here is the Chancellor saying the Government is going to accept flushing ten, twenty billion pounds down the toilet purely because it wants the political problem of RBS off its hands.  Business picture of the day 35 show all Business picture of the day 1/35 Rome’s Trevi Fountain generates €1.4m for city’s charities in 2016 - Thursday April 13 Rome’s Trevi Fountain was a veritable cash cow for the Eternal city’s charities in 2016, according to new data.
