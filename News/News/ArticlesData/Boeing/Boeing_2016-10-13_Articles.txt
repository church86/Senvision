Mounir succeeds John Wojick, who is retiring after 36 years of company service, effective early 2017. In his new role, Mounir is responsible for the sales and marketing of all commercial airplanes and related services to airlines and leasing customers in all markets worldwide. His team’s duties include sales strategy, operations and customer relationships. “Ihssane is a seasoned sales leader with in-depth knowledge of Boeing customers worldwide,” said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner. “His extensive knowledge of our products and services puts him in the best position to help our customers address their fleet and operational needs and be successful in today’s competitive environment.” Mounir has held several leadership positions within Boeing’s Sales organization, mostly recently as vice president of Sales for Northeast Asia. He previously served as vice president of Marketing, Sales Strategy and Operations, responsible for developing and implementing cross-regional strategies for Commercial Airplanes. Prior to that assignment, Mounir led Commercial Airplanes Sales efforts in many regions across the world. Previously, Mounir was the vice president of Sales for Latin America, Africa and the Caribbean. He also served in Sales leadership roles in Europe, Russia, Central Asia and Africa. Mounir joined Boeing as a senior aerodynamics engineer in 1997. He earned Bachelors and Masters degrees in aerospace engineering from Wichita State University. Conner thanked Wojick for his decades of service to Boeing and leadership of the team that sold thousands of airplanes to customers worldwide. “John’s retirement caps an outstanding 36-year Boeing career that has included assignments in engineering and all facets of commercial airplanes sales and marketing,” Conner said. “As the leader of our Sales team since 2012, he has consistently demonstrated the integrity, tenacity, courage and commitment it takes to compete aggressively and win in the marketplace. Under his leadership, our Sales and Marketing organization has sharpened its focus on our customers, continued to earn their trust and maintain their loyalty.” The new regional leader for Northeast Asia Sales will be named at a later time.

Ihssane Mounir was appointed vice president of sales and marketing for Boeing’s airliner division, which puts him in charge of worldwide jetliner sales and services to airlines and aircraft leasing companies. He was most recently vice president of sales for northeast Asia. Mounir takes over from John Wojick, who will retire from Boeing early next year after 36 years at the aerospace giant. A native of Morocco, Mounir joined Boeing in Seattle in 1997 as a senior aerodynamics engineer but soon moved over to the sales and marketing side, first selling Boeing jetliners in Central Asia, Europe, Russia and Africa before being promoted to Boeing’s vice president of sales for Latin America, Africa and the Caribbean. Prior to his appointment to northeast Asia, he was the company’s vice president of marketing, sales strategy and operations. Mounir’s training, however, was in engineering. He earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in aerospace engineering at Wichita State University in 1994 and 1996, respectively, and was a teaching assistant there from 1992 to 1997, according to university records. Scott Miller, professor and chairman of WSU’s aerospace engineering department, was Mounir’s adviser on his master’s degree and now considers him a good friend. Miller said that when Mounir was a graduate student, he had a strong work ethic. Perhaps too strong. “He was one of these guys that you actually had to worry about him doing too much,” Miller said. As a student, Mounir wrote a research paper that won an international competition held by a professional aerospace engineering society. Miller said Mounir’s affable nature is likely what prompted his move at Boeing from engineering to sales and marketing. “He’s … the nicest guy you could ever meet: hard working, incredibly personable,” Miller said Friday. “He’s just a sharp mind.” Mounir is a financial supporter of the university, having been named a life member to the WSU President’s Club, which comes with donating more than $100,000 to the university. He’s also an active member of the WSU Foundation’s National Advisory Board and serves on the College of Engineering’s advisory board, according to the WSU Foundation.

Business Boeing promotes China veteran to top sales job as Wojick retires Boeing AFP, Boeing handout Senior vice president Ihssane Mounir has been named Boeing's top airplane salesman as John Wojick retires. Senior vice president Ihssane Mounir has been named Boeing's top airplane salesman as John Wojick retires. (AFP, Boeing handout) Julie JohnssonBloomberg Boeing's chief airplane salesman, John Wojick, will retire from the post in early 2017 after four years of globetrotting and head-to-head competitions with Airbus Group for multibillion-dollar jetliner orders. He'll be replaced by senior vice president Ihssane Mounir, who leads the planemaker's sales team in northeastern Asia, Boeing commercial airplane chief Ray Conner said in an email to employees late Thursday. Mounir's current portfolio includes China, one of the fastest-growing aviation markets in the world. Mounir takes over as Chicago-based Boeing and European rival Airbus contend with slowing commercial jet sales after more than a decade of rapid expansion that left the planemakers with record order backlogs. Wojick "has consistently demonstrated the integrity, tenacity, courage and commitment it takes to compete aggressively and win in the marketplace," Conner wrote. He said Mounir's "extensive knowledge of our products and services puts him in the best position to help our customers address their fleet and operational needs." Wojick helped make the 737 Max the best-selling new airplane model in Boeing's 100-year history, although it still trails Airbus's upgraded A320neo family, which benefited from an earlier market debut. Wojick also landed the largest sale in U.S. aviation history: Emirates Airline's $76 billion order for 150 of Boeing's 777X jetliners in 2013. He joined Boeing in 1980 as an aerospace engineer before earning an MBA from the University of Colorado in 1985. Wojick held a variety of positions within Boeing's sales organization, overseeing its marketing in North America, the Asia-Pacific region, India and elsewhere before succeeding Conner as senior vice president for global sales and marketing in August 2012. He holds a private pilot's license and is the son of a U.S. Air Force and United Airlines pilot. Mounir's promotion caps a rapid rise at Boeing, which he joined in 1997 as a senior aerodynamics engineer. The Moroccan native didn't speak English when he arrived alone in the U.S. at age 17, according to a 2014 profile in the Seattle Times. After landing a conditional acceptance to Wichita State University to study aerospace engineering, Mounir, who is fluent in Arabic, French and Spanish, immediately enrolled in language school. Since 2011, Mounir has dueled with Airbus in China, which is spending heavily on aviation infrastructure and aircraft. His replacement will be announced later, Conner said. "My goal is to beat Airbus in China every year," Mounir told Bloomberg Television, adding that he wasn't content with a 50-50 split of the market. "My goal is to go all the way."

November 14, 2016 0727 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:170278 Publish Date: Fri, 14 Oct 2016 18:53:02 GMT Service: Iran US, Japanese banks to fund Boeing sales to Iran US plane manufacturer Boeing has reached an agreement with an American bank to provide financing for Iran’s purchase of airliners in cooperation with a Japanese bank, an informed source announced. The informed source at Iran’s government said according to an agreement between Boeing and a US bank, the purchase of the civil aircraft will be financed via a Japanese bank, Tasnim News Agency reported. The comments came after the US decided in September to remove a final hurdle for Western aircraft manufacturers to sell planes to Iran under contracts signed after coming into force of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a nuclear agreement between Tehran and the group of six countries. Iran sealed a deal in June with the US aerospace heavyweight, Boeing, for the purchase of 100 passenger planes. In January, Iran also signed a major contract with Airbus worth about $27 billion to buy 118 planes. The contract was signed during the visit to Paris by Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani. On September 21, aviation giants Airbus and Boeing Co. received permission from the US government to sell aircraft to Iran, part of landmark deals potentially worth some $50 billion in total following last year's nuclear accord. Boeing deal with Iran would be the biggest for an American company since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. European airplane manufacturer Airbus announced the license from the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control on September 22. Boeing followed with its own announcement later in the day. Though based abroad, Airbus needed the approval of the US Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the manufacturer's components are of American origin. Airbus applied for two licenses to cover its deal with Iran to ensure the fast delivery of some of the aircraft, Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon told the Associated Press. The license covers the first 17 planes involved in the deal, which will be A320s and A330s, he said. Dubon said Airbus hoped to receive a second license allowing it to sell the remaining planes to Iran soon. Under Boeing's deal, Iran’s flag carrier Iran Air will buy 80 aircraft with a total list price of $17.6 billion, with deliveries beginning in 2017 and running until 2025. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s in a deal that Iranian officials have suggested would be worth some $25 billion in total.       KeyWords US banks Boeing Iran   Related News : US, Japanese banks to fund Boeing sales to Iran Iran: US must encourage banks to do business with Tehran US government accuses Iran of cyber attack against dozens of banks Iran urges US to tell EU banks trade Ok Iran's Rouhani calls for end to hostility with any country Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Iran, Russia cooperating on Middle East issues: Larijani EU must play more active role on regional, global issues: Zarif Iran beats USA in world kabaddi meet to reach semifinals Iran seeks secure, stable Iraq: Parliament speaker Iran crowned at 1st world Pahlavani bouts Iran fit enough to win world physique title Top Iranian, Russian parliamentarians meet in Tehran President Rouhani inaugurates three oilfields in Khuzestan Official: Over 1m Iranians enter Iraq for Arba’een rituals Iran to join Paris climate change treaty Most Visited Trump looking at 'quick ways' to ditch Paris climate accord: Report Protests erupt in Cincinnati after mistrial in police shooting of black male Sanders popular policies could have made him president: Analyst www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/2131 sec

 Here's the simple reason why planes have winglets Benjamin Zhang and Dragan Radovanovic Oct. 14, 2016, 11:10 AM 177,877 facebook linkedin twitter email print A Boeing 737. Boeing Ever look out the window of a plane or watch as it pulls up to the gate? Have you ever wondered why some planes have pointy bits at the ends of the wings? What you see are "winglets," and they have essentially become standard equipment on all new airliners. Why are they there? "Winglets help reduce the drag associated with the creation of lift," Robert Gregg, Boeing's chief aerodynamicist, told Business Insider. That's the technical answer. Gregg said the practical reason behind winglets is easier to comprehend. Winglets allow the wings to be more efficient at creating lift, which means planes require less power from the engines. That results in greater fuel economy, lower CO2 emissions, and lower costs for airlines. Boeing claims that winglets installed on its 757 and 767 airliners can improve fuel burn by 5% and cut CO2 emissions by up to 5%. An airline that installs winglets on its fleet of 58 Boeing 767 jets is expected to save 500,000 gallons of fuel annually. Winglets help mitigate the effects of "induced drag." When an aircraft is in flight, the air pressure on top of the wing is lower than the air pressure under the wing. Near the wing tips, the high-pressure air under the wing rushes to the lower-pressure areas on top, which results in the creation of vortices. The vortices flow in a three-dimensional manner over the wings. They not only pull air up and over the wing, but they also pull air back. That third component is induced drag. With the advent of winglets, the aircraft is able to weaken the strength of wingtip vortices and, more important, cut down on induced drag along the whole wing. Dragan Radovanovic/Business Insider Induced drag can be overcome by making the wing longer. In fact, the general rule is, the longer the wingspan, the lower the induced drag, Gregg said. But in many instances, airplane makers simply don't have the option of making the wings longer. For example, narrow-body airliners such as the Boeing 737 and 757 often operate from gates at airports designed for short- to medium-range domestic flights. Since these flights usually require smaller aircraft, they have less room apportioned to them. As a result, wingspan is effectively limited by the size of the parking space the plane is allotted at the gate. So instead of the adding wingspan by making the wings longer, Boeing adds wingspan by going vertical with winglets. In some instances winglets aren't necessary, because there are no constraints on space. For example, Boeing's hot-selling 777 wide-body airliner does not have winglets. According to Gregg, that's because the 777 operates from international terminals designed for larger jumbo jets. As a result, Boeing found the performance it was seeking without the need for vertical extensions. A Boeing 777. No winglets here. Boeing Since they were first developed by Richard Whitcomb at NASA's Langley Research Center in 1976, airplane makers have steadily worked to improve the design and effectiveness of winglets. According to Gregg, the first-generation winglets fitted to aircraft such as the Boeing 747-400 and the McDonnell Douglas MD11 offered up to 2.5% to 3% improvement in fuel burn compared with aircraft not equipped with the option. Second-generation winglets, such as those found on Boeing's workhorse 737, 757, and 767 aircraft are much larger than the first-gen models, with greater curvature. Second-generation winglets offer a 4% to 6% improvement in fuel burn.

Mounir succeeds John Wojick, who is retiring after 36 years of company service, effective early 2017. In his new role, Mounir is responsible for the sales and marketing of all commercial airplanes and related services to airlines and leasing customers in all markets worldwide. His team's duties include sales strategy, operations and customer relationships. "Ihssane is a seasoned sales leader with in-depth knowledge of Boeing customers worldwide," said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner. "His extensive knowledge of our products and services puts him in the best position to help our customers address their fleet and operational needs and be successful in today's competitive environment." Mounir has held several leadership positions within Boeing's Sales organization, mostly recently as vice president of Sales for Northeast Asia. He previously served as vice president of Marketing, Sales Strategy and Operations, responsible for developing and implementing cross-regional strategies for Commercial Airplanes. Prior to that assignment, Mounir led Commercial Airplanes Sales efforts in many regions across the world. Previously, Mounir was the vice president of Sales for Latin America, Africa and the Caribbean. He also served in Sales leadership roles in Europe, Russia, Central Asia and Africa. Mounir joined Boeing as a senior aerodynamics engineer in 1997. He earned Bachelors and Masters degrees in aerospace engineering from Wichita State University. Conner thanked Wojick for his decades of service to Boeing and leadership of the team that sold thousands of airplanes to customers worldwide. "John's retirement caps an outstanding 36-year Boeing career that has included assignments in engineering and all facets of commercial airplanes sales and marketing," Conner said. "As the leader of our Sales team since 2012, he has consistently demonstrated the integrity, tenacity, courage and commitment it takes to compete aggressively and win in the marketplace. Under his leadership, our Sales and Marketing organization has sharpened its focus on our customers, continued to earn their trust and maintain their loyalty." The new regional leader for Northeast Asia Sales will be named at a later time.

For example, the Boeing-built   F-15E is equipped with an Advanced Display Core Processor, which can process 87 billion instructions per second. The newly outfitted F-15E made its first flight July 8 with U.S. Air Force Major Justin “Astro” Elliott at the controls. “It will bring people home in bad situations—situations we couldn’t have gotten home from before,” said Elliott in a Boeing Co. press release. After a difficult few years, the outlook for  defense activity is improving, due in part to continuing innovation. Through July, data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau indicated that year-to-date shipments for defense aircraft and parts were down 11 percent from 2015 numbers; however, new orders rose 14 percent versus a year ago. For July alone, new defense capital goods orders increased 35.7 percent; shipments increased 1.1 percent. “We expect that the aerospace and defense industry will continue to grow, due to the rising tensions around the world, particularly in countries that have sovereign threats, such as the South China Seas, the India/China border, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and the border between North and South Korea,” says Tom Captain, vice chairman of the Deloitte U.S. and Global Aerospace and Defense Sector. These threats prompted many countries to recapitalize their defense equipment. “The defense market hasn’t encountered the declines in spending that people were predicting five or six years ago,” says Randy Starr, a principal with Strategy&, a division of consultancy PwC. Starr, who leads the firm’s aerospace and defense practice, says defense spending “ebbs and flows every 12 to 14 years,” but prolonged conflicts resulting from the war on terror have kept spending from dipping as deeply as some analysts anticipated. However, despite supplemental funding that Congress allocates for defense programs, “the harsh reality is there isn’t enough [for] all the big programs the military has in its budget.” Growth areas for defense in the upcoming year will include restricted programs and the production ramp-up on the F-35 Triton and Global Hawk, Wesley Bush, chairman, president and CEO of Northrop Grumman, Falls Church, Virginia, told investors in late July. “These growing programs are more than offsetting the expected declines in Aerospace Systems programs, such as NATO AGS, F/A-18, Advanced EHF and the James Webb Space Telescope.” Affordability rules Because of the emphasis on budgets, the military will focus on finding “ways to increase the capability of platforms that already exist,” Starr says. “A classic example is the F-16 fighter, which has been around since the 1970s but it’s still in use, which is likely due to continually improving the capability of that airplane over time.” The effort to reduce costs also will have an effect on materials used. “Affordability is paramount, no matter what segment you are talking about,” Starr says. “There is a strong desire to try to find a way to wring costs out of both new development programs and programs that have been in production for decades. So defense contractors are under pressure, some of it self-imposed, to reduce material costs.” However, Captain says, lighter weight materials cannot compromise safety. “If it’s less safe and less reliable, it’s not going to be approved. Metals and alloy companies are working with certification authorities, as well their customers, to ensure that the lightweight materials that represent the next generation of material science are in fact as safe or safer but of course more lightweight and more fuel efficient.” There also will be a continued emphasis on communication, surveillance and reconnaissance technologies—“mission-related systems,” Starr says. “In the future, it’s been said that wars will not be fought with missiles and bullets but with ones and zeros—in other words, in cyberspace,” Captain says. He points out that in the next conflict, “we’ll certainly see more electronic defense weaponry, such as increased use of next-generation intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capability as well as data analytics to support the third leg, which is precision strike. Precision strike will increasingly include electronic strike and that will include high-powered lasers as well as directed energy, in other words, microwaves. The first technologies are being proven out right now in the battle space but are not fully deployed in conflict quite yet.”  Editor's Choice Up to the task On the cusp Pure power Doubling down Durable beauty Most Viewed Alcoa Corp. launches as an independent industry leader in bauxite, alumina and aluminum products > Metals Service Center Institute and National Safety Council unveil partnership program > OMAX MicroMAX named finalist for prestigious R&D 100 Awards > Ampco-Pittsburgh announces acquisition of ASW Steel Inc. > Operational Excellence in Manufacturing 2016, December 6-7, 2016, Chicago > Copper Industry Sustainable Energy Director appointed to Federal Clean Energy Committee > Regional manufacturing centers boost high school completion rates > A veteran’s best friend > SSAB launches Docol (hot-rolled) steel, tailor made for chassis applications > Wismarq advances with strategic acquisition of Prior Coated Metals Inc. > LATEST ISSUE   November 2016 READY RESOURCE Service Center Metals produces billets to battle imports. > READ THIS MONTH'S ISSUE Instagram - @ModernMetalsMag Modern Metals on Twitter Tweets by @ModernMetalsMag Company Profiles COIL PROCESSING DEBURRING/FINISHING PLATE SERVICE CENTERS Butech Bliss Supermax Tools Peddinghaus Corp.

However, dividend stocks have recently been thrown out with the proverbial bath water as investors fear interest rate increases. A new Jefferies research note says that the 2016 Dogs of the Dow, which were the lowest priced, highest yielding stocks in the venerable index, are doing outstanding. What we found interesting is the companies that could very well be in that category next year. Four top Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks that all yield more than 3% are down so far in 2016 and may be outstanding buys at current levels. Boeing This top aerospace industrial is still down almost 8% since the beginning of the year, and it was removed from the Dividend Ruler portfolio. Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA), together with its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures, sells, services and supports commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services worldwide. Top analysts have noted that the commercial aerospace business is cyclical and there are some indications that airlines may have expanded their wide-body fleets too aggressively in recent years, suggesting a period of weaker demand going forward. In addition, the fall in oil prices reduces the incentive to upgrade to the most fuel-efficient planes. Boeing is launching refreshed versions of the 737 and the 777 in the next couple of years. New product introductions carry the risk of potential cost overruns. As a result, confidence in the dividend growth outlook has waned. Boeing shareholders receive a 3.27% dividend. The Wall Street consensus price target is $148.71. The stock closed most recently at $133.38. Coca-Cola This company remains a top Warren Buffet holding and offers not only safety, but an incredible strong worldwide brand. Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) is the world’s largest beverage company, refreshing consumers with more than 500 sparkling and still brands. Led by Coca-Cola, its portfolio features 20 billion-dollar brands, including Diet Coke, Fanta, Sprite, Coca-Cola Zero, vitaminwater, Powerade and Minute Maid. Globally, it is the top provider of sparkling beverages, ready-to-drink coffees and juices and juice drinks. Through the world’s largest beverage distribution system, consumers in more than 200 countries enjoy its beverages at a rate of more than 1.9 billion servings a day. Despite reporting second-quarter earnings that came in above some estimates, slower growth and flat volumes brought out the sellers and they tagged Coke stock big time. It is important to remember though that the company owns 31.5% of Monster Beverage, which continues to deliver big numbers. Investors receive a 3.35% dividend. The consensus price target is $47.17, and the stock closed Thursday at $41.76. General Electric This iconic blue chip industrial was on a roll but has sold off 15% since July and is giving investors a nice entry point. General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) is a highly diversified, global industrial corporation. Its businesses are organized broadly under six segments: GE Capital, Energy Infrastructure, Aviation, Healthcare, Transportation and Home & Business Solutions. Its products and services include power generation equipment, aircraft engines, locomotives, medical equipment, appliances, commercial leasing and personal finance. Wall Street analysts feel that the American giant will be a large player in the efficient energy field. While the analysts recently lowered earnings expectations for the quarter slightly, they remain positive as expectations for orders and free cash flow already seem very low. They also note that the industrial giant has a massive $25 billion in cash, which could be put to use to drive earnings toward $2 a share by 2018. GE shareholders are paid a 3.3% dividend. The consensus price target is $33.13. The shares closed at $28.77. McDonald’s The fast-food giant has been hit hard since earnings were released, but it remains a solid pick for investors seeking dividends and a degree of safety. McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE: MCD) is the world’s leading global foodservice retailer, with over 36,000 locations serving approximately 69 million customers in over 100 countries each day. More than 80% of McDonald’s restaurants worldwide are owned and operated by independent local business persons. The company reported solid second-quarter results, but the U.S. store comparable sales growth of just less than 2% disappointed investors. Merrill Lynch noted that charges and refranchising gains make the earnings numbers a bit dicey, so the firm lowered its GAAP numbers to $5.40 from $5.60. McDonald’s shareholders receive a 3.26% dividend. The consensus price objective is $128.33. The shares closed at $115.41.

Besides receiving a big check, Airbus gets to celebrate: This widebody jet is the 10,000th plane it has delivered. It’s an impressive milestone for a planemaker whose chief nemesis Boeing celebrated its 100th birthday this year. Airbus Industrie, a European consortium based in Toulouse, France, started bolting wings to engines in 1970, when Boeing was celebrating its 54th anniversary. It was formed because France, Germany, and initially, Britain wanted to beat those damn Yankees by developing their own “air bus” — a small, short-haul plane. Almost half a century on, Airbus rivals Boeing in marketshare, and deserves credit for some revolutionary innovations, including fly-by-wire and double-decker passenger jets. Here’s a look back at the trip so far. 01 It was a slow start. Airbus’ first plane, the A300, made its maiden flight in 1972. The first one entered service with Air France two years later, shuttling between Paris and London. It was the first twin-engine, wide body (with two aisles) aircraft in the world. Sales started slowly, particularly in the US, but picked up as the plane proved reliable and efficient. Its raised cabin floor allowed for extra cargo and helped make it the best selling freight aircraft, ever. Credit: Airbus Airbus' first plane, the A300, made its maiden flight in 1972.

Sales started slowly, particularly in the US, but picked up as the plane proved reliable and efficient. Its raised cabin floor allowed for extra cargo and helped make it the best selling freight aircraft, ever. 02 But Airbus dreamed big. Today, the Airbus range includes the A320, A330, A350 XWB, and A380. The A300-600 and A310 introduced electrical command of non-critical, secondary flight controls, like flaps, replacing the traditional cables and pulleys. The A320 took this a leap further with full fly-by-wire computer control, turning everything over to the electronics. That level of trust in computers was remarkable when the A320 launched in March 1984. Today, it’s standard—and even making its way into cars.   Credit: Airbus Today, the Airbus range includes the A320, A330, A350 XWB, and A380. The A300-600 and A310 introduced electrical command of non-critical, secondary flight controls, like flaps, replacing the traditional cables and pulleys.

That level of trust in computers was remarkable when the A320 launched in March 1984. Today, it's standard---and even making its way into cars.   03 And built even bigger. By the late 1990s, Airbus had 16 manufacturing sites across Europe, collectively building over 200 planes per year and climbing. To move huge, semi-assembled airplane parts between them, Airbus needed an even huger plane, with a giant lift-up forehead to allow easy access. The A300-600 Super Transporter was quickly nicknamed the Beluga, and became everyone’s favorite, ridiculous, aircraft. Early next year an even bigger replacement will enter production. Five new transporter planes, based on the freighter version of Airbus’ A330-200,will be built. They’re officially named the BelugaXL.

Airbus’s boldest move has been the development of the gargantuan A380, a double-decker plane so big that airport infrastructure had to be redesigned to fit. When Airbus established a “large aircraft division” in 1996, the financial risks seemed worth it—taking lots of people lots of miles was the most lucrative part of the aircraft market. First flight was in 2005, followed by a series of exhaustive tests, like this cold soak in Canada, followed by polar Navigation studies. Slow sales have forced A380 production cutbacks, but Airbus still believes demand will grow, to service megacities with limited airport capacity.

Slow sales have forced A380 production cutbacks, but Airbus still believes demand will grow, to service megacities with limited airport capacity. 05 The company has ambitions for its small planes too.

Image: NASA Can We Get a Human to Mars by 2030? Written by Becky Ferreira and Ben Sullivan October 14, 2016 // 07:00 AM EST Copy This URL On Tuesday, President Obama wrote an op-ed for CNN outlining his vision to send humans to Mars within the next 14 years, in preparation for the White House Frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh on Thursday. “We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America's story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time,” Obama said. “Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators, and we're already well on our way.” He’s not wrong; we are indeed on the brink of pioneering technologies that can deliver humans to Mars, and return them safely home again. Within the last few weeks, for instance, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk unveiled his company’s plans to develop a dazzling Interplanetary Transport System, powered by the largest rocket of all time, which could be ready to ferry astronauts to Mars as early as 2024, according to Musk. SpaceX’s ambitious plans have ignited a spirit of entrepreneurial rivalry with other private spaceflight companies. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg revealed his own company’s intentions of beating Musk to this milestone at the What’s Next? technology summit held last week in Chicago. “I'm convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket," Muilenburg said. But how realistic is the goal of reaching Mars on such a tight deadline? Motherboard's Ben Sullivan (who thinks it can be done) and Becky Ferreira (who thinks it can’t) discussed the invigorated race for Mars over Slack. BEN: Ok, so, what, you don’t think a human will set foot on Mars until the 2030s? BECKY: I think the 2030s is way too early to shoot for something as dangerous and complicated as a Mars mission for a few reasons. As Elon Musk laid out a couple weeks ago, carrying enough people to start a Mars colony while still having enough energy to arrive and land safely means building the largest rocket ever. Images: SpaceX BEN: Like what? I agree the Mars missions will be both dangerous and complicated, I just don’t see how Musk and others will be pushed back by a whole decade? Of course, I can totally believe NASA not getting there for ages... BECKY: Sure, well, there's the most self-explanatory reason of course—even though astronauts have been in the Mir/ISS for over a year, nobody knows what the medical risks of a multi-year trip to Mars would entail, even if there are no major accidents. But beyond medical/technical challenges, multiple lead-up missions would have to precede a human mission. Normally it takes five years to a decade to prep a Mars landing mission, let alone a sample return mission—which will have to be done at whatever Mars site is selected. I get that people are eager to take the next "giant leap" as Obama put it, but I think the Apollo comparison is harmful. Mars is not the Moon! Do you think Musk can make a human Mars mission happen within 14 years? What do you think NASA's role in that would be? BEN: Yep, you’re right about the medical risks. We wrote about the breakdown of cognitive abilities cosmic rays will have on astronauts just this week, but I don’t think it’s a problem that can’t be solved in just a few years. I mean, look at all this money private orgs like SpaceX are pumping into getting to the Red Planet. I honestly think SpaceX can make it happen within 14 years. That’s a lifetime with the pace of change happening in the private sector right now. SpaceX wasn’t even a company 14 years ago! And there’s going to be no shortage of human volunteers, either. I appreciate your argument is based on science and mine is very emotional… but just look plainly at the facts, we’re ready to go almost now. Musk’s plan isn’t even that extraordinary, there’s nothing crazy about it, right? BECKY: Great point about SpaceX not existing 14 years ago, which goes to show how much progress can be made in that period of time. However, as impressive as it is to build a spaceflight company from the ground-up, it's still a false equivalency to compare that to getting humans to Mars in the same timeframe. I suppose there's nothing inherently crazy about Musk's plan—except his deadline. He is proposing building the most powerful rocket of all time, the first long-duration interplanetary crewed spacecraft, and the infrastructure to mine in situ resources from the Martian surface within a decade and change. Even a company as innovative as SpaceX does not have the bandwidth to pull this off safely in time for the 2030s, and this isn't even getting into the legal issues of planetary protection. I do think those issues can be overcome, but it will take time and involvement from the entire global spaceflight community to do so. Summary of SpaceX’s Interplanetary Transport System concept. Video: SpaceX/YouTube As to your point about having an emotional angle on this, I feel ya. I want to see humans on Mars. But my preference would be a slow, safe, and incremental approach, a la Wernher von Braun's vision for spaceflight, rather than rushing into another space race that makes human life and safety secondary to symbolic victories BEN: Slow and steady wins the race, for sure. I guess it’s easy to think everything is sorted when all you have to worry about is rockets. Space is hard, but rocket science is easy, and building the ITS boosters won’t be too much of a problem, but yeah, Musk admittedly was rather scant on details when it came to health issues. And you’re right, it will take the full involvement of the global space community to overcome problems like radiation and the damaging effects of microgravity and weightlessness. I mean, NASA has made this area of research a priority, and I think SpaceX will rely on NASA a lot over the next decade or two in this department at least. And this deadline also relies on there being no problems with SpaceX’s Red Dragon mission in 2018, as part of its Space Act Agreement with NASA. The mission will analyse what will be needed to protect the Mars lander when it’s on the planet, and also make sure that the lander and humans won’t contaminate the planet in any harmful way. Funding is another hurdle. While I’m confident Musk can fund many aspects of the mission (he noted that it’s currently taking up less than five percent of SpaceX’s spending,) in his own words, “Ultimately, this is going to be a huge public-private partnership.” While SpaceX may be happy to send humans up in the 2020s and 2030s, the question is, will the ones who are paying for it be happy? READ MORE: Watch Elon Musk Explain How He Will Get Our Asses To Mars BECKY: Precisely, there will be so many hidden contingencies with a mission this ambitious and complicated, let alone the obstacles that we do know have to be overcome. The public-private partnership is one that I want to address: It's great that SpaceX and Boeing are shooting for Mars and I'm glad there are vocal proponents, like Musk, who are tackling these kinds of futurist goals. My worry is how much public money will be on the hook for this. A human Mars mission is estimated to cost upwards of $100 billion (though Musk has argued it can be much cheaper, of course). It would be a shame, in my opinion, if NASA's budget were steamrolled for several years by an endeavor this ambitious, edging out other robotic exploration missions that could be really useful (a Europa lander for instance). NASA's massive Space Launch System is currently under development by Boeing, and also would be the most powerful rocket ever built. Image: Boeing Also, I'd like to get your read on a broader note: I'm personally not sold on the idea of stoking another "space race," this time for Mars. During the Space Race 1.0., the US and USSR achieved great feats because of that rivalry, sure, but there were also a lot of tragedies as a result of the intense pace of the competition. Of course, there are thousands of volunteers who are willing to risk their lives for a chance to leave footprints on Mars, and they should be applauded. But every precaution should be made for their safety, and I'm not convinced that's possible by the 2030s, nor do I think "space races" provide a workable framework for sustainable colonization of the solar system over the long term. At some point, we have to be incentivized by something other that "oh no, my enemy is gonna get there first." BEN: Agreed, a Space Race 2.0 isn’t ideal but unless there’s some seismic shift in global relations I really don’t think that’s going to happen. The only race here is between private companies, and even then, they’re all going to have to help one another out. The technology needed to get humans to Mars will be the result of a multinational effort, as well as multicorporation (like my previous example of NASA’s role as more of a research incubator and advisor). The time is ripe for Mars. Everything’s fallen into place. We have the technology, we have the players, I think we have the consent of the public, and we also have persuasive reasons to go too, rather than political goals. Musk is a determined man, and I think the exponential growth of technology and ambition that he has ushered in will only continue until we have boots on the ground on Mars, and with the help of all the other agencies, this will no doubt happen during the 2030s at the latest. BECKY: Awesome, let's make this an official bet! If we've successfully sent humans to Mars by the 2030s, I'll owe you a really slick Saturn V model or something. I kind of love my position here because if we don't make it within 20ish years, I win, but if we do make it, the human species as a whole wins. I like those odds. Want to weigh in on the debate?

Credit: NASA NASA is sure enough that Boeing and SpaceX can safely launch astronauts to the International Space Station by early 2019 to hold off paying Russia to keep flying U.S. crews to the research complex, and one official says a deadline to order parts for new Russian Soyuz crew capsules may have already passed. Boeing and SpaceX are working on new commercial capsules designed to transport at least four astronauts to and from the orbiting outpost, but their schedules appear to be slipping, this time due to technical woes, not the lack of funding that caused previous delays in the program. Until the U.S.-built spaceships are certified by NASA, all space station crews will launch and land aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft. NASA last year signed a $490 million agreement with the Russian government for six round-trip seats on Soyuz missions, with launches in 2018 and landings extending into early 2019. The space agency is sending nearly $82 million to Russia for each ticket. Even as the commercial crew schedules move later into 2018, NASA officials say they are not considering extending the contract with Roscosmos — the Russian space agency — for more launches in 2019. The last Soyuz launch seats reserved for U.S. astronauts are at the end of 2018. It takes more than two years to procure components and assemble new Soyuz capsules, so Russia needed to receive new Soyuz orders from NASA by some time this fall to ensure the spacecraft would be ready for liftoff in early 2019. Four Soyuz spacecraft currently launch each year, and without NASA’s reliance on the Russian ferry craft, that production and launch rate will be cut in half. NASA has recently signed new contracts for Soyuz seats by May of each year. The last contract extension with Roscosmos was announced in August 2015, just in time for Russian engineers to start work on the spaceships for launches in 2018. While NASA and Roscosmos have not publicly identified a deadline for a fresh Soyuz agreement, the U.S. space agency’s top human spaceflight official recently told Spaceflight Now the date may have already passed. “We may have actually crossed the deadline, so we’re not really looking at that,” said Bill Gerstenmaier, head of NASA’s human exploration and operations directorate. “There is still sufficient overlap, and we could still do things during the overlap period.” Asked if he is comfortable not buying more Soyuz seats, Gerstenmaier replied: “I don’t have much choice.” File photo of Bill Gesternmaier, NASA’s head of human exploration and operations. Credit: NASA/Joel Kowsky “A Soyuz is a complicated vehicle, and a complicated vehicle doesn’t come into existence in a matter of days,” said Kirk Shireman, NASA’s space station program manager, in an interview last month, before Gerstenmaier’s comments. “It takes over two years to build a Soyuz, so yes, at some point in time, building a new Soyuz vehicle is not an option. We’re working with our Russian counterparts on exactly when that is. We have not crossed that date yet, but I believe the date is in sight. “It will be this calendar year when we will cross the point where we won’t be able to build a Soyuz in time for when our last seats that we’ve already procured expire,” Shireman said. Any decision to send more money to the Russian government — a new Soyuz contract for a year’s worth of seats is likely to cost more than $500 million — would be politically unpopular in the United States after the Obama administration pushed Congress and secured full funding for the commercial crew program last year, an appropriation NASA said would reduce chances of further delays. Holding off on more Soyuz seat purchases is also likely to put more pressure on Boeing and SpaceX. Commercial crew missions were originally scheduled to begin in 2015, but lawmakers in Congress for several years did not approve the funding NASA said the program needed. The CST-100 Starliner spaceship developed by Boeing will be ready for its first crewed test flight, with a Boeing test pilot and NASA astronaut on-board, in August 2018, the company confirmed this week. That is six months later than Boeing’s previous target date for the piloted mission announced in May. Assuming the test flight goes well, Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner could be certified for its first operational crew rotation mission to the space station in December 2018, Boeing officials said in a report first published by Aviation Week. SpaceX claims its Crew Dragon spacecraft could fly with test pilots by the end of 2017, but the company is working through its second failure investigation in a year after a Falcon 9 rocket — the same type of booster that will launch crews — exploded on the launch pad in Florida last month. A prototype of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule completed a pad abort test at Cape Canaveral in May 2015. Credit: SpaceX While SpaceX has not announced any delays on the Crew Dragon program, the final impacts of last month’s explosion on the company’s manifest remain to be seen. SpaceX officials admit the schedule leading up to a trio of key milestones next year — an orbital mission without astronauts, an in-flight checkout of the Crew Dragon’s abort system, and a crewed demo mission to the space station — is optimistic, requiring near perfect execution and assuming engineers find no problems on the multitude of ground and flight tests planned over the next 12 months. If SpaceX can keep that schedule, the first operational Crew Dragon rotation flight is expected in early 2018. “We have a lot of work to do to get there, but that’s the schedule we’re working to,” said Garrett Reisman, SpaceX’s director of crew operations and a former astronaut. NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden told reporters last month that the agency own internal schedule projects the first SpaceX and Boeing crewed test flights, each with two astronauts, in 2018. “We’re relatively confident that we’re going to make that,” Bolden said in a press conference at the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico. “This is a development program, and everyone needs to keep that in mind. With that said, we are not presently looking at any additional (Soyuz) seats beyond those that we have already purchased.” A report by NASA’s Office of Inspector General released last month echoed the worries of some NASA managers that neither commercial crew program will be certified for regular flights until late 2018. The latest slip in Boeing’s schedule stems from challenges moving from development into production of the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft, which the company says have stabilized, minor component qualification test issues, and the scrapping of a spacecraft dome structure damaged during construction. “Based on those challenges, we stopped and took a hard look at our schedule moving forward and made the adjustment,” said Kelly Kaplan, a Boeing spokesperson. “As we learn these hard lessons, we’ll continue to incorporate them throughout the build and test campaigns. And we will remain focused on our first and most important priority — providing astronauts with safe crew transportation to and from the ISS.” Boeing’s first crewed test flight to the space station has moved six months from February to August 2018, Kaplan said, with the first two crew rotation flights in December 2018 and January 2019 — delayed from June 2018 and August 2018, respectively. A CST-100 pad abort test has been delayed from October 2017 to January 2018, and the capsule’s first unpiloted test flight has slid from December 2017 to June 2018, Kaplan said. Including a ground unit not intended to fly, four CST-100 Starliner vehicles are in various stages of construction and assembly. Each flight-worthy crew module is designed for 10 missions. Boeing is preparing to ship the first flight-like CST-100 crew module, a structural test article, from the company’s spaceship factory at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida to a test facility in Huntington Beach, California, in the coming weeks. Engineers there will put the crew module and a service module through a series of structural loads tests to ensure the design is up to the perils of spaceflight. A full-up drop test of a CST-100 mass simulator is also on tap from an altitude of 40,000 feet in the coming months to verify the capsule’s parachute deployment sequence works as expected. That test comes after a series of water and land landing tests that are nearing completion to measure the spacecraft’s response to the touchdown. CST-100 missions will end under parachutes with airbag-cushioned landings in the Western United States, with the initial test flights likely to touch down in New Mexico or Utah.

This rendering features the recent addition of an aft skirt below the capsule’s service module. Credit: United Launch Alliance Boeing officials believe they have resolved a potential aerodynamic issue discovered during wind tunnel tests. Data indicated the capsule’s shape on top of its rocket — the United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 booster — could make the launcher’s Centaur upper stage susceptible to higher-than-acceptable aerodynamic loads as the vehicle accelerates through the speed of sound. The spaceship will launch exposed, without the nose fairing typically flown on the Atlas 5 rocket. Engineers plan to add an aft skirt extending downward from the base of the CST-100 service module to resolve the problem. ULA released an updated artist’s rendering Thursday of the Atlas 5 rocket and CST-100 Starliner capsule in launch configuration. “Through incredible coordination and continued innovative thinking, the collective team of NASA, Boeing and United Launch Alliance completed three wind tunnel tests in six months to investigate the aerodynamic stability of various configurations and to anchor our analytical predictions,” said Gary Wentz, ULA’s vice president of human and commercial services. “Based on that information, we updated the configuration for the Atlas 5 Starliner integrated vehicle stack. This configuration is unique because it combines the Atlas 5 launch vehicle without a payload fairing with Boeing’s Starliner capsule, resulting in different aerodynamic interactions.” The metallic orthogrid aeroskirt will jettison from the rocket after it is no longer needed, and the structure will have “venting provisions” to prevent over-pressurization and allow the the CST-100’s pusher abort engines to safely ignite in the event of a launch mishap, according to ULA. Fabrication of the aeroskirt is due to begin this month at ULA’s factory in Decatur, Alabama, the company said. “Our testing indicates the solution we chose will sufficiently smooth the air flow around the vehicle during ascent, ensuring crew safety and mission success,” said John Mulholland, vice president and program manager of Boeing’s commercial crew program. Speaking at last month’s International Astronautical Congress in Mexico, SpaceX’s Reisman said the Crew Dragon recently passed its final design milestone. “That’s all behind us,” Reisman said. “We’re moving on with production, test and certification. That’s where all the focus is right now.” Reisman said the Crew Dragon has completed its primary structure qualification tests, and much of SpaceX’s attention on the commercial crew program is now centered on parachute testing — the human-rated version of Dragon will have four chutes, not the three currently flying on the cargo configuration — and validation of the performance of the spaceship’s life support system. One of the final tests of SpaceX’s spacesuit, which the company has kept secret, is scheduled around the end of this year, when the manager of the spacesuit design team will don the gear for a test inside a vacuum chamber, Reisman said last month. He said the spacesuit incorporates lessons learned from the bright orange launch and entry suits flown on the space shuttle, and is primarily composed of soft goods except for the helmet. “We’ve learned our lessons from the Columbia accident investigation report, and one of the things that was really featured in that report was the the deleterious effect of body-worn mass,” Reisman said. “One of the things we were very careful to try to eliminate as much as possible is that body-worn mass, so it’s mostly all soft goods with the exception of the helmet, and it’s got a bunch of other advances that make it really usable from an operational perspective.” He said SpaceX plans to release imagery of the spacesuit design soon. Around 80 percent of the Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon spaceships that will fly with astronauts is designed and built in-house at SpaceX, Reisman said, with the exception of a few items like the parachutes, which come from an outside vendor. Artist’s concept of a Falcon 9 rocket with a Crew Dragon spacecraft on top at launch pad 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Credit: SpaceX Reisman said SpaceX still intends for crews to board the Dragon capsule on the launch pad before fueling of the Falcon 9 rocket, a decision that concerned senior NASA officials even before last month’s explosion on the launch pad. “The baseline for crew ingress is for the crew to be ingressed and for the strap-in crew to be completely out of the blast danger area before we fuel the rocket,” Reisman said. “However, during that entire time, the launch abort system is armed and ready should anything untoward occur.” SpaceX plans to introduce the Crew Dragon’s propulsive landing capability, using the capsule’s SuperDraco abort engines to softly touch down without the need for parachutes, before the end of the decade. The first few Crew Dragon missions will splash down in the ocean, and Reisman said SpaceX expects to test the rocket-assisted landing scheme on a real space mission on the first automated logistics flight of the company’s next-generation Dragon cargo capsule. That flight, part of a follow-on cargo contract awarded by NASA in January, is scheduled in 2019. When Boeing and SpaceX begin flying astronauts, NASA will expand its crew complement on the space station from three to four people, a number that will include some representatives from Japan, Europe and Canada. That will give astronauts more time for scientific research. Russia is cutting the number of cosmonauts needed to maintain its segment of the space station from three to two next year, but Roscosmos aims to return to current staffing levels as soon as 2018, once a new Russian laboratory module arrives at the complex. Starting in 2019, when residents fly to the space station on Boeing, SpaceX and Russian vehicles, NASA and Roscosmos have agreed to launch mixed crews, where a Russian cosmonaut will always be part of a four-person crew on a CST-100 or Crew Dragon, and a U.S. astronaut will be one of the three fliers on each Soyuz. The in-kind agreement does not involve any exchange of funds, but it ensures there will always be at least one U.S. astronaut and one Russian cosmonaut on the space station in case an illness necessitates the homecoming of part of the research lab’s crew in a Crew Dragon, CST-100 or Soyuz capsule. “There are a number of things that could go wrong that would cause us, for instance, not to have a Soyuz vehicle up there,” Shireman said. “They could have a launch abort, or a problem in the factory, or the most likely scenario, according to our probabilistic risk assessment, is a cosmonaut or astronaut gets sick. If they get sick, everybody in that vehicle has to come home. If that was to occur, we wouldn’t want the Russian segment to be without a Russian segment expert, nor would we want the U.S. segment to be without a U.S. segment expert.” Email the author.

(Boeing) Related Stories Canada's CF-18s wearing out as rivals spar over replacement benefits Defence minister going back to drawing board on fighter jets, launching consultations In a study paid for by the company itself, Boeing found it contributes more than $3 billion US to the Canadian economy every year, the aircraft manufacturer announced Thursday. The analysis, done by Doyletech Corporation and commissioned by Boeing, concluded the massive manufacturer supports more than 17,000 jobs across Canada and contributes nearly $4 billion Cdn to the Canadian economy directly and indirectly. "This study helps to quantify Boeing's impact for Canadian industry," said Maria Lane, Defense Space & Security vice president of International Strategic Partnerships in a release. "Looking ahead, we are committed to growing our partnership with Canada, supporting local jobs and growth across the country." The analysis also says that Boeing's spending in Canada is growing at eight per cent — double the national growth rate of 4 per cent — and the company is contributing $10 million US to science, technology, economic evolution and growth. Harjit Sajjan going back to drawing board on fighter jets, launching consultations CF-18 airframes approaching their age limits as replacement debate rages The study is part of Boeing's larger "industrial engagement plan," the release states, related to its bid to sell several dozen fighter jets to the Canadian government. Boeing is vying with Lockheed Martin for the sale, offering up its own F/A-18 Super Hornet against the competitor's F-35 jets. Take numbers with a grain of salt, prof says Barry Prentice, a professor at the University of Manitoba's Asper School of Business, said the $3 billion USD figure could be "misleading." The number includes direct and indirect impact, and Prentice said that means the total factors in lots of money and jobs Boeing can't claim sole responsibility, including cash spent by employees and the price of raw materials the company didn't produce. "These sorts of numbers have to be taken with a real grain of salt," he said. Prentice said companies release economic impact studies from time to time to remind government and the public of their role in the economy. "It's always a threat the company can use to try and lever the sale of its goods to the government," he said. Boeing reportedly cutting up to 10% of workforce Boeing says it could end 747 production The report comes after media reports earlier this year that the company is facing hard times. In March, the Seattle Times reported the manufacturer was preparing to eliminate up to 10 per cent of its workforce, and in July, Boeing announced it might have to halt production of its 747 aircraft. Prentice said that's a symptom of a general decline in aviation markets, in part thanks to lagging demand from big buyers like the American military. Boeing's manufacturer in Winnipeg is one of the largest aerospace composite manufacturers in Canada, the company says, employing more than 1,400 people in the city.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Fri, Oct 14, 2016 - Page 11　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp LCC business lucrative, despite hurdles: Boeing Staff writer, with CNA Low-cost carriers (LCC) still appeal to Taiwanese, despite two locally owned budget carriers struggling financially, a Boeing executive said in Taipei yesterday while discussing the market outlook in Taiwan. Taiwan has a growing economy and market penetration for no-frills airlines is relatively low compared with other countries in Northeast Asia, which suggests there is room for growth, said Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Acknowledging the recent difficulties faced by V Air (威航) and Tigerair Taiwan (台灣虎航), Tinseth said he remains confident that the emergence of LCC business — both regionally and in Taiwan — is unlikely to slow. V Air suspended operations on Oct. 1, while Tigerair Taiwan is also in bad shape. “For every market, there will be winners and losers,” Tinseth said at a news conference, adding that with a good business plan, capital and corporate culture, the LCC model remains lucrative. “I think the challenge here in Taiwan is there is a greater desire for people to come visit Taiwan than necessarily to leave on the low-cost model.” It explains why the more successful LCCs operating in Taiwan are foreign-based, he said, adding that Taiwanese LCCs should improve their services for local passengers to develop a more balanced consumer base. Boeing said that passenger air traffic in Northeast Asia will grow at an annual rate of 2.6 percent over the next 20 years, backed by LCCs. Taiwan could see even greater growth with a stronger economy, although it might pick up rather slowly in the LCC market, Tinseth said. “We have seen a surge in the number of flights being added within the region due to the emergence of LCCs over the past five years,” he said. According to Boeing, the market share of Northeast Asia LCCs has grown from 31 percent in 2011 to 47 percent this year. The trend is exciting news for the aviation industry, because budget airlines help stimulate flight demand in general, Tinseth said. Mature fleets in Northeast Asia will drive replacement demand, contributing two-thirds of the region’s aircraft deliveries, he added. Boeing also forecasts that airlines in Northeast Asia will require 1,440 new commercial airplanes valued at over US$320 billion between now and 2035. More than half of these airplanes, or approximately 770 aircraft, will be for widebody airplanes such as the new 787 and 777 airplanes, while 600 units will be for narrow-body airplanes, such as the new 737 MAX, Tinseth said. "Widebody airplanes will continue to play an important role in Taiwan's commercial air travel market and that trend will continue as EVA Air introduces new 787s in the coming years," he said This story has been viewed 1146 times.

The airline also signed a Letter of Intent for up to 60 B737 MAX 8s, valued at US$6.9 billion at list prices. With this new order, Qatar Airways increases its firm order backlog of Boeing widebody airplanes from 65 to 105, including 60 777Xs. "Qatar Airways, already one of the fastest growing airlines in the history of aviation, today announces a significant and historic aircraft order that will power our future growth for the years and the decades ahead," said Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, Mr. Akbar Al Baker. "Boeing has proven to be a valuable partner, and today's announcement is testament to our appreciation of the quality of their product and their dedication to providing world class customer service." Qatar Airways' relationship with Boeing was renewed in 2006. Since then, there have been many milestones in the partnership.

Seen here is an artist's rendering of the airplane. Pic: Courtesy of BoeingKUALA LUMPUR, Oct 13 (Bernama) -- Boeing and China Southern Airlines on Wednesday Oct 12, 2016 finalized an order of 12 787-9 Dreamliners, valued at US$3.2 billion at current list prices. The new order strengthens China Southern's expanding long-haul fleet. "The 787 Dreamliners have helped us to achieve initial success in implementing our internationalization strategy in the past few years and enabled us to make our operation and services more appealing to passengers," said Tan Wangeng, CEO, China Southern Airlines in a statement from Guangzhou, China. "The additional new 787-9s will further increase our capacity and services for our long-haul routes." China Southern Airlines, China's launch customer of the 787, currently operates 10 787-8s. The airplanes have enabled the Guangzhou-based carrier to launch six new non-stop global routes, connecting Guangzhou to London and Rome in Europe, Vancouver in North America, as well as Perth, Auckland and Christchurch in the Oceania area. "China Southern has been a long-standing Boeing customer and we truly appreciate their confidence in the 787," said Ihssane Mounir, senior vice president, Northeast Asia Sales, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "The 787-9 will help the airline achieve a new level of efficiency and profitability." The 787-9 complements and extends the super-efficient 787 family. With the fuselage stretched by 6 meters (20 feet) over the 787-8, the 787-9 will fly more passengers and more cargo farther with the same exceptional environmental performance. Like the 787-8, the 787-9 brings the economics of large jets to the middle of the market, with 20 percent less fuel use and 20 percent fewer emissions than similarly sized airplanes. The 787-9 leverages the visionary design of the 787-8, offering passenger-pleasing features such as large windows, large stow bins, modern LED lighting, higher humidity, a lower cabin altitude, cleaner air and a smoother ride. China's largest airline by fleet size, China Southern Airlines currently operates 700 aircraft, including Boeing 787, 777, 747, 757 and 737s. By 2020, the airline expects to have a fleet of 1,000 aircraft with passenger traffic surpassing 160 million annually. --BERNAMA >> Newslist Previous Top Stories Earthquake: Stay Vigilant, Najib Advises Malaysians In New Zealand BNM Tightens NDF Trading Rules Country's Future Cannot Depend On Hypocritical Political Pact - Najib Other News Headlines PPBM-Pakatan Harapan Collaboration Will Not Work - Ismail Sabri- politic Brace For Higher Financial Market Volatility, Says Don- business Remains Of Former Terengganu Footballer Alfian Aziz Laid To Rest- sports The Best And Freshest Produce At Maha 2016- features Us President-elect Trump Names Republican Leader Reince Priebus As Chief Of Staff- world Most Read News No Malaysians Affected In Christchurch Quake 18 Months Imprisonment For Pandan MP Rafizi Under OSA Communications Minister Attends Opening Of ITU Telecom World 2016 Home | Sitemap | Contact Us | General | Politics | Business | Sports | Features | World | Full News List | Archived News | RSS Feeds © 2016 BERNAMA.

The order by Asia’s biggest carrier by passenger volume is valued at $3.2 billion according to list prices, although carriers typically negotiate discounts. It comes less than a week after Qatar Airways announced an order for 30 Dreamliners. The two deals combined more than doubled Boeing’s 787 order tally for the year. China Southern chose the 787-9 model, with a list price of $271 million each, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange statement Wednesday. The planes will be delivered between 2018 and 2020 and funded using cash and loans from banks, the Guangzhou, China-based airline said in the statement. The carrier and its subsidiaries have ordered more than $15 billion of new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus Group in the past year. China Southern, the country’s first Boeing 787 customer, already flies 16 Dreamliners on operating and financial lease, according to data the airline released in August. The carrier had a total fleet of 684 planes, the largest in Asia, as it caters to a nation that is expected to surpass North America as the world’s largest aviation market.

But innovation at Boeing will be “disciplined” and not endanger the future of the world’s biggest plane maker, Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told reporters at an event marking the company’s founding on July 15, 1916. The enterprise established by William Boeing in a Seattle boathouse has faced numerous “bet the company” moments over its 10 decades to bring out new planes such as the 707 and 747. “We have won for 100 years because of innovation,” Muilenburg said. “The key is disciplined innovation. We’ll take risks. We’ll invest smartly.” Chicago-based Boeing has managed to stay ahead of European rival Airbus in plane production and is a major defense and space contractor, producing fighter jets, aerial refueling tankers, communications satellites and rockets. The company is exploring the possibilities of commercial supersonic and hypersonic planes, Muilenburg said. It also is at work on a manned mission to Mars. Though those are perhaps many decades away, “I’m anticipating that person will be riding on a Boeing rocket,” Muilenburg said. More immediately, Boeing is pressing for licenses to conclude sales of 109 aircraft to Iran, including leased jets, despite opposition from some in Congress. “This is a significant opportunity,” he said. “It does represent significant U.S. manufacturing jobs.” The company also is still working on plans for a so-called “middle of the market” aircraft that could fill a gap in its product line between the 737 and the 787. Muilenburg said it might use “existing products, derivatives of existing products or an all new airplane” to fill the gap. “If it’s an all new airplane, we think that would probably be in the 2024-2025 time frame in terms of when it would be introduced into service,” he said. Muilenburg spoke with reporters at the beginning of a celebratory weekend of events for an estimated 100,000 employees, families and retirees at Boeing Field in Seattle. Muilenburg said Boeing is arguably stronger now than at any point in its 100-year history. It has a backlog of 5,700 plane orders, enough to keep its factories humming for six or seven years. Beyond filling those orders, it aims to “sharpen and accelerate” its innovation, in plane design in the factory and services. This includes “second-century design in manufacturing, automation, 3-D printing, additive manufacturing,” he said. “Even though we’re arguably the best aerospace company in the world today, we have to continue to invest in innovation,” he said.— Reuters Share this: Print Email Tweet Related SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleHashoo Foundation committed to youth empowerment Next articleAttempted Turkey coup may imperil region’s crude transport Webmaster RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Economy Watch Bahria Town, Hyatt Hotels sign agreement for 4 signature resort properties in Pakistan Economy Watch Dar urges SECP to create cell of experts to provide guidance on Companies Ordinance Economy Watch Dream of game-changer CPEC materialised Digital Newspaper Social Diary Oil & Gas Leap Forward Management Founder: Zahid Malik Editor: Faisal Zahid Malik Executive Editor: Gauhar Zahid Malik Editor Social Diary: Sadia Zahid Malik E-Mail : socialdiarymag@gmail.com magazinesocialdiary@hotmail.com Resident Editor Lahore: .....

He'll be replaced by senior vice president Ihssane Mounir, who leads the planemaker's sales team in northeastern Asia, Boeing commercial airplane chief Ray Conner said in an email to employees late Thursday. Mounir's current portfolio includes China, one of the fastest-growing aviation markets in the world. Mounir takes over as Chicago-based Boeing and European rival Airbus contend with slowing commercial jet sales after more than a decade of rapid expansion that left the plane maker with record order backlogs. Wojick "has consistently demonstrated the integrity, tenacity, courage and commitment it takes to compete aggressively and win in the marketplace," Conner wrote. He said Mounir's "extensive knowledge of our products and services puts him in the best position to help our customers address their fleet and operational needs." Wojick helped make the 737 Max the best-selling new airplane model in Boeing's 100-year history, although it still trails Airbus's upgraded A320neo family, which benefited from an earlier market debut. Wojick also landed the largest sale in U.S. aviation history: Emirates Airline's $76 billion order for 150 of Boeing's 777X jetliners in 2013. He joined Boeing in 1980 as an aerospace engineer before earning an MBA from the University of Colorado in 1985. Wojick held a variety of positions within Boeing's sales organization, overseeing its marketing in North America, the Asia-Pacific region, India and elsewhere before succeeding Conner as senior vice president for global sales and marketing in August 2012. He holds a private pilot's license and is the son of a U.S. Air Force and United Airlines pilot. Mounir's promotion caps a rapid rise at Boeing, which he joined in 1997 as a senior aerodynamics engineer. The Moroccan native didn't speak English when he arrived alone in the U.S. at age 17, according to a 2014 profile in the Seattle Times. After landing a conditional acceptance to Wichita State University to study aerospace engineering, Mounir, who is fluent in Arabic, French and Spanish, immediately enrolled in language school. Since 2011, Mounir has dueled with Airbus in China, which is spending heavily on aviation infrastructure and aircraft. His replacement will be announced later, Conner said. "My goal is to beat Airbus in China every year," Mounir told Bloomberg Television, adding that he wasn't content with a 50-50 split of the market. "My goal is to go all the way."

Then check out Verizon Communications, Terra Nitrogen Company LP, and Boeing Co. Tyler Crowe (TMFDirtyBird) Oct 14, 2016 at 9:34AM Image source: Getty Images. I won't say that investing in dividend stocks is the only way to build wealth in the stock market, but it is a pretty good way to do it. For investors out there who have a very, very long investment time horizon, buying, holding, and letting dividends reinvest themselves can create significant gains. If you are looking for some solid dividend investments that fit a buy-and-hold mentality, maybe you should check out Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), Terra Nitrogen Company LP (NYSE:TNH), and Boeing (NYSE:BA). Here's a quick rundown of each of these stocks and why it could make for a compelling long-term dividend investment.  Delivering data and dividends Let's face it, data, and the need to access it at any given moment, has solidly entrenched itself into our lives. Between increased use of data on smartphones and other mobile devices, and cord-cutters relying more on their internet connections for entertainment than on traditional TV packages, there is still an immense opportunity for even the largest communications providers. When a company has the pricing power that Verizon Communications sports, it can make for an extremely compelling investment. Despite the fact that some of Verizon's smaller wireless competitors are starting to offer incentives such as unlimited data plans, Verizon continues to have the lowest churn rate among all the major wireless carriers. This kind of sticky business model, combined with its even stickier wired FiOS business, has been a major factor in making Verizon a cash cow. Last quarter alone, the company generated $5.4 billion in cash from operations. It's not exactly cheap to remain the top communications provider in the U.S., however: The company has spent more than $7 billion in the first half of 2016 on capital expenditures.  Having the ability to spend that much on its network, though, is what makes Verizon a compelling investment for the years to come. It's extremely unlikely that data usage would go down, and a robust network infrastructure coupled with strong pricing power should give Verizon a major growth platform for several years to come and further support its dividend that yields 4.6% today. If you only want a dividend If you are interested in just dividends and aren't concerned with rapid dividend growth, then perhaps it's worth taking a look at Terra Nitrogen Company. It consists entirely of one nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility, so there isn't much growth baked into the investment thesis for this company. What makes it compelling, though, is its ability to generate lots of cash that it pays out to its unitholders.  There are two things that work in Terra Nitrogen's favor in this regard. One is that the company is one of the lowest-cost producers of nitrogen fertilizers. Even though fertilizer prices are at their lowest level in a decade, Terra Nitrogen is still generating a 56% gross margin on its combined ammonia and urea sales. This advantage should work in its favor as many more-expensive fertilizer producers get squeezed out of the market.  The other big advantage is the way the business is structured. It's a variable-rate master limited partnership, so it pays out all available cash at the end of each quarter. With no long-term debt on the books, all of the cash generated each quarter goes toward some small maintenance capital needs or into investors' pockets. With such a high yield and little in terms of production growth in the future, all of the gains on an investment in Terra Nitrogen will come from those quarterly distributions. With a yield today of 9.1% and a good chance that prices of nitrogen-based fertilizers will rise over time, Terra Nitrogen looks to be a compelling dividend investment.  A payout that still has a chance to soar Two big knocks on Boeing today are that total commercial aircraft orders may not be as robust as they have been over the past couple of years and that some of the aircraft maker's most profitable plans over the years -- most notably the 777 -- are in a decline that its expensive 787 Dreamliner will have to make up for. Based on these two points, you can see why some investors might be concerned. If you look beyond these factors, though, there are reasons to believe that this company still has plenty of opportunities to grow its bottom line and payout to shareholders. Let's start with orders for new planes drying up. That is certainly true, especially in the case for older planes such as the 747. One look at the company's current backlog, though, and you can see that Boeing has plenty of work ahead of it over the years that it can handle a decline in orders for a while. Its backlog for the 737 alone is enough for the company to grow its production from 42 planes a month today to 57 planes a month in 2019 and still have plenty of work left over. It also helps that over this time frame, its 787 Dreamliner will increase production and start to recover the cash losses from its earlier deliveries. These two drivers should help to more than make up for the declines in its other planes and will even give the company a cushion until it starts delivering its 777 replacement, the 777X.  This gives the company a runway of more than half a decade. By then, it's not hard to imagine another wave of plane orders coming in. In the meantime, those fulfilled orders will generate loads of cash that will give Boeing the ability to grow its already impressive payout that yields 3.2% today.  Tyler Crowe owns shares of Terra Nitrogen.

Then check out Verizon Communications, Terra Nitrogen Company LP, and Boeing Co. Tyler Crowe (TMFDirtyBird) Oct 14, 2016 at 9:34AM Image source: Getty Images. I won't say that investing in dividend stocks is the only way to build wealth in the stock market, but it is a pretty good way to do it. For investors out there who have a very, very long investment time horizon, buying, holding, and letting dividends reinvest themselves can create significant gains. If you are looking for some solid dividend investments that fit a buy-and-hold mentality, maybe you should check out Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), Terra Nitrogen Company LP (NYSE:TNH), and Boeing (NYSE:BA). Here's a quick rundown of each of these stocks and why it could make for a compelling long-term dividend investment.  Delivering data and dividends Let's face it, data, and the need to access it at any given moment, has solidly entrenched itself into our lives. Between increased use of data on smartphones and other mobile devices, and cord-cutters relying more on their internet connections for entertainment than on traditional TV packages, there is still an immense opportunity for even the largest communications providers. When a company has the pricing power that Verizon Communications sports, it can make for an extremely compelling investment. Despite the fact that some of Verizon's smaller wireless competitors are starting to offer incentives such as unlimited data plans, Verizon continues to have the lowest churn rate among all the major wireless carriers. This kind of sticky business model, combined with its even stickier wired FiOS business, has been a major factor in making Verizon a cash cow. Last quarter alone, the company generated $5.4 billion in cash from operations. It's not exactly cheap to remain the top communications provider in the U.S., however: The company has spent more than $7 billion in the first half of 2016 on capital expenditures.  Having the ability to spend that much on its network, though, is what makes Verizon a compelling investment for the years to come. It's extremely unlikely that data usage would go down, and a robust network infrastructure coupled with strong pricing power should give Verizon a major growth platform for several years to come and further support its dividend that yields 4.6% today. If you only want a dividend If you are interested in just dividends and aren't concerned with rapid dividend growth, then perhaps it's worth taking a look at Terra Nitrogen Company. It consists entirely of one nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility, so there isn't much growth baked into the investment thesis for this company. What makes it compelling, though, is its ability to generate lots of cash that it pays out to its unitholders.  There are two things that work in Terra Nitrogen's favor in this regard. One is that the company is one of the lowest-cost producers of nitrogen fertilizers. Even though fertilizer prices are at their lowest level in a decade, Terra Nitrogen is still generating a 56% gross margin on its combined ammonia and urea sales. This advantage should work in its favor as many more-expensive fertilizer producers get squeezed out of the market.  The other big advantage is the way the business is structured. It's a variable-rate master limited partnership, so it pays out all available cash at the end of each quarter. With no long-term debt on the books, all of the cash generated each quarter goes toward some small maintenance capital needs or into investors' pockets. With such a high yield and little in terms of production growth in the future, all of the gains on an investment in Terra Nitrogen will come from those quarterly distributions. With a yield today of 9.1% and a good chance that prices of nitrogen-based fertilizers will rise over time, Terra Nitrogen looks to be a compelling dividend investment.  A payout that still has a chance to soar Two big knocks on Boeing today are that total commercial aircraft orders may not be as robust as they have been over the past couple of years and that some of the aircraft maker's most profitable plans over the years -- most notably the 777 -- are in a decline that its expensive 787 Dreamliner will have to make up for.

Monday, 14 November 2016 اردو Türkçe العربیة فارسی Toggle navigation TASNIM NEWS .com Home All Stories Politics Economy World Defense Nuclear Society/Culture Science Sports Tourism Other Media Photos Interview US, Japanese Banks to Fund Boeing Sales to Iran News ID: 1211744 Service: Economy October, 14, 2016 - 17:44 TEHRAN (Tasnim) – US plane manufacturer Boeing has reached an agreement with an American bank to provide financing for Iran’s purchase of airliners in cooperation with a Japanese bank, an informed source announced. The informed source at Iran’s government said according to an agreement between Boeing and a US bank, the purchase of the civil aircraft will be financed via a Japanese bank. The comments came after the US decided in September to remove a final hurdle for Western aircraft manufacturers to sell planes to Iran under contracts signed after coming into force of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a nuclear agreement between Tehran and the group of six countries. In January, Iran signed a major contract with Airbus worth about $27 billion to buy 118 planes. The contract was signed during the visit to Paris by Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani. Iran also sealed a deal in June worth around $25 billion with the US aerospace heavyweight, Boeing, for the purchase of 100 passenger planes.

Hyderabad: Low frills carrier SpiceJet today said it is planning to add about three Bombardiers and 4 to 5 Boeings by the end of the current fiscal as it wants to increase its daily flights by 10 per cent and also introduce new international destinations. "We have 17 planes for regional connectivity. Spicejet is a major player in regional connectivity space. Few weeks back, we have added three Bombardiers. We will be adding three more in the current financial year," Ajay Singh CMD of SpiceJet told reporters on the sidelines of a Ficci Ladies Organisation programme here today. "We will be adding 4 or 5 aircraft this year. They will mostly be Boeings," he said. Currently, SpiceJet is having a fleet of 43 aircraft operating 320 flights a day. Replying to a query, Singh said within next few weeks they will be adding 2 to 3 international destinations. Currently, it operates to six countries. "We are flying to six countries as of now. We are looking at more options. In the next few weeks, we will announce some more routes. We will be announcing two to three destinations more. Our strategy is to operate in 4 hour-window journey," he said. On its proposed order, the CMD said they are talking to both Airbus and Boeing for placing an order of over 100 aircraft. The deal will be finalised in a month, he said, adding that the whole order will either go to Boeing or Airbus. "We are going to finalise in a month. It will be either Boeing or Airbus. We will not be rushed into a decision. It will not be mix of both. It has to be done at right price. So, we have to be very careful. We have closed many issues related to aircraft purchase. It could be more than 100 aircraft," he said. He said the budget airline is also mulling to operate flights from Hyderabad to Tier-II cities like Nagpur, Calicut and Bhubaneswar. The Airline has continuously been making profits for the few quarters on the back of operational efficiency, he claimed.

By Mary-Ann Russon October 14, 2016 12:59 BST Close Embed Feed EmDrive Exclusive: Roger Shawyer confirms MoD and DoD are interested in controversial space propulsion tech IBTimes UK <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/21144" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> EmDrive inventor Roger Shawyer has confirmed that the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the US Department of Defense (DoD) are both interested in the controversial space propulsion technology, in an exclusive new interview with IBTimes UK. "Yes, the UK MoD and the US DoD are interested in EmDrive. It would clearly be useful for any intelligence-gathering platform. It provides good manoeuvrability and stealth orbits to be maintained... clearly EmDrive has no exhaust signature and is very stealthy," said Shawyer. While he cannot say much on this topic, Shawyer indicated that the EmDrive's controversial reputation and ridicule on the internet serves a key purpose for the UK and US military – if it is actually possible to create a propellant-less rocket engine, then this would be really useful in spy satellites, as it would enable the military to get close to a target without anyone knowing it was there. Shawyer, 69, is a certified chartered electrical engineer who spent 40 years working in the space and defence industry on UK government defence contracts, primarily for BAE Systems and Matra Marconi Space (MMS, now Airbus). During his career, he was a senior engineer and project manager for multiple satellite contracts including the Skynet 4 military satellite, the NATO-4 satellite serving Nato and the British Ministry of Defence, and the French Euteselat Hot Bird TV broadcast satellite. Shawyer explains that he was inspired to use a gyroscope to create an electromagnetic thruster after watching Professor Eric Laithwaite's 1974 Christmas lecture at the Royal Institution. He experimented with the concept in the 1980s in his garage and then told his employers at MMS, but his idea was rejected outright – and was told that his career would suffer if he mentioned it again. Eventually he was told MMS was unwilling to consider any new propulsion concepts for another decade due to the firm's investment into the Arianne 5 heavy lift launch vehicle, and so in 2001 Shawyer left MMS and decided to go it alone, setting up Satellite Propulsion Research Ltd (SPR). Interest from the UK government, US Air Force, Nasa and Darpa The full uncut version of the EmDrive video interview with Roger Shawyer, which is 20 minutes long and explores his life and other interesting facts about the EmDrive story SPR was awarded a grant from the UK government to continue to research the EmDrive for five years from its beginnings as a feasibility study, right up through the first experimental thruster and to the eventual demonstrator engine, which produced up to 8g of thrust. And despite the furore of the New Scientist article in September 2006, which saw a huge backlash from members of the public as well as academics in the international space community, and the fact that a group of naysayers persuaded a British MP to ask in Parliamentary Questions why the EmDrive was being funded, the UK government continued to fund the research until its completion in 2007. There was also a huge interest in the technology in the US – in 2008, Shawyer was invited to the Pentagon to make a high level presentation on the EmDrive technology to members of the US Air Force, Nasa and Darpa, and following this presentation, Boeing stepped in and asked to licence the technology. "The UK MoD agreed to an export licence, and we designed, built and tested a Flight Thruster for use on a test satellite. The thruster gave 18 grams of thrust," said Shawyer. "All design data was transferred to Boeing and the contract was completed by July 2010. We waited for them to sign the licence agreement, which had been prepared by Boeing's lawyers and agreed by SPR. However, once we confirmed the test data it all suddenly went quiet, and we have heard no more from Boeing since then." Working with Gilo Industries Shawyer has continued to develop the EmDrive, and over the last year began hinting that he is working with an unnamed UK aerospace company on a second generation superconducting thruster that will produce thrust many orders of magnitude greater than that observed by Eagleworks or any other laboratory (view his latest patent application here). However, he has confirmed that the company he is working with is none other than Gilo Industries Group, the inventors of the personal aviation paramotor vehicle Parajet Skycar, which famously flew TV survivalist Bear Grylls close to Mount Everest in 2007 and is now being developed as an all-terrain flying car. "Gilo Cardozo approached me. I confirm that we are in a joint venture. Universal Propulsion is the name of the joint venture and it's located in Dorset," said Shawyer. "It's a very innovative, modern young company. He has an excellent track record. He employs professional scientists and engineers who reviewed the science of the EmDrive. Like many people who don't say much, these guys go through it very carefully. Gilo has the engineering expertise and resources to do this, so it's a good match between us." Shawyer says that he's not interested in fame the way entrepreneurs like Elon Musk are, but he never expected to receive the amount of personal abuse he was subjected to for a mere invention. "Some insults still appear on forums, but I have got immune to it now. There are some very strange people out there on the internet," he said, emphasising that he intends to keep going with developing the EmDrive so it can be used in flying cars and to make low cost access to space possible. "I don't think engineers become superstars, particularly not in the UK. We just quietly get on, having fun and enjoying our job, whilst trying to make the world a safer and better place."

Photos by Katherine Frey/The Washington Post   Matt and Ann MacPhail built a state-of-the-art recording studio in their home basement in Arlington, Virginia.; they call it Undisclosed Location Studios.   Matt and Ann MacPhail pose with their piano in their living room, which also can be used for recording.   Guitars hang on one wall of the studio.   By Michele Lerner Special to The Washington Post Washington, D.C., and its suburbs are well known as a setting for spies, clandestine meetings and hidden safe rooms for the powerful, and now a new secret has been revealed: Undisclosed Location Studios, a state-of-the-art recording studio, is hiding in an Arlington, Virginia, basement. "We can't claim to have invented the joke about being in an undisclosed location, but we like the tongue-in-cheek reference to being near D.C. and the Pentagon and at the same time to refer to the fact that no one can drive by our house and know that it has a recording studio inside," says Matt MacPhail, who owns News at Eleven Productions, an audio-production business, with his wife, Ann MacPhail. The MacPhails' Queen Anne-style Victorian home, designed to fit in with the neighborhood and reminiscent of nearby Victorian homes, includes a home theater for professional and personal use as well as a recording studio with a control room and three isolation booths, all completely invisible to outsiders. While that invisibility is intentional, it deprives local residents of being able to point to the new cool thing in the neighborhood: a studio designed by the architect who designed Jimi Hendrix's Electric Lady Studios in Greenwich Village, which was pioneering as a musician-owned recording studio. "Recording studios in homes have become pretty common since digitalization allows equipment to be less expensive and smaller," says John Storyk, founding partner of WSDG-Walters-Storyk Design Group in Highland, New York. "While there are thousands of them across the country now, very few are at the professional level of the MacPhails' studio." Storyk says the acoustical accuracy of the MacPhails' studio is exceptional. The couple have always had some type of recording system in their home and have been producing music and voice-overs for nearly 20 years. "Matt and I met in 1996 as founding members of the SoCal Vocals, a rock a cappella group at the University of Southern California," Ann MacPhail says. "They are the only four-time champions of the ICCA [International Collegiate Championship of A Cappella]. The experience of recording an album with the SoCal Vocals sparked our interest in audio production." Among the MacPhails' clients are IBM, MasterCard, Boeing and Bank of the West. "A big part of our business now is audio for video, so it helps to have the home theater connected to the recording studio when we work on sound design for a documentary or narrate an employee safety video for Boeing," Ann MacPhail says. While none of that sounds quite as cool as recording Hendrix or jamming with the Rolling Stones, some of the essential elements of the recording-studio design are the same for Hendrix and the MacPhails, including fully decoupled, room-within-a-room construction and a custom-designed ceiling with varied heights. One of the innovations of Electric Lady Studios was the use of lighting for mood in keeping with the psychedelia in which Hendrix was interested and to make the studio feel less sterile and closer to the live experience for performers. That recording studio, like the MacPhails' and most other studios today, was intended to encourage creativity and artistry. "The democratization of recording studios means that artists have more control over their own work," Matt MacPhail says. "Hendrix was one of the first artists to own his own creative space, but there are challenges in designing a recording studio. Acoustic isolation requires a tight seal, so you can't always get the ventilation you need. Now we have ventilation, and even if we turn on the air conditioning, it's quiet enough that we don't pick up any sound on our recordings." The subbasement includes a studio reception room for clients, the isolation booths and control room, along with an elevator and stairs to the basement level, which has a separate entry for clients, a full bathroom and the theater. "Because this is our house as well as our workspace, we worked with the designer to have two entrances into the theater, so that clients never have to walk through the residential part of the house," Ann says. In addition to the theater, the basement level has family spaces, including a recreation room, access to the garage, storage closets and another full bathroom. The entire house has approximately 5,400 finished square feet, with purely residential functions on the first and second floors. Getting started Matt MacPhail attended Georgetown University and worked at WETA-FM for a few years and always intended to return to the D.C. area after graduate school in California. The couple decided to relocate to the region a few years ago to be close to friends and to raise their children, Gabriel, 12, and Lucas, 10, here. The couple spent seven months searching for an appropriate site for their home. They have lived in it for about four years but only recently have rededicated their time to their recording business. "Our focus was first on the residential aspect of our home and second on the studio, but from the very beginning, we worked with the recording-studio designers and our architects to make sure everything worked together," Matt says. In their previous home, Ann says, clients had to step over the toys and walk through the kitchen to get to the professional area, so the couple planned for a dedicated entrance for when clients occasionally came to the studio. "We wanted a theater but weren't sure whether it was family space or professional space," Ann says. "It's actually worked out to be both. We use it for work, but we also had 'Downton Abbey' watch parties and [watched] the Olympics with our sons. It's a fun social space." The MacPhails enjoy playing music and singing with friends in their great room, which has space for a grand piano. The great room has been designed for enhanced acoustics and has microphone and data lines linked to the recording studio in case the MacPhails want to record the spontaneity. "We've enjoyed entertaining in the house because the open floor plan makes it so easy," Ann says. "We held a '70s-themed fundraiser for our kids' school and even set up a 'Not-So-Newlywed' game with Matt dressed up like Bob Eubanks, and [had] a disco ball and laser lights. The next year, we had an '80s fundraiser, and Matt built a console with working buttons to replicate 'Family Feud.' He dressed up like Richard Dawson for that one." The MacPhail boys enjoy using the recording studio equipment for karaoke, and the couple donated a two-hour recording studio session as an auction item for a fundraiser. "We love using our space for community-building events and love that this is such a socially active neighborhood," Ann says. Design team The MacPhails' residential architects, John and Marilyn Burroughs, principals of New Leaf Collaborative Architecture and Design in Ashburn, Virginia., collaborated closely with Storyk and his team from the very beginning of the project. "Getting in on the master planning level helped make this a success," Storyk says. "We did the architectural design for the basement and subbasement, but the challenge here was that it's a very tight site. We had to piggyback the studio and the home theater and the multipurpose space on top of each other." The MacPhails wanted three small isolation booths, so that was another challenge, says Storyk, who says it's easier to control sound in a bigger room than in the series of smaller rooms. Storyk says that while being underground helps maintain acoustic isolation, not all recording studios are in basements. "People want privacy, but they also want sunlight, and we can easily use glass to create sound isolation," Storyk says. "But daylight isn't an asset for a professional theater, so it was easier to design that underground." Storyk says Matt is an expert in lighting design, so he created a low-voltage LED lighting system that can be adjusted and programmed. The lighting can be set to automatically mimic the time of day. "We deliberately designed the architecture of the studio and home theater to be different from the rest of the house, to be more neutral, since these are professional work spaces," Storyk says. Ann had photos and ideas of what she wanted, with a definite desire for a Victorian house with a front porch on the outside but a modern feel inside, Marilyn Burroughs says. "The exposed beam ceiling, arches and traditional cabinets in the kitchen warm up the contemporary open floor plan," she says. The most dramatic feature of the residential portion of the building is the great room, which the Burroughses designed with a 22-foot-high vaulted ceiling similar to a church nave. "I literally drew what I wanted on a napkin for the great room, and it came out even better than expected," Ann says. "I wanted to be able to see everyone from the kitchen, but I also wanted the space to be both elegant and warm." The ceiling has exposed timber trusses, and the room has a sliding glass "NanaWall" partition to separate it from the kitchen, which is open to a dining alcove in a bay window. Outside the kitchen and dining area is a screened porch. "Ann wanted the great room to be capable for making recordings, but she still wanted the open floor plan for entertaining, so the NanaWall was perfect for that," Marilyn Burroughs says. The first floor also has a guest bedroom and bathroom with universal design features such as a curb-less shower, which John Burroughs refers to as the "backup master suite" in case one of the residents needs to live on one level. This level also has an office with a storage closet. An elevator reaches all four levels of the home -- from the subbasement to the bedroom level on the second floor. The second floor has a master suite with a balcony, a walk-in closet and private bathroom; two more bedrooms, each with a walk-in closet and private full bathroom, and a laundry room. Efficient focus While the MacPhails' priorities included comfortable living space for their family, room to entertain and space for their business, they also were committed to using sustainable, efficient building techniques. They recycled every part of the house that had been on the lot before theirs. "The MacPhails wanted to do the right thing throughout the project and to have a minimal impact on the environment," John Burroughs says. The home has two cisterns to collect rain water and to collect water from the sump pump. "We have a rain garden and permeable pavers to help us conserve water," Matt says. "We use the water from our cisterns for landscaping, and we hope to use it as gray water in our home in the future." The home was designed to maximize the benefits of a tighter envelope and insulation and natural light. Solar panels generate electricity on-site, and a separate solar hot-water system provides radiant floor heating as well as for domestic use. Energy-efficient appliances and systems are in place, and the whole home is controlled by a smart home-management system. Working with professional architects for each of the dual purposes of their home resulted in the MacPhails' getting exactly what they wanted: a family-oriented home in a friendly neighborhood along with a secret, high-caliber recording studio so they can seamlessly move between their private and professional lives.

WALLOPS ISLAND (USA), (Sputnik) — General Director Igor Arbuzov told RIA Novosti on Friday the first unmanned test launch of the heavy-lift Atlas V vehicle with Boeing's Crew Transportation System (CTS) capsule is expected in 2017. The Atlas V CST's manned test launch is expected in 2018, he added. "The crew had already been selected and is being trained. It was determined that the Atlas V manned program will be implemented using the Russian RD-180 engines," Arbuzov said. He pointed out that the RD-180's and Atlas V's tried and tested performance gives confidence that manned launches could take place within specific time frames. "Moreover, one can say with confidence that no other engine in the world except the RD-180 is ready for manned launches as part of the Atlas V rocket," the Energomash director stressed. US Launch Operator to Buy 10-20 Russian RD-180 Space Rocket Engines © Photo: Pixabay Next Small Step & Giant Leap: United States to Send Humans to Mars by 2030The United Launch Alliance (ULA) operator plans to purchase 10-20 of Russia's RD-180 space rocket engines, the Energomash space and rocket engine director said. Arbuzov expressed confidence to RIA Novosti that the new contract could be signed after the November 8 presidential elections in the United States. "Not only do I expected it, but I am certain that this will happen. Even the currently available supply of Russian engines in the US does not fully meet its needs under the developing 2020-2023 program," Arbuzov said. © Flickr/ Official U.S. Navy Page Dropping Russia's RD-180 Engines is Like 'Burning $100 Mln for Fun'Washington itself concedes that its gradual transformation from the Atlas V launcher to the Vulcan vehicle using the domestically produced BE-4 engines could stretch into 2024, he added. Asked if ULA had made a commercial offer for the RD-180 engines, Arbuzov said he discussed it with the joint venture's CEO Tory Bruno, who he said had made "optimistic statements" about the purchase. Russian Space Bureau to Deliver 14 RD-181 Rocket Engines to US Manufacturer in 2017-18 Energomash will deliver 14 RD-181 engines to the US Orbital ATK aerospace and defense industry company over the next two years, Arbuzov said. "According to the signed contract, we are required to deliver 14 engines from 2017 to 2018. I do not think there will be any replacements in favor of other engines, the time for experiments has expired and no alternatives have been found," he told RIA Novosti. Orbital ATK's Antares vehicle equipped with two RD-181 first stage engines is expected to send the Cygnus spacecraft to the International Space Station on October 16 after numerous delays. ...

Home Issues Experts Newsletters & Trading Services Login A Most Unlikely Stock for the ‘War on Terror’ Posted on October 13, 2016 by Brad Hoppmann When you think of companies (and the stocks to own) that are directly involved in the West’s war on radical Islamic terror, you tend to think of companies in the defense and aerospace industries. Giant defense contractors such as Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) make the fighter jets that steal all of the dramatic battlefront headlines, as they rain smart bombs down on ISIS strongholds in places such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. Yet in this asymmetric war of ideas, the real battles are being fought in the hearts and minds of people around the world. To wage that war, you have to go where the recruitment and the access to those ideas reside … and that means you have to go on social media platforms such as Twitter (TWTR) and Facebook (FB). Fortunately, both Twitter and Facebook increasingly realize that they play a key role in this fight. And both have recently stepped up their efforts to get rid of members and platforms advocating dangerous extremist ideologies. According to a story at the excellent website Quartz.com: Twitter has become bullish on deleting terrorist accounts in recent months, and now it seems Facebook is ramping up its strategy to prune extremists from its platform. As evidence of Facebook’s intent to do just that, the Quartz story goes on to report verbiage from a "help wanted" post from the social networking giant for what FB calls a “Counterterrorism Researcher.” The job is basically a sort of cyber sleuth whose job will be to figure out how terrorists are using the social media site, and how to shut them down quickly. Here’s the text of the post as reported by Quartz: “The candidate will be responsible for helping drive our efforts around identifying the latest tools, tactics, and infrastructure used by terrorist actors as they affect Facebook and its ecosystems to better defend against and disrupt these threats.” Before I go any further, I’d like to stop here and thank Facebook for this effort. It shows that the social media giant knows it has a vested interest in maintaining a rational, free-idea zone … but that those ideas, when physically threatening and/or violent, are a threat to free ideas and free minds everywhere. Now, some may argue that, for Facebook, it is more than just a realization of the role it plays in safeguarding a free society that’s the real motivation. That may indeed be true — especially when you consider that, just last month, Facebook helped the Israeli government to take down what that government identified as “terrorist content.” Yet that help only came after the Israeli police minister accused Facebook of essentially enabling Palestinian violence via the failure to monitor and shut down the terrorist group Hamas. In fact, the move by Facebook may also have been at least partly in response to a $1 billion lawsuit filed against the company by Israeli and U.S. lawyers. That lawsuit claims the social network allowed Hamas to conduct an attack that left five Americans dead. According the Quartz story: Upon announcing the September partnership, Facebook claims to have taken down 95% of the content flagged by the Israeli government. So, did FB take that action as a result of a realization that freedom requires vigilant monitoring of terrorist groups? Or, did they take that action to avoid litigation of the sort brought in the Hamas case? Or, is it a combination of both? The answer isn’t really clear, nor does it have to be. The fact that they are doing the right thing now by stepping up their efforts to combat dangerous ideas is, in my view, laudable and deserving of acknowledgement and respect. It’s also just another reason why investors continue to bid FB shares higher, having pushed the stock to a one-year gain of more than 35%. And it shows in no uncertain terms why this "FANG" (e.g., Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) stock has the chops to keep going up. *** What’s your take on social media stocks, and Facebook’s renewed efforts, in the fight against radical Islamic terror? Are you encouraged, or are you skeptical? Or, do you think that you will have to start worrying about what you write on social media, with so many eyes watching? Write in and tell me by leaving me a comment on our website or by sending me an e-mail. *** Stocks fell during Thursday’s session, but managed to recoup most of the losses to close just below the flat line. The Dow closed 0.2% lower as traders continued to ponder the Federal Reserve’s next move. • Jobless claims are at a 43-year low, according to the Labor Department. This statistic may just become the icing on the cake for an increasingly expected December interest-rate hike. • Delta (DAL) flew 1.9% higher today, after reporting Q3 earnings. Revenues came in at $10.5B and earnings-per-share came in at $1.70. However, that revenue number was 5.6% higher in the year-ago quarter. • Wells Fargo (WFC) shares gained 2% in after-hours trading yesterday on news that John Stumpf was stepping down. However, the euphoria that he would be replaced effective immediately by Tim Sloan as CEO and Stephen Sanger as chairman didn’t last today. WFC fell 1.3%. Good luck and happy investing, Brad Hoppmann Publisher Uncommon Wisdom Daily Your thoughts on “A Most Unlikely Stock for the ‘War on Terror’” Joe says: October 14, 2016 at 4:37 am The dominant players in social media (Facebook, Twitter) have allowed pro-ISIS and radical Islamic tweets and posts to go unchecked and unpunished, while suspending the accounts of those who advocate for opposing radical Islam, and supporting traditional values, traditional marriage, Judeo-Christianity, and the candidacy of Donald Trump. They are left wing censors for the global establishment, nothing more. Reply Schnieders says: October 16, 2016 at 5:02 pm Great job!!!!

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — Boeing's Canadian investment has increased by an average annual rate of almost 8 percent, or four times that of Canada’s economic growth, according to the release. "Boeing contributes more than $3 billion annually to Canada’s economic growth and development, according to a study commissioned by the company," the release stated. In September, Boeing proposed its F/A-18 Super Hornet for a planned replacement by Canada’s military of the country’s CF-18 fighter aircraft. ...

Crunch Network Los Angeles is a transportation tech powerhouse Posted Oct 13, 2016 by Eric Pakravan (@epakravan) 0 SHARES Next Story Hyperloop One gains $50 million in funding from DP World Group of Dubai Eric Pakravan Crunch Network Contributor Eric Pakravan is a senior associate at Amplify.LA. How to join the network Los Angeles is famous for two things: entertainment and traffic. Back in the 1950s, any association with “stars” and “cars” would be the envy of any modern city. But today, that’s sometimes overshadowed by images of aggressive paparazzi and gridlocked freeways. Thankfully, over the last five years, the emergence of big content-centric startups like Maker Studios, Hulu and even Snapchat has shown that LA can embrace its Hollywood DNA to fuel its burgeoning tech scene. But when it comes to transportation, there might be more to LA than just bloated commute times. Intrinsically, anyone from LA knows that we spend far too much time thinking and talking about traffic (if you haven’t seen SNL’s rendition of “The Californians,” that should give you an idea). In a normal city, weather is a standard conversation starter. But in a city with 329 days of sunshine, conversations here naturally begin instead with a serious discussion about traffic and commute schedules. All that discussion of gridlock may make it seem like we don’t have our act together when it comes to transportation. But if that’s the case, why did Elon Musk choose to build his Mars-chasing SpaceX in LA? Or why did Bay Area-based Shervin Pishevar choose downtown LA for the HQ of Hyperloop One? And why did Chinese giant LeEco choose sunny Southern California as the home for their ambitious electric self-driving car company, Faraday Future? Simple: LA is a powerhouse in transportation technology. This isn’t a new development, either. LA has been a leading transportation technology center for decades. Since the Lockheed Corporation made its home in Burbank in 1928 (as it happens, the same year Warner Bros. moved its studios to Burbank), LA has been consistently churning out new, transformative modes of transportation. The first space shuttle was built in LA county, as were all four of NASA’s Mars Rovers. For a time, Boeing was Southern California’s largest employer. And NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena actually predates NASA itself. When JPL was established next to Caltech in 1936, it was already developing next-gen rocket launchers and early lunar landers. Only after NASA was formed by Eisenhower in 1958 did JPL transfer to NASA’s control. Today, JPL is most well-known for building and managing NASA’s fleet of Mars Rovers, and it funnels talent to Elon Musk’s SpaceX. It’s no surprise that prominent engineers, investors and entrepreneurs are proactively building their transportation ventures in LA. Southern California’s engineering talent continues to be the leading factor for LA’s continued success in delivering bleeding-edge transportation tech. Even with early LA mainstays like Boeing, Lockheed and Northrop Grumman moving the bulk of their manufacturing divisions outside of California to states with lower labor costs, all three continue to maintain sizable engineering departments in Southern California. Not only that, but the LA area’s nine engineering schools, including those at Caltech, USC, UCLA and Harvey Mudd, continue to graduate top-quality talent for companies like SpaceX, Boeing and, now, Hyperloop One. In fact, LA graduates more engineers than any other U.S. metro area. That statistic is referenced freely by LA’s startup community in an effort to encourage more LA-based software startups. While that statistic is often taken to mean that LA graduates a lot of programmers (which it does), in reality, a large portion of those engineers are also your PhD-level aerospace engineers, graduate-level electrical engineers and Caltech mechanical engineering grads. Not exactly your stereotypical programmer, right? But it’s exactly those engineers you need to build next-generation modes of transportation, and LA has no shortage of them. Even beyond Hyperloops and aerospace, the strength of LA’s university system continues to lead the way in bringing new edge-case transportation solutions to market. Case in point, TallyGo, an LA-based real-time navigation startup, was spun out of technology originally developed in-house at USC’s IMSC institute. The company has since raised millions in funding from local investors and is now taking on mapping giants like Waze, Google and Apple Maps. Related Articles Hyperloop Technologies becomes Hyperloop One, pulls in $80 million and announces global partners How To Expand Your Marketplace To LA What Los Angeles Is Missing And, believe it or not, LA even leads the nation in traffic mitigation; in 2012, LA was the first major city to sync all its traffic lights. That technology has increased the speed of traffic by 16 percent, reduced travel times in the city by 12 percent and, like a scene out of Fast & Furious, can be used to automatically reprioritize key travel lanes in times of emergency. With such a strong foundation, it’s no surprise that prominent engineers, investors and entrepreneurs are proactively building their transportation ventures in LA. In the not too distant future, self-driving cars from Google, Uber, Tesla or LA’s Faraday Future may eliminate the city’s traffic woes. Hyperloop One could eliminate travel time between LA, SF, Vegas, San Diego and Phoenix. And one day, you might even be able to hitch a first-class ride to Mars — courtesy of LA-native, Elon Musk.

Finance Search Mon, Nov 14, 2016, 6:27 PM AEDT - Australia Markets closed Brazil's Embraer 'close' to deal to end US graft caseAFP – Thu, Oct 13, 2016 5:25 PM AEDT Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo Embraer, the world's third-largest commercial plane-maker after Boeing and Airbus, is under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations it violated anti-corruption regulations in sales outside Brazil Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer's stock rose Thursday after the company said it was "close" to a deal with US authorities to settle corruption allegations that have dogged it since 2010. Embraer, the world's third-largest commercial plane-maker after Boeing and Airbus, is under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations it violated anti-corruption regulations in sales outside Brazil. The company "is looking to finalize definitive agreements with the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States to resolve the allegations," it said in a statement released Wednesday. It is also in talks with Brazilian authorities to settle a local investigation, it said. Embraer's stock rose more than three percent on the New York stock exchange and 1.5 percent in Sao Paulo Thursday morning. The international corruption probe was opened after officials in the Dominican Republic allegedly accepted a $3.5 million bribe to buy eight of Embraer's Super Tucano military planes. Former Dominican defense minister Rafael Pena Antonio and three other people were arrested in August in the case. Embraer said it would give details on the settlement deals once they were complete. The company had set aside $200 million in the second quarter to settle the allegations. That helped push it into the red as it lost nearly $100 million for the quarter amid falling demand for executive jets. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Gerry Harvey rounds on 'short-sellers'AAP Gerry Harvey claims gripes over Harvey Norman's accounting methods originate from short-sellers trying to drive … Shorten, PM at odds over jobs outlookAAP Harvey blasts share plotters over rumoursAAP Underground rail to link CBD to ParramattaAAP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7548 +0.0007 +0.10% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.6020 +0.0031 +0.52% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.6992 +0.0036 +0.52% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Robert Vaughn Toyota AU US refugee Gumtree Four Nations Perth Accommodation Trump protests Car insurance comparison Cecil the Lion Life insurance Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Boeing Starliner Won't Be Taking Astronauts To ISS Until December 2018 Posted: Oct 13 2016, 7:41am CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Latest Science News   Boeing Boeing Company Delays its Starliner Spacecraft Flights with People On Board   The Boeing company has procrastinated its CST-100 Starliner spacecraft flights with people on board for the second time in a row. This is the second time that the Boeing company has delayed its CST-100 Starliner flight. This was the first time that there were supposed to be people on board. Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals These people consisted of the crew that were to operate the spacecraft. This spacecraft had been built for the express purpose of taking NASA astronauts to and back from the ISS.  The Starliner was originally supposed to carry astronauts a year from now. Yet Boeing announced in the sultry month of May this year that it will send astronauts aboard the spacecraft in 2018. That is definitely a change of plan. The goal was mid-2018 yet now it has been even further delayed to December of 2018, according to AviationWeek via The Verge. Now that is a long way off. Boeing has given the reasons behind this delay as production glitches and qualification tests that need to be carried out in the nick of time. Also a production hitch forced Boeing to eliminate an important component of the spacecraft. This consisted of a dome that composed the pressure shell of the crew module.     These flaws and problems forced Boeing to further delay the timeline of the Starliner by about half a year or so. When the issues began to crop up, the administration and staff of Boeing took a pause for thought and decided that they were up against a hindrance or two. They had to do something about it and so the delay was inevitable. This was something which could not be avoided by an ostrich-like head-in-the-sand policy of ignorance.  Other tests still need to be carried out. There is the pad abort test. This has everything to do with crew safety in case of an emergency occurring while the spacecraft is on the launch pad. This test was supposed to occur by October of next year. Yet now it has been postponed to January of 2018. The Starliner spacecraft is NASA’s answer to the Commercial Crew Program. The goal is the switching of American astronauts back within the context of national spacecraft. Currently, the United States is dependent upon Russia’s Soyuz modules for sending its astronauts to the ISS. This trip has a steep price tag since each seat costs $80 million. The US of A is looking forward to the Boeing company to build the Starliner under contract from NASA. This way the United States will once again become autonomous as regards space travel and space exploration.  You May Like The Author Sumayah Aamir Sumayah Aamir (Google+) has deep experience in analyzing the latest trends.     Advertisement Leave a Comment Share this Story Follow Us Read the Latest from I4U News Climate Change: Global Carbon Emissions Remain flat for Third Year 1 hour ago Marijuana Use can Weaken Heart Muscle, Says Study 3 hours ago Hands-on Experience Helps Students to Grasp Concepts Much Better 9 hours ago, 3:53pm CST Neanderthal Helped Humans Adapt to Life outside Africa 12 hours ago, 12:34pm CST Smartphone App helps early Detection of Autism 13 hours ago, 12:19pm CST John Oliver Takes On President Trump in HBO Last Week Tonight 22 minutes ago Best Buy Black Friday Deals on Samsung KS8000 SUHD 4K HDR TVs Sell Early 10 hours ago, 2:27pm CST Walmart Black Friday 2016 Map Release Details 12 hours ago, 1:06pm CST You Can Make Your iPhone Great Again With £3000 Gold-Plated Donald Trump iPhone 7 12 hours ago, 1:02pm CST H&M Launches First Black Friday Collection 12 hours ago, 12:48pm CST Apple To Release 10.9 Inch Bezel-less iPad Pro In 2017 12 hours ago, 12:38pm CST Amazon Launches 12 Day Black Friday Sale Monday in UK 13 hours ago, 12:10pm CST Ghost In The Shell is the New Matrix Movie 14 hours ago, 11:06am CST Cyber Monday 2016 Deals Forced To Change 14 hours ago, 10:43am CST British Red Squirrels Carry Bacteria that Cause Leprosy in Humans 14 hours ago, 10:42am CST Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad Target Black Friday 2016 ad Best Buy Black Friday 2016 ad All Black Friday 2016 ads How to Find Hatchimals Deals Find NES Classic Deals Featured News How to Find NES Classic, Hatchimals, Pokemon Go Plus and New Nintendo 3DS on Black Friday Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad Released   Best Buy Black Friday 2016 Ad Released David Blaine Spits out and Swallows Again Live Frog on Tonight Show Latest Science News Climate Change: Global Carbon Emissions Remain flat for Third Year 1 hour ago Marijuana Use can Weaken Heart Muscle, Says Study 3 hours ago Hands-on Experience Helps Students to Grasp Concepts Much Better 9 hours ago, 3:53pm CST Neanderthal Helped Humans Adapt to Life outside Africa 12 hours ago, 12:34pm CST More Latest Science News Stories Latest News John Oliver Takes On President Trump in HBO Last Week Tonight 22 minutes ago $149.99 40-inch LG 40LH5000 TV Best Buy Black Friday 2016 Doorbuster Deal 48 minutes ago Climate Change: Global Carbon Emissions Remain flat for Third Year 1 hour ago Bon-Ton Black Friday 2016 Ad Leaks 1 hour ago More Latest News The Latest ...

But consumer demand for smaller, longer lasting devices is forcing manufacturers to push the technology, battery experts say, testing the limits of how much energy they can safely pack into smaller spaces. “A battery is really a bomb that releases its energy in a controlled way,” says Qichao Hu, a former researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and founder of SolidEnergy Systems, a battery startup. “There are fundamental safety issues to all batteries, and as you get to higher energy density and faster charge, the barrier to explosion is less and less.” On Tuesday, Samsung Electronics scrapped its flagship Note 7 smartphone and told customers return their devices after weeks of bruising reports of phones igniting and images of scorched handsets. In early September, the world's largest smartphone maker blamed “a very rare manufacturing process error” for the problems. It has said it is still investigating reports of fires in a second, supposedly safe, batch of phones. Exactly what caused the problems will be the subject of detailed studies by regulators, the company and its suppliers. Experts are baffled by what could be causing the overheating in the replacement phones, if not the batteries. Samsung says it would be “premature to speculate” on the outcome of its investigations. Read also: Samsung offers financial help over Note 7 “We are reviewing every step of our engineering, manufacturing and quality control processes,” Samsung said in an emailed response to Reuters. An official at the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards, which is also investigating, said the fault in the replacement devices might not be the same as the problem in the original product. Both Samsung SDI and Amperex Technology, which supply batteries to Samsung Electronics, declined to comment. Samsung's Note 7 crisis may be its biggest, but the problems with lithium-ion are not new. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued recalls for battery packs, snow blowers, hoverboards, flashlights and power recliners in the past year, all because of fires caused by lithium-ion batteries. In 2013, Boeing was forced to ground its entire fleet of advanced 787 jetliners after some lithium-ion batteries caught fire. The fleet was allowed to resume flights after changes were made to the battery and charger, and to better contain battery fires. “We remain confident in the comprehensive improvements made to the 787 battery system following this event, and in the overall performance of the battery system and the safety of the airplane,” Boeing said in 2014 after an investigation into one incident. Light-weight, high-energy Lithium is the lightest of all metals, and can pack a lot of energy into a small volume - making it perfect for batteries. The market has grown from a few hundred million cells in 2000 to 8 billion last year, according to Albemarle, a US chemical company. But for the same reason, lithium-ion batteries need safety mechanisms built in, adding to production costs. And with prices falling 14 percent per year for the past 15 years, according to Albemarle, smaller scale players have scrimped on safety, says Lewis Larsen, CEO of Lattice Energy, a consultancy. There is no evidence Samsung or its battery suppliers cut corners with the Note 7, and Tony Olson, CEO of consultancy D2 Worldwide, said the problem was not limited to cheaper products. Watch He ran tests on batteries in laptops a decade ago, highlighting the dangers of them catching fire. Some 9.6 million Sony Corp laptop batteries were subsequently recalled. But when Olsen repeated the tests on other laptop batteries seven years later he found that “very little had changed in battery safety design, despite being under tremendous scrutiny.” Sony, HP, Toshiba and Panasonic have all recalled laptop battery packs this year over fire hazards, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Panasonic, which supplied the batteries, said the problem was caused by manufacturing issues which it had now resolved. Asked about Samsung's woes last week, Panasonic CEO Kazuhiro Tsuga told reporters lithium ion batteries could become prone to fires when density was raised and fast charging was applied. “It's a trade-off between that (risk) and benefits. We place the biggest priority on safety,” Tsuga said. “With current technologies, it's extremely difficult to make it zero chance of such incidents.” Greater demands Before the era of smartphones, users didn't require much of their device - a few phone calls, a few SMS messages. The phone of today, however, needs to do a lot more, and is in constant use. According to eMarketer, an advertising consultancy, Chinese mobile users, for example, spend nearly twice as long on their smartphone as they did four years ago. This in turn has pushed manufacturers into making their screens bigger and their devices more powerful, packing more energy into smaller spaces. And however sophisticated the materials, “they're not 100 percent safe and they never will be,” said Larsen, the consultant. Read also: Can Samsung bounce back from Note 7 fiasco? “What we're seeing from the standpoint of lithium-ion technology is they're beginning to reach the safe energy density limits of that technology.” But experts are divided on that point. Brandon Ng, whose Hong Kong startup QFE plans to sell refrigerator-sized batteries to replace diesel generators, said there is still room for improvements. “There is still a lot of developmental headroom with lithium-ion batteries in terms of increasing the energy they can store.” Long-promised new technologies to make batteries safer are around the corner. Tim Grejtak, an analyst at Lux Research, said there are dozens of startups working on the issue, but the scientific problems were hard to solve and would take time. Among the most promising candidates, according to Grejtak, is California-based Blue Current, which is working on a high density, low flammable battery using gel electrolytes. Massachusetts-based SolidEnergy Systems is working on a lithium metal battery which founder Hu says takes up half the space of existing batteries. It will be used first in high altitude drones, he says, and in consumer devices, including smartphones, by 2018. REUTERS Hungry for more business news? Sign up for our daily newsletter!

According to a pre-release from the White House, one of the President’s goals to be discussed in Pittsburgh today will involve expanding human presence throughout the solar system. He hopes that with the leadership of NASA and their private industry partners, humanity can achieve this by pushing innovation and harnessing the spirit of exploration. Making good on his CNN op-ed published earlier this week, the President will enable NASA to send humans to Mars by the 2030’s by allowing them to focus on deep space exploration while private companies take over operations in low-Earth orbit or specifically, the International Space Station. The President will highlight the commercial contracts already in place for SpaceX to ferry astronauts to the ISS with their upcoming Crew Dragon vehicle and for Boeing to do the same with the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft. Dragon is on display at the conference while a Starliner simulator will be available for participants. The Obama administration has directed NASA to start working with the commercial space industry to also develop deep space habitats which could safely house astronauts during the long trip to Mars and other destinations. “The idea is that these habitats or “habs” would evolve into spacecraft capable of sustaining and transporting astronauts on long duration deep space missions, like a mission to Mars,” said a joint statement from NASA Administrator Charles Bolden and John P. Holdren, Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. “Their development would be achieved through new public-private partnerships designed to build on and support the progress of the growing commercial space sector in Earth orbit.” In order to achieve the ambitious goal of a fully space-faring future, the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships or “NextSTEP” program was created to foster the development of the technologies to accomplish what will be the most scientifically complex endeavor ever attempted by mankind. Six companies have received awards to start developing potential habitation systems along with life support and propulsion concepts to protect humans during interplanetary travel. The list includes Sierra Nevada Corporation, Boeing, Orbital ATK, NanoRacks and two companies who are leading the pack with their progress in hardware development, Lockheed Martin and Bigelow Aerospace. Veteran spacecraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin is already a few years into development of the Orion spacecraft—the vehicle that NASA will use to propel humans to deep space atop the agency’s upcoming heavy lift rocket, the Space Launch System. While Lockheed has been conceptualizing a multi-purpose logistics module for NextSTEP to initially orbit the moon, they seem to be resetting that plan to build what they are calling a “Mars Base Camp” that will help establish a human presence in Martian orbit and get us there faster than NASA’s current plans to land on the surface. “At Lockheed Martin, we’ve been a part of every NASA mission to Mars for the past 4 decades and we stand ready to support the nation’s goal of making the next giant leap of sending humans there and bringing them safely home. Working in partnership with NASA, we’ve developed, built and flown the Orion spacecraft — the only crewed spacecraft built to withstand the punishing journey to other planets,” said Lockheed Martin Vice President Lisa Callahan in a statement to the Observer. “We’re also advancing deep space habitat designs and mapping out a Mars mission concept, called Mars Base Camp, that suggests a technological roadmap for achieving the first human mission at Mars.” As part of the administration and NASA’s push for the eventual commercial takeover of the space station, they will move forward with the plan to offer private companies docking capabilities and the resources to operate in low-Earth orbit. One of those firms is Bigelow Aerospace, a Las Vegas-based expandable habitat developer that already has their BEAM module attached to the International Space Station for testing. The experimental Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM) is connected to the Tranquility node of the ISS and its testing could lead to future versions being used as extra work or living space for astronauts. For the NextSTEP program, Bigelow is developing an accessible 330 cubic meter expandable habitat module to house a human crew. XBASE or Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement as it’s called, would be able to dock with the International Space Station and provide a wealth of space for routine operations as well as mission-specific tasks. The XBASE’s development will be based on the current testing of the BEAM which includes performance reactions to temperature fluctuations, space radiation, and debris impact. Bigelow Aerospace hopes their expandable concepts will lead to the development of habitat spacecraft that will orbit the moon and one day, Mars. “We have submitted a version of a deep space habitat that we call EMMT—Earth Moon Mars Transporter and it can be various sizes and the particular presentation we were given were constrained. We had to shape this spacecraft to a size that would initially fit as a secondary payload under the Orion on a Space Launch System. We really had to shrink it down but these are terrific transporters,” said Bigelow Aerospace founder and president Robert Bigelow in a previous interview with the Observer. “Our philosophy is try to test everything we can. First, close to home because we don’t want any suicide missions. The moon is a perfect testing ground for a really dangerous environment and If you can successfully do a lot of things there, you can learn a lot that would be valuable to bases and human habitats on Mars.” Apart from NASA and their private industry partners that are all developing Mars mission-related capabilities, SpaceX has their own plan for not only reaching the red planet but building a permanent, self-sustaining city on our neighboring world. At the 67th annual International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara two weeks ago, CEO Elon Musk unveiled the company’s Interplanetary Transport System which can carry 100 or more colonists to Mars to establish a permanent settlement. The 400 foot tall rocket will be the largest ever built and will launch a 55 feet wide reusable spacecraft from Kennedy Space Center for a trip that could last up to 150 days. SpaceX hopes to launch the maiden voyage in a decade to construct a fuel processing facility on Mars that will enable return flights and slash the costs of interplanetary travel. It’s not clear how SpaceX’s bold mission will coincide with NASA’s plan to launch the Orion crew module atop the Space Launch System to Mars but the company has left the door open for government and industry cooperation. “SpaceX was founded with the ultimate goal of helping make humans a multi-planetary species. As Elon said at his recent talk, it will take a combination of public and private efforts to build a self-sustaining city on Mars,” said a SpaceX spokesperson to the Observer. “It’s exciting to see President Obama advocate for the next frontier in human spaceflight, and we look forward to participating in the journey.” Robin Seemangal focuses on NASA and advocacy for space exploration.

Sobczyk Published: Oct 13, 2016 9:39 a.m. ET Share By MartinM. Sobczyk WARSAW--LOT Polish Airlines said on Thursday it would lease up to 15 Boeing Co. BA, +0.56% single-aisle planes from Air Lease Corp. AL, +1.15% marking the second contract that Warsaw has awarded U.S. aerospace companies over European rival Airbus Group SE (AIR.FR) in as many weeks. The state-owned carrier said it would take delivery of two latest-generation 737 Max 8 and four 737-800 NG airplanes next year, with the rest of the deliveries expected by 2020. The jetliner deal follows Poland's decision to buy military helicopters from Lockheed Martin Corp. earlier this month after abandoning a tentative $3.5 billion deal to buy 50 Caracal helicopters made by Airbus. LOT Chief Executive Rafal Milczarski on Thursday said leasing Boeing planes was the cheapest option, "not emotional or political," and that the timing of the announcement, soon after the government's decision to reject the Airbus helicopter deal, was a coincidence. Mr. Milczarski said the move offers synergies with LOT's existing 737-400 aircraft and allows the company to more easily train pilots to fly the newer planes. Since the early 1990s, LOT has preferred Boeing aircraft for its long-haul as well as narrow-body fleet. Expanding LOT's fleet comes as the airline seeks to grow back its business after nearly going bankrupt in 2008 and 2012. Airbus, in response to Thursday's announcement, said its A320 neo model would have been a better choice for the Polish airline. LOT said it would increase the number of flights operated to major European airports and Tel Aviv, and that it was working on adding flights from its hub in Warsaw to Tehran and Astana. Rescued with Polish tax money in 2012, LOT said it would make between 150 million zlotys and 200 million zlotys ($38.5 million to $51.3 million) in operating profit this year. The airline expects to grow its fleet to some 70 aircraft in 2020 from 45 this year.

In 2013, Boeing was forced to ground its entire fleet of advanced 787 jetliners after some lithium-ion batteries caught fire.

This in turn has pushed manufacturers into making their screens bigger and their devices more powerful, packing more energy into smaller spaces. And however sophisticated the materials, "they're not 100 percent safe and they never will be," said Larsen, the consultant. "What we're seeing from the standpoint of lithium-ion technology is they're beginning to reach the safe energy density limits of that technology." But experts are divided on that point. Brandon Ng, whose Hong Kong startup QFE plans to sell refrigerator-sized batteries to replace diesel generators, said there is still room for improvements. "There is still a lot of developmental headroom with lithium-ion batteries in terms of increasing the energy they can store." Long-promised new technologies to make batteries safer are around the corner. Tim Grejtak, an analyst at Lux Research, said there are dozens of startups working on the issue, but the scientific problems were hard to solve and would take time. Among the most promising candidates, according to Grejtak, is California-based Blue Current, which is working on a high density, low flammable battery using gel electrolytes. Massachusetts-based SolidEnergy Systems is working on a lithium metal battery which founder Hu says takes up half the space of existing batteries. It will be used first in high altitude drones, he says, and in consumer devices, including smartphones, by 2018.

 Samsung's woes highlight explosive limits of lithium batteries Reuters Oct. 12, 2016, 10:38 PM 410 facebook linkedin twitter email print An advertisement of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is seen at a mobile phone shop in Hanoi Thomson Reuters By Jeremy Wagstaff SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Lithium-based batteries have been powering our portable devices for 25 years. But consumer demand for smaller, longer lasting devices is forcing manufacturers to push the technology, battery experts say, testing the limits of how much energy they can safely pack into smaller spaces.  "A battery is really a bomb that releases its energy in a controlled way," says Qichao Hu, a former researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and founder of SolidEnergy Systems, a battery startup. "There are fundamental safety issues to all batteries, and as you get to higher energy density and faster charge, the barrier to explosion is less and less." On Tuesday, Samsung Electronics scrapped its flagship Note 7 smartphone and told customers return their devices after weeks of bruising reports of phones igniting and images of scorched handsets. In early September, the world's largest smartphone maker blamed "a very rare manufacturing process error" for the problems. It has said it is still investigating reports of fires in a second, supposedly safe, batch of phones. Exactly what caused the problems will be the subject of detailed studies by regulators, the company and its suppliers. Experts are baffled by what could be causing the overheating in the replacement phones, if not the batteries. Samsung says it would be "premature to speculate" on the outcome of its investigations. "We are reviewing every step of our engineering, manufacturing and quality control processes," Samsung said in an emailed response to Reuters. An official at the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards, which is also investigating, said the fault in the replacement devices might not be the same as the problem in the original product.

And however sophisticated the materials, "they're not 100 percent safe and they never will be," said Larsen, the consultant. "What we're seeing from the standpoint of lithium-ion technology is they're beginning to reach the safe energy density limits of that technology." But experts are divided on that point. Brandon Ng, whose Hong Kong startup QFE plans to sell refrigerator-sized batteries to replace diesel generators, said there is still room for improvements. "There is still a lot of developmental headroom with lithium-ion batteries in terms of increasing the energy they can store." Long-promised new technologies to make batteries safer are around the corner. Tim Grejtak, an analyst at Lux Research, said there are dozens of startups working on the issue, but the scientific problems were hard to solve and would take time. Among the most promising candidates, according to Grejtak, is California-based Blue Current, which is working on a high density, low flammable battery using gel electrolytes. Massachusetts-based SolidEnergy Systems is working on a lithium metal battery which founder Hu says takes up half the space of existing batteries. It will be used first in high altitude drones, he says, and in consumer devices, including smartphones, by 2018.

The airline re-launched domestic destinations October 14, 2016 after a government bailout. NDI EUGENE NDI | NATION MEDIA GROUP  NDI EUGENE NDI in Yaoundé Friday, October 14   2016 at  17:32 comment Cameroon’s national carrier Camair-Co Friday re-launched its domestic flights with an inaugural journey between Yaoundé and Bafoussam. The re-launch follows the suspension of Camair-Co's lone intercontinental route last month. An extra-ordinary board of directors’ meeting earlier this month in Douala agreed that the Paris route be suspended for the company to concentrate on its domestic destinations. A new management team appointed last August has been struggling to revamp the ailing state firm that has been grappling with financial and managerial crisis since it launched operations in March 2011. The company Transport minister Edgar Alain Mebe Ngo’o announced on Wednesday that the government had disbursed $50.5 million (FCFA 30 billion) for the rehabilitation of the company. The infusion is part of a $101 million (FCFA 60 billion) recommended by a US consortium in a new business strategy to the government of the central African nation earlier this year. Boeing Consulting findings revealed Camair-Co recorded a deficit of $59 million (FCFA 35 billion) between 2012 and 2014, urging for a bailout to help the airline to continue flying. Mr Ngo’o said the government was also seeking to absorb the company’s debts. Flag carrier Boeing will accompany Cameroon for 18 months in the implementation of the new business plan, which authorities hope will make Camair-Co return to stability. The head of Boeing Consulting team, Mr Michael Bangue Tandet, said the US firm was working with the new Camair-Co management to ensure the plan was implemented “as quickly as feasible”. Camair-Co is the successor to Cameroon Airlines, the central African country’s pioneer flag carrier, which was dogged by losses and safety challenges. Five years later, observers say there were no indications that Camair’s successor would be profitable.

Looking to parallel this rapid development, Boeing’s Commercial Planes’ Product Development team is now experimenting with new ideas to bring connectivity to the modern day aircraft. Recent tests of a networked ‘smart cabin’ interior mock-up reveal new ways to order food and drinks, check bathroom availability and manage lighting options through a flyer’s smartphone, smart watch, or tablet. Note that passenger devices aren’t supplied for the flight, rather they’re the same ones they use on a daily basis. By linking up via secure chips located near each feature—a completely separate system from the electronics used for flight that doesn’t require Wi-Fi—users can then change the settings to match their preferences. Eventually these chips will be programmed to inform on-the-ground service teams about necessary maintenance, streamlining the repair process to ensure more timely flights and overall customer satisfaction moving forwards.

Davey Alba Science Date of Publication: 10.14.16. 10.14.16 Time of Publication: 4:25 pm. 4:25 pm Obama Geeks Out Over a Brain-Controlled Robotic Arm That ‘Feels’ Official White House Photo by Lawrence Jackson When Nathan Copeland got into a car accident in 2004, he suffered a spinal cord injury that left him paralyzed in both arms and both legs. Eventually, Copeland got a prosthetic—but one that is very different from most anyone else’s out there. Copeland is the first person in the world to use a system created by DARPA and the National Science Foundation, which allows him to “experience” the sensation of touch via a special robotic prosthesis. He has a brain implant that lets him control and feel the system with his mind. Pretty amazing stuff. Oh, he’s also one of the few Americans who has personally met the President of the United States. ‘I confess I’m a science geek. I’m a nerd. I won’t make any apologies for it.’ President Barack Obama Yesterday in Pittsburgh, during the White House Frontiers Conference, Barack Obama went on a tour of the most cutting-edge US technologies. With just a few months left in office, Obama is seeking to cement his legacy as a whole-hearted supporter of science—something that has been a clear differentiator between camps in this crazy election year. Science and technology, Obama seemingly hopes to underline, leads to progress—and, yes, American success. But more than just being a trumpeter of this message, watching Obama nerd out on science projects himself proves how much of one he is. “I confess I’m a science geek,” Obama announced at the conference. “I’m a nerd. I won’t make any apologies for it.” And this much was clear as he spoke with a handful of Pittsburgh scientists and academics who let him tinker with their machines and ask about their research. The first stop on the tour was to shake Copeland’s hand. The President chatted quietly, almost conspiratorially, with Copeland, and with University of Pittsburgh assistant professors Robert Gaunt and Jennifer Collinger, who explained to him the science of how the robotic arm worked. Obama held the fingers on the arm, which was mounted to a metal post by Copeland’s side, and moved them one by one. Then he shook the robotic hand. “Do you want to blow it up?” the President asked Copeland. “Let’s blow it up!” The two fist-bumped and mimicked exploding fingers. “Boo-yah!” Obama said. Then, rather suddenly, he turned to the gathered crowd: “Does everyone fully grasp what’s going on here?” Obama explained not only was Copeland moving the arm himself, using his own brain, whenever he moved the hand it also sent signals to Copeland. “You can imagine what this means over time as this gets miniaturized and more sophisticated,” Obama said. “Somebody who may currently have paralysis but now has, essentially, a set of robot limbs? Nathan’s going to be in a position where there’s all the kids of stuff he’s going to be able to do, and do it without having to manipulate something mechanically—but simply generated by what he’s thinking.” “Is it painful?” a member of the press called out. “No, never painful,” Copeland answered. “Look at him!” Obama chimed in. “He’s pretty chill.” “Tiring?” a reporter pressed. As Copeland said next to no effort was needed, Obama joked, “If you moved your arm up and down all day, you’d get tired of it too.” Obama then met with a NASA astronaut and Boeing representative, who taught him how to operate a spacecraft flight and docking simulator. The video game-like contraption—complete with dual screens, various knobs and levers, and a sloping hood above Obama’s seat—is the training setup that NASA’s own astronauts are using to prepare for future missions to the International Space Station. “Uh, let me try to get comfortable,” Obama said, approaching the intimidating-looking machine. “Let me take my jacket off.” He shed his coat and sat in front of the controls, rocking the chair back and forth like a kid testing out the seat of an arcade game. The experts coached him on how to use the simulator—left, right, left. The representative from Boeing representative told Obama what speed he should aim for, but told him not to go so fast that he crashed into the ISS. ‘Your ride is here, baby!’ the President said as he docked the spacecraft into the ISS. “I don’t want to crash!” cried Obama. “This is really expensive stuff… OK, let’s drive.” A few minutes later: “I’m so tense!” Obama said, struggling to follow the commands and not let the spacecraft drift. The scene made for a pretty good case for anyone who wants to defend their childhood love of video games. And finally, after several moments: “Your ride is here, baby!” the President said as he docked the spacecraft into the ISS. “This is like the Uber shuttle. Just call, they’ll be there in five minutes.” The press crowd, trailing Obama, hurried over to an autonomous flying machine demo from Carnegie Mellon used for inspecting bridges, imaging, and mapping. Standing in front of one of the screens that apparently sensed motion, Obama flapped his arms for a bit, checking to see if his movements would register. More stories So, President Obama’s Got a Workout Playlist. Let’s Rank Its Songs Barack Obama Talks AI, Robo-Cars, and the Future of the World How to Watch President Obama’s Essential Sci-Fi TV and Films Several minutes away, one last demonstration awaited Obama: a SpaceX Dragon capsule that has been successfully tested by NASA and meant to keep astronauts safe during human spaceflight. “You almost want to get in and take off, don’t you?” Obama asked. He wondered out loud what it’d be like to bring the whole family along for a trip, and how his kids Malia and Sasha might react to being in the backseat. And when a SpaceX representative said the company could one day visit Mars, Obama said, “That’s our goal.” Pushing the frontiers of human achievement, at least to this US President, means one day leaving this world entirely. Presidents: they’re kooky science lovers, just like us! Apart from the cabal of Secret Service keeping crowds back at all times. Oh, and they have access to cooler toys, too. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Following recommendations from a civil aviation ministry committee headed by joint secretary B S Bhullar to set up a flight simulator for every 20 aircraft, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is drafting a regulation in this regard. A ministry official said the recommendation had been approved and DGCA would be issuing draft guidelines in the next two weeks. Civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said the government wanted aircraft manufacturers to set up simulators in India. “We want to build an aviation ecosystem in the country,” he said, adding that the companies would not be arm-twisted to provide simulators. Currently, Air India and Jet Airways have their own simulators for their Boeing and Airbus aircraft, while other airlines send their pilots to third-party simulators in India and abroad. There are no simulators in India for ATR, Bombardier, and Embraer aircraft. The issue of simulator training also came up during a recent meeting between the civil aviation ministry and representatives of Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation. The Japanese company is developing a regional jet and is looking for customers in India. Pilots have to undergo simulator checks once every six months. Also, simulators are used for training pilots on new aircraft type. The sector criticised the move, saying it was impractical. Airline executives said building a simulator was not part of the core business of airlines and such a mandate would increase their costs. “Expert organisations should build that; airlines are only customers,” said the chief executive of a private airline. Queries to Vistara and IndiGo were not responded to. SpiceJet said airlines should be left alone to decide whether they would go for leasing for pilot trainings or investing in simulators. And, the government has no role to play in such investment decisions. “If the government is serious about building flight simulator facilities and training ecosystem in India, it should slash the import duties on simulators and Indian banks should be allowed to finance the process. Teg cost of credit and dollar-rupee fluctuations make it impossible for airliners to build such facilities in the most economical way,” said the spokesperson. Experts corroborated this saying it’s not feasible for airlines in India to set up their own simulator, citing high costs. “A fairly average quality simulator costs $4 million in the current market price. Asking the airlines to set up one such simulator for every 20 aircraft is not at all practical – who will pay for it?” said Mark Martin of Dubai-based Martin Consultancy. According to Martin, the government can build such training facilities and monetise it by opening them to the airlines. “In that way, the government makes money and also becomes a facilitator to build an ecosystem,” Martin said. Currently, domestic airlines operate around 450 planes and have 700 aircraft on order. There is a shortage of trained commanders and airlines are hiring foreign pilots to operate aircraft. Setting up an in-house simulator could make pilot training easier and help the airlines reduce dependence on expatriates. The initiative is also part of the overall government vision to build an aviation ecosystem in the country.

A train is set to reach the Sligo glamping site this weekend David McGowan recently brought a Boeing 767 to the small village of Enniscrone. Oct 14th 2016, 7:19 PM 27,600 Views 10 Comments Share564 Tweet Email7 Image: David McGowan via Facebook ALL ABOARD! FROM planes to trains, one forward-thinking Sligo native is bringing his camping vision alive. David McGowan managed to capture the imagination of the nation earlier this year after he pulled out all the stops to transport a Boeing 767 to the small village of Enniscrone in Sligo. The plane is to be the centerpiece of McGowan’s Quirky Nights Glamping Village. But it’s not the only vehicle that will be on display in Enniscrone when the village opens its gates to the public. The enterprising undertaker is today beginning his transport of a train from the UK to Enniscrone. The train will be moved from London to the west of England. It will arrive at Dublin Port on Sunday at 5pm before making it to Enniscrone at about 6am on Monday. “It seems to going well and the permits are all in place in this side of the water,” McGowan said to Today FM’s the Anton Savage Show today. “If there’s anyone there in Ireland that wants a life home we’ll be leaving this evening at about 7 o’clock. We’re going across London… so if there’s anyone from Ireland looking for a lift home give us a shout… It won’t cost you anything. You can’t fault the man for vision.

November 14, 2016 0727 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:170293 Publish Date: Fri, 14 Oct 2016 20:13:56 GMT Service: Iran Bombardier says unfazed by late start in Iran Canada’s flag-carrier airline Bombardier says it has no concerns to find a foothold in Iran’s aviation market even though it has been late on chasing opportunities in Iran. Bombardier’s CEO Alain Bellemare said he expects his company to be able to catch up with its rivals following Canada’s lifting of sanctions against Iran. Bellemare added that Bombardier currently has teams on the ground in Iran, stressing that the company was not concerned about winning its share of new orders in the Iranian market. The Montreal-based plane and train maker sees opportunities to sell regional rail services along with regional jets and CSeries planes as Iranian companies look to modernize, reported Canada’s Toronto Starnewspaper in an article on its website. Iran has signed an agreement with the French plane-maker Airbus to purchase over 100 planes.    The country has also signed another agreement with the American aviation giant Boeing to buy some 80 passenger jets worth $25 billion at price lists. The tentative deals have already hit a speed bump because major global banks are refusing to handle transactions with Iran for fear of running afoul of US sanctions on the country. One major roadblock was lifted last month when the US government granted Airbus and Boeing permission to sell aircraft to the Islamic Republic. Apart from Boeing and Airbus, Iran has also already started talks with Canada’s Bombardier, Brazil’s Embraer and Japan’s Mitsubishi over plane supply agreements. Iran’s current civil aviation fleet consists of 248 aircraft with an average age of 20 years, of which 100 are grounded. Iranian officials have announced that the country needs as many as 500 jets to rejuvenate its aviation fleet.     KeyWords Bombardier unfazed Iran   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Iran, Russia cooperating on Middle East issues: Larijani EU must play more active role on regional, global issues: Zarif Iran beats USA in world kabaddi meet to reach semifinals Iran seeks secure, stable Iraq: Parliament speaker Iran crowned at 1st world Pahlavani bouts Iran fit enough to win world physique title Top Iranian, Russian parliamentarians meet in Tehran President Rouhani inaugurates three oilfields in Khuzestan Official: Over 1m Iranians enter Iraq for Arba’een rituals Iran to join Paris climate change treaty Most Visited Trump looking at 'quick ways' to ditch Paris climate accord: Report Protests erupt in Cincinnati after mistrial in police shooting of black male Sanders popular policies could have made him president: Analyst www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/0594 sec

Even Samsung's heir apparent admitted that the incident was the trigger for him to pull the plug on blundered smartphone. The incident put the airline industry into panic mode. In short order they've now begun to outfit planes with fire-containment bags capable of withstanding 1,760C heat to stop smartphone and laptop battery fires from spreading throughout the plane.   The first airline to deploy fire-containment bags on its entire fleet was Alaska Airlines. The Seattle-based airline finished adding them to its 219 planes in May, a process that took two months from concept to deployment. With the Samsung incident, several other airlines have gone into high gear to adopt these new bags.   A new report states that following explosions of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, airlines are taking steps to protect their planes from mobile devices with fire-suppressing systems.   Three US airlines have started rolling out new fire-containment bags capable of sealing up an overheating smartphone or laptop battery to prevent a disaster mid-air.   The bright red bags are made of a fire-resistant material and are designed to hold electronic devices such as mobile phones and laptops. The bags, which retail for $1,800 each, can be shut with Velcro and heavy-duty zippers to withstand temperatures up to 1,760C.   Virgin America installed fire-containment bags on all its 60 or so planes, while Seattle-based Alaska Airlines finished adding them to its 219 planes in May.   Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines said that it too would be adding such bags to its more than 900 planes, prioritizing the 166 aircraft that cross oceans, as well as some Boeing 757s used for domestic flights, which will have two of the bags each by the end of the year.   "This has been on the to-do list, but has been accelerated by recent events," said Morgan Durrant, communications manager for Delta.   Other airlines, including American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, have yet to deploy the bags, but do have aircrew training and fire extinguishers to deal with high-energy fires mid-flight.   Note 7 Costs to Dramatically Rise for Samsung   On Tuesday Samsung's preliminary estimates over the costs of the first recall rang in at US$4 billion. Today Samsung let it be known that the costs will rise to what amounts to US$6.1 Billion.   A Korean report this morning states that Samsung announced that "In total, the halts in sales and production of the fire-prone Note 7 cost Samsung Electronics more than 7 trillion won ($6.1 Billion U.S.).   The operating profits of the company's internet and mobile division in the fourth quarter is also estimated to drop more than 20 percent year-on-year to close to 2 trillion won, according to analysts' estimates.   To cover the cost from the Note 7, Samsung plans to focus on other premium smartphone brands such as the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. The tech giant also reportedly plans to shift operations of plants in Gumi and Vietnam -- originally for the Note 7 -- to produce the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge.   Samsung, reeling from the painful Note 7 fallout, also vowed to improve its product development that critics say is largely at fault due to its rigid organizational culture."   Kim Sun-woo, an analyst at Meritz Securities stated for the report that "Samsung may improve earnings in its mobile division in the first quarter of next year if it investigates the causes of the explosions, discloses the solution for the production of the Galaxy S8, and adopts compensation programs in case of possible explosions."   What's disturbing about Samsung's handling of their Note7 crisis is that they sent out replacement Note7's in quick fashion without even knowing if that would actually solve the problem. When the replacement batteries began exploding, their theory also went up in smoke.   Just yesterday Samsung vowed to figure the root causes of the Note 7 problem. This is what's damaging to Samsung's reputation: The admission that they never had a clue as to what was going wrong behind the scenes while telling the press that it is was all due to a bad batch of batteries. They lied, which means that the anger expressed by their customers in China were right all along. It's not the battery, it's something within the Note7's architecture that has a problem controlling the charging of the battery.   Now the fact that analysts want Samsung to adopt compensation programs in case their future Samsung S8 explodes tells you that there's deep fear even at the broker level about Samsung ability to resolve this problem.   Yet the thing that might have saved the Galaxy S7 Edge from having an overheating problem is that they adopted a liquid cooling system for that model; something that couldn't have been adopted by the Note 7 due to precious internal space being reserved to accommodate their S-Pen or stylus.   Without a doubt, this has been one of the worse weeks for Samsung in decades and a baptism of fire for their heir apparent Jae-yong Lee.   Samsung's CES 2017 Surprise has Likely Gone Up in Smoke   It was discussed in the Korean press just yesterday that Samsung was planning to unveil their new Galaxy S8 in a surprise event at CES 2017 and launch it while at the Mobile World Congress in late February.   Yet with the demise of the Note7 this week, those plans are likely to have gone up in smoke, as such a market surprise would now be interpreted as Samsung in panic mode rushing out yet another smartphone release. The ripple effect of the Note 7 crisis continues.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The new routes include Kolkata-Silchar-Guwahati, Kolkata-Aizawl-Guwahati and Kolkata-Gorakhpur-Delhi. It will also deploy a dedicated fleet of three Q400 for the north-eastern markets. On the connectivity from Hyderabad to other tier-II cities, Singh said, "We are considering to run flights from Hyderabad to Nagpur, Calicut and Bhubaneswar. Already, we have planned to start a flight from Hyderabad to Kolkata from this November." The company is in talks with Airbus and Boeing to order more than 100 aircraft. The deal is likely to finalise in a couple of months, according to him.

Source: IHS/James Hardy South Korea has received its first lot of Taurus KEPD 350K cruise missiles during a ceremony at the headquarters of Taurus Systems in Schrobenhausen, Germany, it was announced on 14 October. An undisclosed number of missiles were formally handed over to the Republic of Korea Air Force (RoKAF) during the event, which took place on the same day as the announcement. The RoKAF signed a contract for the Taurus KEPD 350K in November 2013, with reports putting the number at either 170 or 180 missiles. The Taurus KEPD 350K is being integrated onto the RoKAF's Boeing F-15K Slam Eagle fleet. According to MBDA Deutschland (the lead company in the Taurus Systems consortium, which also includes Saab Dynamics), this work is now in its final stages. The missile is an enhanced version of the Taurus KEPD 350 fielded by Germany and Spain on its Panavia Tornado, and Boeing EF-18 Hornet and Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft respectively. Sweden is looking at integrating it onto its Saab JAS 39 Gripens also. The baseline Taurus KEPD 350 missile is a 350 km to 500 km-class weapon designed for use against hardened and buried targets with its Multi-Effect Penetrator Highly Sophisticated and Target Optimised (MEPHISTO) penetrator warhead and intelligent fuzing system. Once launched, the missile, which is powered by a small turbofan engine, flies at extremely low altitudes (30 m) at speeds of up to Mach 0.9. The Taurus KEPD 350 missile measures 5.1 m in length, 63 cm wide, 32 cm high, and weighs in at 1,400 kg. The Taurus KEPD 350K for the RoKAF differs slightly in that it is equipped with a new Rockwell Collins GPS receiver that comes with a Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) to prevent jamming.

Three US airlines will now provide fire-containment bags which can be used to seal up an overheating smartphone or other device. Virgin America, Delta Air Lines and Alaska Airlines have started rolling out the bright red bags which can be sealed using Velcro and heavy-duty zippers and are capable of withstanding 1,760C heat. Related: Best Note 7 replacements Virgin America has already installed the fire-resistant bags on all its 60-odd planes and Alaska Airlines has also ensured its 219 planes are fully Note 7-proof. Delta Air Lines is yet to kit its planes out but has said it will make sure its 900 aircraft, starting with the 166 that cross oceans and some Boeing 757s used for domestic flights, will have two of the bags on-board before the end of 2016. The move follows a warning from the US Federal Aviation Administration to passengers, advising them not to use or charge Note 7 devices on-board planes. Samsung meanwhile has been forced to stop production of the explosion-prone handsets, after initially offering supposedly safe replacements to customers. The South Korean firm made the decision after reports of replacement devices catching fire began to surface, one of which related to a Note 7 exploding before take-off on a Southwest Airlines flight in the United States. Royal Mail this week has also said it will not allow the phones to be returned via its network, due to the lithium-ion batteries used in the devices, which have been identified as the source of the overheating problems. If you still have a Note 7, Samsung has issued a global recall and strongly advises powering the phone down and returning tit for a refund as soon as possible.

The launch operator is expected to purchase up to 20 engines for the current mission. “It has been decided that the Atlas V manned program will be implemented using Russian RD-180 engines. The crew had already been selected and is being trained,” NPO Energomash General Director Igor Arbuzov told RIA Novosti on Friday. Read more No space for US without Russian rockets The missions will be carried out aboard the heavy-lift Atlas V vehicles with Boeing’s Crew Transportation System (CTS) capsules. The first unmanned test launch is expected in 2017, while manned test launch is scheduled for 2018, Arbuzov said. The United Launch Alliance (ULA) operator which is responsible for the launches plans to purchase from 10 to 20 Russian engines for the missions. “One can say with confidence that no other engine in the world except the RD-180 is ready for manned launches as part of the Atlas V rocket,” Arbuzov said, adding that the RD-180 engines’ and Atlas V's joined performance has been very successful over the years. Arbuzov specified that the engines that have already been shipped to the United States will be used for both test launches and the first manned flight along with those that are to be delivered between 2017 and 2019.  READ MORE: Pentagon defends use of Russian rocket engines as matter of national security “The package for 2017-2019 has been fully approved. It is a solid contract. What will be happening after 2019 is currently being discussed with our American colleagues,” he noted, adding, however, that the new contract could be signed after the US presidential elections to be held on November 8. Russian RD-180 rocket engines © Iliya Pitalev / Sputnik “I am certain that this will happen,” Arbuzov said, stressing that the currently available supply of Russian engines in the US does not meet its needs under the developing 2020-2023 program. The RD-181 engine was developed specifically for the US Antares rockets; it allows more cargo to be brought up to the International Space Station. While RD-180 was chosen for the US Atlas rocket in early 1996. In spring 1999, the RD-180 was officially certified for use in Atlas III carrier rocket, and a year later, for use in Atlas V launch vehicle, whose first flight took place in August 2002. Despite over 13 years of successful cooperation in the field and steady supply of engines, doubts about using the RD-180 for the US space program arose following the Ukraine crisis in March 2014, which affected US-Russia relations. American lawmakers banned future military use of the Russian engines after Crimea joined Russia in 2014.  Commercial Crew Transportation System (CCTS) capsule © Bruce Weaver / AFP However, the US Congress weakened the ban in 2015 in order to keep its space program going. ULA has also maintained that Russian engines are cheaper than the US alternatives, and that view is shared by the Pentagon. Still, the use of Russian engines for American rockets remains a political issue in the US, where some politicians like Republican Senator John McCain strongly advocate replacing them. To break the dependency on Russian engines, in 2014 ULA has partnered up with Blue Origin, a private US-based aerospace research and development company, to develop the BE-4 LOX/methane engine to replace the RD-180. However Arbuzov said these replacement plans could stretch well into 2024. “Indeed, [we’ve heard] statements that the development of Blue Origin’s methane engines BE-4 is going on schedule.  However, in my opinion, these engines will not be able to compete with our RD-180s, at least until 2020,” he concluded. via GIPHY Where to watch Schedule Where to watch Schedule News America UK Russian politics Business Sport Op-Edge More Live Where to watch In vision In motion RT360 Shows Schedule Business projects Legal disclaimer Privacy policy Feedback About us Vacancies Contact info On-Air Talent RT NEWS APP Android iOS Windows phone Windows 8 العربية Español Русский Deutsch Français ИНОТВ RTД RUPTLY Applications RSS facebook twitter youtube google-plus instagram soundcloud coub © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2016.

REUTERS/Lee Jae-Won Reuters/Lee Jae-Won Friday, Oct 14, 2016 Abu Dhabi: The trade relations between the UAE and the US are strong with bilateral trade reaching $25.44 billion in 2015, an increase of 2.24 per cent from 2014, Chairman of American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Abu Dhabi told Gulf News in an interview. “The US-UAE trade relations are currently the strongest as have ever been. The UAE is the largest US export market in the Middle East surpassing Saudi Arabia, Turkey and India. This is due to a strong focus on the defence, health care, oil and gas and education sectors,” said Sharief Fahmy. The total US exports to the UAE have reached $22.98 billion (Dh84.33 billion) last year surpassing other regional trade partners including Saudi Arabia ($19.69 billion), India ($21.53 billion), Turkey ($9.56 billion) and Egypt ($4.75 billion, according to figures provided by AmCham Abu Dhabi. The top exports were transportation equipment including aircraft and commercial aviation equipment accounting for $8.7 billion. Advertisement There is also a huge presence of the US companies in the UAE with the number exceeding more than 1500 in different sectors including aerospace, finance, oil and gas, health care, tourism among others. Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Raytheon are some of the companies in the defence and aerospace sector. In the oil and gas, Occidental petroleum has a tie up with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) in the development of Shah gas oilfield in the Western region on Abu Dhabi and Exxon Mobil has concession agreement with Adnoc in the development of the emirate’s offshore oilfields. From the UAE side, Abu Dhabi based Mubadala has $6 billion investment in GlobalFoundries, a semiconductors manufacturer based in California. “We’ve seen consistent growth in trade between the two countries and moving forward I see the relationship strengthening further with boost in investment and trade.” With the UAE planning to diversify their economy due to drop in oil prices and the introduction of the bankruptcy law next year, the number of US companies in the UAE is likely to go up. “The introduction of bankruptcy law is going to benefit our SMEs significantly. A lot of companies will feel more secure to invest in the UAE.” The UAE bankruptcy law approved by the UAE Cabinet last month is likely to come into effect early next year. The new law will pave the way for companies in financial distress to restructure and allow the possibility of getting fresh loans under terms set by the law. When asked whether change in the guard in the US after the elections in November will have any impact on the bilateral trade relations, he said business will continue to progress irrespective of whether a democrat or a republican candidate wins the elections. “From a chamber perspective, we are non-partisan. We’ve been fortunate with Obama administration and the policies that came out in the last eight years. We expect the same spirit to continue whether it is Trump or Clinton administration.” He said the Obama administration has attached special significance to the UAE with the US administration sending invitations to Emirati companies to come and be part of the select USA Investments Summit in Washington DC in June this year. Thirteen companies represented the UAE and received special status with private meetings with the US Secretary of Commerce Pritzker, he added. Set up in 1986, AmCham Abu Dhabi is represented by more than 600 American and Emirati companies including Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and big corporations with huge investments in the UAE.

The geek-in-chief was in his element Thursday as he toured cutting-edge projects during a White House Frontiers Conference. Obama beamed as he took the chair of a Boeing Starliner Flight Simulator, with its panoply of buttons and monitors and futuristic gizmos. “Right, left, left,” his trainer said, urging minute course corrections. “Your ride is here, baby,” Obama said after docking the simulator on the International Space Station. “This is like the Uber shuttle. In case anybody calls, we’ll be there in five minutes.” Minutes later, the president gawked at a self-directed quadcopter, or mini-drone, used to inspect infrastructure like bridges. As a computer screen showed the drone’s preset path, the drone moved up and down, left and right, emitting neon green light and whizzing loudly. He offered a presidential fist-bump to Nathan Copeland, a paralyzed man who is the first person who can feel sensation through his mind-controlled robotic arm. The Harvard-trained lawyer has never been shy about his fascination with all things scientific and high-tech. Over the years he’s fired off a high-speed marshmallow air cannon at a White House science fair and rubbernecked at robots built by teenagers. He used his appearance Thursday to scoff at those who “willfully ignore facts or stick their hands in the sand,” such as those who question global warming. “Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us to space, we didn’t deny that Sputnik was up there. That wouldn’t have worked,” Obama said. “No, we acknowledged the facts and then built a space program almost overnight, and then beat them to the moon.” Urging a new aspiration for the nation, Obama has set a goal to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, and in Pittsburgh he got a look at the SpaceX Dragon Spacecraft, part of ongoing research to develop vehicles that could transport astronauts to the red planet.

(October 13, 2016) – A United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket with the CST-100 Starliner capsule on Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The Atlas V carrying Starliner will launch American astronauts from US soil to the International Space Station beginning in 2018. Photo by United Launch Alliance/Boeing The goal of the US transporting astronauts to the International Space Station is finally within reach, something that up until now has required the US relying upon other nations' transport to and from ISS. NASA has paid Russia, and over 12 years could end up paying, more than $3.36 billion. With the thought of being self sufficient, United Launch Alliance (ULA) and The Boeing Company unveiled an updated aerodynamic configuration of the Atlas V that will launch Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner capsule for NASA after encountering unique challenges with aerodynamic stability and loads. This new configuration incorporates an aeroskirt aft of the spacecraft, extending the Starliner Service Module cylindrical surface to improve the aerodynamic characteristics of the integrated launch configuration and bring loads margins back to acceptable flight levels. Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of Human and Commercial Services said, “Through incredible coordination and continued innovative thinking, the collective team of NASA, Boeing and United Launch Alliance completed three wind tunnel tests in six months to investigate the aerodynamic stability of various configurations and to anchor our analytical predictions. Based on that information, we updated the configuration for the Atlas V Starliner integrated vehicle stack. This configuration is unique because it combines the Atlas V launch vehicle without a payload fairing with Boeing’s Starliner capsule, resulting in different aerodynamic interactions.”   The aeroskirt is a metallic orthogrid structure designed to be jettisoned for improved performance. In the unlikely event that an emergency occurs during boost phase of flight, the aeroskirt has venting provisions to control over-pressurization if the Starliner’s abort engines are fired. Fabrication of the aeroskirt is scheduled to begin this month at ULA’s factory in Decatur, Alabama, following completion of a Production Readiness Review. John Mulholland, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program stated, "Our testing indicates the solution we chose will sufficiently smooth the air flow around the vehicle during ascent, ensuring crew safety and mission success," said . The ULA team completed the aeroskirt Preliminary Design Review earlier this month. The Atlas V with Starliner has a planned uncrewed flight test in 2018 with operational missions to follow. “We look forward to our continued partnership with Boeing and NASA to ensure mission success and safety for American astronauts flying from U.S. soil on the Atlas V Starliner,” said Wentz. ULA has successfully delivered more than 110 satellites to orbit that provide critical capabilities for troops in the field, aid meteorologists in tracking severe weather, enable personal device-based GPS navigation and unlock the mysteries of the solar system.  http://www.ulalaunch.com   Topical Tags :  Manufacturing    Agencies    Regulatory/Government    Launch    Service Provider      Regional Tags :  North America                     FREE SUBSCRIPTIONS Today's Top News ULA's Successful Cool As A Cube WorldView-4 Launch  A Fairing Kind Of Day For Arianespace AIMing For Didymos Veterans Day, Lest We Forget...  Launch Reminders...

Scoot Print Singapore Airlines' budget siblings, Scoot and Tigerair, are embarking on their biggest-ever recruitment drive for cockpit and cabin crew as the group positions itself to capture a bigger share of the low-cost travel market. From 400 pilots today, the total headcount for the two airlines, which now operate as one, will increase to 700 by 2020, Captain Rohan Hari Chandra, the airline's advisor of flight operations, told The Straits Times yesterday. About 2,000 cabin crew will also be hired during the same period, almost double the number today. Since May, when SIA set up a new holding company to operate both budget carriers, Scoot and Tigerair have been working closely to grow their market share. Capt Rohan said: "We know the expansion is coming, the planes are coming and we need pilots to fly them." Scoot, which operates medium and long-haul flights with 12 Boeing 787s, will grow to 20 planes by 2019. Tigerair, which flies single-aisle planes within the region, will grow from 23 to 38 aircraft by 2022. With strong demand for low-cost air travel, SIA is counting on its budget offshoots to move quickly in this sector. This is critical given intense pressure the premium carrier faces in the long-haul market, with stiff competition from rivals that include the Middle Eastern airlines and Cathay Pacific. Finding enough pilots, though, will be tough, experts say. American plane maker Boeing estimates that the world will need about 617,000 new pilots and 814,000 cabin crew over the next 20 years. The Asia-Pacific region will soak up 40 per cent of the total due to the growth in the single-aisle market, driven by low-cost carriers, the firm said. Capt Rohan said he is confident Scoot/Tigerair will be able to fill the available positions. Remuneration packages are competitively pegged to what other budget carriers in the region offer, he added, without disclosing details. And while there are those who prefer to join full-service airlines - perceived as more glamorous - "we generally get the hungry guys", he said. "They want to get on with their careers and get their command (captain rank) quickly," he noted. Budget carrier pilots typically move from trainee to captain in about seven years, compared with more than 10 years for pilots with full-service long-haul airlines. This is because they tend to clock more flying hours and flight cycles in a month with shorter flights. A recent recruitment exercise drew over 1,000 candidates, of whom about 150 were shortlisted for a test yesterday. One of them, Brian Chow, 22, said: "I always thought I would become an engineer until I signed up for a flying course last year. "I now know I want to become a pilot." karam@sph.com.sg Get MyPaper for more stories. Sign Up Now! Enjoy 2 weeks of unlimited digital access to The Straits Times. Get your free access!

Clark's job was with Emirates, an airline set up with a US$10 million loan from Dubai's royal family. Its first flight took off from a dusty runway bound for Karachi. Brought in as head of airline planning, the economics graduate had a vision that would go on to see Dubai at the heart of an aviation boom like no other. With two-thirds of the world's population within eight hours of the emirate, Clark aimed to have his new airline carrying millions of them. By various measures, that vision has come to fruition; the airline's growth has been staggering. While other established airlines have folded, merged or gone backwards, Emirates has known only one trajectory - up. Thanks to its international reach and billions of dollars spent on promotion, marketing and sponsorship, it's the biggest brand in aviation, has the largest available flight kilometres of any international carrier and in absolute size, is in the top three behind American and United Airlines. "I wouldn't have dreamt that in 1985 when we set the thing up," says Clark - now Sir Tim, and one of aviation's most powerful executives. Asked about Clark's place in the airline industry, a leading aviation analyst this week described him as being "slightly south of God". Clark extends a half-hour interview with the Herald to nearly an hour at Sydney's Shangri-La hotel. There are fine views out to the Opera House, but much of his focus is on the meeting room, where there are two scale models of the Airbus A380 superjumbo, Emirates' signature aircraft. The airline now has more than 80 of the double decker planes and close to 150 other widebody aircraft flying to more than 150 destinations. Almost the same number of aircraft are on order and it carries more than 50 million passengers a year. Continued below. Related Content Air NZ getting WiFi - next year Joke spreads among Aussies and Kiwis over UK's Marmite misery New airline's cut-price fares on longest route "By the mid 1990s we had 40 aircraft and probably thought we would cap out at about 120. We thought we could be at the scale of Singapore Airlines (which today has 103 aircraft) and everyone said we were barking mad." Watch: Emirates boss explains A380 interior design: Video The NZ connection Emirates has been flying to Auckland since 2003, adding a Christchurch service the following year. It scaled up massively in 2009 with three A380 services to Auckland and from the end of this month capacity will surge again with the number of superjumbo services increasing to five, including replacing 777s on the Christchurch route and the direct Dubai-Auckland service. This will add 2500 more seats a week each way. Growth elsewhere is strong. So far this month the airline has announced new services to all parts of the globe: Guangzhou, Moscow and Florida. What about fares? Rival Middle Eastern carrier Qatar will start Doha-Auckland services from next February and Clark says there is ``theoretically'' room for both carriers. ''Both carriers are growth animals they thrive on growth and looking for new markets and being innovative and experimental in what they do.'' The extra competition meant times couldn't be better for New Zealand travellers. "The fares are already down. In this part of the world we're seeing arfares that were around eight to 10 years ago - that's supply and demand,'' he says. The big Asian carriers were adding more capacity to Australasia and boosting competition but Clark says there are product differences. ''If they come in and trash the pricing then that's up to them but it is a long way to go and if you've got a moderate or mediocre product.'' Video When will Emirates' growth end? "When we increase supply and demand doesn't grow with it, we're not there yet simply because there are multiple city pairs that we want to do," Clark says. The airline has modelled up to 60,000 places in the world that could be linked, including little-known cities in China and Latin America. "If you get disequilibrium you will know the model has maxed out. I don't see that happening because there are so many city pairs that are untouched by long-haul carriers in the second level segments where the markets are, but people don't believe in or don't know about." Clark says the main constraint is at its Dubai hub, which can't keep up with capacity growth in spite of a seemingly never-ending building programme. The airport needs to push through tens of thousands of people an hour and increase the number of gates three-fold to meet Clark's growth goals. "If you can build a hub to to do that then it opens up a huge spectrum of offerings. Will this model work? - yes with the geocentricity of Dubai." he says. "It goes back to the business model of 1985 with access to primary markets." Emirates business class seats. Photo / Grant Bradley Storm clouds about The fall in fuel prices is double edged for Emirates, in an industry that was notorious "for racing to the bottom," he says. "Now we've got low costs everyone's saying 'let's go and grab all the business' but unfortunately everyone has got it at the same time - consumers globally have had an absolute field day." Analyst Peter Harbison, executive chairman of the CAPA Centre for Aviation, says there are other storm clouds about. Emirates is facing growing competition from Middle Eastern carriers Etihad and Qatar, and also the big Chinese long-haul operators. "It's a tough world on long-haul now," says Harbison. "We used to say the thing that kept Tim awake at night was the Chinese carriers." And there's something else, deeper, that Clark has in the back of his mind. Outside the usual economic and demand fluctuations, popular anger that fuelled the Brexit vote and is behind support for Donald Trump could play out in aeropolitics. The introduction of the jumbo jet in the late 1960s has been credited with making mass long-haul travel feasible, bringing about profound political and social change. Similarly, when Emirates - and then other airlines - ramped up global operations and linked cities in ways that had not been imagined, they broke down barriers too. Now Clark wonders how long that will last. It is possible he has to understand the balance because aeropolitics drives the global demand for Boeing aircraft which is the largest single exporter in the US. If you compromise that then down they go. Peter Harbison, CAPA's executive chairman "You've got to be very careful about that because at this particular juncture you see the effects of globalisation and free trade." Moves that were good for the global economy in the 1990s are now being questioned. "All the fantastic things that were happening in general as we knitted as a community and we broke down all the barriers about faith and creed, colour sexuality and gender. "We thought this could last forever and have deployed capacity to the most bizarre city pairs and seen traffic move - now that's all changing. Are there paradigm shifts in this?" He says that question could be answered by the result of next month's US election next month - not that he'll be drawn on who he supports. "I'm not going to take sides on this otherwise I will get in big trouble, but if there is a move to the strange right position, if that happens, if the kind of statements he's [Trump's] been making about trade - a degree of isolationism - will this pan through to aeropolitics? "It is possible he has to understand the balance because aeropolitics drives the global demand for Boeing Aircraft, which is the largest single exporter in the US. If you compromise that then down they go." Emirates A380 aircraft. Throwing bricks In May the Emirates Group announced its 28th consecutive year of profit - US$2.2b, up 50 per cent from the previous year. Opponents "threw bricks" at Emirates in the early days, says Clark, and "said we were cheating, saying we had free oil, government money, because they couldn't understand how this could happen and for us to still make money and quite good money." The airline has spent years pushing back on those claims, and others about paying low wages, especially from opponents in the United States where the big three carriers have fought hard against Emirates entering that market. Analyst Harbison - who offered the "south of God" line - says Clark is right about the Emirates standing on its own. "He's a phenomenon, one of the two (along with Maurice Flanagan) who set up an airline with two aircraft, no guarantee from the government that it would have any protection whatsoever and built the most massive empire in the world," said Harbison, on the sidelines of the inaugural New Zealand Aviation and Travel Summit in Auckland. "Tim's no softie - when you've knocked around in the airline industry as long as he has you have a few battle wounds and a few good scars to cover them up, you know how to fight." Emirates economy class on an A380. "Put in the big windows" Plane makers know the power of a Clark pushback too; in 2014 he walked away from a $16b Airbus deal. When Clark was named Aviation Week's person of the year in 2013, Airbus president Fabrice Breglier said: "He knows everything you could possibly know about an aircraft, just give him the parameters and he'll tell you immediately if it's a go or a no-go." Clark says it's a matter of historical record that the bigger the airline got, the more successful it became. "We didn't buy [aircraft] in twos or threes, we bought them in 100s and 200s so it was only a matter of time before the manufacturers began to look at what we were doing, understanding we were a serious player and it was probably a good idea to adapt what they did." "With the 777X (which Emirates will get in four years) we worked with them and said 'put the windows in like the 787' they said structurally they just couldn't do it. I said 'just put them in' so they put them in." He is also is demanding that manufacturers produce aircraft capable of flying for 20 hours, which could link Dubai and Chile. Circling the globe Emirates has about 15 per cent of traffic on the transtasman route and the respect of home carrier Air New Zealand, which with Virgin Australia has just over half of the market. "We have a huge amount of respect for what Emirates does on a global basis," says Air New Zealand chief revenue officer Cam Wallace. "They have a different business model to us and obviously our businesses do overlap and compete. "We're very pragmatic and have to compete with anyone, we're up for it." The diplomatic tone is a far cry from when Emirates first entered Australasia, when Qantas (now in a deep partnership Clark's airline) and Air New Zealand expressed anger and alarm at the prospect of the Middle Eastern giant using rights to fly on across the Pacific and to the Americas, creating a massive operation circling the globe. "There was a shock reaction in New Zealand with open skies - now they're going to go across the Pacific they'll be in Los Angeles and we'll be all toast," says Clark. Clark is now in his mid-60s and this year the Gulf News reported he had up to another decade at the airline. So there's no hurry to join all the dots and Clark says he "doesn't deny that Emirates has aspired to a global operation in terms of circumnavigation." - NZ Herald Grant Bradley travelled to Sydney courtesy of Emirates.

The commander-in-geek was clearly in his element as he stepped off Air Force One in Pittburgh and headed to the event, which showcases thrilling innovations in tech. There, a clearly delighted President fist-bumped a paralyzed man who uses a mind-controlled robotic hand, goofed around with a baby in a Nasa T-shirt and got a taste of astronaut life.  Geek power: Self-confessed science geek Barack Obama hangs out with his ten-month-old counterpart Rowan Wright at the White House Frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh Thursday Space commander: Obama managed to successfully dock into the ISS using this  official flight simulator, joking that it was like driving an Uber The President beamed as he took docked a virtual shuttle into the International Space Station on a Boeing Starliner Flight Simulator that had been installed at the event, held in Carnegie Mellon University. 'Your ride is here, baby,' Obama said after docking the simulator on the International Space Station. 'This is like the Uber shuttle. In case anybody calls, we'll be there in five minutes.' But his control of a virtual shuttle was nothing compared to Nathan Copeland's dexterity with the robotic hand protruding from his wheelchair.  Copeland, who is paralyzed, explained that he was able to use his mind to control the arm remotely, and could even feel sensation through it - making him the first person in the world to use such technology.  Hand it to him: Obama was astonished to meet Nathan Copeland (left), who is the first person to use a mind-controlled robotic arm that allows them to feel sensation  'What a story,' Obama said incredulously, before offering up a handshake and a much cooler fist-bump. But the President's cultivated air of cool was no match for the geek power on display at the show. The Harvard-trained lawyer, who has never been shy about his fascination with science and technology, gawked at a self-flying quadcopter, or mini-drone. Brass knuckles? Obama greeted Copeland, who is paralyzed, with a fist-bump - a moment of cool during his enthusiastically geeky day at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University He goofed around with ten-month-old baby Rowan Wright, whom he spotted wearing a Nasa T-shirt. And he showed short shrift for those who 'willfully ignore facts or stick their hands in the sand' on issues like global warming. 'Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us to space, we didn't deny that Sputnik was up there. That wouldn't have worked,' Obama said.  'No, we acknowledged the facts and then built a space program almost overnight, and then beat them to the moon.'

The geek-in-chief was in his element Thursday as he toured cutting-edge projects during a White House Frontiers Conference. Obama beamed as he took the chair of a Boeing Starliner Flight Simulator, with its panoply of buttons and monitors and futuristic gizmos. "Right, left, left," his trainer said, urging minute course corrections. "Your ride is here, baby," Obama said after docking the simulator on the International Space Station. "This is like the Uber shuttle. In case anybody calls, we'll be there in five minutes." Minutes later, the president gawked at a self-directed quadcopter, or mini-drone, used to inspect infrastructure like bridges. As a computer screen showed the drone's preset path, the drone moved up and down, left and right, emitting neon green light and whizzing loudly. He offered a presidential fist-bump to Nathan Copeland, a paralyzed man who is the first person who can feel sensation through his mind-controlled robotic arm. "What a story," Obama said incredulously. The Harvard-trained lawyer has never been shy about his fascination with all things scientific and high-tech. Over the years he's fired off a high-speed marshmallow air cannon at a White House science fair and rubbernecked at robots built by teenagers. He used his appearance Thursday to scoff at those who "willfully ignore facts or stick their hands in the sand," such as those who question global warming. "Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us to space, we didn't deny that Sputnik was up there. That wouldn't have worked," Obama said. "No, we acknowledged the facts and then built a space program almost overnight, and then beat them to the moon." Urging a new aspiration for the nation, Obama has set a goal to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, and in Pittsburgh he got a look at the SpaceX Dragon Spacecraft, part of ongoing research to develop vehicles that could transport astronauts to the red planet. Obama remarked at the white capsule's petite size. "It's like putting up with Sasha and Malia in the back of the car," he said. "It's a long car ride." ___ Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Home World news Obama to campaign for Clinton, Ohio Democrats as 2016 map narrows Obama to campaign for Clinton, Ohio Democrats as 2016 map narrows President Barack Obama will try to rev up Democrats in Ohio during a two-day visit, as the number of states that could swing to either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump narrows to just a handful. By: Associated Press | Washington | Published: October 14, 2016 4:23 AM US President Barack Obama. (Reuters) President Barack Obama will try to rev up Democrats in Ohio during a two-day visit, as the number of states that could swing to either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump narrows to just a handful. Obama heads to Columbus on Thursday to be the featured speaker at an annual dinner benefiting Ohio Democrats and Gov. Ted Strickland, who is running to oust incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman. On Friday, Obama will hold a rally in Cleveland for Clinton emphasizing early voting, a major focus for Democrats across the U.S. this year. This week Obama entered the final 100 days of his presidency, and he’s increasingly devoting his time to trying to push Clinton over the finish line in the presidential race. With Trump and Republicans threatening to undo much of what Obama has accomplished over the last eight years, campaigning for Democrats is the most productive way for Obama to try to protect his legacy. Before flying to Ohio, Obama planned to speak in Pittsburgh at the ”White House Frontiers Conference,” where aides said he’d announce new funding for technology and research and tout innovations like self-driving cars and artificial intelligence. Obama, in an op-ed in the magazine Wired, said the U.S. needed to adapt its skills to address emerging threats like antibiotic-resistant ”superbugs,” cybersecurity and climate change. ”To accelerate that change, we need science,” Obama said. In Pittsburgh, the president checked out a few projects, including a Boeing flight simulator, a drone and a mind-controlled robotic arm, before he addressed the conference. Obama, who has not kept his love for science a secret, appeared to be having too much fun after he sat in what looked like part of a small cockpit, with an abundance of lights, buttons and knobs. He joked about not wanting to crash because ”this is really expensive stuff.” ”Your ride is here, baby,” Obama said, stepping out of the simulator. ”This is like the Uber shuttle. In case anybody calls, we’ll be there in five minutes.” Ohio, with its diverse mix of cities and rural areas, is a coveted prize every four years, seen as a barometer for the shifts in the nation’s political climate. This year, it’s one of just four states that polls suggest are currently toss-ups between Clinton and Trump, along with Nevada, North Carolina and Florida. Trump, too, was setting his sights on Ohio on Thursday, with a speech in Columbus and an evening rally in Cincinnati. The shrinking of the political battlefield reflects demographic shifts that have benefited Democrats in several states and Trump’s struggles to expand his appeal to a broad cross-section of America. But Obama and Democrats have been wary not to take anything for granted, particularly as the final weeks of the campaign have taken a series of unpredictable turns. Obama and his wife, Michelle, are two of the country’s most popular Democrats, making them the most effective voices to vouch publicly for Clinton. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that makes the first couple particularly useful in freeing up Clinton to focus her limited time elsewhere. ”The real value of having somebody as high-profile as the president or the first lady on the stump campaigning for you is that you don’t have to also go there in order to get attention. You’ve got somebody else there who can make a forceful case in support of your candidacy,” Earnest said. Hoping that broad disdain for Trump will sink other Republican candidates, Democrats have been particularly bullish this year about retaking the Senate, which would significantly strengthen Clinton’s hand legislatively should she win the White House. Democrats had expected Strickland’s race to be one of their better prospects to win a GOP-held Senate seat, but he has been running consistently behind Portman in the polls. Yet in a sign of how toxic Trump has become for other Republicans, Portman revoked his support for Trump after video emerged of Trump making offensive comments about women. Portman has said he’s backing Trump’s running mate Mike Pence instead. Please Wait while comments are loading...

By Jennine Zeleznik The Monitor PHARR Fire Marshal Juan Ruiz climbed over piles of discarded metal beams Tuesday morning, making his way toward the fire alarm box in a back room of Pharrs newest nightclub, Graham Central Station. The $2 million club, located in El Centro Mall, has been under construction since March and is slated for a grand opening Friday. Turning to the contractors around him, Ruiz explained what needed to be done to bring the system and other parts of the building up to code in time for the big day. Were going to do everything we can to have it ready by Thursday morning, said Ed Derveda, a fire alarm and sprinkler contractor. When complete, Graham Central will houses seven mini-nightclubs under one roof and should hold more than 3,000 people. It is expected to generate between $3 million and $5 million annually. But first, it has to get done. We will be working day and night, around the clock, to get this club finished, said general contractor George Elizondo of Geoval Properties LLC. Workers on Tuesday were finishing the dance floors in the Tejano, country and disco/80s sections of the club, while others cemented tiles or fine-tuned the laser lights in the entryway. Unconnected wires still hung in bunches from ceilings, and electrical extension cords crisscrossed the brightly striped carpet. Weve got a lot to do, but were tying up the ends there, getting things done, said James DeBerry, supervisor of construction at the club. Were doing the last minute preparations and checks, making sure all the equipment works correctly and all the supplies are in place. Owner Gary Graham said the club employs more than 140 people, between its security, bartenders, waitstaff and an in-house singing group. This is the largest nightclub Ive ever seen and we own 48 others, Graham said, looking around at the 50,000-square-foot complex. For $5, people 18 and older will be admitted to all seven of the miniclubs, which also include salsa/meringue music, karaoke, a sports bar and a Top 40 dance section. The (Rio Grande) Valley certainly lends itself to a variety of music venues, DeBerry said. Folks here seem to like more types of music and enjoy it all. And thats what were here to give them. People under 21 will be issued numbered wristbands in exchange for their IDs, which will be put in a book with the same number as their wristbands. At the end of the night, or when they want to leave, they come back, get the wristband cut off and our employees will reissue them their ID, DeBerry said. In a club so large, this system allows for better alcohol control, he said, and is used by the Grahams other clubs throughout the country. Curtains are scheduled to go up at 8 p.m. Friday for more fun than you can possibly stand, DeBerry said, laughing. Discuss Print Posted in Life on Friday, August 23, 2002 12:00 am.

President Obama plays the fool with baby wearing a Nasa t-shirt and fist-bumps a paralyzed man's mind-controlled robotic hand at science fair Obama appeared at the White House Frontiers Conference Thursday The Pittsburgh event gave him the chance to geek out with technology He fist-bumped a man using a mind-controlled robotic arm And he piloted a virtual spaceship into the International Space Station But he also took the time to warn against denying climate change And he said America must embrace scientific development By Associated Press and James Wilkinson For Dailymail.com Published: 17:51 EST, 13 October 2016 | Updated: 21:50 EST, 13 October 2016 e-mail 1.1k shares 124 View comments Barack Obama might be the most powerful man in the world, but at heart he's just a science nerd - as he proved while touring the White House Frontiers Conference Thursday. The commander-in-geek was clearly in his element as he stepped off Air Force One in Pittburgh and headed to the event, which showcases thrilling innovations in tech. There, a clearly delighted President fist-bumped a paralyzed man who uses a mind-controlled robotic hand, goofed around with a baby in a Nasa T-shirt and got a taste of astronaut life.  Geek power: Self-confessed science geek Barack Obama hangs out with his ten-month-old counterpart Rowan Wright at the White House Frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh Thursday Space commander: Obama managed to successfully dock into the ISS using this  official flight simulator, joking that it was like driving an Uber The President beamed as he took docked a virtual shuttle into the International Space Station on a Boeing Starliner Flight Simulator that had been installed at the event, held in Carnegie Mellon University. 'Your ride is here, baby,' Obama said after docking the simulator on the International Space Station. 'This is like the Uber shuttle. In case anybody calls, we'll be there in five minutes.' But his control of a virtual shuttle was nothing compared to Nathan Copeland's dexterity with the robotic hand protruding from his wheelchair.  Copeland, who is paralyzed, explained that he was able to use his mind to control the arm remotely, and could even feel sensation through it - making him the first person in the world to use such technology.  Hand it to him: Obama was astonished to meet Nathan Copeland (left), who is the first person to use a mind-controlled robotic arm that allows them to feel sensation  'What a story,' Obama said incredulously, before offering up a handshake and a much cooler fist-bump. But the President's cultivated air of cool was no match for the geek power on display at the show. The Harvard-trained lawyer, who has never been shy about his fascination with science and technology, gawked at a self-flying quadcopter, or mini-drone. Brass knuckles? Obama greeted Copeland, who is paralyzed, with a fist-bump - a moment of cool during his enthusiastically geeky day at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University He goofed around with ten-month-old baby Rowan Wright, whom he spotted wearing a Nasa T-shirt. And he showed short shrift for those who 'willfully ignore facts or stick their hands in the sand' on issues like global warming. 'Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us to space, we didn't deny that Sputnik was up there. That wouldn't have worked,' Obama said.  'No, we acknowledged the facts and then built a space program almost overnight, and then beat them to the moon.'

Embraer, the world's third-largest commercial plane-maker after Boeing and Airbus, is under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations it violated anti-corruption regulations in sales outside Brazil. The company "is looking to finalize definitive agreements with the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States to resolve the allegations," it said in a statement released Wednesday. It is also in talks with Brazilian authorities to settle a local investigation, it said. Embraer's stock rose more than three percent on the New York stock exchange and 1.5 percent in Sao Paulo Thursday morning. The international corruption probe was opened after officials in the Dominican Republic allegedly accepted a $3.5 million bribe to buy eight of Embraer's Super Tucano military planes. Former Dominican defense minister Rafael Pena Antonio and three other people were arrested in August in the case. Embraer said it would give details on the settlement deals once they were complete. The company had set aside $200 million in the second quarter to settle the allegations. That helped push it into the red as it lost nearly $100 million for the quarter amid falling demand for executive jets.

The UAE is the largest US export market in the Middle East surpassing Saudi Arabia, Turkey and India. This is due to a strong focus on the defence, health care, oil and gas and education sectors,” said Sharief Fahmy. The total US exports to the UAE have reached $22.98 billion (Dh84.33 billion) last year surpassing other regional trade partners including Saudi Arabia ($19.69 billion), India ($21.53 billion), Turkey ($9.56 billion) and Egypt ($4.75 billion, according to figures provided by AmCham Abu Dhabi. The top exports were transportation equipment including aircraft and commercial aviation equipment accounting for $8.7 billion. There is also a huge presence of the US companies in the UAE with the number exceeding more than 1500 in different sectors including aerospace, finance, oil and gas, health care, tourism among others. Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Raytheon are some of the companies in the defence and aerospace sector. In the oil and gas, Occidental petroleum has a tie up with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) in the development of Shah gas oilfield in the Western region on Abu Dhabi and Exxon Mobil has concession agreement with Adnoc in the development of the emirate’s offshore oilfields. From the UAE side, Abu Dhabi based Mubadala has $6 billion investment in GlobalFoundries, a semiconductors manufacturer based in California. “We’ve seen consistent growth in trade between the two countries and moving forward I see the relationship strengthening further with boost in investment and trade.” With the UAE planning to diversify their economy due to drop in oil prices and the introduction of the bankruptcy law next year, the number of US companies in the UAE is likely to go up. “The introduction of bankruptcy law is going to benefit our SMEs significantly. A lot of companies will feel more secure to invest in the UAE.” The UAE bankruptcy law approved by the UAE Cabinet last month is likely to come into effect early next year. The new law will pave the way for companies in financial distress to restructure and allow the possibility of getting fresh loans under terms set by the law. When asked whether change in the guard in the US after the elections in November will have any impact on the bilateral trade relations, he said business will continue to progress irrespective of whether a democrat or a republican candidate wins the elections. “From a chamber perspective, we are non-partisan. We’ve been fortunate with Obama administration and the policies that came out in the last eight years. We expect the same spirit to continue whether it is Trump or Clinton administration.” He said the Obama administration has attached special significance to the UAE with the US administration sending invitations to Emirati companies to come and be part of the select USA Investments Summit in Washington DC in June this year. Thirteen companies represented the UAE and received special status with private meetings with the US Secretary of Commerce Pritzker, he added. Set up in 1986, AmCham Abu Dhabi is represented by more than 600 American and Emirati companies including Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and big corporations with huge investments in the UAE.   More from Investment Waha Capital profit down 31% to Dh82m in Q3 Iran mulls new investment rules Paris pact opens $265b business opportunities Dubai, China share big ambitions and projects Buffett cash at record as operating profit rises Early Madoff investor’s estate settles suit B.R.

With the U.K. government poised to decide on the location of a new landing strip to serve pent up demand in southeast England, Cruz said Wednesday that the case for expanding Heathrow is “overwhelming” and that any decision to focus growth on the rival Gatwick airport would be “astonishing.” British Airways, the biggest U.K. carrier, has major operations at both bases. Cruz, who became CEO of BA in April, said Heathrow should not be expanded “at any cost” and that his airline “wouldn’t react very well” if a so-called runway tax was levied against users to fund the plan, arguing that the facility’s shareholders should bear development costs. BA parent IAG SA has hubs at four other airports so that growth could easily be directed elsewhere, though there’s no question of the group abandoning Heathrow, he added. Despite the funding concerns there’s “no business case” for building a second runway at Gatwick, with insufficient demand from airlines and passengers alike, Cruz told British Air Transport Association members in his first speaking engagement since joining BA from IAG’s Vueling discount arm. “That’s why the airport’s two biggest users, ourselves and EasyJet, do not support the idea,” he said, referring to the low-cost carrier that also backs growth at Heathrow. Announcement Due Prime Minister Theresa May’s government could make an announcement on a new runway imminently, according to the British Broadcasting Corp., though other reports suggest one is more likely to come next week. Adding an extra runway would allow Heathrow to handle about 135 million passengers a year, up from 75 million now, at a cost of 18 billion pounds ($22 billion). Politicians have been debating the case for growth at Heathrow for years, with May’s predecessor David Cameron delaying a decision even when a state-appointed commission backed the airport over Gatwick after senior figures in his own Conservative Party expressed concern about the environmental impact. Cruz said that while BA is “nervous” about uncertainty created by Britain’s vote to quit the European Union, the carrier will still increase capacity next year and is set to announce new short- and long-haul routes in coming months. “We just have to get over it,” he said. “We are trying to leverage the currency situation to make Britain a desired destination. Let’s get as many Americans as we can coming to the U.K. because of the stronger dollar in comparison with the pound.” The executive said he met with Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond and lobbed him to remove air passenger duty to spur traffic. Cruz reiterated that IAG, as International Consolidated Airlines Group SA is known, expects to post a “significant” gain in operating profit this year, though the increase won’t match that generated in 2015 in absolute terms. Fleet Plans A capital markets day next month will make clearer the carrier’s fleet plans and any interest that London-based IAG has in taking extra planes including used Boeing Co. 777-300ERs and Airbus Group SE A380 superjumbos, he said in an interview after his speech. Willie Walsh, the group’s CEO and Cruz’s boss, said in February that he was looking at the possibility. Cruz said there is also interest in longer-range single-aisle models, Boeing’s 777X upgrade and the Airbus A330, which is performing well at the Iberia unit. The executive said June 23’s Brexit vote has “muddied the waters a bit” for U.K. airlines aiming to participate further in consolidation because it’s not clear what future rules will allow. While the EU permits mergers among carriers within the bloc, there’s a 49 percent ownership cap for outside operators. Commenting on the rescue of Britain’s Monarch Airlines Ltd. via a 165 million-pound ($202 million) injection from Greybull Capital LLP, Cruz said he was happy the carrier had survived but that the situation presented “an opportunity for some further rationalization of the market and it hasn’t happened.” The CEO praised moves toward German consolidation in the face of increasing competition from Ryanair Holdings Plc, where Air Berlin Plc plans to operate as many as 40 jets for Deutsche Lufthansa AG and is also exploring a merger of its tourism operations with the local airline division of holiday giant TUI AG. “They’re trying,” he said. “They have a huge threat, which is the big bad wolf from Ireland coming in and saying ‘we’re going to take 20 percent market share, get ready.’ For Lufthansa that’s a big threat. The sort of things they’re doing, while a bit controversial, appear to be going in the right direction.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The US Air Force is looking to replace the wings of its 235 single-seat F-15C and twin-seat F-15D aircraft as it looks to maintain the type in service through to 2045. (US Air Force) An industry day for the F-15C Service-Life Extension Program (SLEP) is being held at Robins Air Force Base (AFB) in Georgia on 13 October to consider options for the re-winging of all 235 F-15C/D aircraft in the USAF's inventory to see the type through to its projected out-of-service date of 2045. As noted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website, the new wing will be the same stronger unit as that fitted to the F-15E Strike Eagle variant; be capable of 14 years of flying at current worst usage severity before needing depot-level inspections; maintain the current F-15C/D outer-mould line and existing fuselage interfaces; maintain compatibility with the original aerodynamic and structural properties; show airworthiness compliance without additional full-scale durability testing; and be compatible with all existing aircraft and weapons systems to include fuel, hydraulic, electrical, and environment control systems. Industry day briefing slides posted on the day of the event note that the USAF is looking to receive the first three production prototype wing sets in fiscal year (FY) 2020. Delivery of 10 low-rate initial production (LRIP) sets will take place in 2022, to be followed by the remaining full-rate production (FRP) wings at a rate of about 40 a year through to 2028. Companies attending the industry day comprise the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) Boeing; current wing manufacturer Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI); and sub-contractors CPI Aerostructures, Yulista Aviation, Constellium, Kitco Defense, Cherokee Nation Aerospace and Defense, FQ&P Aviation Limited, and Herndon Products. A formal request for proposals (RfP) is expected to be issued in the fourth quarter of FY 2017. Want to read more?

China to dominate space within 10 YEARS as it becomes only nation with permanent orbital outpost International Space Station expected to go out of operation in a decade, leaving the People's Republic alone in space by JASPER HAMILL 13th October 2016, 12:10 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments China is expecting to dominate space within the next 10 years. A top military official has claimed the People’s Republic will be the only nation with a permanent base in space by 2024, when the America-backed International Space Station will reach the end of its life. 2 A Chinese Long March rocket and the Tiangong-1 space station, which is currently out of control and expected to hurtle back into the Earth next year Lei Fanpei, chairman of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, told Xinhua that his country “plans to launch the experimental core module of its space station around 2018 with a Long March 5 heavyload carrier rocket, and the 20 ton combination space station will be sent into orbit around 2022”. This could leave “China’s space station may be the only one left in service”, the news service reported. The International Space Station is nearing the end of its life, with no clear agreement to replace it in place. NASA has tasked Boeing with figuring out how to extend the lifespan of the ISS from 2020 to 2028, but it is not yet clear how it will achieve this. Once China’s space station is up and running by 2022, it is likely that Beijing will seek to use space in some sort of military capacity, potentially sparking an orbital arms race. Xu Qiliang, a senior Chinese air force commander, has said the militarisation of space “is a historical inevitability and a development that cannot be turned back”. “As far as the revolution in military affairs is concerned, the competition between military forces is moving towards outer space,” he told the People’s Liberation Army Daily.

Donald Trump recently said he wants to improve the US governments ability to wage war from space. The presidential candidate has said he would focus on enhancing the “combat lethality” of the military space programme. Trumps wish to focus on military aspects of the space programme may have sprung from revelations earlier this year the Chinese and Russia were developing “space weapons”. US Admiral Cecil D. Haney, commander of the US Strategic Command told an audience at the the Centre for a New American Security in January: “Adversaries and potential adversaries are developing, and in some cases demonstrating, disruptive and destructive counterspace capabilities. “Furthermore, they are exploiting what they perceive as space vulnerabilities—threatening the vital, national, civil, scientific and economic benefits to the U.S. and the global community.” A terrifying intergalactic 'blob' is on a collision course with our home galaxy We pay for your stories!

Be prepared for irreversible damage to your brain Written by Akshat Rathi Obsession Life as Laboratory October 13, 2016 Keep dreaming. (SpaceX) Share Written by Akshat Rathi Obsession Life as Laboratory October 13, 2016 You can’t go many days without someone talking about going to Mars. Just in the last few weeks: Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, laid out his plans to sell tickets to the red planet for $200,000; Dennis Muilenburg, CEO of Boeing, vowed to get there before Musk; and US president Barack Obama reiterated his plans to send humans to Mars by 2030. Before these fantasies become reality, there are many problems to overcome. One of them might be the most difficult: how to stop astronauts from suffering irreversible damage to brain functions that are crucial to completing a space mission? This damage is predicted to be caused by space radiation. When we’re on Earth, the planet’s magnetic field shields us from most of it. A spacecraft’s hull can’t provide that level of protection. The result, a 2015 study predicted, would be brain damage that would affect astronauts’ cognitive powers. The study was done on mice, who were exposed to a space-equivalent dose of radiation in the form of charged oxygen and titanium particles. Then, the mice were observed for six weeks and given a battery of cognitive tests. As Quartz reported then: When compared to mice who were not exposed to radiation, the irradiated mice performed far worse. On being shown familiar objects, these mice weren’t interested. They also lacked curiosity towards new objects. Now, the same researchers have gone a step further. They’ve observed irradiated mice for longer and looked in more detail at the sort of damage radiation can cause in the brain. In the new study, published in Scientific Reports, they find that the prefrontal cortex of the mice, which is the area of the brain responsible for making decisions and moderating social behavior, had fewer neural connections than the brains of mice who weren’t exposed. The irradiated mice were more anxious, weren’t able to control fear, and had reduced cognitive powers. Worse still, this brain damage lasted at least 24 weeks with no apparent sign of improvement. The implication is that it was probably irreversible. As Quartz reported previously: Space radiation is so harmful because its high-energy particles leave tracks of damage in cells and tissue that are difficult for the body’s repair system to fix. This occurs because the ionized particles are like bullets inside of bullets: Once the big bullet manages to enter cells or tissue, it causes further damage by firing off many more smaller bullets. Mice are not men, so the study’s results can only estimate how such radiation will affect human brains. It’s worth noting, however, that the dose of radiation used in the study (about 210 milliSieverts, equivalent to about 600 chest X-rays) is smaller than the 300 milliSieverts that NASA estimates (pdf, p. 9) humans would be exposed to during just the first six months of a mission to Mars. Adding metal shielding to spacecraft could help, but it’s prohibitively expensive. The heavier the craft, the more fuel it has to carry for launch. Another option is to take drugs that counter radiation. Perhaps the most inventive idea involves using the astronauts’ urine and feces as shielding. Water shields better against this sort of radiation than metal; the ship could store its water supply in a hull cavity that surrounds the crew quarters, and replace it with human waste as the water supply is used up, stored in special bags that extract the water out of the human waste for reuse.

In particular, the Ground Based Mid-Course Defense or GMD program is one that Huntsville impacts.  "The GMD is our ICBM defense of the homeland, and our only ICBM defense today", said Colonel (retired) Dewey Granger, who works for Boeing now.  GMD works by having a modified ICBM, called a Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) be launched towards an incoming ballistic missile and directly hitting it, called "hit to kill". THis is the equivalent of hitting a bullet with another bullet.  The actual missile was built by Orbital ATK, the warhead by Raytheon, and the command and control system was built by Northrop Grumman. But Boeing has been the prime contractor since 1998.  Right now there are between 30-44 GBI's deployed at Vandenberg AFB in California, and the plan is to reach the full level by the end of 2017.  They're operated by the 100th Missile Defense Brigade, controlled by Space and Missile Defense Command at Redstone Arsenal.  Jeff Martin Follow Jeff Martin Close Get email notifications on Jeff Martin daily!

By: Reuters | Nairobi | Published:October 13, 2016 12:51 pm Kenya Airways said KALPA’s call for a strike was unjustified, adding half-year results due to be released at the end of October would show a surge in passenger numbers and a reduction in losses. (Source: Google maps) Kenya Airways said on Thursday it will be forced to halt ticket sales unless its pilots withdraw a strike threat that has prompted cancellations by worried passengers. The pilots’ union, Kenya Airline Pilots Association (KALPA), has called for an indefinite strike from Tuesday to protest at what it describes as poor management of the airline. “The threatened action is already costing Kenya Airways significant losses as passengers have begun to make cancellations,” the airline said in a statement. “If KALPA does not forthwith retract its statement, Kenya Airways will have to immediately stop selling tickets.” Kenya Airways, which carries 12,000 passengers a day in a fleet on Boeing and Embraer planes, has been hit in recent years by falling earnings triggered by a decline in the number of visitors to Kenya. Tourism has been hurt by security worries stoked by Somali Islamist group al Shabaab’s attacks in the country, in apparent retaliation for Kenya’s military deployment in Somalia. KALPA is pressing for chief executive Mbuvi Ngunze and the chair of the airline’s board, Dennis Awori, to be fired, saying it is not confident in their ability to drive its recovery. Kenya Airways said KALPA’s call for a strike was unjustified, adding half-year results due to be released at the end of October would show a surge in passenger numbers and a reduction in losses. A strike, it said, could cause it to lose the support of financiers and suppliers that it is in negotiations with.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Monday November 14, 2016 Life & Style Technology Larger / SmallerNight Mode Samsung's woes highlight explosive limits of lithium batteries Jeremy Wagstaff 13 Oct 2016, 4:14 p.m. Consumer demand for smaller, longer lasting devices is forcing manufacturers to push the technology to the limits, battery experts say. Samsung's woes highlight explosive limits of lithium batteries A Panasonic lithium-ion flexible battery that's just 0.55 millimeters thick: Producers are pushing to develop ever smaller batteries, but there's a safety issue. Photo: Koji Ueda Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Lithium-based batteries have been powering our portable devices for 25 years. But consumer demand for smaller, longer lasting devices is forcing manufacturers to push the technology, battery experts say, testing the limits of how much energy they can safely pack into smaller spaces. "A battery is really a bomb that releases its energy in a controlled way," says Qichao Hu, a former researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and founder of SolidEnergy Systems, a battery startup. "There are fundamental safety issues to all batteries, and as you get to higher energy density and faster charge, the barrier to explosion is less and less." On Tuesday, Samsung Electronics scrapped its flagship Note 7 smartphone and told customers return their devices after weeks of bruising reports of phones igniting and images of scorched handsets. In early September, the world's largest smartphone maker blamed "a very rare manufacturing process error" for the problems. It has said it is still investigating reports of fires in a second, supposedly safe, batch of phones. Exactly what caused the problems will be the subject of detailed studies by regulators, the company and its suppliers. Experts are baffled by what could be causing the overheating in the replacement phones, if not the batteries. Samsung says it would be "premature to speculate" on the outcome of its investigations. "We are reviewing every step of our engineering, manufacturing and quality control processes," Samsung said in an emailed response to Reuters. An official at the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards, which is also investigating, said the fault in the replacement devices might not be the same as the problem in the original product. Both Samsung SDI and Amperex Technology, which supply batteries to Samsung Electronics, declined to comment. Samsung's Note 7 crisis may be its biggest, but the problems with lithium-ion are not new. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued recalls for battery packs, snow blowers, flashlights and power recliners in the past year, all because of fires caused by lithium-ion batteries. In 2013, Boeing was forced to ground its entire fleet of advanced 787 jetliners after some lithium-ion batteries caught fire. The fleet was allowed to resume flights after changes were made to the battery and charger, and to better contain battery fires. "We remain confident in the comprehensive improvements made to the 787 battery system following this event, and in the overall performance of the battery system and the safety of the airplane," Boeing said in 2014 after an investigation into one incident. Light-weight, high energy Lithium is the lightest of all metals, and can pack a lot of energy into a small volume - making it perfect for batteries. The market has grown from a few hundred million cells in 2000 to 8 billion last year, according to Albemarle, a US chemical company. But for the same reason, lithium-ion batteries need safety mechanisms built in, adding to production costs. And with prices falling 14 per cent per year for the past 15 years, according to Albemarle, smaller scale players have scrimped on safety, says Lewis Larsen, CEO of Lattice Energy, a consultancy. There is no evidence Samsung or its battery suppliers cut corners with the Note 7, and Tony Olson, CEO of consultancy D2 Worldwide, said the problem was not limited to cheaper products. He ran tests on batteries in laptops a decade ago, highlighting the dangers of them catching fire. Some 9.6 million Sony laptop batteries were subsequently recalled. But when Olsen repeated the tests on other laptop batteries seven years later he found that "very little had changed in battery safety design, despite being under tremendous scrutiny." Sony, HP, Toshiba and Panasonic have all recalled laptop battery packs this year over fire hazards, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Panasonic, which supplied the batteries, said the problem was caused by manufacturing issues which it had now resolved. Asked about Samsung's woes last week, Panasonic CEO Kazuhiro Tsuga told reporters lithium ion batteries could become prone to fires when density was raised and fast charging was applied. "It's a trade-off between that (risk) and benefits. We place the biggest priority on safety," Tsuga said. "With current technologies, it's extremely difficult to make it zero chance of such incidents." Greater demands Before the era of smartphones, users didn't require much of their device - a few phone calls, a few SMS messages. The phone of today, however, needs to do a lot more, and is in constant use. According to eMarketer, an advertising consultancy, Chinese mobile users, for example, spend nearly twice as long on their smartphone as they did four years ago. This in turn has pushed manufacturers into making their screens bigger and their devices more powerful, packing more energy into smaller spaces. And however sophisticated the materials, "they're not 100 per cent safe and they never will be," said Larsen, the consultant. "What we're seeing from the standpoint of lithium-ion technology is they're beginning to reach the safe energy density limits of that technology." But experts are divided on that point. Brandon Ng, whose Hong Kong startup QFE plans to sell refrigerator-sized batteries to replace diesel generators, said there is still room for improvements. "There is still a lot of developmental headroom with lithium-ion batteries in terms of increasing the energy they can store." Long-promised new technologies to make batteries safer are around the corner. Tim Grejtak, an analyst at Lux Research, said there are dozens of startups working on the issue, but the scientific problems were hard to solve and would take time. Among the most promising candidates, according to Grejtak, is California-based Blue Current, which is working on a high density, low flammable battery using gel electrolytes. Massachusetts-based SolidEnergy Systems is working on a lithium metal battery which founder Hu says takes up half the space of existing batteries. It will be used first in high altitude drones, he says, and in consumer devices, including smartphones, by 2018.

But, for several reasons — including the end of the Cold War, budget constraints, or technical challenges — humans haven’t yet stepped foot on another planet. But President Obama wants to stake his legacy on that dream. In an op-ed penned for CNN, he laid out a plan to send people to Mars and return them safely to Earth by the mid-2030s. He opens the piece by describing the profound effect that space flight had on him as a child. Growing up in Hawaii, he got to see astronauts coming back to Earth from their brief forays into space. President Obama, as many other scientists, historians, and leaders before him, believes in the power of space travel to inspire and encourage generations of young people to literally reach for the stars. Citing the recent discoveries of water on several of Jupiter’s moons, new knowledge about the Martian surface pouring in each day from the Curiosity rover, and the remarkable prevalence of Earth-like circling other stars, President Obama believes that exploring space isn’t just something we should do, it’s something we have to do. “We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America’s story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time,” he wrote. “Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators, and we’re already well on our way. Within the next two years, private companies will for the first time send astronauts to the International Space Station.” This sort of deep public-private partnership is emblematic of how the US tends to do its bigger projects, but this sort of collaboration is as yet unheard of in space flight. Part of that comes from the broader conflicts of interest. Governments can spend a huge amount of money ($25.4 billion, or $150 billion today for the Apollo program) on these sorts of plans. That lets agencies like NASA focus on safety and other goals that might not have a direct profit motive, but President Obama and the businesses NASA will likely be partnering with are confident that they can succeed. SpaceX’s Elon Musk revealed his own ideas for an interplanetary transport system (though we’d need to make huge advances in safety and rocket reliability to make that viable), Blue Origin managed an exceptional launch test earlier this month, and Boeing’s CEO said that he was “convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket. These are major steps in private space flight that demonstrate the sectors’ willingness to accept the tremendous upfront costs on the hopes that we might become a two planet species. That said, there’s still a lot more to be done. According to the National Research Council, the US still isn’t allocating enough public funds to achieve President Obama’s lofty goals. Even so, it’s clear President Obama wants to inspire the nation just as President Kennedy did in his 1961 “We choose to go to the Moon” speech. “Someday,” President Obama writes, “I hope to hoist my own grandchildren onto my shoulders. We’ll still look to the stars in wonder, as humans have since the beginning of time. But instead of eagerly awaiting the return of our intrepid explorers, we’ll know that because of the choices we make now, they’ve gone to space not just to visit, but to stay — and in doing so, to make our lives better here on Earth.” The president is expected to further detail his plan to colonize Mars at the White House Frontier Conference later this week in Pittsburgh. There he will lay out his plan for five “frontiers of innovation” that include the personal, local, national, global, and interplanetary which are expected to include policy discussions ranging from health care to climate change and space travel.

But consumer demand for smaller, longer lasting devices is forcing manufacturers to push the technology, battery experts say, testing the limits of how much energy they can safely pack into smaller spaces. “A battery is really a bomb that releases its energy in a controlled way,” says Qichao Hu, a former researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and founder of SolidEnergy Systems, a battery startup. “There are fundamental safety issues to all batteries, and as you get to higher energy density and faster charge, the barrier to explosion is less and less.” On Tuesday, Samsung Electronics scrapped its flagship Note 7 smartphone and told customers return their devices after weeks of bruising reports of phones igniting and images of scorched handsets. In early September, the world’s largest smartphone maker blamed “a very rare manufacturing process error” for the problems.  It has said it is still investigating reports of fires in a second, supposedly safe, batch of phones. Exactly what caused the problems will be the subject of detailed studies by regulators, the company and its suppliers. Experts are baffled by what could be causing the overheating in the replacement phones, if not the batteries.  Samsung says it would be “premature to speculate” on the outcome of its investigations. “We are reviewing every step of our engineering, manufacturing and quality control processes,” Samsung said in an emailed response to Reuters. An official at the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards, which is also investigating, said the fault in the replacement devices might not be the same as the problem in the original product. Both Samsung SDI and Amperex Technology Ltd (ATL), which supply batteries to Samsung Electronics, declined to comment. Samsung’s Note 7 crisis may be its biggest, but the problems with lithium-ion are not new. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued recalls for battery packs, snow blowers, hoverboards, flashlights and power recliners in the past year, all because of fires caused by lithium-ion batteries. In 2013, Boeing was forced to ground its entire fleet of advanced 787 jetliners after some lithium-ion batteries caught fire.  The fleet was allowed to resume flights after changes were made to the battery and charger, and to better contain battery fires. “We remain confident in the comprehensive improvements made to the 787 battery system following this event, and in the overall performance of the battery system and the safety of the airplane,” Boeing said in 2014 after an investigation into one incident. Light-weight, high-energy  Lithium is the lightest of all metals, and can pack a lot of energy into a small volume — making it perfect for batteries. The market has grown from a few hundred million cells in 2000 to 8 billion last year, according to Albemarle, a US chemical company. But for the same reason, lithium-ion batteries need safety mechanisms built in, adding to production costs. And with prices falling 14 percent per year for the past 15 years, according to Albemarle, smaller scale players have scrimped on safety, says Lewis Larsen, CEO of Lattice Energy, a consultancy. There is no evidence Samsung or its battery suppliers cut corners with the Note 7, and Tony Olson, CEO of consultancy D2 Worldwide, said the problem was not limited to cheaper products. He ran tests on batteries in laptops a decade ago, highlighting the dangers of them catching fire.  Some 9.6 million Sony Corp laptop batteries were subsequently recalled. But when Olsen repeated the tests on other laptop batteries seven years later he found that “very little had changed in battery safety design, despite being under tremendous scrutiny”. Sony, HP Inc, Toshiba Corp and Panasonic Corp have all recalled laptop battery packs this year over fire hazards, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Panasonic, which supplied the batteries, said the problem was caused by manufacturing issues which it had now resolved. Asked about Samsung's woes last week, Panasonic CEO Kazuhiro Tsuga told reporters lithiumion batteries could become prone to fires when density was raised and fast charging was applied. “It’s a trade-off between that (risk) and benefits. We place the biggest priority on safety,” Tsuga said.  “With current technologies, it's extremely difficult to make it zero chance of such incidents.” Greater demands  Before the era of smartphones, users didn’t require much of their device — a few phone calls, a few SMS messages.  The phone of today, however, needs to do a lot more, and is in constant use. According to eMarketer, an advertising consultancy, Chinese mobile users, for example, spend nearly twice as long on their smartphone as they did four years ago. This in turn has pushed manufacturers into making their screens bigger and their devices more powerful, packing more energy into smaller spaces.  And however sophisticated the materials, “they’re not 100 per cent safe and they never will be,” said Larsen, the consultant. “What we’re seeing from the standpoint of lithium-ion technology is they're beginning to reach the safe energy density limits of that technology.” But experts are divided on that point.  Brandon Ng, whose Hong Kong startup QFE plans to sell refrigerator-sized batteries to replace diesel generators, said there is still room for improvements. “There is still a lot of developmental headroom with lithium-ion batteries in terms of increasing the energy they can store.” Long-promised new technologies to make batteries safer are around the corner. Tim Grejtak, an analyst at Lux Research, said there are dozens of startups working on the issue, but the scientific problems were hard to solve and would take time. Among the most promising candidates, according to Grejtak, is California-based Blue Current, which is working on a high density, low flammable battery using gel electrolytes. Massachusetts-based SolidEnergy Systems is working on a lithium metal battery which founder Hu says takes up half the space of existing batteries.  It will be used first in high altitude drones, he says, and in consumer devices, including smartphones, by 2018. — Reuters                 MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week The best action cams for winter sports Facebook accidentally declares some users dead, including founder Zuckerberg Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Sony seeks to patent method for measuring journalists' accuracy Best smartphones for holiday 2016 Apple now sells refurbished iPhones China unveils first satellite smartphone Samsung apologises for Galaxy Note phones in US ads Robotic dinosaur replicas stomp in Tokyo hotel (VIDEO) Best smartphones for holiday 2016 Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Two killed as powerful earthquake hits New Zealand Reuters Video: F1 fans watch as Hamilton wins for first time in Brazil Reuters Video: Supermoon rises in Spain Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Related Articles Samsung’s folding smartphone could be taking shape Samsung ads on Note 7 fires: We are truly sorry South Korea’s Park willing to relinquish some power Samsung raided over probe into South Korea political scandal Samsung set to launch AI assistant service for Galaxy S8 Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Things to do in the Lehigh Valley this weekend Entertainment 'Robot Revolution' at Philly's Franklin Institute: See the future Robot Revolution, the new exhibit at the Franklin Institute, features more than 40 cutting edge robots. (CONTRIBUTED PHOTO / The Franklin Institute) Kathy Lauer-WilliamsContact ReporterOf The Morning Cal From robots that can do surgey to robots that can take on dangerous search and rescue missions, the most innov Standing in front of Cube Solver, one of 40 cutting-edge robots in a new exhibit at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, I twisted and turned a Rubik's Cube, jumbling the colors as fast as I could. After I returned it to the display, Cube Solver picked up the cube with its robotic arm. After flipping it around several times to examine every face of the cube, it started twisting and turning it. Eighteen seconds later the cube was solved, all faces matching in color. It's just one example of the amazing capabilities of today's robots. Across the room is Baxter, a robot whose face is a screen displaying hooded eyes that watch as it play tic-tac-toe with visitors. Baxter, developed to work alongside humans in factories, can even play two people simultaneously. From robots that can do surgery to robots that can take on dangerous search and rescue missions, the most innovative are on display in "Robot Revolution." The exhibit features robots curated from companies and universities across the world. More than half of the contraptions are interactive or can be operated. Many have rarely been seen in public.

John Beckham, curator and "chief robot hunter," says he helped hand-pick the machines. He describes them as the most "advanced and exciting robots from Japan to Poland to China." "The exhibit shows the amazing things robots can do for us and what they will do in the future," he says. "This is an unprecedented collection that showcases a diverse range of skills." The exhibit is organized into four sectors, each focusing on various aspects of robotics: Cooperation, Skills, Smarts and Locomotion. In the Smarts area, visitors see how machines are able to sense, plan and then act, while comparing and contrasting the ways in which humans and robots learn. In a simulation of a Google self-driving car, visitors can experience a drive, learn how the car operates using LiDAR sensors that assess road conditions and "see" obstacles in 360 degrees. Robotis-OP can follow a person's face and make "eye" contact using its visual tracking software. Visitors can see how a Roomba robotic vaccuum works and try out simple coding with a friendly robot guide. In the Skills area, visitors learn about the skills robots possess that mimic human capabilities. There are numerous types of "grippers" that pick up objects to try out. One demonstrates how robots can select and sort items with precision and speed by picking up M&Ms and sorting them by color. A five fingered gripping hand has nine motors and 20 joints and a bionic arm was inspired by the structure of an elephant trunk A humorous looking "two-armed bandit" robot will even challenge visitors to a game of blackjack. In the Cooperation area, visitors see robots that can enhance the lives of humans. The most adorable is Paro, a therapeutic fuzzy baby seal robot which has sensors that respond to touch. Pet it and it moves and makes a crying sound. Paro has been used with people suffering from dementia in nursing homes and hospitals in Australia, Europe, the U.S. and Japan. One display shows off the da Vinci Surgical System, a robotic system through which surgeons perform minimally invasive surgery for a wide range of operations. Since 2000, more than 2 million patients have had surgery with da Vinci. Make a funny face and EMYS will mimic your expression through advanced facial-coding technology. EMYS can look happy, sad, angry, afraid, disgusted and surprised. In Locomotion, visitors see the ways robots can move and how they can access places unsafe or inaccessible to people. Visitors can direct THES, a snake-like robot, to crawl through a series of see-through pipes. They also can control RHex, the six-legged robot inspired by the cockroach. Developed by the University of Pennsylvania, RHex can manuever through rugged terrain as it flips, turns and leaps. Robots similar to the TOPY OSCAR stair-climbing robot investigated radiation leaks after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011. Also on display is the one-pound Recon Scout Throwbot XT, which can be thrown up to 120 feet, or dropped from a 30-foot roof. This robot moves quietly and its infrared optical system enables it to see in complete darkness so it can be thrown into a dangerous situation to collect vital information. More than 4,500 are in use worldwide. In the Robo Garage, visitors can watch engineers help maintain the high-tech robots in an open technology lab, which Dubinski says he hopes will inspire students to consider a career in robotics. In front of the Robo Grage are two tables covered with interlocking robot building blocks called Cubelets. The magnetic blocks each contain a basic component, such as a battery or an engine, and snap together to make a machine that moves. An interactive Drone Zone show will take place several times an hour and miniature soccer robots will play a demonstration game on the hour. Also during the exhibit's run, the Franklin's IMAX theater is showing the National Geographic documentary "Robots."

But consumer demand for smaller, longer lasting devices is forcing manufacturers to push the technology, battery experts say, testing the limits of how much energy they can safely pack into smaller spaces. "A battery is really a bomb that releases its energy in a controlled way," says Qichao Hu, a former researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and founder of SolidEnergy Systems, a battery startup. "There are fundamental safety issues to all batteries, and as you get to higher energy density and faster charge, the barrier to explosion is less and less." On Tuesday, Samsung Electronics scrapped its flagship Note 7 smartphone and told customers return their devices after weeks of bruising reports of phones igniting and images of scorched handsets. In early September, the world's largest smartphone maker blamed "a very rare manufacturing process error" for the problems. It has said it is still investigating reports of fires in a second, supposedly safe, batch of phones. Exactly what caused the problems will be the subject of detailed studies by regulators, the company and its suppliers. Experts are baffled by what could be causing the overheating in the replacement phones, if not the batteries. Samsung says it would be "premature to speculate" on the outcome of its investigations. "We are reviewing every step of our engineering, manufacturing and quality control processes," Samsung said in an emailed response to Reuters. An official at the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards, which is also investigating, said the fault in the replacement devices might not be the same as the problem in the original product. Both Samsung SDI and Amperex Technology Ltd (ATL), which supply batteries to Samsung Electronics, declined to comment. Samsung's Note 7 crisis may be its biggest, but the problems with lithium-ion are not new. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued recalls for battery packs, snow blowers, hoverboards, flashlights and power recliners in the past year, all because of fires caused by lithium-ion batteries. In 2013, Boeing was forced to ground its entire fleet of advanced 787 jetliners after some lithium-ion batteries caught fire. The fleet was allowed to resume flights after changes were made to the battery and charger, and to better contain battery fires. "We remain confident in the comprehensive improvements made to the 787 battery system following this event, and in the overall performance of the battery system and the safety of the airplane," Boeing said in 2014 after an investigation into one incident. LIGHT-WEIGHT, HIGH ENERGY Lithium is the lightest of all metals, and can pack a lot of energy into a small volume - making it perfect for batteries. The market has grown from a few hundred million cells in 2000 to 8 billion last year, according to Albemarle, a U.S. chemical company. But for the same reason, lithium-ion batteries need safety mechanisms built in, adding to production costs. And with prices falling 14 percent per year for the past 15 years, according to Albemarle, smaller scale players have scrimped on safety, says Lewis Larsen, CEO of Lattice Energy, a consultancy. There is no evidence Samsung or its battery suppliers cut corners with the Note 7, and Tony Olson, CEO of consultancy D2 Worldwide, said the problem was not limited to cheaper products. He ran tests on batteries in laptops a decade ago, highlighting the dangers of them catching fire. Some 9.6 million Sony Corp laptop batteries were subsequently recalled. But when Olsen repeated the tests on other laptop batteries seven years later he found that "very little had changed in battery safety design, despite being under tremendous scrutiny." Sony, HP Inc, Toshiba Corp and Panasonic Corp have all recalled laptop battery packs this year over fire hazards, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Panasonic, which supplied the batteries, said the problem was caused by manufacturing issues which it had now resolved. Asked about Samsung's woes last week, Panasonic CEO Kazuhiro Tsuga told reporters lithium ion batteries could become prone to fires when density was raised and fast charging was applied. "It's a trade-off between that (risk) and benefits. We place the biggest priority on safety," Tsuga said. "With current technologies, it's extremely difficult to make it zero chance of such incidents." GREATER DEMANDS Before the era of smartphones, users didn't require much of their device - a few phone calls, a few SMS messages. The phone of today, however, needs to do a lot more, and is in constant use. According to eMarketer, an advertising consultancy, Chinese mobile users, for example, spend nearly twice as long on their smartphone as they did four years ago. This in turn has pushed manufacturers into making their screens bigger and their devices more powerful, packing more energy into smaller spaces. And however sophisticated the materials, "they're not 100 percent safe and they never will be," said Larsen, the consultant. "What we're seeing from the standpoint of lithium-ion technology is they're beginning to reach the safe energy density limits of that technology." But experts are divided on that point. Brandon Ng, whose Hong Kong startup QFE plans to sell refrigerator-sized batteries to replace diesel generators, said there is still room for improvements. "There is still a lot of developmental headroom with lithium-ion batteries in terms of increasing the energy they can store." Long-promised new technologies to make batteries safer are around the corner. Tim Grejtak, an analyst at Lux Research, said there are dozens of startups working on the issue, but the scientific problems were hard to solve and would take time. Among the most promising candidates, according to Grejtak, is California-based Blue Current, which is working on a high density, low flammable battery using gel electrolytes. Massachusetts-based SolidEnergy Systems is working on a lithium metal battery which founder Hu says takes up half the space of existing batteries. It will be used first in high altitude drones, he says, and in consumer devices, including smartphones, by 2018.

(Courtesy Glenn Carberry) Published October 17. 2016 12:01AM  GLENN CARBERRY, Special to The Day When you live along the eastern seaboard, it is difficult to appreciate the differences between our region and the coastline of the Pacific Northwest. The Northeast Corridor, which consists of large and small cities located between Boston and Washington, is sometimes characterized as a single metropolis with close to 56 million people. In contrast, the sparsely populated northwest features wide beaches, spectacular mountains and a few cities with a reputation for cleanliness, friendliness and outdoor living. We recently had an opportunity to visit some interesting destinations along the Pacific coast by land and by sea and enjoyed it immensely. Ironically, there is considerable debate as to how to define the Pacific Northwest. Most people agree that it includes the states of Oregon, Washington and the Vancouver area of the Canadian province of British Columbia. Others believe that the geographically and climatically similar parts of California located from San Francisco north are also part of the Pacific Northwest. It is difficult to do justice to this vast area in a short article, but here some places worth visiting. San Francisco: The City by the Bay is a spectacular place to look at from almost any location — whether you are crossing the Golden Gate Bridge, sitting in a café having a Dungeness crab at Fisherman’s Wharf, or gazing out of a prison cell at Alcatraz planning an imaginary escape. San Francisco has a most interesting history. It once served as the northernmost outpost of Spain’s empire in the Americas, but later emerged as America’s own foothold on the Pacific coast after the Mexican-American War and the California Gold Rush of the 1840s. The vibrant waterfront became the center of activity for maritime shipping and commerce. By 1915, a world exposition confirmed San Francisco’s recovery from its famous earthquake and showcased the region’s reputation for innovation and an eclectic lifestyle. Today, there is plenty to do in San Francisco. Many of the 50 or so commercial piers that dominate the northern part of the city now feature an array of stores, restaurants and clubs, as well as an aquarium, sea lion platform and an interesting National Maritime Museum. Ferries leaving from the waterfront transport tens of thousands of people each day to communities around the bay or to the infamous federal prison at Alcatraz. Gangsters and other dangerous felons were imprisoned on the massive rock island there from the 1930s to 1963. The audio tour brings to life the Spartan conditions under which both prisoners and guards served time there, and the legends they created. Within a short distance from San Francisco are many other attractions worth visiting. Just north of the Golden Gate Bridge lies the bayside village of Sausalito, where Mediterranean-style villas cling to the hillside and tourists flock to cafes and shops along the waterfront. Another few miles along Route 101 lies Muir Woods, where a forest of redwoods containing some of the world’s oldest and tallest trees can be visited. Finally, many people travel to the more than 400 wineries located near San Francisco in the Sonoma or Napa valleys to sample the wares and take in the countryside. Astoria and the Oregon Coast: The rugged coastline of Northern California, Oregon and Washington extends from San Francisco to Seattle for a distance of almost 1,000 miles with only two small cities in between: Eureka, California, and Coos Bay, Oregon. The three main ways to travel north are via ship; along Route 101, a two-lane coastal highway that meanders through small towns and mountain passes; or by Interstate 5, which is located about 50 miles east of the coast and passes through Portland, Tacoma and Seattle into Canada. Perhaps the most interesting section of the Oregon coast is the area around the small city of Astoria, where the mighty Columbia River comes down from the mountains to the east and empties into the Pacific. Astoria is historically significant since it marks the location where the explorers Lewis and Clark first viewed the Pacific in 1805 after years of traversing the wilderness. Six years later, millionaire John Jacob Astor established a trading post there, which, by the end of the century developed into a regional center for the fishing, timber, fur-trading and shipping industries. The strategic location of the town and the treacherous nature of the waters also led to the establishment of important forts and Coast Guard installations in the region. This interesting history is told at the Columbia River Maritime Museum and Fort Stevens, the only mainland military installation fired upon by the Japanese in World War II. Today, Astoria is also known as the gateway to the beach communities of the Oregon coast, which are populated by retirees, tourists and weekenders from Portland. One of the most interesting places to see along the coast is Cannon Beach, located about 30 miles south of Astoria. The wide beach there is enhanced by views of Haystack Rock, a 235-foot-high geological marvel that juts out of the sand just a few feet offshore. Families also will enjoy Seaside Beach, located closer to Astoria, with its beachfront promenade and worldwide sand castle championship. Seattle: Seattle is one of the nation’s major cities with a population of 3.6 million people in the metropolitan area. Known and respected today as the headquarters or founding place of major companies such as Microsoft, Boeing, Starbucks, Nordstrom, UPS and Amazon, the city also has a reputation for its beautiful surroundings and a cosmopolitan outlook. It is built on several hills on a narrow strip of land bordering on Puget Sound and Lake Washington. In the distance, the Cascade mountain range and snow-clad Mt. Rainier are visible, along with evergreen forests. Seattle is reputed to have mild temperatures and frequent precipitation, but most visitors are able to work around the elements to take in several enjoyable sites. First, the 600-foot Seattle Space Needle, built for a 1962 World’s Fair, offers spectacular views of the region from its observation deck and revolving restaurant. Second, many people enjoy a visit to Pike’s Place Market, which features local merchants selling fresh seafood, produce, flowers and retail products. Third, people travel north of the city to Everett, Wash., to tour the Boeing Flight Aviation Center and see jets on the assembly line being designed and completed. Vancouver: Vancouver is an important stop along the Pacific coast. Located just 30 miles north of the Canadian border, Vancouver could have ended up being part of the United States if expansionists in Congress seeking a border with Great Britain at the 54th parallel rather than the 49th parallel had prevailed instead of President James Polk. Today, Vancouver has become a gateway into Canada for foreign investors and immigrants from Asia and elsewhere. Like Seattle, Vancouver has a large harbor for shipping, is protected from harsher norther weather by the surrounding mountains and separated from the Pacific by the 400-mile-long Vancouver Island to the west. These natural features plus a favorable business climate have made Vancouver a popular place for movie and TV production, world festivals and the arts in general. Other prominent industries in Vancouver include computer software, forestry and consumer products. Vancouver is densely populated with a high cost of living, but the city often is cited as having a high quality of life for residents and many outdoor attractions for visitors. Like much of the northwest, it is not hard to find tours or guides offering activities from whale watching and plane rides to kayaking and hiking in this outdoorsy city. For the less adventurous, one feature is Stanley Park, which recently was named the top park in the world by TripAdvisor. Stanley Park is adjacent to the downtown area and includes more than 1,000 acres of public land on the water with forest trails, playgrounds, an aquarium, beaches and wildlife. Granville Island is considered a must-see attraction because this restored industrial district offers hundreds of shops, theaters and markets all in one location.

Photo / Creative Commons / eosdude Air New Zealand is investigating further steps to contain burning objects on planes as concern about the danger of lithium battery-powered devices catching fire grows. At least three United States airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. An Air New Zealand spokeswoman said the airline carries flame resistant gloves on board its aircraft to protect a person who may be handling an object that has overheated or caught fire. ''In addition to this we are currently looking into other possible containment equipment options." The Associated Press reports the issue has taken on new urgency following incidents of overheating Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones, including one on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. The US Federal Aviation Administration has taken the unusual step of warning passengers not to use or charge the devices while on board and not to stow them in checked luggage. The warnings are also given on aircraft operating in New Zealand. The first airline to deploy fire-containment bags on its entire fleet was Alaska Airlines. The Seattle-based airline finished adding them to its 219 planes in May, a process that took two months from concept to deployment, AP reports. The bright red bags are made of a fire-resistant material and are designed to hold electronic devices such as mobile phones and laptops that can sometimes overheat and catch fire. Continued below. Related Content What are your rights when your phone explodes? New Zealand customer reports 'incident' with Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phone Air NZ offers cheap seats to Taranaki The bags can be shut with Velcro and heavy-duty zippers and can withstand temperatures up to 1760C. They sell for $2350 each but airlines are likely to have negotiated a bulk discount. Virgin America has installed fire-containment bags on all its planes, said spokeswoman Jennifer Thomas. The airline has about 60 jets. Delta Air Lines noted yesterday on a call with investors that it too would be adding such bags. The Atlanta-based airline has more than 900 planes, all of which will eventually get the bags, depending on production speeds and the ability to train flight attendants and pilots. The first priority will be the 166 aircraft that cross oceans, as well as some Boeing 757s used for domestic flights, according to spokesman Morgan Durrant. Those jets will have two bags each by the end of the year. In 2017, Delta plans to start adding the bags to its domestic fleet, including planes flown by its regional airline partners."This has been on the to-do list but has been accelerated by recent events," Durrant said. American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines don't have any immediate plans for fire containment bags but all said their crews are trained on how to fight such high-energy fires. Additionally, aircraft have been fitted with fire extinguishers in the cabin as well as other fire detection and suppression systems in cargo holds for decades. Lithium ion batteries used to power Boeing 787 Dreamliner systems also caused problems when that plane was introduced, with a small number catching fire and forcing the global fleet to be grounded. Boeing came up with a fire containment system where batteries are housed on the aircraft. - NZ Herald Read more by Grant Bradley Email Grant Bradley Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

The order, which goes into effect on Saturday at noon EDT, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo. An advertisement of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is seen at a mobile phone shop in Hanoi, Vietnam Credit: Kham/Reuters Passengers caught attempting to travel with the phones will have the phones confiscated and may face fines, the department said. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the U.S. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Samsung Profits, Products Struck by Note 7 Troubles Play! 03:09 The Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. "We recognise that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority," said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. "We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk." Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their phone service provider or retail store. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. What the Loss of the Note 7 Means for Samsung Play! 03:50 Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices.

At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can’t be extinguished. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to “thermal runaway” in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn’t always halt the thermal runaway.

A planned nighttime launch this weekend from Wallops Island on Virginia's Eastern Shore will be visible along parts of the coast if the skies are clear. Liftoff is scheduled for 8:03 p.m. Sunday. The mission seeks to put the state-owned launch pad back into business. It's been idle since the 2014 rocket explosion that caused about $15 million in damage. The Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority owns and operates the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on an island that NASA uses to launch small research rockets. Most of those launches are suborbital, and they've continued. Orbital and SpaceX are the two private companies that NASA has hired to keep the space station stocked. As Orbital returns to the repaired launch pad, some industry observers are still waiting to see if the private company model will succeed in the long run. "Unless Congress is willing to spend a lot more money on NASA, this is what we have to work with," said Marco Caceras, senior analyst and director of space studies at the think tank Teal Group. SpaceX and Boeing are supposed to start ferrying astronauts to the space station in the next year or two. In the meantime, the United States is relying on Russia to get astronauts there. NASA began investing in private companies for space station missions after President George W. Bush announced the space shuttle would retire (the last flight was in 2011). The agency needed to refocus its efforts on bigger missions, such as sending humans to Mars, so it turned to private industry. The agency spent nearly $800 million to help SpaceX and Orbital develop launch systems, less than half of each project's cost. Now it is paying the two companies billions to ship cargo to the space station. Since 2012, Space X and Orbital have shipped food, equipment and scientific experiments on 12 successful missions. Two have failed. Orbital lost its rocket and NASA cargo shortly after liftoff from Wallops on Oct. 28, 2014. A liquid oxygen turbo pump caught fire in a decades-old Russian engine, according to a NASA investigation. Since then, Orbital has fulfilled its contract by launching from Cape Canaveral using another company's rocket. "Orbital ATK has conducted two resupply missions using our Cygnus spacecraft aboard an Atlas V (rocket) in December 2015 and March 2016 in order to continue to support NASA space station operations while we worked to put Antares back into service," said Orbital spokeswoman Trina Helquist. For Sunday's planned launch at Wallops, Orbital will use a newer engine, also Russian built, on its Antares rocket. On June 28, 2015, a SpaceX rocket with cargo for the space station broke up about two minutes after liftoff from Cape Canaveral. Investigators blamed a failed strut assembly on the rocket's upper stage. The problem has since been fixed. Associated Press staff writer Steve McMillan contributed to this report.

The order, which goes into effect on Saturday at noon EDT, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo. The department initially said that passengers attempting to board planes with the phones might face fines, but later clarified that such passengers will simply not be allowed on planes. Passengers who try to evade the ban by packing the phone in their checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Packing the phones in checked luggage increases the risk of a "catastrophic incident," the department said. In this Tuesday, Oct. 11, 2016 photo, Samsung Electronics Galaxy Note 7 smartphones are displayed at its shop in Seoul, South Korea. Samsung Electronics said Thursday, Oct. 13, 2016, it has expanded its recall of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in the U.S. to include all replacement devices the company offered as a presumed safe alternative after the original Note 7s were found prone to catch fire. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man) Passengers who are currently traveling with Samsung Galaxy Note7 phones should contact Samsung or their wireless carrier immediately to obtain information about how to return their phones and arrange for a refund or a replacement phone, the department said. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the U.S. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. The Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. "We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority," said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. "We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk." Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their wireless carrier or retail store. Samsung has a website at http://www.samsung.com/us/note7recall/ and a phone number, 1-844-365-6197, for customers with questions. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished.

Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane. ___ Follow Joan Lowy at http://twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy.

Vista L.A. Newsmakers LAFF TV Follow Us NEWS Samsung Galaxy Note7 phones banned from US airliners Email share share tweet email none In this Sept. 8, 2016 file photo, a Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Note 7 smartphone is displayed at the headquarters of South Korean mobile carrier KT. (AP Photo) AP Friday, October 14, 2016 WASHINGTON -- Passengers and flight crews will be banned from bringing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on airline flights under an emergency order issued Friday by the Department of Transportation in response to reports of the phones catching fire. The order, which goes into effect on Saturday at noon EDT, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo. Passengers caught attempting to travel with the phones will have the phones confiscated and may face fines, the department said. MORE: Smoking Samsung Note7 prompts airplane evacuation Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the U.S. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. The Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. MORE: Samsung halts sales of Galaxy Note7 after replacements catch fire "We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority," said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. "We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk." Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their phone service provider or retail store. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. MORE: Have a Samsung Galaxy Note7? Here are your options Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.

(Photo Credit: U.S. Army) VIEW ORIGINAL DETROIT -- A senior leader of the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center will be honored at the 21st Women of Color Science and Technology, Engineering and Math Conference Oct. 15. Juanita Harris, AMRDEC's director of Weapons Development and Integration Directorate, was nominated for the Professional Achievement-Government Award. "I am very honored to get the award, especially knowing [former U.S. Army Materiel Command commanding] General Via nominated me," said Harris. "I'm humbled by the opportunity to be recognized in this way. I don't think I'm doing anything more than others, but I do feel I am a role model for the Center and my organization." Since 1995, Women of Color magazine's annual conference recognizes significant contributions of women in STEM fields to attract and leverage talent in America's scientific and technical workforce. Harris has been recognized as a pathfinder in her field, becoming the first African-American woman from Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, selected for the government's Senior Executive Service. In her current role, Harris manages the science and technology portfolio for AMRDEC's missile systems. "This has been a challenging opportunity for me," Harris said. "Our focus is to provide new technologies, new capabilities to create an advantage. We want to provide that overmatch for the Warfighter. A part of what my organization does is to develop those cross cutting, new, innovative solutions." She began her career in 1985 as an engineer for Boeing, eventually making her way to Huntsville in 2000. Before her current position, Harris was the deputy director for AMRDEC's Aviation Development Directorate. As a native of East Saint Louis, Illinois, Harris attributes her successes in life to her family and various mentors throughout her career. She says it is her experiences and qualifications she hopes people recognize, not solely the color of her skin. "I think there need to be more opportunities for not just women, but minorities in general. If you look at me and all that you see is the fact that I'm a female and black, then I think you're missing the real benefit I bring to the organization; the diversification of the activities I've worked on, my expertise in developing a workforce, my leadership, my critical thinking. It is the culmination of everything that I bring to the table." The Women of Color STEM conference is a three-day event that offers career networking opportunities and hosts award ceremonies. Attendees have the opportunity to meet and learn from executives representing Fortune 500 companies that are committed to diversity and to the advancement of women in the workforce. This award comes after two leadership awards Harris previously received in 2015 including the inaugural Dred Scott Freedom Award for government service in December 2015 and the Women Honoring Women award for technology in September 2015. --- The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center is part of the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, which has the mission to ensure decisive overmatch for unified land operations to empower the Army, the joint warfighter and our nation. RDECOM is a major subordinate command of the U.S. Army Materiel Command.

The order, which goes into effect on Saturday at noon EDT, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo. The department initially said that passengers attempting to board planes with the phones might face fines, but later clarified that such passengers will simply not be allowed on planes. Passengers who try to evade the ban by packing the phone in their checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Packing the phones in checked luggage increases the risk of a "catastrophic incident," the department said. Passengers who are currently traveling with Samsung Galaxy Note7 phones should contact Samsung or their wireless carrier immediately to obtain information about how to return their phones and arrange for a refund or a replacement phone, the department said. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the U.S. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. The Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. "We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority," said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. "We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk." Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their wireless carrier or retail store. Samsung has a website at http://www.samsung.com/us/note7recall/ and a phone number, 1-844-365-6197, for customers with questions. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane. ___ Follow Joan Lowy at http://twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy.

On Friday (October 7) aerospace manufacturer GKN sent all 227 of its employees home and told them that its Yeovil facility was "no longer" viable after it lost a major order from Leonardo Helicopters with which is shares a site. Mr Fysh met with GKN employees tonight (October 14) at Yeovil College. After the meeting he said many are "concerned" about a lack of information being given to them by GKN. He said: "They were understandably frustrated, and concerned that they weren't being given enough information by the company about what is happening. "I committed to keeping the lines of communication open and sharing what I can through the process, and I will be organising a further meeting and making contact with the company's union convenor." MORE: GKN Yeovil - everything you need to know about the crisis which could see 227 job losses He also said he wanted to take concerns about jobs for skilled workers to the highest level of government. He said: "I'll be seeking a meeting with the Prime Minister and the skills minister to discuss ways highly skilled workers can continue to find opportunities in our region to make sure we deliver on our commitment to creating a country that works for everyone. "It was important to meet employees and their families to listen to their concerns and the kind of support they want from their MP and the Government. "I'm determined to do whatever I can to help, either finding work within GKN or exploring opportunities elsewhere." Mr Fysh has already met with MoD minister Harriet Baldwin and will be meeting with Leonardo, GKN and Boeing to discuss the future of the aerospace industry in Yeovil. He said: "The Defence Secretary has told me he is committed to supporting the helicopter industry in Yeovil. "The MoD has signed a new partnering deal with Leonardo which will continue to play a vital role in supporting helicopter fleets for the Armed Forces, and Leonardo is also set to benefit from around £3bn MoD spending over the next decade." He added: "The Liberal Democrats have learnt nothing from their election losses last year and want to ignore the will of the British people over leaving the EU, blaming everything on the referendum.

(Reuters/Kim Hong) Share Written by Leslie Josephs Obsession Batteries October 14, 2016 Battery fires continue to vex airlines, even after Samsung scrapped production of its exploding Galaxy Note 7. Some carriers are putting up a new line of defense against burning mobile devices: bright red fire-containment bags that can withstand temperatures of 3,200 degrees Fahrenheit (1760 degrees Celsius). In a call with investors this week, Delta Air Lines said it would add fire-resistant bags to its fleet. Delta CEO Ed Bastian specified that the bags were fully capable of containing lithium-battery fires. Since September, the US Federal Aviation Administration and several airlines have been instructing passengers not to turn on, charge or pack in checked luggage the doomed Samsung smartphone model. On Friday, the US Department of Transportation issued an emergency ban of any Galaxy Note7 phones on all air transport, including cargo. But smartphone bans are nearly impossible to enforce because so many devices look so similar. Even after the Note 7 was recalled, a replacement Samsung Galaxy Note 7 started smoking on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. Delta has more than 900 aircraft, all of which will eventually get the bags. The first bags will go to 166 planes used on transoceanic routes and some Boeing 757s used for domestic service, the airline told The Associated Press. The rest of the fleet will be equipped next year, the airline said. Alaska Airlines and Virgin America have also added fire-containment bags to their fleets, the AP said. The FAA reported 23 incidents of smoke, fire, explosion or extreme heat from lithium ion batteries or unknown types through Sept. 7 in airplanes or airports. That’s up from just 16 in all of 2015 and nine in 2014, so on-board fire-containment bags may soon become as common as seatbelts. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

(Photo Credit: U.S. Army) VIEW ORIGINAL DETROIT -- A senior leader of the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center will be honored at the 21st Women of Color Science and Technology, Engineering and Math Conference Oct. 15. Juanita Harris, AMRDEC's director of Weapons Development and Integration Directorate, was nominated for the Professional Achievement-Government Award. "I am very honored to get the award, especially knowing [former U.S. Army Materiel Command commanding] General Via nominated me," said Harris. "I'm humbled by the opportunity to be recognized in this way. I don't think I'm doing anything more than others, but I do feel I am a role model for the Center and my organization." Since 1995, Women of Color magazine's annual conference recognizes significant contributions of women in STEM fields to attract and leverage talent in America's scientific and technical workforce. Harris has been recognized as a pathfinder in her field, becoming the first African-American woman from Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, selected for the government's Senior Executive Service. In her current role, Harris manages the science and technology portfolio for AMRDEC's missile systems. "This has been a challenging opportunity for me," Harris said. "Our focus is to provide new technologies, new capabilities to create an advantage. We want to provide that overmatch for the Warfighter. A part of what my organization does is to develop those cross cutting, new, innovative solutions." She began her career in 1985 as an engineer for Boeing, eventually making her way to Huntsville in 2000. Before her current position, Harris was the deputy director for AMRDEC's Aviation Development Directorate. As a native of East Saint Louis, Illinois, Harris attributes her successes in life to her family and various mentors throughout her career. She says it is her experiences and qualifications she hopes people recognize, not solely the color of her skin. "I think there need to be more opportunities for not just women, but minorities in general. If you look at me and all that you see is the fact that I'm a female and black, then I think you're missing the real benefit I bring to the organization; the diversification of the activities I've worked on, my expertise in developing a workforce, my leadership, my critical thinking. It is the culmination of everything that I bring to the table." The Women of Color STEM conference is a three-day event that offers career networking opportunities and hosts award ceremonies. Attendees have the opportunity to meet and learn from executives representing Fortune 500 companies that are committed to diversity and to the advancement of women in the workforce. This award comes after two leadership awards Harris previously received in 2015 including the inaugural Dred Scott Freedom Award for government service in December 2015 and the Women Honoring Women award for technology in September 2015. --- The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center is part of the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, which has the mission to ensure decisive overmatch for unified land operations to empower the Army, the joint warfighter and our nation. RDECOM is a major subordinate command of the U.S. Army Materiel Command.

Brookfield, up 16% year-to-date, owns office and retail property, toll roads, hydroelectric dams, transmission lines and ports. Macauley said the company's "scale, global operating footprint, and contrarian approach" make them among the best at this in the world. The Hennessy Focus Fund is up 3.1% thus far in 2016, according to Morningstar. The $2.4 billion fund has returned an average of 8.5% annually over the past three years, outpacing 87% of its rivals in Morningstar's mid-cap growth category. Macauley is also bullish on shares of American Tower (AMT) , which are up 18% thus far in 2016. Macauley said the largest cellular tower owner in the U.S. is rapidly growing its international portfolio and is benefiting from the rollout of 4G technologies to support the surging demand for mobile data. "Mobile data demand growth has been explosive and that will provide a decade or more of growth at American Tower," said Macauley. Hexcel  (HXL) is another one of Macauley's top picks. The advanced materials company has seen its stock drop 9% thus far in 2016, but Macauley believes Hexcel has excellent growth prospects as Boeing and Airbus compete to make lighter, more durable and more fuel-efficient planes. "Aerospace customers are increasingly using carbon fiber over aluminum, growing Hexcel's addressable market," said Macauley. "And as the most vertically integrated supplier in the industry, Hexcel is better able to control costs, quality and delivery of its product." Finally, Macauley is a fan of Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA) , down 9% year-to-date, saying the media giant has "built-in pricing power" for its cable networks and the best growth profile in the space.

Lockheed Martin is the only competitor for the GBSD contract to replace the USAF's legacy LGM-30 Minuteman ICBMs (pictured) to have revealed its industry team. Northrop Grumman and Boeing have also submitted bids but have not revealed partners. (USAF) The company's Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) programme team includes General Dynamics, which is working on the system's command and control capability; Draper Laboratories, which is developing guidance, navigation, and control systems; Moog, which is providing cross-vector control systems; and Bechtel, which is working on launch facilities. John Karas, Lockheed Martin vice president and GBSD programme manager, also told reporters that the company is considering both Aerojet Rocketdyne and Orbital ATK to work on the propulsion system for the new missile. "Each company has different benefits and advantages for different stages," Karas said of the engine vendors. "It's too early to tell, but both of those teams are working with us." Boeing and Northrop Grumman also confirmed their intent to bid for the work but have declined to name industrial partners. The programme will replace the USAF's ageing Minuteman III missile. All three companies delivered their proposals for the work to the air force on the 11 October deadline, according to company statements. The USAF released a request for proposals (RfP) for GBSD on 29 July. The service revealed its plan to award up to two 36-month technology maturation and risk reduction contracts by the end of the fiscal year and to field a new system in the late 2020s. The RfP and its supporting documents are classified 'secret'. GBSD, previously known as Minuteman IV, is expected to leave much of the legacy infrastructure and even some associated components in place, officials have said. Want to read more?

By: PTI | Hyderabad | Published:October 14, 2016 6:47 pm Low frills carrier SpiceJet on Friday said it is planning to add about three Bombardiers and 4 to 5 Boeings by the end of the current fiscal as it wants to increase its daily flights by 10 per cent and also introduce new international destinations. “We have 17 planes for regional connectivity. Spicejet is a major player in regional connectivity space. Few weeks back, we have added three Bombardiers. We will be adding three more in the current financial year,” Ajay Singh CMD of SpiceJet told reporters on the sidelines of a Ficci Ladies Organisation programme here today. “We will be adding 4 or 5 aircraft this year. They will mostly be Boeings,” he said. Currently, SpiceJet is having a fleet of 43 aircraft operating 320 flights a day. Replying to a query, Singh said within next few weeks they will be adding 2 to 3 international destinations. Currently, it operates to six countries. “We are flying to six countries as of now. We are looking at more options. In the next few weeks, we will announce some more routes. We will be announcing two to three destinations more. Our strategy is to operate in 4 hour-window journey,” he said.

Beautiful scenery, jovial ground crew, and white-knuckle crosswinds that mean the autopilot stays off; according to the pilots we questioned, that's the secret of job satisfaction.  1. Naples, Italy “The views during descent and approach are breath-taking! I enjoy the challenges this airport brings due to the steeper than normal approaches to both runways. The approach to Runway 06 is also offset requiring a visual transition to line up with the runway centreline. Stepping out onto the ramp into the sunshine during the turnaround is always an added bonus! Instagram : by pilotbaffo - Landing in Naples #vesuvio #napoli #golfodisorrento #pilotjob #pilotview #pilotlife #la… pic.twitter.com/1ARuE9x7ql— ✈ Dorian BENTEJAC ✈ (@DeltaBravo33) November 3, 2015 “Closer to home, my absolute favourite is London Heathrow. On a clear day the views of the city approaching Runways 27L and 27R from the north are amazing. The air traffic controllers here are second to none, another reason I love flying into this airport.  It always amazes me the outstanding job they do in precisely managing the heavy flow of traffic both into and out of here.” – Captain Sonya Bissett, Aer Lingus 2. Christchurch, New Zealand “I love to fly into Christchurch as it has the most incredible landscape: it's the ultimate scenic flight. Alps covered in snow, valleys filled with cerulean blue snow melt and patchwork fields covered in tiny white sheep-dots. After landing we're always met with a friendly Kiwi smile and a subtle ribbing as to how we're doing in the rugby or cricket.” – Captain Mark Goodwin, Qantas The view landing into Christchurch looks so warm!!⛄️ pic.twitter.com/x8DUpNl5Pr— Nathan Jack (@nathanjack10) July 27, 2016 3. Leeds Bradford, UK “Returning to Leeds Bradford after the dry plains of Spain is always a treat. From the flight deck I can see the beautiful rolling hills of Yorkshire. What always surprises me is just how green the landscape is. “I also love going into Gibraltar. It has such a great approach as you sweep around the massive rock with a view of all the gigantic tankers moored out in the bay. It really is a truly epic arrival but no chance to take photos – for obvious safety reasons!” – Pilot Paul Fox, Monarch 4. Funchal, Madeira, Portugal “Funchal is always exciting. The airport is on the stunning volcanic island of Madeira, rising out of the Atlantic in an archipelago of a few small islands. The runway is carved into the side of a mountain with a steep slope on one side and a 200ft drop into the sea on the other. Half of the runway is actually built on stilts as there was not enough land to build a runway of sufficient length. “All approaches to Funchal are visual: pilots must use their high levels of training, judgement and flying skill to negotiate the curving approach to the runway. This is while managing the wind conditions that swirl around the mountain and cause quickly changing cross and tailwinds. Only certain pilots are certified to fly there.” – Captain Ally Wilcox, British Airways 5. Innsbruck, Austria “Innsbruck Kranebitten Airport in Austria is my favourite airport. The views of the Alps that we get from the flight deck on most days are just amazing. “We get special training every year in the simulator for this airport as it’s especially challenging: the mountains that surround the airport; the possibility of heavy snow; strong winds that can come down the Brenner Pass causing quite bad turbulence; and a rather short runway. But that makes it even more rewarding flying there!” – Pilot Rob Kooyman, Monarch @MarkGrigg @markv747 #windowweekend on the approach to land at Innsbruck. Not exactly a normal view! pic.twitter.com/y9z91TxQIF— Cam Chapman (@CamRChapman) September 10, 2016 6. Jersey, UK “My favourite UK airport would be Jersey. It is technically interesting: it has a fairly short runway for a medium-sized jet aircraft which requires careful planning and landing distance calculations. When the doors are opened it is almost always warmer than mainland UK – it just shouts ‘holiday time’ at you. “Further afield, my current favourite is Athens. We normally arrive onto the northerly runway 03L due to prevailing local winds. It’s a very early arrival and we watch the sun rise on the way in. After landing we are usually met by Stavros our local crazy Greek handler who has us all laughing with his latest escapades – often in rather too much detail…” – DB, European Freight operator 7. London Heathrow, UK “I love arriving at London Heathrow. First officers, who sit on the right side of the cockpit, usually have the best views when landing. I love to see the Thames, and the old docklands once famed for their ‘forest of masts’, a reminder of London’s great maritime history that’s somehow particularly pleasing to contemplate from the flight deck of a modern-day vessel like a 747. Hello London! #london #uk #aircraft #landing #heathrow #skyline #theshard #towerbridge #thames #model #modellife #luxury #jetset #lifestyle pic.twitter.com/wvBBDiHAKj— Carmen PK (@CarmenPKu) October 3, 2016 “Cape Town is also spectacular. After a long, quiet overnight journey across Europe and from one end of Africa to the other, there’s nothing quite like the sight of Table Mountain rising just as dawn breaks. From the air, looking out at one of the world’s most beautiful intersections of land and sea, it’s obvious why this city remains one of the most popular destinations for crew and customers alike. “It’s also handy for Diaz Beach, my favourite beach in the world, which is near the Cape of Good Hope. It’s at the bottom of a challenging set of steps, and it’s often too rough and cold to swim here, but it’s the perfect place to put on your headphones, catch some sun, and watch two oceans at work.” – Pilot Mark Vanhoenacker, British Airways Rt"@vargasmoni: Cape Town seen from the cockpit ... #pilotsview #pilotlife 😊✈️🌈 ©® pic.twitter.com/3M69uX8lem"— laty (@laty72) April 5, 2015 8. New York, USA “JFK's 'Canarsie' approach is my personal favourite. Named after the navigation aid (VOR) on which it is based, this approach is essentially a cloud break manoeuvre to runway 13L at Kennedy, designed to get you in position to complete the landing visually. “Quite often given at short notice, this can be a challenging approach in a large aircraft, and a daunting one if the weather is poor. It is one of very few approaches in a large commercial aircraft where a pilot has the opportunity to switch all the automation off and fly the aircraft manually whilst remaining visual with the runway on a curved descent profile, often with a healthy tailwind until close to the runway.” – Captain Michael Landy, Aer Lingus @MarkGrigg #windowweekend -YMMT out of JFK on the sleeper service 182 #wannagoback! pic.twitter.com/x4M86949xl— Otto Lillebø (@OttoLillebo) September 10, 2016 9. Hamilton Island, Whitsundays, Australia “The approach to Hamilton takes you across beautiful island beaches and turquoise ocean vistas. Yachts are regularly in the vicinity and the airport is next to a marina. The surroundings, along with the demeanour of the staff, make you feel more relaxed as soon as you arrive. It makes you never want to leave!” – Captain Al Crawford, Qantas Landing at Hamilton Island Credit: alamy 10. Stavanger, Norway “One of my favourite approaches is on to Runway 18 at Stavanger Sola Airport in Norway. On a clear day, flying down the coastline and then over the lakes as you approach the airport is absolutely stunning.” – First Officer Hannah Vaughan, British Airways  11. Gibraltar “Gibraltar can be rather challenging with the limits on the wind as it rolls around the rock and can make it extremely turbulent on landing, but what I really like is the fact it's also rather an old school approach.  They have no landing aids at Gibraltar, so it’s back to basics: just the stick and rudder.  Gibraltar landing is as dramatic as ever... pic.twitter.com/BtRvBJEdG2— Chris Stringer (@ChrisStringer65) September 20, 2016 “No autopilot is used and it is hand flown visually; its great when landing onto the easterly runways and you come in low around the rock and pass the harbour for a touchdown on a very short runway. The main road into Gibraltar actually crosses the runway, so they stop the traffic and pedestrians. “The easiest place to land is Faro on the Algarve. The flight is very straight forward, with very little radio talk. Portuguese air traffic control is very chilled: the minute you come into Portuguese airspace you're cleared straight to final approach. Its ground crew are very relaxed too.” – Anonymous commercial pilot Strong crosswinds cause tricky landing for Boeing plane at Prague airport Play! 02:41 12. Beijing, China “When I started going to Beijing more than 20 years ago, all the aircraft cleaners (up to 20) stood on parade to meet the arrival. They stood at attention, to one side, all dressed in the same uniform, only breaking ranks to come on board once you had parked. It gave the impression to the crew and customers of being met by a guard of honour, and is something that will always remain with me. “The other destination that stands out for me is Malė in the Maldives which still has the most fantastic views of coral atolls that you are likely to see anywhere in the world.” – Captain Geoff Leask, British Airways The Maldives, as seen from above Credit: AP 13. Kittilä, Finland “My home country Kittilä, in northern Finland, is at its best during the winter months when there is hardly any daylight and often freezing fog, which gives it a fairytale-like lighting when the lights reflect upwards and there is a lot of snow. You are met by friendly staff, and the passengers are like children playing with in the snow when exiting the plane. During the winter season you might even see Santa Claus with his reindeer.   Worldwide, my pick would be Hong Kong with the tiny islands popping up from the sea and the high green hills around the populated area. One would never think that there is so much unpopulated land around the city with skyscrapers and millions of inhabitants. I guess there is hardly an office with a better view…” – Captain Camilla Sommar, Finnair 14. Ilulissat, Greenland “I recently flew to Ilulissat, a very remote coastal town in the Qaasuitsup municipality in western Greenland. With a population of only around 5,000 people and because of its location north of the Arctic Circle, it is one of the most peaceful places that I have ever been to. @MarkGrigg #windowweekend Flying over Greenland on board a BA A380 on the way to SFO pic.twitter.com/eBNfb9XLoX— Rob Taylor (@TaylorRob96) September 11, 2016 “The nearby Ilulissat Icefjord is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with astonishing giant white icebergs coming off the most productive glacier in the northern hemisphere. You can’t help but be captured by the serenity of the place.” – Jonny Nicol, Founder and CEO of Stratajet 15. San Francisco, USA “An amazing approach with spectacular and iconic views of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. It's also a wonderful city to spend a few days in. “I normally set off for a bike ride at first light, cycling over the Golden Gate Bridge, stopping for breakfast in Sausalito before heading out into the hills in the Marin Headlands. To get back across the bay at the end of the day it's either the ferry or back up over the bridge depending on how much energy I have left.” – Senior First Officer Ian Palframan, British Airways @MarkGrigg Inbound SFO a few weeks ago #WindowWeekend @British_Airways #aviation pic.twitter.com/LfD6Xy0BcU— Ben Kay (@Benjamin_Kay) September 10, 2016 Follow the latest Telegraph Travel news Read more 24 Oct 2016, 1:30pm The confessions of an airline pilot 25 Sep 2016, 8:00am Quiz: The myths of air travel - can you sort fact from fiction? 01 Sep 2016, 10:00am What causes turbulence, and is it dangerous? 12 Jul 2016, 1:23pm Incredible photography by the pilots of Instagram - but is it legal? 04 Jul 2016, 3:07pm How dangerous is a bird strike?

The global aircraft heavy maintenance visit (HMV) market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 5.78% during the period 2016-2020. According to the report, rapid development in ultrasonic technique will be a key trend for market growth. Ultrasonic inspection is a sensitive method of nondestructive testing metallic, nonmetallic, magnetic, or nonmagnetic components of aircraft. This technique is widely used for the detection of internal defects in materials. With only single surface accessibility, the ultrasonic test can detect small flaws and estimate the location and size of the defect. Further, the report states that OEMs have a major role to play in the HMV market. They have the license for the supply of spare parts that cannot be purchased by PMAs. This domination has created a niche market for the MRO service providers or third parties, especially for the engine OEMs. Further, dynamic technology in new aircraft opens new opportunities for the OEMs to penetrate further in the market. In addition, they are augmenting their presence by extending aftermarket services to the end-users. Such moves by the OEMs inevitably challenge the presence of service providers and PMAs.

That’s changing, thanks to one remarkable drone technology.   The sight of a drone hurling across Rwandan skies usually inspires fear on the African continent as it’s regarded as an instrument of death. But instead of destroying lives, it’s here to save them, reports CBS News correspondent Debora Patta.  “What this represents is an opportunity ... to leapfrog over the absence of roads and provide first-world medical care to every single person in the country, regardless of where they live,” said Zipline co-founder Keller Rinaudo.  Zipline is a California-based tech company that uses engineers -- with experience at companies like NASA and Boeing -- to build and develop drones capable of accessing remote areas, dropping blood instead of bombs.  Play Video CBS Evening News American farmers getting assist from drones An increasing number of American farmers are using a high-tech tool to make their jobs a little easier.

Half of the 65,000 units of blood currently delivered by road each year are used in life-saving transfusions for women who lose too much blood during childbirth. Doctor Kajibwami Espoir said that in his rural hospital, it can take hours for the blood to arrive. The forward thinking Rwandan government’s wants to change this and is the first African nation to sign up with Silicon Valley to bring cutting edge technology to a nation’s infrastructure that is far more third world in places. “From this distribution center, we can serve thousands of doctors and health workers,” Rinaudo said. “And or those individuals, the experience of the system is super simple -- send a text message and we will send a product that will save a person’s life.” Each package is placed into a cardboard box attached to a paper parachute, then secured onto the drone before heading off on its life-saving mission using GPS coordinates. One flight took a mere five minutes to deliver blood to a clinic that is 33 miles from the nearest blood bank. The launch of the Zipline drones today puts Rwanda on the cusp of a technological revolution that could ultimately turn around its health care and see similar projects implemented across the continent. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Three US airlines have started rolling out new fire-containment bags capable of sealing up an overheating smartphone or laptop battery to prevent a disaster mid-air. The bright red bags are made of a fire-resistant material and are designed to hold electronic devices such as mobile phones and laptops. The bags, which retail for $1,800 (£1,475) each, can be shut with Velcro and heavy-duty zippers to withstand temperatures up to 1,760C. Virgin America installed fire-containment bags on all its 60 or so planes, while Seattle-based Alaska Airlines finished adding them to its 219 planes in May. Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines said that it too would be adding such bags to its more than 900 planes, prioritising the 166 aircraft that cross oceans, as well as some Boeing 757s used for domestic flights, which will have two of the bags each by the end of the year. “This has been on the to-do list, but has been accelerated by recent events,” said Morgan Durrant, communications manager for Delta. Other airlines, including American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, have yet to deploy the bags, but do have aircrew training and fire extinguishers to deal with high-energy fires mid-flight. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Samsung Note7 customer shows charred remains of phone after it caught fire The issue of potentially dangerous lithium-ion batteries within electronics on aeroplanes has taken on new urgency following incidents of overheating Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones, including one on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. The US Federal Aviation Administration took the unusual step of warning passengers not to use or charge Note 7 devices while on board and not to stow them in checked luggage. Other aviation authorities took similar steps, while airlines have been warning passengers both at airports and before take off to switch off the phones and not to charge them. In February the UN’s aviation agency prohibited cargo shipments of lithium-ion batteries on passenger aircraft over concerns by pilots and plane makers that they are a fire risk. Boeing also had issues with lithium-ion batteries built into its 787 Dreamliners that caught fire, forcing changes to the battery design that took five days to perform per plane.
