The new factory for the Air Force’s T-X training program will support 1,800 “direct and indirect positions” in the region, according to the Boeing statement. “I’m proud that Boeing has trust in the highly skilled workforce in my district, and I look forward to the economic opportunity these jobs will bring for our community and the Missouri supply chain,” Rep. William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) said in the release. ADVERTISEMENT Boeing already builds its F-15 and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet in St. Louis. The company is paired with Swedish company Saab in the T-X competition. The Air Force plans to purchase 350 T-X aircraft to replace its aging fleet of Northrop Grumman-made T-38. The contract is expected to be awarded by the end of this year and could be worth up to $16 billion over the life of the program. Including the Boeing-Saab team, there are five groups hoping to win the contract. Leonardo DRS announced in March that it would build its T-100 aircraft at a new manufacturing facility in Tuskegee, Ala., should the Air Force choose its firm’s Aermacchi M-346 design. Lockheed Martin and Korea Aerospace Industries are offering the T-50A, tested and built at the Lockheed’s factory in Greenville, S.C. In addition, there are two dark-horse candidates - a Sierra Nevada Corp. and Turkish Aerospace Industries team, which would build its newly designed Freedom trainer aircraft in Colorado; and Stavatti Aerospace Ltd., which pulled its design from the U.S.-Israeli conceived ATG Javelin Mk-30. Northrop Grumman withdrew from the competition in February.    View the discussion thread. Most Popular Most Popular Discussed Past: 1 day 1 Trump takes heat over intel, '...

The company today announced its new T-X Air Force jet that could be used in military training for fighter pilots. If awarded the bid, Boeing would build 350 T-X jets. Photo courtesy of Boeing U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, says the number of Air Force pilots has slowed to a crawl because of the fleet of aging T-38 aircraft. “The world is a dangerous place. We have to be ready at a moment’s notice,” says McCaskill. “One of the reasons we have a shortage of pilots is the training aircraft now doesn’t have the capabilities it needs to train our pilots of today.” McCaskill, who is a member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, says the rising tensions between the U.S. and North Korea is an example of why the country needs the most advanced military resources. “Especially in light of the threats we are facing from North Korea, Russia and Iran, it’s incredibly important that we’re able to train up our Air Force pilots and our fighter pilots in an efficient way,” says McCaskill. The Air Force contract is expected to be given by the end of this year. More than 14,000 Missourians work at the eastern Missouri Boeing plant.

Share this article Share Blast off! Elon Musk’s space firm launched its Falcon 9 rocket to deliver Inmarsat-5 F4, a commercial communications satellite in iots first launch for the company. 'All systems and weather are go,' it said at 6:35pm.  The satellite was deployed approximately 32 minutes after launch when it will come under the command of the Boeing and Inmarsat satellite operations teams based at the Boeing facility in El Segundo. 'From here I-5 F4 will be manoeuvred to its geostationary orbit, 35,786km (22,236 miles) above Earth, where it will deploy its solar arrays and reflectors and undergo intensive payload testing before beginning commercial service,' Inmarsat said. The payload was so heavy (13,448lbs) and going into such a high orbit (22,000 miles) that the Falcon 9 rocket won't have enough propellant left to land, SpaceX says. It launched at 7:21 p.m. EDT. The payload, Inmarsat-5 F4 (I-5 F4) is the fourth satellite in the Global Xpress (GX) constellation; the world’s first globally available, high-speed, mobile broadband service. 'Global Xpress represents an important step in Inmarsat’s transformation from a satellite operator to a digital services enabler,' the company said. 'Today, being connected is an expectation, whether you want access to Wi-Fi in the sky or to use your mobile in the remotest location.  'Satellite communications is no longer a luxury, it is a critical enabler for our demanding connectivity needs.'  The payload is so heavy (13,448lbs) and going into such a high orbit (22,000 miles) that the Falcon 9 rocket won't have enough propellant left to land, SpaceX says. Inmarsat, the only operator of a global Ka-band network, created the GX platform to enable communities across the world to benefit from the emerging digital society. Already delivering unprecedented service speeds, coverage, reliability and security to users on land, at sea and in the air, Inmarsat’s GX network entered global commercial service in December 2015.  I-5 F4 adds further capacity to the network, as well as in-orbit redundancy that further upgrades the reliability and resilience of Inmarsat’s service offerings.  Global Xpress is establishing a new standard of excellence for broadband communications in established VSAT markets and is gaining strong traction in new market areas, such as the rapidly expanding aviation passenger connectivity sector. The first four GX satellites, including I-5 F4, were constructed by Inmarsat’s partner Boeing Network & Space Systems. THE KENNEDY LAUNCH PADS This July 16, 1969 shows the huge, 363-foot tall Apollo 11 Spacecraft 107/Lunar Module S/Saturn 506) space vehicle launched from Pad A, Launch Complex 39. Since the late 1960s, Pads A and B at Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39 have served as backdrops for America's most significant manned space flight endeavors - Apollo, Skylab, Apollo-Soyuz and space shuttle. Located on Merritt Island, Fla., just north of Cape Canaveral, the pads were originally built for the huge Apollo/Saturn V rockets that launched American astronauts on their historic journeys to the moon and back.  Following the joint U.S.-Soviet Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission of July 1975, the pads were modified to support space shuttle operations.  Both pads were designed to support the concept of mobile launch operations, in which space vehicles are checked out and assembled in the protected environment of the Orbiter Processing Facility and the Vehicle Assembly Building, then transported by large, tracked crawlers to the launch pad for final processing and launch. During the Apollo era, key pad service structures were mobile.  For the space shuttle, two permanent service towers were installed at each pad for the first time, the fixed service structure and the rotating service structure. On April 12, 1981, shuttle operations commenced at Pad A with the launch of Columbia on STS-1.  After 23 more successful launches from A, the first space shuttle to lift off from Pad B was the ill-fated Challenger in January 1986.  Pad B was designated for the resumption of shuttle flights in September 1988, followed by the reactivation of Pad A in January 1990. The space shuttle Atlantis lifts off from the Kennedy Space Center Friday, July 8, 2011, in Cape Canaveral, Fla. Atlantis was the 135th and final space shuttle launch for NASA.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 16 shares Most watched News videos A man accused of theft is shot by police live on television Curious bear gets scared off by doll when trying to open trashcan Shocking video of busy road almost set ABLAZE by lightning strike Passenger has pizza delivered to stalled Amtrak train First Marine Corps recruitment ad with female fighters The moment a bully picks the wrong fight and gets body slammed Foul-mouthed woman goes berserk inside Sprint store How satisfied do you feel after watching silicone being rolled?

Photo by Christian Gooden, cgooden@post-dispatch.com Boeing will assemble the new T-X Air Force training jet at its north St. Louis County campus — supporting 1,800 jobs locally — if it beats out rivals for the lucrative defense contract, company officials said Monday. Industry analysts had mostly expected St. Louis to get T-X work if Boeing wins the contract, but Monday’s announcement — complete with members of the area’s congressional delegation, local politicians and regional business leaders — made it official. “It’s not ‘if’ it’s awarded, it’s ‘when’ it’s awarded,” Rep Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin, told a cheering crowd of about 200 Boeing employees and area officials gathered in a hangar displaying two of the company’s T-X models. A decision from the Defense Department is expected by the end of the year. Boeing has teamed up with Saab, the Swedish maker of the Gripen fighter, in its bid for the trainer work. It faces competition from a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Korean Aerospace Industries and Italian aircraft maker Leonardo and its U.S. subsidiary, DRS Technologies. Lockheed would make its trainer in Greenville, S.C., while Leonardo would manufacture its version in Tuskegee, Ala., according to industry publication Defense News. If Boeing and Saab are successful, the contract to replace the Air Force’s decades-old T-38 trainer could be worth up to $16 billion to the company. The Defense Department is expected to buy up to 350 aircraft over the 15-year life of the contract, with the first planes delivered in 2024. Leanne Caret, CEO of Boeing’s Defense Space and Security division, said the decision to assemble in St. Louis was “purposeful.” She commended the team that was able to take the new aircraft from design to first flight test in under three years, calling the speed “unprecedented in this industry.” A Boeing T-X made its first test flight here in December, and a second went airborne last month. Boeing unveiled its T-X trainer in September during a similar ceremony. “If you see these beautiful aircraft flying around town, this is the team that got us to the flight ramp” and into the air for testing, said Shelley Lavender, Boeing’s senior St. Louis executive and president of Boeing Military Aircraft. Though the contract would support 1,800 direct and indirect jobs, a Boeing spokeswoman said the company didn’t have a breakdown of how many of those jobs would be actual company employees and how many would be from suppliers and secondary economic activity caused by employees buying houses and other goods. Neither would Boeing say how much T-X work would be done in St. Louis versus Saab facilities. Boeing spokeswoman Deborah VanNierop said it was “possible” some of the 1,800 could be new Boeing jobs. Boeing employs about 14,000 people in the St. Louis area, the company said. But many of those 1,800 jobs may well turn out to be new, said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute, a Washington-area think tank on security issues. He noted that the St. Louis plant’s big product, the F/A-18 Super Hornet, had recently won several orders from and was expected to have enough orders to last until the middle of next decade. Plus, most of the work will be done by Boeing rather than its partners, he said. The White House approved in September the $7 billion sale of F/A-18s to Kuwait and F-15 Strike Eagles to Qatar; and in November, Canada said it would buy 18 Super Hornets. “I think that a lot of these jobs could actually be new rather than workers shifting from the Super Hornet or the Eagle over to the trainer,” Thompson said. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., nodded to the new momentum behind the F/A-18 production line in St. Louis, declaring she and her colleagues in Congress were pleased to “ink the deal” for next year’s budget that included money for 14 more U.S. Super Hornets. Pointing to the Republican and Democratic politicians in attendance, McCaskill, a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said partisan divisions dissolved when it came to supporting the thousands of jobs at Boeing’s St. Louis operations.

There is no other plant and workforce that could build the new T-X trainer as well as Boeing in St. Louis, said Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis. “The history of military aviation literally runs through this plant,” he said. Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, said his team would work “side by side, every step of the way” to do everything it could to ensure Boeing won the T-X contract. But he indicated he believes Boeing already had an edge because of how quickly it had built and tested a prototype. “I think we’ve got a leg up because of the stage we’re at,” Greitens said. Thompson, at the Lexington Institute, thinks economic considerations may well play into this award. “What you see in the T-X program is the first big military award of the (President Donald) Trump era, where economic goals and military goals might coincide,” Thompson said. “This is an opportunity to boost manufacturing jobs in a part of the country that has lost for decades. I just think it is St. Louis’ turn.” Any new jobs Boeing adds could position it to tap state subsidies. Almost three years ago, Missouri dangled $229 million in subsidies over 18 years if Boeing grows its workforce here by at least 2,000 people. But Boeing would collect up to $146 million in state incentives over 10 years even if it just maintains employment at 14,500 jobs. It would have to return some money if employment drops below 11,000. Boeing has announced several moves to add jobs here in recent years. Those include 700 new jobs expected by 2021 to build wing and tail parts for the new 777X airliner. Other Boeing jobs moving here include service work for the F-22 fighter, information technology and research jobs. In November, it said it would move 500 professional service jobs here from California, including engineering and finance positions. However, those moves don’t appear to have changed the total job count much. Actually, at the time of the 777X announcement, Boeing said it employed close to 15,000 people, a higher number than the 14,000 it referenced Monday.

The plane, used in the U.S. Air Force pilot training program, will replace the T-38 trainer currently being used. Previously, Boeing added 500 jobs to the St. Louis area when the company consolidated some of its facilities.   “The Boeing T-X trainer will keep Americans safe and create more jobs for Missourians,” Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens said in the release. “Companies like Boeing, which are committed to growing and investing here, show the world that our state is open for business and ready to create new jobs.” The contract will be awarded by the end of the year.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Weeks after the news broke that an upstart competitor in China managed its first successful commercial jetliner flight, U.S.-based Boeing faced another public relations setback, having to announce the company has grounded all flights of its new single-aisle 737 Max. The reason stated, concerns about the quality of the jet’s new engines. Sure, the grounding is necessary, but the reason is not one to inspire caution. Here is a portion of the official statement released by the media: "Out of an abundance of caution, we decided to temporarily suspend MAX flights. The step is consistent with our priority focus on safety for all who use and fly our products . . . " Worried consumers should know that this grounding will not affect any currently scheduled flights because Boeing has not delivered any jets to its customers. Then again, the news isn’t great, because the first delivery was supposed to happen later this month. Boeing claims the engine issues won’t change the delivery date, yet some have doubts. In an attempt at full disclosure, Boeing said it must inspect the interior core of its advanced Leap-1B engine, which is manufactured by General Electric and Safran, a French company. The potential problem was found after the completed engines were delivered to inspection locations in the United States. When Boeing engineers found the issue, they immediately called for the jets to be grounded and further tests to be run. Aviation enthusiast Daniel Palmier said "Further confusing the issue, and the consumer public, is the fact that the engine components come from two separate suppliers, which means not all the engines that were made have the troublesome issue. But which ones, and who’s to blame? "These are questions Boeing will have to answer before making their first delivery. These questions may not be as important to the customer, but they will be of paramount importance to any potential fliers who see these reports." Consumers are paying close attention to airline news after a rash of horrible public relations about the airlines dominated recent news cycles. Already conditioned to believe that airlines care more about profits than people — whether that charge is fair or not — any additional negative news will further erode consumer confidence in an industry facing a major public relations turning point. Even news such as one airline cutting a few inches of legroom in economy class got headlines, as well as strong viewing on social media. The idea that a new jet’s engine "may" be suspect has a much higher "scare" factor than losing an inch or two in economy. Boeing doesn’t seem to be worried, though. They are going ahead with delivery to their first customer, a budget Malaysian airline, this month — but what then?

LOUIS, May 15, 2017 – Boeing’s [NYSE: BA] decision to assemble its T-X Air Force training jet at its St. Louis facility is expected to support approximately 1,800 jobs in the region. If the Air Force chooses Boeing to help train pilots for generations to come, T-X will be the newest project for a community that has produced some of the most acclaimed military aircraft of the past seven decades. “The Boeing T-X trainer will keep Americans safe and create more jobs for Missourians,” said Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens. “Companies like Boeing, which are committed to growing and investing here, show the world that our state is open for business and ready to create new jobs.” The jobs projection includes direct and indirect positions expected to be supported by the T-X work. “I’m proud that Boeing has trust in the highly skilled workforce in my district, and I look forward to the economic opportunity these jobs will bring for our community and the Missouri supply chain,” added U.S. Rep. Lacy Clay, who represents Missouri’s first district that includes Boeing’s St. Louis facility. The first two new, purpose-built T-X aircraft have proven the design’s low-risk, performance and repeatability in manufacturing. “Our highly skilled St. Louis workforce designed, assembled and brought Boeing T-X to life, and they continue to define the future, not just for our company, but for our customers and the global aerospace industry,” said Shelley Lavender, St. Louis senior executive and president of Boeing Military Aircraft. Boeing T-X is a training system designed specifically for the Air Force training mission. It will replace the service’s fleet of aging T-38 aircraft. The initial acquisition, for 350 aircraft and the associated ground-based training and support, is valued at up to $16 billion. Initial operating capability is planned for 2024. The contract award is expected by the end of the year. Get the latest Boeing T-X updates at www.boeing.com/t-x or by searching #NewBoeingTX on Twitter.

Boeing Related Media Gallery: Boeing 737 MAX 9 takes flight Advertisement Boeing is operating 737 MAX flights using CFM International LEAP-1B engines unaffected by the issue that prompted a May 10 suspension of all MAX flying. “We have resumed some 737 MAX flight activities,” a Boeing spokesperson said. “Regulatory agencies support this action.” Malaysia’s Malindo Air and Norwegian are slated to receive the first deliveries of the 737 MAX 8 this month, and Boeing said those plans remain unchanged. “We plan to begin 737 MAX deliveries in May,” the Boeing spokesperson said. Boeing suspended all 737 MAX flights May 10 after being informed by CFM, a GE Aviation/Safran Aircraft Engines joint venture, of a potential issue with the aircraft’s LEAP-1B engine. The suspension was implemented “out of an abundance of caution,” Boeing said. The potential issue, discovered during a quality inspection by CFM of an engine in a factory, is with low pressure turbine (LPT) discs. But CFM has double or triple sourced 80% of the LEAP engine’s outsourced components, and has two LPT suppliers. Only one supplier’s LPTs are at issue. Regulators cleared Boeing to resume flights with LEAP-1B engines containing LPTs from the unaffected supplier even as inspections of engines with LPTs from the affected supplier continue. GE LEAP manufacturing program director Cristina Seda-Hoelle told ATW last year that the dual sourcing strategy was necessary to ensure LEAP production did not come to a halt if one supplier has a problem. “If you have one source fall down, you’ve got to have a backup plan,” she said.

(May 22, 2012) -- The signature sound of the tandem-rotored Chinook was multiplied by four as Sortie 2 took to the early morning air over Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah, Ga. The new helicopters had been flown to the airfield just a couple of weeks earlier in mid-March from the Boeing production facility in Philadelphia. And though new, the helicopters were far from shiny; their mid-toned, flat green paint was well-designed to offer concealment against terrains in theater operations where most F models would fly. It was now April, and the Chinooks were departing on what would likely be the longest mission they'd likely ever be tasked to do; fly from the eastern seaboard of the southern U.S. all the way to Fairbanks, Alaska. Once in Alaska, the new F models would be turned over to the aviators of the 1st Battalion, 52nd Aviation Regiment, 16th Combat Aviation Brigade. The mission sounded easy enough. But the nearly 3,400 nautical mile route to Alaska would take almost two weeks with multiple fuel stops and overnight breaks for the crews along the way. They would be trailing in the wake of Sortie 1, also consisting of four new F models and a combined crew of about 22, by just a day. The sorties were separated by at least a day so that some of the smaller airfields used along the way would not be overly taxed in terms of fueling capabilities or ramp parking spaces. Four more CH-47 F model Chinooks would follow a couple of weeks later to comprise Sortie 3 for a total of 12 new aircraft delivered to the 16th CAB in Fairbanks. The route was lengthy and well-planned out. The new F models and their crews would fly from Savannah, Ga., to St. Louis then on to Rapid City, S.D., with a quick stop for fuel and lunch at Campbell Army Airfield at Fort Campbell, Ky. From Rapid City, the route continued north to Helena, Mont., and, from Helena, north across the Canadian border to Edmonton in Alberta. From there, stops included Fort Nelson in northern British Columbia, a brief fuel stop at Whitehorse in the Yukon, and, finally, the immense state of Alaska and the final destination of Fairbanks. All of the major stops were conducted as an overnight stay to allow the crews needed rest and downtime as well as to allow for required maintenance on the Chinooks. Amazingly enough, the ferry mission to Alaska was to be a first of sorts for the venerable airframe. In its 50 years of production and hundreds of thousands of hours of flight time as a fleet, a ferry of this magnitude across the breadth of North America had never been done before. "From an operational standpoint, or a logistical, planning and actual execution standpoint, it's been a big challenge," explained Col. Bob Marion, Cargo Helicopters project manager. Marion spoke during a weather delay in Helena that held up the mission for two days. The delay wasn't part of the extensive planning, of course, but the plans were necessarily flexible due to the complexity of the mission. A team of Boeing technicians was traveling along to handle issues that might have come up during the long flight. They didn't travel light. One of the four helicopters was the "maintenance bird," so-called because, in addition to the technicians, it carried a couple of large tool boxes as well as spare parts and other items they might need along the way. Marion elaborated on the long history of the Chinook, noting that the basic design may be old in terms of military vehicles, but it was a completely up-to-speed aircraft. "If you go back in time and look at the fact that the Chinook has been around for over 50 years now, flying in the Army, from the big picture standpoint, it shows how reliable, how sustainable, how effective operationally the system is. The physics of the aircraft have remained the same for 50 years. "We've done a lot of things like upgrading the engine, the gearboxes, the transmission, to make it more and more reliable as we've gone through these last generations of aircraft from A through F. We've improved the aircraft over 50 years, but the fact that it's continued to be a part operationally of the Army's inventory of aircraft shows just how reliable it is," Marion said. "Engines have been upgraded over the years, as have the most of the other major components. What really sets the F model apart is its greatly upgraded avionics." Marion added that Chinooks in theater have flown anywhere from 50 to 100 hours in per month. "And that's been ongoing for the last 10 years," he emphasized, noting that the airframe was originally designed to fly just over 14 hours per month with a life span calculated on those flight hours. "The aircraft has done great." The first couple of days covered familiar ground for most of the CH-47F crews. And though the scenery was entertaining from 1,200 feet in the air, the days were fairly uneventful. The battle rhythm was developed. Get to the airfield and the aircraft early in the morning. Pilots had already completed their pre-mission planning and all crew members assisted in getting the aircraft ready to fly for the day. The ramp at the back was lowered to allow access to the interior. Covers were removed from the engines, rotor hubs and other sensors that needed protection overnight. Blade ropes that had secured each rotor's four large blades were taken off. Luggage was stowed and tied down within. The pilots worked through their checklists while the flight engineer coordinated external checks from the ramp near the opened right side door as the engines started and the rotors began the first of their revolutions for the day. After a short taxi to the runway, the pilots would perform a hover check, then other final checks. The air mission commander in the lead helicopter would confirm a go for all aircraft in the sortie then the pilots in the four birds would increase air speed and elevation and take off. The day's flight had begun. The trip from Savannah to St. Louis was punctuated only by the fuel stop at Campbell Army Airfield. The overnight in St. Louis was nearly uneventful except for having to wait for an avionics software update on one of the F models. The delay slowed the day's mission by a couple of hours, putting off the arrival of the four Chinooks at the National Guard facility in Rapid City by a couple of hours. Departing from Rapid City the next morning, the sortie crews saw the first of several crowds drawn to the attraction of four Army Chinooks passing through had gathered just inside a National Guard hangar out of the reach of the morning's drizzle. The 30 some-odd men, women and children were just in time to witness the morning hover check and launch for the day. The weather had been clear flying into Montana and the crews had the first glimpse of the Rocky Mountains. By the next morning, however, the clouds had settled into the valleys and low areas to the north along the planned route to Edmonton. Traveling through the mountain passes had become a major safety concern which resulted in a two-day weather delay and the biggest single setback on the road to mission complete. But, as Lt. Col. Brad Killen, Cargo office product manager for the F model, explained that the mission was to get the Chinooks to the Soldiers of the 16th CAB in as safe a way as possible. "We can see to certain ridge lines, but we can't see over other ones. If you do punch in (to the clouds), then you would proceed to altitude and fly instruments. The problem here is, as we can see with all the snow capped mountains, once you get to altitude, then you're dealing with icing. And that's something you don't want in a helicopter. "In an aviation unit, we focus on getting the mission done and getting it done safely. We have weather conditions such that we'd probably be really close on whether or not we should launch or not and, in our case, we don't have troops that we need to go save, we don't have an injured Soldier that we're trying to go rescue on a mountain top somewhere. We're trying to get these eight 47Fs to Fairbanks, Alaska, safely. So we're going to wait until we're certain that we have good weather between here and our next stop in Alberta," Killen said. Once given the go ahead, the trip north was uneventful considering that eight Army Chinook helicopters, separated by just about an hour, were traveling into the heart of the Canadian province of Alberta and the cosmopolitan city of Edmonton. But it was a friendly invasion and the helicopters continued to draw at least a small crowd of onlookers and well-wishers. Several of the support staff at the Edmonton City Centre airport just north of downtown took a look inside one of the F models of Sortie 1 shortly after the sortie landed. They were joined by several others the next morning to watch the four Chinooks take off for the day. The Chinooks of Sortie 2 had landed at Edmonton International Airport situated south of the city. When they departed the next day, airport support crews with bucket trucks had lined up several hundred yards away against the edge of the airfield with buckets raised high to allow their occupants the best view of the departing Chinooks. The truck crews held their pseudo salute as the Chinooks climbed away and departed for the Canadian province to the west. A little over five hours later, the four helicopters in the sortie had arrived at Fort Nelson in northern British Columbia. The small town on the Al Can Highway served as a hub for the oil drilling activities in the region and had its fair share of air traffic as evidenced by busy regional airport nearby. A lot of things passed through Fort Nelson on the Al Can, but most of them were not new F model Chinooks. This stop along the route drew the attention of the students and faculty of the R.L. Angus Middle School who wasted no time in inviting themselves to the airport for a tour of the Chinooks. A few volunteers waited for the students and kept one aircraft open and ready and a short while later, the middle-schoolers were on the parking ramp where the four F models sat and talking to the pilots and flight engineers. The ramp extensions were lowered to allow easier access and soon the cargo helicopter was full of 15 students with iPads taking photos and video. The main attraction in the helicopter, however, was the cockpit. Since a little seat time was called for, one of the pilots offered some basic instructions on how to successfully enter the busy cockpit and briefly occupy a seat. "Put your left foot in first if you're going in the right seat, and your right foot in first if you're going in the left seat," Chief Warrant Officer 5 Matt Carmichael instructed. Carmichael was a pilot from 10th CAB at Fort Drum, N.Y., temporarily assigned to the ferry task force. The experience of getting in to the cockpit for the first time wasn't easy for everyone. "No, your other right foot," Carmichael scowled jokingly toward a student who didn't yet grasp his directions. "Now pull your other foot over," he said, adding a "there you go" when the student figured it out. "And remember, if you break it, you buy it," he announced to all of the students in the cargo bay of the F model. He then broke a smile to cue them in and added "they're actually pretty hard to break. They're Army tough." After everyone had a chance to sit up front, Carmichael, along with Chief Warrant Officer 5 Jack Tartaglia, a pilot with the Cargo Helicopters Project Office, handed out CH-47F patches to them as parting souvenirs, and then posed for photos with the students and the other pilots and crew in front of the aircraft. The following day, the four Ch-47F models of Sortie 2 followed the Alcan Highway through mountain passes too numerous to count. Following the highway below was not only the most direct route through the endless mountains, but a reliably open offer for a good spot to put one or more of the helicopters down should the need to land arise. Options for emergency landing zones were nearly non-existent in the otherwise craggy and forested area below. Options in any terrain are a necessity, but even more so in this unforgiving and remote part of the world. Fortunately, the need never arose. The scenery was impressive and downright spectacular. The rugged, snow covered mountains stretched from horizon to horizon and then some. Sporadic clusters of cabins along with an occasional airstrip could be seen from the crew's varying vantage points of between several hundred to 1,000 or 2,000 feet above ground level. Traces of wildlife could also be seen by the tracks they left in the snow below, and at one point, an eagle flew across the field of view. The need for the airstrips was obvious. Although an occasional car or truck could be spotted on the lonely road, the best way to get in or out of here was by air. Wheels on the ground took too much time and the distances between pockets of civilization were too vast. After a few more hours of solidly dramatic scenery, the four F model Chinooks in Sortie 2 stopped at Whitehorse to refuel, and then were off to Alaska once again. As the sortie neared the final destination on the ferry trip, the terrain below opened into the broad geologic basin that was the home to Fairbanks and Fort Wainwright. More signs of civilization followed and the Chena River, displaying the broken ice chunks of spring along its banks, joined the Alcan in leading the crews of Sortie 2 to the airfield destination ahead. Ladd Army Airfield was populated with a few D model Chinooks on skis instead of wheels. The D models stood out due to their darker green paint color against the snow in the middle of the air field where a few of them were parked. The four Chinooks in Sortie 1 were there, too, having arrived just the day before. It was a long way from sunny Savannah, Ga., but the weather was surprisingly not much different. The sun was out and Fairbanks was enjoying a mild 57 degrees Fahrenheit. And for Sorties 1 and 2, it was mission complete. Some of the pilots and crew members would travel back to Savannah to ferry the remaining four F models to this same spot. From an operational standpoint, Col. Marion pointed out the first two deliveries were a success. He then elaborated on the abilities of the Chinook. "We've used this aircraft in so many different roles. When we did the 50th anniversary of the first flight of the Chinook in Philadelphia where they build the Chinooks, the original design engineers came to the ceremony," Marion said. "I know that they had no idea that we'd be using this as an air assault platform and all the other missions that we've asked this aircraft to do. It's a testament to the folks who designed the aircraft and the Soldiers who are flying and maintaining the aircraft today that every time we ask it to pick up something else, to do something more, to take on a new mission, it's always done more than we asked it to do." The eight new CH-47F models parked on the ramp near a 16th CAB hangar were home. Not just home, but tested and proven. Not battle tested, maybe, or hooking a truck or Humvee from below proven, but they had just traveled 3,400 nautical miles by rotor without a major hitch. Four more new F models would join them in early May. Over the next few months, they would be turned over to their new crews in the 16th CAB with the help of the New Equipment Training Team pilots who will instruct them on the finer points of the latest model Ch-47F Chinook. The 16th CAB will, no doubt, have much to add to the storied legacy of the multi-capable cargo helicopter.

The effort, announced by the carrier Monday, is part of a broader trial of self-service bag drop machines at its MSP hub. Delta is installing four of the machines, including the one that will test facial recognition technology "equipped to ... match customers with their passport photos through identification verification.” Delta says the $600,000 initiative at MSP will make it the first airline to try a biometric-based self-service bag drop in the United States. This image provided by Delta shows the new bag-drops that will be added this summer at the carrier's hub at the Minneapolis/St. Paul airport.  (Photo: Delta Air Lines) “We expect this investment and new process to save customers time,” Gareth Joyce, Delta’s SVP - Airport Customer Service and Cargo, says in a statement. “And, since customers can operate the biometric-based bag drop machine independently, we see a future where Delta agents will be freed up to seek out travelers and deliver more proactive and thoughtful customer service.” Delta’s bag drops are aimed to those checking in via Delta’s self-service check-in kiosks. Customers will affix a bag tag to their luggage that is printed out from the kiosk and then take the tagged luggage to the bag-drop station. At the three stations without the biometric capability, an agent will verify a customer’s identity. The fourth bag-drop machine, the one that will test the facial-recognition technology, will attempt to verify the customer’s identity without the assistance of an agent. To use it, customers scan their passport at the machine, which will then use facial-recognition technology to try to confirm the identity of the person checking the bag matches the information from the passport. So far, the technology is only enabled for fliers with passports. Customers using other forms of ID will have to use one of the three other self-service bag drops. At all four bag drops, fliers leave their bags on the automated luggage belt once their identities are confirmed. The belt then takes the luggage off for security checks and to be loaded into the plane. Delta says it will evaluate customer feedback from the bag-drop trial, which comes amid a broader lobby renovation at the MSP airport, “to ensure that this lobby enhancement improves the overall customer experience.” Delta touted the bag drops as a way to speed up passenger queues. “Studies have found that self-service bag drops have the potential to process twice as many customers per hour,” the airline said in announcing the installation of the machines at MSP. Delta described the self-service bag drops and facial-recognition technology being introduced at MSP as “a natural next step in its work to streamline airport processes.” It comes after the carrier last year rolled out radio frequency identification (RFID) technology that allows the carrier to track bags in real-time via chips included in fliers’ bag tags. TODAY IN THE SKY: Delta leads quest to end lost airline luggage Delta also touted other recent efforts, such as an effort to add modernized security lanes at its Atlanta hub. The updated security queues, “gifted” to the Transportation Security Administration at Delta’s expense, were meant to reduce wait times by keeping empty bins circulating via an automated process. They were introduced last summer as security wait times spiked at a number of major U.S. airports amid staffing constraints at the TSA. Similar lanes have since been added at other U.S. airports. “This is the next step in curating an airport experience that integrates thoughtful innovation from start to finish,” Delta’s Joyce said about the new bag drops and facial-recognition features being tested at MSP. “We’re making travel easier than ever for our customers and continuing to deliver a leading customer experience.” TWITTER: You can follow Today in the Sky editor Ben Mutzabaugh at twitter.com/TodayInTheSky FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn Delta's quest to end lost luggage with RFID technology  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

The plane is being spray painted by hand, by a team of artists; the same group who created the Hekla Aurora plane. The process of airbrushing used to create the image of the glacier is a highly unusual, skilled job that will take the team a total of 24 days to complete using 195 litres of paint. It takes 1062 litres to cover the entire plane, which is over 200 domestic size tins. The new Vatnajökull plane also features wonderful touches of glacier magic within its interiors to replicate the experience of the Vatnajökull glacier itself. Ambient moving LED blue lighting will be installed in the main cabin; the headrests will be adorned with a beautiful ice white and brilliant turquoise design. Even the drinks trolley will be transformed into a mini ice-cave, while cups, napkins, and even sick bags will be decorated with glacier prints! The Vatnajökull glacier is the most active in Iceland with around 60 eruptions over the last 800 years, not surprising seeing as it has three active volcanoes beneath its surface: �r�fajökull, Bàròarbunga and Grímsvötn. It covers an area of 8100-8300 sq km, 8% of the country's land mass and is considered to be one of the seven natural wonders of Europe. Icelandair has been a supporter of the 'Friends of Vatnajokull' since the non-profit organisation was formed in 2009 to support research and educational activities. Birkir Hólm Gunason, CEO at Icelandair comments, "We can't wait to share the Vatnajökull with our passengers. Icelandair believe that travelling is one of life's great pleasures and a trip on this plane will ensure customers experience time welltravelled,as they sit back and experience Iceland's most extreme elements from the comfort of their own seats." A "Making Of" film is available to watch here: https://youtu.be/XdTbjzWdtss which captures the incredible process of painting the plane and showcases how Icelandair are committed to championing creativity to inspire and enrich their passengers. To mark the launch of the Vatnajökull, a celebration flight took place on 13 [th] May 2017, where a special flight path took it over the very glacier it is named after.

The new satellite will join the $1.6 billion Global Xpress broadband network developed by Inmarsat, a London-based company originally established to provide emergency communications to ships at sea that is now expanding its service into the airborne connectivity market. “It’s for passenger connectivity, so it’s wifi services for passengers for web browsing, email, video downloads and uploads,” said Michele Franci, Inmarsat’s chief technology officer. “On ships, our biggest market today is in merchant shipping, and there it will provide a combination of operational services and crew welfare.” Three Global Xpress satellites are already in orbit providing global broadband for mobile customers, and the fourth one set for launch by SpaceX on Monday is the next step in expanding the service. “We’ve always said that Global Xpress, with the first three Inmarsat 5 satellites, provides global coverage, but it’s a relatively thin layer, and then we would start going deep where needed, as needed, as market requirements push forward or user patterns change,” Franci said in an interview with Spaceflight Now. “This satellite we’re launching Monday will start providing some of that. “It’s not designed as a local augmentation, but it nevertheless does bring significant additional capacity, and thanks to the fact that we have steerable beams on it, we can create this effect of concentrating capacity in particular areas of the world where needed,” Franci said. The Boeing-made Inmarsat 5 F4 communications craft, valued by itself at up to $250 million, will launch from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center aboard a 229-foot-tall (70-meter) Falcon 9 booster at 2321 GMT (7:21 p.m. EDT) Monday, the opening of a 49-minute launch window. Forecasters from the U.S. Air Force’s 45th Weather Squadron predict an 80 percent chance of favorable conditions at launch time, with the only concerns being cumulus clouds near the Atlantic coastline and anvil clouds blowing toward the spaceport from inland storms. SpaceX ground crews transferred the fully-assembled rocket from a hangar at the southern perimeter of pad 39A up the incline to the historic launch complex Sunday. Engineers from Boeing’s satellite control center in El Segundo, California, planned to finalize checks on the Inmarsat satellite Sunday night and verify the spacecraft’s readiness for launch. Technicians were expected to hoist the two-stage rocket vertical at pad 39A with hydraulic lifts overnight, with final countdown preparations on tap Monday morning. Credit: Inmarsat SpaceX’s launch conductor will poll the launch team at 2208 GMT (6:08 p.m. EDT) for a “go” to begin loading super-chilled, densified propellant into the Falcon 9 rocket. RP-1 kerosene should be pumped into the Falcon 9 beginning at 2211 GMT (6:11 p.m. EDT), followed by cryogenic liquid oxygen at 2236 GMT (6:36 p.m. EDT). The propellants will continue flowing into the rocket until the final few minutes of the countdown, when the Falcon 9 will switch to internal battery power and its tanks will be pressurized for liftoff. The Falcon 9’s computers will command nine Merlin 1D engines to ignite at the base of the rocket at T-minus 3 seconds. Following an automated health check, the launcher will climb away from pad 39A with 1.7 million pounds of thrust, veering to the east over the Atlantic Ocean. Monday’s mission will loft one of the heftiest payloads ever launched by SpaceX, and the heaviest sent by a Falcon 9 into geostationary transfer orbit, the target orbit used by most telecom satellites. With a launch mass of 13,417 pounds (6,086 kilograms), Inmarsat 5 F4 will take all of the Falcon 9’s power to soar into as high of an orbit as possible Monday, according to Franci. “For this reason, this is a so-called Falcon 9 Full Thrust vehicle,” he said. “It’s not going to be recovered. No element of the first stage or anything else will be recovered. We’ve taken off all the gear that allows the recovery. We’re going to use the entire capacity of the vehicle to bring the satellite to GTO (geostationary transfer orbit).” SpaceX typically attempts to land the Falcon 9’s first stage at a recovery facility at Cape Canaveral or on an ocean-going barge offshore, depending on each mission’s requirements. For Monday’s launch, neither landing target is achievable. Instead, the first stage will drop into the Atlantic Ocean like other rocket boosters. SpaceX has heavier satellites on its manifest in the coming months, but Inmarsat 5 F4 is the biggest test of the Falcon 9’s lifting capability to date. “These records are meant to be beaten anyway,” Franci said. A mission poster for the launch of Inmarsat 5 F4. Credit: Inmarsat The Falcon 9’s first stage engines will fire until T+plus 2 minutes, 45 seconds, and then the 14-story booster will fall away from the rocket’s upper stage around four seconds later. A single Merlin 1D engine, fitted with an enlarged nozzle for better efficiency in the airless vacuum of space, will start up at T+plus 2 minutes, 56 seconds, delivering 210,000 pounds of thrust for nearly six minutes to steer into a preliminary orbit. The rocket’s nose cone, a composite fairing that shields the satellite during the first few phase of flight, will drop away from the Falcon 9 during the second stage burn at T+plus 3 minutes, 35 seconds. After shutdown of the second stage engine, the rocket and the attached Inmarsat 5 F4 satellite will speed across the Atlantic Ocean, flying over Cape Verde before firing its engine again near the equator at T+plus 26 minutes, 59 seconds. Franci said the 56-second engine firing is designed to push the telecom payload into a “supersynchronous” transfer orbit, with an apogee, or high point, above the satellite’s 22,300-mile-high (35,800-kilometer) final operating position. Parameters for the target orbit are not available, he said, because the upper stage engine is programmed to keep firing until it is almost out of fuel, a technique rocket engineers call a “minimum residual shutdown.” The tank-draining burn is intended to ensure the Inmarsat 5 F4 satellite goes into as high of an orbit as possible, reducing the work the craft’s own thrusters need to do in the coming months. Deployment of the satellite from the Falcon 9’s upper stage is scheduled for T+plus 31 minutes, 48 seconds. Around a half-dozen orbit-adjustment firings by the satellite’s hydrazine-fueled thruster are planned in the first couple of weeks after launch, followed by the extension of Inmarsat 5 F4’s solar panels May 28 to a wingspan of 133 feet — more than 40 meters — wider than the wingspan of a Boeing 737 passenger jet, Franci said. Then the satellite’s xenon-ion maneuvering jets will take over to fine-tune its path around Earth, settling in a circular orbit directly over Earth’s equator by mid-August. If the Falcon 9 can boost the craft into a higher-than-expected orbit, several weeks could be shaved off the orbit-raising schedule, according to Franci. “There’s quite some variability (in the targeted orbit), but in the worst case, we’ll still make the nominal 15-year mission that the satellite has been designed for,” Franci said. The satellite will also unfurl its antenna reflectors once stabilized in its final orbit. Artist’s concept of an Inmarsat 5-series satellite in orbit. Credit: Boeing Inmarsat 5 F4 should be operational around the end of this year, and its first job will likely be to grow Inmarsat’s broadband network load over Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and the Indian subcontinent, Franci said. Rupert Pearce, Inmarsat’s chief executive, said May 4 there is a “strong business case” for locating the new satellite over Europe, but he said Inmarsat has not solidified its plan for Inmarsat 5 F4. “Whether it’s going to stay there for long — long meaning most of its life — or not, that will depend on the other deployments we’re doing and the market demand,” Franci said. “But right now, that’s the area we expect to initially deploy it.” “Because it’s not needed (for) complete global coverage, the role of Inmarsat 5 F4 could change through its life,” said Tony Bates, Inmarsat’s chief financial officer, in a May 4 quarterly conference call with investment analysts. “And obviously, they are for in-orbit redundancy, which would limit it if it was needed for that purpose. But otherwise, it can go off to discrete business opportunities that may differ during its life.” Franci said Friday that Inmarsat 5 F4 will carry commercial broadband traffic “right at the start” of its operational life. The major customers for the Global Xpress network — Inmarsat’s fifth-generation fleet — include airlines, which use satellite links for safety and passenger entertainment, the maritime industry, oil and gas platforms, media companies, and the military. Based on the Boeing 702HP satellite bus, Inmarsat 5 F4 joins three nearly identical spacecraft successfully orbited on three Russian Proton rockets from 2013 through 2015 under the auspices of International Launch Services, a U.S.-based, Russian-owned launch services provider. The first three Inmarsat 5-series satellites are parked in geostationary orbit at positions around the globe. The first Global Xpress satellite is positioned to cover Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the second is over the Atlantic Ocean and the Americas, and a third Inmarsat 5 satellite launched in August 2015 provides coverage to the Asia-Pacific and Australia. Each Inmarsat 5-series Global Xpress satellite carries 89 fixed and six steerable spot beams in Ka-band. The company’s earlier satellites broadcast in L-band, but Inmarsat switched to Ka-band for the Global Xpress system, offering improved downlink communications speeds to 50 megabits per second, with up to 5 megabits per second on the uplink side. The jump in throughput with Global Xpress has attracted airlines and maritime operators to Inmarsat. According to Franci, around 1,000 ships already use Global Xpress services. “The system is working steady, even though we’re still in the introductory phase, but we are already seeing that in many areas there is going to be concentration of traffic,” he said. Pearce said May 4 that Global Xpress is now in full commercial service providing passenger broadband connectivity on 80 aircraft operated by Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines and Swiss International Air Lines. The German low-cost carrier Eurowings will start using Global Xpress in a few weeks, he said. Inmarsat also has an agreement to add Global Xpress receivers to aircraft owned by the Malaysian airline AirAsia, and Qatar Airways has announced it intends to install Global Xpress for in-flight wifi on its long-haul planes. Boeing is responsible for selling military-grade Global Xpress Ka-band services to U.S. government and military users. Monday’s launch is Inmarsat’s first mission with SpaceX, but Franci, a former procurement agent for SES, has experience with the launch company. SES was the first major commercial satellite operator to reserve a launch with SpaceX, and the Luxembourg-headquartered firm again took a chance with SpaceX in March, when it put a satellite aboard the first re-flight of a previously-used Falcon 9 rocket. SpaceX and many of its customers, including SES, believe the successful reuse of a Falcon 9 first stage is a harbinger of a new era of spaceflight with lower-cost launches. The Falcon 9 set for blastoff Monday is a newly-manufactured vehicle. “SpaceX is a very interesting company to work with,” he said. “The pure technology of their launchers is not Earth-shattering. They have not invented a different way of bringing satellites to orbit, but they did invent a different way of working.” Inmarsat originally booked Inmarsat 5 F4 for a launch on SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket, but delays in the debut of the new commercial mega-booster prompted a switch to the smaller Falcon 9 to avoid a “very significant delay,” Franci said. Inmarsat also moved another satellite off the Falcon Heavy last year, booking it on an Ariane 5 rocket launch from SpaceX rival Arianespace. That spacecraft, owned in partnership by Inmarsat and Greece’s Hellas-Sat, will lift off June 28 from French Guiana. Franci said Inmarsat has contract options to launch more satellites with SpaceX in the future, but no firm payload assignments have been made. “It’s an important launch for me and for Inmarsat,” Franci said of Monday’s mission. “We have always launched a bit less than some of our competitors, so every launch is very, very important. “We don’t have several launches a year,” he said. “This year is very exceptional in that we actually have two, so the tension is mounting.” Email the author.

Reuters/Jason Reed Qantas’ new Boeing 787 Dreamliner is slated to start daily non-stop flights between Perth and London on March 24, 2018. Tickets are reportedly on sale. In favour of its new service, the airline will axe its Airbus A380 flights from Melbourne to London via Dubai. The West Australian reports that a return economy fare was offered for a “very competitive” $2270. The first flight in the 236-seat Boeing 787-9 will take off from Perth next year and will land at London’s Heathrow Airport. Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce revealed through the news outlet last month that flights from Perth to Berlin, Rome and Paris were the next nonstop routes on Qantas’ radar. The Perth to London travels will start at Melbourne and will obtain both QF9 and QF10 numbers of the Melbourne-London service, according to the Australian Business Traveller. The travel will take 18 hours, the longest Qantas flight and the third-longest passenger flight worldwide. Joyce was confident that the service would result to a new level of convenience Australians had not experienced before.  “We’ve said the Qantas Dreamliner is a game changer and that’s now becoming real,” he said. The new Qantas service makes it possible to link Australia and the United Kingdom in a single hop, which used to take four days and seven stops. Joyce said Qantas was aware that the Perth to London flight was long, but not much longer compared to the airline’s Sydney to Dallas service. Additionally, Joyce said a “very high level of comfort” was added to each of the cabins and seat count was lower than most of their competitors. He also teased that Qantas is making tweaks to its in-flight service in order to assist customers in enjoying the journey even more. The airline stretched its marketing partnership with Tourism Western Australia in order to maximise the tourism benefits of its latest service. “It’s great for Qantas and for Australian aviation, but a world-first route like this is also great exposure for Western Australia,” Joyce said. WA tourism said it could add $9 million-$36 million a year into the economy of Western Australia. The amount would depend on passenger load. The state government invested $14million to upgrade domestic terminal T3 with border services. Amity Travel’s Luke Chittock anticipated a high demand for the service, specifically in the premium cabins. He said an increasing number of passengers were asking for nonstops.

The company said Wednesday that it still plans to deliver the first Boeing 737 Max later this month, and production will continue. A Boeing 737 MAX 9 under construction at the company's production facility in Renton, Washington, on Feb. 13. Jason Redmond / Reuters file The news sent Boeing Co. shares down nearly 4 percent, although they recovered partly to close at $183.18, down $2.31, or 1.3 percent. Chicago-based Boeing was notified last week of a potential issue involving turbine engine discs produced by a supplier to engine maker CFM International. Boeing said it has not experienced any problems with the discs during more than 2,000 hours of testing. It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 Max but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer. The Max is designed to be a more fuel-efficient version of the workhorse 737, Boeing's most popular commercial plane. Malaysia's Malindo Air plans to take delivery of the first Max in a few days and begin using it for passenger flights before July. Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. expects to begin using the plane this fall. It said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Related: China's 'Homegrown' Competitor to 737 Takes to the Skies American Airlines Group Inc., which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The discs in question are made by a supplier to CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran. GE spokeswoman Jamie Jewell declined to identify the supplier. She said GE and Safran will work with the supplier to find and correct any shortcomings in the manufacturing process while also turning to a backup supplier to keep production of engines on schedule. A Boeing logo on one of the firm's 737 Max 9 jets. Jason Redmond / AFP - Getty Images file In a written statement, Boeing said it will work with CFM "to understand the precise scope and root cause of the quality issue." New planes and parts go through extensive testing to turn up problems before passengers go on board. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., said "this doesn't look like a serious concern" because Boeing still expects to deliver the first plane this month and it appears to be a fixable manufacturing problem rather than a design flaw. Boeing has built about 9,500 single-aisle 737s since the late 1960s. The company said it has taken more than 3,700 orders for the Max, which carries a list price of $112.4 million to $119.2 million, although airlines routinely get big discounts.

The contamination occurred in April of last year while President Barack Obama was still president. Because of unsafe cleaning procedures, there was a risk of fire breaking out on the plane. Secret Service agents stand by as Air Force One departs from Dallas Love Field Airport March 12, 2016 in Dallas. Ashley Landis / Getty Images pool file Three Boeing mechanics working on the plane, "failed to follow proper maintenance procedures leading to the contamination of the oxygen system," according to a report by the Air Force Materiel Command. They were working on a VC-25A, one of two specially configured Boeing 747-200B aircraft, which are known as Air Force One when they fly the president. Boeing repaid for the damages at its own expense. After he was elected but before he assumed office, President Donald Trump threatened to cancel an order with Boeing for two updated 747's that would join the Air Force One fleet.

SpaceX will attempt to deliver a classified payload to orbit and liftoff is scheduled for tomorrow at 7 a.m. ET from Kennedy Space Center. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) (Photo: Joe Raedle, Getty Images) 24 CONNECTTWEET 5 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is targeting a 7:21 p.m. Monday launch of a “behemoth” commercial communications satellite from Kennedy Space Center. You can watch live in the player above. Weighing in at nearly 13,500 pounds atop the rocket, the fourth Inmarsat-5 satellite will be the heaviest load lofted by a Falcon 9 yet. The 230-foot rocket will need all its fuel and 1.7 million pounds of liftoff thrust to deliver the spacecraft larger than a double-decker bus on its way to an orbit more than 22,000 miles over the equator. As a result, SpaceX will not attempt to land the rocket’s first stage either at Cape Canaveral or at sea, and the Falcon 9 booster is not equipped with landing legs. The Inmarsat-5 Flight 4 satellite, built by Boeing, will complete Inmarsat’s four-satellite Global Xpress constellation focused on delivering high-speed broadband data to mobile customers including commercial aircraft and ships and the U.S. military. “I’m sure we’re going to have a really, really exciting show (Monday),” said Inmarsat CEO Rupert Pearce. “Everyone at Inmarsat, SpaceX and Boeing is really, really pumped about this launch. It’s a very significant one for us at Inmarsat, because we call it the end of the beginning of the Global Xpress era.” CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share SPACEX'S FALCON 9 ROCKET EXPLODES ON LAUNCHThis is why SpaceX rocket explosion is a big loss | 2:10 The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that exploded Sunday means the loss of important research equipment and supplies for the crew on board the International Space Station.

The move sets up the St. Louis plant in competition with facilities in Alabama and South Carolina run or planned by Boeing's rivals in bidding to build an initial 350 T-X jets. Boeing said winning the contest would support around 1,800 jobs, but didn't disclose if any new ones would be created if it wins the contest due to be decided later this summer and assembles planes in the St. Louis facility, where test aircraft have been built in partnership with Sweden's Saab AB. The Boeing offering is the only "homegrown" entrant from prime defense contractors, with Lockheed Martin Corp. offering a version of a plane developed by Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd, while Italy's Leonardo SpA entered its own widely used trainer after dropping a planned joint bid with Raytheon Co. The Pentagon requires the winner to assemble planes in the U.S., though parts are drawn from global supply chains. Northrop Grumman Corp. pulled out of the contest earlier this year after designing an all-new plane. Boeing already builds its F-15 jet fighter and the F/A-18 aircraft widely used by the U.S. Navy in St. Louis, and the T-X would help maintain experienced workers at the plants as orders become scarce. The U.S. company has explored a potential move of the F-15 production line to India, to win a big combat jet deal, and the extension of F/A-18 work hinges in part on Boeing securing overseas orders for the planes. Boeing's recent complaint against Bombardier Inc. over alleged predatory pricing of the CSeries passenger jet has led some analysts to question whether it can hang on to a potential deal outlined last year to sell 18 F/A-18s to Canada, which has rejected the charges. "Canada is also a natural customer for P-8 maritime patrol aircraft and many other Boeing military products," said Richard Aboulafia at Teal Group in a client note. "Unless, that is, they start looking to anybody but Boeing for their defense needs." The International Trade Commission is due to hold an initial hearing on Boeing's complaint on May 18. Boeing has identified winning the T-X contest as a priority after its joint bid with Lockheed to build a new Air Force bomber lost out to Northrop. The plane flew for the first time in December. Employment at Boeing facilities in Missouri had dipped to just under 14,000 by the end of Marchsecond only to Washington state -- from around 16,000 a decade ago. Lockheed would assemble the T-50A jet developed with Korea Aerospace for the T-X contest in Greenville, S.C., where it also plans to shift production of its F-16 combat jet from Fort Worth. Italy's Leonardo says it would build a plant in Tuskegee, Ala., for its offering and create 750 jobs if it wins the Air Force contract.

LOUIS, MO (KPLR) - Boeing announced Monday plans to manufacture new Air Force TX training jets in St. Louis, provided the military branch chooses Boeing for the project. The contract would bring 1,800 direct and indirect jobs to the St. Louis area. Missouri Governor Eric Greitens and Senator Claire McCaskill were at the announcement to help break the good news. "It's a fantastic project and incredible opportunity, not just for Missouri, but for the country to have Boeing win this. It's a really important project,” Greitens said. The plane, built by Boeing and Saab, had a successful test flight in St. Louis in December. It will be used by the Air Force for training jet pilots and is planned to go into operation by 2024. “The Boeing T-X trainer will keep Americans safe and create more jobs for Missourians,” Greitens said. “Companies like Boeing, which are committed to growing and investing here, show the world that our state is open for business and ready to create new jobs.” The initial acquisition for 350 aircraft and ground-based training and support is valued at $16 billion. The TX will replace the aging T-38 trainer. The first two new TX jets were assembled at Boeing, which could be a sign of good things to come. Senator McCaskill said nobody would be better equipped to handle the contract than Boeing. “It's built on time, on budget, to the full capabilities, and it's reliable," McCaskill said. "That's why I'm hopeful that it's a fair competition and it will be taken into account that a competitor is getting subsidation from a foreign country.” Congressman Lacy Clay feels Boeing is in a great position and its partnership with Saab can only help. "This TX proposal was something we're pushing for. The TX team are always an excellent group of skilled workers that we want to support and we want those jobs here,” Clay said. The Air Force will make its final decision later in the year. “Our highly skilled St. Louis workforce designed, assembled and brought Boeing T-X to life, and they continue to define the future, not just for our company, but for our customers and the global aerospace industry,” said Shelley Lavender, St. Louis senior executive and president of Boeing Military Aircraft.

"A sum of 9 financial institutions from Norway, Denmark, Ireland, Britain, China and Japan have offered Iran to fund the purchases," Fakhrieh Kashan said. He underlined that proceedings to hold a tender to choose the financer for the purchases were underway, and said, "Tender documents would be sent out to potential bidders within a month." In relevant remarks in April, CEO of Iran Air, national flag carrier, Farhad Parvaresh said that the Iranian airline will receive four ATR aircraft within three weeks given that the deadline for the French-Italian aircraft manufacturer has expired for a week. Parvaresh also noted that, as per the contract with Boeing, the first Boeing 777 Wide-body jet airliner will be delivered to Iran Air in a year time. He also pointed to the latest status of the negotiations with the largest German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG, and said, "Not long ago, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed with Lufthansa on technical and operational training, catering and corporate restructuring as well as business cooperation; the agreement was recently implemented in the commercial sector though talks are still underway on other provisions." The French-Italian ATR plane manufacturer has signed a contract with Iran Air to provide it with 20 planes. This is a third plane manufacturer after Airbus and Boeing had successfully signed lucrative deals with Iran. Efforts to sign a deal with Brazilian manufacturer Embraer had been uninspiring and plans were abandoned in favor of Airbus and Boeing.         Related News Official: ATR to Deliver 4 Passenger Planes to Iran Next Week  Official: Iran to Select Financers for Purchasing Passenger Planes via Tender  Minister: Iran to Use ATR Planes for Short-Distance, Small Airports  CEO: ATR Ready to Sell More Passenger Planes to Iran  Source: Boeing to Deliver 2 Passenger Planes to Iran in 1 Month  Deputy Minister: Iran Air Inks Contract with ATR to Buy 20 Passenger Planes  LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Army Artillery Units Pound Terrorists in Moshayrifeh East of Homs Yemen: Sanaa Hospitals Continue to Struggle with Numerous Cholera Cases as Saudi Siege Continues Iraqi Forces Corner ISIL into Small Area as Offensive Approaches Endgame Homs: More Militants, Family Members Leave Al-Wa'er Iraqi Popular Forces Repel ISIL's Night Attack West of Hadar Region NDF Captures Hilltops East of Mount Al-Shoumeriyeh, Homs Province Iraqi Popular Forces Liberate More Villages in Qayrawan Region 'Nakba Day': 69 Years of Despair The Old Will Not Die and the Young Will Not Forget – The Nakba People across World Mark Palestinian Nakba Day Iran Reiterates Support for Palestinian Refugees' Right to Return Home ISIL's Heavy Attack to Prevail over Syrian Army Positions in Hama Repulsed Intense Infighting Reported among Terrorists in Eastern Ghouta of Damascus Iran's Judiciary Chief Blasts S.

Nevertheless, he emphasized that proceedings to hold a tender to choose the financer for the purchases were underway, adding that tender documents would be sent out to potential bidders within a month.  Last week, he was quoted by media as saying that Britain’s key export credit agency – UK Export Finance (UKEF) – had informed Iran’s Ministry of Roads and Urban Development that it was ready to provide funding for all of Iran’s purchases from Boeing and Airbus.

Matthew previously worked for GKN Aerospace where he led the introduction of a global strategy for composite procurement across Europe, North America and Asia.  Prior to this Matthew worked at Defence industry prime contractors and the UK Ministry of Defence.   History and Background Velocity was established in October 2007 by Jonathan Bridges, Gerard Johnson and Christopher Banks (the „Founders”), three career composite engineers, to manufacture kits of raw materials to be used in the manufacture of composite aircraft parts. The Founders recognised that there was a market opportunity to make the supply chain more efficient and less expensive by operating between the raw material suppliers and the aircraft part manufacturers and converting the materials into a usable form.  Initially Velocity operated from the premises of its first customer in order to prove the concept and demonstrate that, by using Velocity’s processes, material cost savings were achievable.   This trial was successful and in November 2008, the Company commenced occupation of a 11,000 square ft facility located in Blackburn and acquired its first cutting, welding and sewing machines enabling it to diversify its product range from simple manual-cut shapes towards more complex shapes and engineered products. The premises in Blackburn obtained AS9100 approval in October 2009. Following further growth in July 2012 Velocity occupied new, purpose built premises in Burnley and continues to operate from this 26,000 square ft facility. At that time, the premises included floor space of 18,000 square ft, including 15,000 square ft of cleanroom space, which the Blackburn facility did not have. During 2013 and 2014 the Company invested in increasing floor space at the Burnley site so that it now operates from 32,500 square ft of floor space in total, including 20,000 square ft of cleanroom space.   Following further contract wins Velocity has opened a second site in Hampshire, UK to service customers in the south of England and mainland Northern Europe. This facility mirrors the manufacturing capability of our Lancashire HQ with all requisite approvals.   Historically, aircraft manufacturers have had to prepare and process materials for part manufacture in-house and this has generally been performed in high overhead/labour rate facilities. Savings made by the customer when using Velocity‚s services include:   ·      material spend reduction of approximately 10-53 per cent.; ·      reduction in indirect support staff costs; ·      reduction in cost of non-quality products; ·      reduction in stock going ‚out of life’; and ·      reduction in capital equipment spend.   In addition to these savings, customers also gain the following:   ·      material increase in productivity;  ·      increase in productive cleanroom floor space;  ·      full material traceability and regulatory compliance; and ·      better payment terms resulting in improved cashflow.   Reasons for Admission The Directors believe that Admission will represent an important step in the Company’s development and will enhance its growth potential by the injection of additional growth capital and by the increased profile attaching to its new status as a publicly quoted company. The Company believes that the main reasons for becoming a public quoted company are as follows:   ·      there is an opportunity to establish a market leading position in multiple regions; ·      it will assist in receiving additional approvals; ·      provides future access to capital; ·      working capital management; ·      customers and suppliers expect the governance associated with becoming a PLC; and ·      the credibility of becoming a PLC, especially with Primes and Tier 1 manufacturers.     Important Notices Neither this announcement nor any copy of it may be taken or transmitted, published or distributed, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, in, into or from the United States of America (including its territories and possessions, any state of the United States of America (the „United States” or the „US”)), Australia, Canada, Japan, the Republic of Ireland or the Republic of South Africa or transmitted, distributed to, or sent by, any national or resident or citizen of any such countries or any other jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant securities laws of such jurisdiction (each a „Restricted Jurisdiction”).

All Icelandair planes are named after Icelandic volcanoes and this special livery joins the Hekla Aurora, created in 2015 and inspired by the northern lights, as the second hand crafted piece of artwork to adorn one of their fleet. So now when you fly transatlantic or take a stopover you can explore another natural phenomenon before you even land. Icelandair commissioned this plane as part of their celebrations for their 80th anniversary this year. The plane is being spray painted by hand, by a team of artists; the same group who created the Hekla Aurora plane. The process of airbrushing used to create the image of the glacier is a highly unusual, skilled job that will take the team a total of 24 days to complete using 195 litres of paint. It takes 1062 litres to cover the entire plane, which is over 200 domestic size tins. The new Vatnajökull plane also features wonderful touches of glacier magic within its interiors to replicate the experience of the Vatnajökull glacier itself. Ambient moving LED blue lighting will be installed in the main cabin; the headrests will be adorned with a beautiful ice white and brilliant turquoise design. Even the drinks trolley will be transformed into a mini ice-cave, while cups, napkins, and even sick bags will be decorated with glacier prints! The Vatnajökull glacier is the most active in Iceland with around 60 eruptions over the last 800 years, not surprising seeing as it has three active volcanoes beneath its surface: Öræfajökull, Báròarbunga and Grímsvötn. It covers an area of 8100-8300 sq km, 8% of the country's land mass and is considered to be one of the seven natural wonders of Europe. Icelandair has been a supporter of the 'Friends of Vatnajokull' since the non-profit organisation was formed in 2009 to support research and educational activities. Birkir Hólm Guðnason, CEO at Icelandair comments, "We can't wait to share the Vatnajökull with our passengers. Icelandair believe that travelling is one of life's great pleasures and a trip on this plane will ensure customers experience time well travelled, as they sit back and experience Iceland's most extreme elements from the comfort of their own seats." A "Making Of" film is available to watch here: https://youtu.be/XdTbjzWdtss which captures the incredible process of painting the plane and showcases how Icelandair are committed to championing creativity to inspire and enrich their passengers. To mark the launch of the Vatnajökull, a celebration flight took place on 13th May 2017, where a special flight path took it over the very glacier it is named after.

Boeing is competing to win the contract from the U.S. Department of Defense to manufacture the planes here. Photo by Christian Gooden, cgooden@post-dispatch.com WASHINGTON • The buzz here Monday was that Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin, will announce in July that she will challenge Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., in 2018. The National Journal’s Josh Kraushaar cited two anonymous sources in saying that Wagner would announce in July, and he declared McCaskill the most endangered Senate Democrat in 2018. Ironically, the two women appeared together at a Boeing event in St. Louis on Monday. House news: Dems landing bumper crop of moderate recruits w pro-biz, military bios in red districts https://t.co/Id676MEuUG— Josh Kraushaar (@HotlineJosh) May 15, 2017 Politico picked up Kraushaar's prediction and — well, you know the rest. The political grapevine got a Missouri virus for a day. The Post-Dispatch, which reported some time ago that if Wagner decided to run she would not announce at least until after May, asked Wagner’s chief of staff, Christian Morgan, if the reports were true. If July, it would be late in the month, he said, and it may very well be later than that. Morgan said that the political environment is so “crazy” that Wagner “may not need as early of an announcement.” “We’ll see,” he told this newspaper. On several levels, announcing later rather than sooner could make some sense. First, the political environment is so charged, with Republican campaign promises to reform health care and the tax code threatened by partisan quicksand and fractures in the GOP itself, that announcing a challenge to McCaskill would look presumptuous. Yes, the House passed an overhaul of Obamacare, with Wagner whipping votes. But it's now tied up in the Senate, and not so popular with the people. With so many Republican promises on shaky ground, Wagner could logically be asked why she wanted a promotion at such a time. (And voters could be excused for saying: What, this again?)  Second, the sooner Wagner announces, the sooner deep-pocketed, liberal interest groups could rev up their attacks on her.  Already, groups on the left and right have begun running ads in Missouri. The campaign, for all practical purposes, has begun anyway, but without announced Republican candidates. Other Republicans are thinking of getting in, too. As long as the situation is somewhat diffuse, the concentrated attacks on Wagner wouldn't be as effective. And third, Wagner is a bit of a rare Republican: A woman with considerable rainmaker capabilities, she's raised money for Bushes, and also millions of dollars for fellow Republican U.S. House members. She’s built chits and a national fundraising network, and most observers think Wagner would not have trouble raising a lot in a little time once she says she's ready to take McCaskill on. Wagner has already built a fairly substantial campaign bank account. She can afford to wait. Is McCaskill the most vulnerable Democrat in 2018, as Kraushaar maintains? In this body politic, which can be sent into froth and fervor with a single Donald Trump tweet, these kinds of declarations are barely worth the uttered breath to make them — or the 140 characters to write them. So much has changed in the six months since the 2016 election that guessing about the 18 months ahead is like throwing darts blindfolded. Maybe something will stick.   McCaskill was endangered in 2012, too, until Republican Todd Akin crashed and burned on a couple of words, virtually overnight. And McCaskill has shown herself plenty capable of raising money, and running against a status quo, whatever it is at the time – even of playing mischief in Republican primaries – to not be underestimated 18 months out.  On the web: National Journal piece mentioning the Missouri Senate race: https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/652892?unlock=VHJNLLGOT7UE5XCR By the numbers: $2.7 million - cash in Wagner's campaign bank account at the end of March. $3.2 million - cash on hand in McCaskill's campaign account at the same time.  They said it:  "In Mis­souri, Rep. Ann Wag­n­er is plan­ning to enter the Sen­ate race in Ju­ly, ac­cord­ing to two sources fa­mil­i­ar with her plans, and has seen private polling show­ing her already lead­ing Sen. Claire Mc­Caskill. Of­fi­cials from both parties agree that Mc­Caskill is the most vul­ner­able Demo­crat up for reelec­tion." - National Journal Political Editor Josh Kraushaar  Political Fix from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Be informed.

Quick video recap of Falcon 9 launch of Inmarsat-5 Flight 4 pic.twitter.com/W8eVUEsH6r — SpaceX (@SpaceX) May 16, 2017 The satellite is Inmarsat’s four-satellite Global Xpress constellation, aimed at delivering high-speed mobile broadband data to customers, including commercial aircraft and ships and the US military. Monday's launch also marked the first time SpaceX had launched a satellite for the London-based mobile broadband company. The payload weighed some 6,100 kilograms and the force needed to propel it to orbit would not leave enough fuel for the rocket to maneuver back to Earth. It was the heaviest load lofted by a Falcon 9 yet. "Inmarsat, the only operator of a global Ka-band network, created the GX platform to enable communities across the world to benefit from the emerging digital society," said a company statement. SpaceX, which is headed by Elon Musk, did not attempt to bring the first stage of the rocket back to Earth for an upright landing following the launch.

William Harwood/CBS News Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Under a clear sunset sky, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket streaked into space Monday, boosting a heavy Inmarsat communications satellite into orbit in the California rocket builder's second flight in just two weeks, its sixth so far this year. Thirty-two minutes after liftoff, the Inmarsat-5 F4 satellite -- the fourth in a global constellation of high-speed Ka-band relay stations serving aircraft, ships at sea and other government and commercial users around the world -- was released into the planned highly elliptical orbit. SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches spy satellite SpaceX successfully launches satellite in historic flight with "used" booster Over the next 90 days or so, the bus-size satellite's on-board thrusters will be used to circularize the orbit 22,300 miles above the equator where the relay station will turn in lockstep with Earth and appear stationary in the sky. It is joining three virtually identical Boeing-built satellites in Inmarsat's $1.6 billion Global Xpress constellation. "It's the first global seamless broadband service specifically designed for mobile applications," Michele Franci, chief technology officer at Inmarsat, told Spaceflight Now. "That is the background of Inmarsat, mobile applications, so this constellation, and the entire network around it, has been designed to be optimized for mobile users." The mission got underway at 7:21 p.m. EDT (GMT-4) when the Falcon 9's first-stage engines ignited with a rush of fiery exhaust. An instant later, the rocket was released from its firing stand and it smoothly climbed into the early evening sky atop a brilliant jet of flame from its nine Merlin 1D engines. Arcing away to the east, the rocket climbed out of the thick lower atmosphere and two minutes and 45 seconds after launch, the first stage engines shut down, the stage fell away and the rocket's second stage, powered by a single Merlin engine, continued the climb to space. The Inmarsat-5 F4 satellite tipped the scales at 13,417 pounds, the heaviest satellite yet launched by SpaceX to a geosynchronous transfer orbit. As a result, the Falcon 9 used virtually all of its first-stage propellants lifting the payload out of the lower atmosphere and it was not possible to fly the booster back to a landing. Play Video SciTech Watch: SpaceX launches spy satellite into orbit A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off early Monday, carrying a classified National Reconnaissance Office spy satellite into orbit. Then the rocke... Of the six flights launched by SpaceX so far this year, four stages were successfully recovered, two on off-shore drone ships and two back at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Monday's flight was the second this year in which a landing was ruled out by the weight and orbital requirements of the satellite payload. In any case, the Falcon 9's second stage fired twice to reach a so-called "super synchronous" elliptical orbit and the Inmarsat-5 satellite was safely released to fly on its own. The Inmarsat-5 satellite originally was built as a spare and is now intended to expand existing service. It originally was scheduled for launch aboard a heavy-lift version of the Falcon, a rocket made up of three Falcon 9 first stage cores and a single upper stage. The maiden flight of the Falcon Heavy has been repeatedly delayed -- it currently is planned for sometime this summer -- but engine upgrades made it possible to launch the 6.7-ton Inmarsat-5 satellite to a single-core Falcon 9, clearing the way for Monday's flight. The Inmarsat-5 series satellites are the backbone of the company's Global Xpress system, providing airline passenger connectivity, "so it's wi-fi services for passengers for web browsing, email, video downloads and uploads," said Franci. "Our biggest market today is in merchant shipping, and there it will provide a combination of operational services and crew welfare," he said. "In maritime, our system is actually integrated. We have L-band and Ka-band that are seamlessly joined up on the ship itself, and our system automatically evaluates the quality of the link. "We stay in Ka-band as long as we can, and if ever the link would become poor, either because of edge of coverage reasons or very bad weather, we would jump over to L-band. We offer always-on resilience and reliability when it comes down to real needs, and the quality of broadband for most of the time." Play Video CBSN Watch: SpaceX "used" rocket launch Watch SpaceX's successful launch and land of a rocket that's flown before. This was SpaceX's sixth launch so far this year, its 34th Falcon 9 flight overall and the seventh since a Falcon 9 exploded on its Cape Canaveral Air Force Base launch pad Sept. 1. SpaceX has recovered 10 first stage boosters in 15 attempts over the past two years. Today's flight was SpaceX's second in just 14 days, demonstrating the rapid-fire pace company officials are counting on to work through a backlog of satellites. If all goes well, SpaceX will launch a space station-bound Dragon cargo ship June 1, a Bulgarian communications satellite on June 15 and an Intelsat relay station around the end of June. If that blistering pace holds up, SpaceX will have launched nine Falcon 9s in just six months. A key element in maintaining that rapid launch rate is returning pad 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station to service. The pad was heavily damaged in the Sept. 1 pre-flight mishap but it is expected to be back on line shortly. SpaceX operates a launch pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, and two pads in Florida. The company plans to use pad 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station primarily for commercial payloads and to reserve pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center for the Falcon Heavy, Dragon space station resupply flights and launches of crew ferry ships being designed to carry astronauts to and from the space station. Three Dragon cargo flights are planned this year, along with the Heavy's maiden launch. The first unpiloted test flight of SpaceX's Dragon crew ship is expected next March. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Unlike past missions, however, Monday’s launch saw the Falcon 9 deliver a massive payload to space, and never return to Earth, all for the sake of better internet. In a launch that was viewed by millions of viewers across the globe, the Falcon 9 rocket seemingly broke its limits and delivered its biggest payload yet in what currently stands as one of SpaceX’s most successful missions to date. A WIRED report has stated that the private space firm would be launching a satellite from its Cape Canaveral launch pad on Monday night, with the launch window opening at 7:21 p.m. EST. The Falcon 9 rocket would be carrying a massive, 13,500-pound satellite from British firm Inmarsat, which is designed to deliver high-speed broadband internet to mobile customers. The satellite, called the Inmarsat-5 Flight 4, is built by Boeing and is created to be one of four Global Xpress satellites that are set to deliver improved mobile internet connection for passengers in commercial aircraft, ships, and members of the U.S. military who are currently deployed. With the satellite launching into space, in-flight internet would be significantly improved. Liftoff! https://t.co/gtC39uBC7z pic.twitter.com/C5nAH1bnPB — SpaceX (@SpaceX) May 15, 2017 SpaceX has practically mastered the art of sending spacecraft to space and bringing them back to Earth, but in the case of Monday’s launch, the private firm has opted to send its rocket on a one-way trip instead. This is due to the sheer size of the payload it is carrying, as the Inmarsat-5 Flight 4 is the Falcon 9’s heaviest payload yet, weighing in at 13,500 pounds and being larger than a double-decker bus. With a payload this heavy, the Falcon 9’s 230-foot frame needed all of its fuel and 1.7 million pounds of liftoff thrust to send the satellite to its destination 22,000 miles above the equator, according to a USA Today report. As a result of the large payload it would be carrying, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket on Monday’s launch did not land its first stage after use. The Falcon Booster also went to space without carrying a landing gear. This is not the first time SpaceX has made a similar decision, however, as the private space firm also launched a satellite from EchoStar in a one-way trip to space a couple months back. During that time, it appeared that the EchoStar launch would be SpaceX’s last expendable mission. As it turned out, however, this was not to be the case. The Inmarsat-5 Flight 4 rocket was originally slated to be launched in SpaceX’s bigger, far more reusable rocket, the Falcon Heavy. Back when SpaceX and the British firm ironed out their contract back in 2014, the massive payload was planned for a launch using the private space company’s largest rocket to date. With the Falcon Heavy still in development, however, the two companies had to reach a compromise, which ended with SpaceX opting to sacrifice one of its Falcon 9 rockets to send the Inmarsat-5 Flight 4 satellite payload to space. Falcon 9 and Inmarsat-5 Flight 4 vertical on Pad 39A. The 49-minute launch window opens at 7:21 p.m. EDT, or 23:21 UTC. pic.twitter.com/BYylLU7TTE — SpaceX (@SpaceX) May 15, 2017 Inmarsat CEO Rupert Pearce has expressed his anticipation and optimism for the mission, stating that the launch would signify the beginning of a revolution in mobile internet. Considering that the mission would give better connections to customers who are out of range from conventional internet providers, the Inmarsat CEO’s statements could not be any more accurate. “I’m sure we’re going to have a really, really exciting show. Everyone at Inmarsat, SpaceX and Boeing is really, really pumped about this launch. It’s a very significant one for us at Inmarsat, because we call it the end of the beginning of the Global Xpress era.” With SpaceX achieving yet another successful launch, its place as one of the most aggressive and formidable private space firms has just been further established. If any, it proved that the Falcon 9, despite being pushed to its limits, is capable of delivering its payload to space in a safe and satisfactory manner.

(Andy Bronson / The Herald) Couple pays $5,495 owed for lunches at Marysville schools Chris Winters Mon May 15th, 2017 3:20pm News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. MARYSVILLE — On Friday, Tom and Christy Lee called the Marysville School District, intending to pay off the lunch money debt for the students at Kellogg Marsh Elementary School. They asked how much debt had accrued. “We actually figured it would be $2,000 for Kellogg Marsh,” Christy Lee said. “We were shocked when it was only $259.” They went to the district offices to make their donation. While there, they asked what they thought was the obvious next question: How much would it take to pay off the debt for every elementary kid in the district? The answer: $5,495 for 262 kids in 10 schools. They said they’d go home to talk about it, Tom Lee said. It turned out they didn’t need to. In the car, Tom and Christy agreed. “We already knew we were going to do it,” he said. “We came home, poured a cup of coffee and called them back,” he said. It was a surprise at the district. “In my 32 years in public education, it’s the first time I’ve seen something of this magnitude,” said Marysville School Superintendent Becky Berg. Schools regularly receive donations from PTA groups and individuals, Berg said, often targeted at a specific school or program, such as paying for a field trip or a nonstandard piece of equipment like a 3-D printer. Occasionally, a parent may pay off the lunch debt of one of their kids’ friends. But usually, donations aren’t made with the entire district in mind, Berg said. The Lees had been talking about giving back to their community for several months. They had agreed that they wanted to give to Kellogg Marsh Elementary, which their son Ryan attended in the 1990s. When the Lees worked for Boeing, they always tried to contribute the maximum amount allowed to the Employee Community Fund, which directs millions of dollars each year to charitable causes. After they retired a few years ago, they continued to contribute to the Marysville Community Food Bank, Senior Services of Snohomish County’s Meals on Wheels program, and an international ministry. “We buy goats for the ladies in Africa,” Tom Lee said. But they felt like they could do more. They’d done OK in life and their New Year’s resolution was to give back, he said. “We’re just not giving as much as we used to and we kind of missed that,” he said. “Friday morning, when I got up I said, ‘Today’s the day I want to do it,’” he said. There’s another reason why they chose to do this now. “Some of my health issues,” Tom Lee said. “My kidneys failed about a year-and-a-half ago.” In August 2015, the Lees had planned on a long-dreamed-of trip to Hawaii. “Then I started getting sicker and sicker,” he said. After spending a night in the hospital that November, they talked to a nephrologist, who told them he had to start dialysis the next week. They had to cancel their trip. “We were crushed,” he said. “We’ve been together 40 years and it was our goal.” While the Lees have focused on improving Tom’s health to where he could qualify for a transplant, they started looking for things to do. “His nutritionist is telling him to do things on his bucket list,” Christy Lee said. That brought them back to the Marysville School District. Kids with school lunch debt generally don’t get a choice of hot lunch, Berg said. Usually they get something like a cheese sandwich. “We will never be in the business of throwing a lunch away or taking it from a child’s hand,” Berg said. But other kids who don’t have debt can see who’s eating what kind of lunch, Tom Lee said. “It’s embarrassing,” Christy Lee said. Unpaid lunch debt at the end of the school year also carries over into the next year. The one thing that really reassures the Lees is knowing that both of those problems are now taken care of. Berg said the district hasn’t officially communicated to the schools yet about the Lees’ donation, but the computers in the cafeteria would show that the debts were paid. “No child is going to go without a good regular lunch today,” Tom Lee said. On Tuesday, the Lees plan to go to Kent Prairie Elementary in Arlington, where their two grandsons attend school, and drop off a check for $239.88 to wipe out all the kids’ lunch debt there. Then they’ll get to work on the rest of his bucket list, starting with that trip to Hawaii. “This year,” he said. “And hopefully next year will be Alaska,” Christy Lee said.

Planning expeditions to Earth’s nearest celestial neighbor is no longer just a NASA effort, though the U.S. space agency has plans for a moon-orbiting space station that would serve as a staging ground for Mars missions in the early 2030s.  Scroll down for videos   The moon has one-sixth the gravity of Earth, which makes it an attractive alternative base. The moon also has ice, which we already know how to process into a hydrogen-oxygen propellant that we use in many modern rockets (pictured is an artist impression of a fueling station) MINING THE MOON  A team of international students have proposed a plan that uses three different types of rovers to mine ice on the moon, manufacture liquid propellant and transfer it to passing spacecraft.  One rover, which we call the Prospector, would explore the moon and find ice-bearing locations.  A second rover, the Constructor, would follow along behind, building a launch pad and packing down roadways to ease movements for the third rover type, the Miners, which actually collect the ice and deliver it to nearby storage tanks and an electrolysis processing plant that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The Constructor would also build a landing pad where the small near-moon transport spacecraft we call Lunar Resupply Shuttles would arrive to collect fuel for delivery as newly launched spacecraft pass by the moon.  The United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, is planning a lunar fueling station for spacecraft, capable of supporting 1,000 people living in space within 30 years. Billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Robert Bigelow all have companies aiming to deliver people or goods to the moon.  Several teams competing for a share of Google’s US$30 million cash prize are planning to launch rovers to the moon. We and 27 other students from around the world recently participated in the 2017 Caltech Space Challenge, proposing designs of what a lunar launch and supply station for deep space missions might look like, and how it would work. Right now all space missions are based on, and launched from, Earth.  But Earth’s gravitational pull is strong.  To get into orbit, a rocket has to be traveling 11 kilometers a second – 25,000 miles per hour! Any rocket leaving Earth has to carry all the fuel it will ever use to get to its destination and, if needed, back again.  That fuel is heavy – and getting it moving at such high speeds takes a lot of energy. If we could refuel in orbit, that launch energy could lift more people or cargo or scientific equipment into orbit.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next What will the world be like in a BILLION years?

Those locations would be tricky to mine because they are colder and offer no sunlight to power roving vehicles.  However, we could install big mirrors on the craters’ rims to illuminate solar panels in the permanently shadowed regions. ELON MUSK'S MISSION TO THE MOON  SpaceX will launch the private mission on a journey to circumnavigate the moon and return to Earth.  Lift-off will be from Kennedy Space Center's historic Pad 39A near Cape Canaveral – the same launch pad used by the Apollo program for its lunar missions.  The mission will use one of SpaceX's Dragon capsules, which will be modified to allow communications in deep space.  The Dragon will be capable of operating autonomously throughout the whole flight, but the passengers will be trained in emergency procedures.  The mission would 'do a long loop around the moon' and would take about a week.  Musk says it will 'skim the surface of the moon, go quite a bit further out into deep space' and then return to Earth. The total flight would go about 300,000 to 400,000 miles into space. Rovers from Google’s Lunar X Prize competition and NASA’s Lunar Resource Prospector, set to launch in 2020, would also contribute to finding good locations to mine ice. Depending on where the best ice reserves are, we might need to build several small robotic moon bases.  Each one would mine ice, manufacture liquid propellant and transfer it to passing spacecraft.  Our team developed plans to accomplish those tasks with three different types of rovers.   The fuele depot (artist impression) would have large solar arrays powering an electrolysis module for melting the ice and then turning the water into fuel, and large fuel tanks to store what’s made Our plans also require a few small robotic shuttles to meet up with nearby deep-space mission vehicles in lunar orbit. One rover, which we call the Prospector, would explore the moon and find ice-bearing locations.  A second rover, the Constructor, would follow along behind, building a launch pad and packing down roadways to ease movements for the third rover type, the Miners, which actually collect the ice and deliver it to nearby storage tanks and an electrolysis processing plant that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. AMAZON'S MOON DELIVERY The boss of Amazon wants to be delivering packages to the moon in 2020. He has already reserved a parking spot near the Shackleton Crater on the south pole. It has constant sunlight and water nearby could be used as a source of hydrogen for rocket fuel. The rocket could carry 10,000 pounds of goods to help the first human settlements.   The Constructor would also build a landing pad where the small near-moon transport spacecraft we call Lunar Resupply Shuttles would arrive to collect fuel for delivery as newly launched spacecraft pass by the moon.  The shuttles would burn moon-made fuel and would have advanced guidance and navigation systems to travel between lunar bases and their target spacecraft. When enough fuel is being produced, and the shuttle delivery system is tested and reliable, our plan calls for building a gas station in space.  The shuttles would deliver ice directly to the orbiting fuel depot, where it would be processed into fuel and where rockets heading to Mars or elsewhere could dock to top up. The depot would have large solar arrays powering an electrolysis module for melting the ice and then turning the water into fuel, and large fuel tanks to store what’s made.  First, the spacecraft would launch from Earth into Low Earth Orbit with an empty propellant tank. Then, the spacecraft and its cargo could be towed from Low Earth Orbit to the depot at L1 using a solar electric propulsion tug (artist impression) NASA is already working on most of the technology needed for a depot like this, including docking and fuel transfer. We anticipate a working depot could be ready in the early 2030s, just in time for the first human missions to Mars. To be most useful and efficient, the depot should be located in a stable orbit relatively near both the Earth and the moon.  The Earth-moon Lagrangian Point 1 (L1) is a point in space about 85 percent of the way from Earth to the moon, where the force of Earth’s gravity would exactly equal the force of the moon’s gravity pulling in the other direction.  It’s the perfect pit stop for a spacecraft on its way to Mars or the outer planets. Our team also found a fuel-efficient way to get spacecraft from Earth orbit to the depot at L1, requiring even less launch fuel and freeing up more lift energy for cargo items.  First, the spacecraft would launch from Earth into Low Earth Orbit with an empty propellant tank.  YOU COULD BOOK A HOLIDAY ON THE MOON BY 2026   Within the next ten years, the word 'honeymoon' might start to live up to its name. Newly-wed couples could celebrate their love with a trip to our satellite, according to the founder of a a space exploration company called Moon Express.  The company wants to team up with Elon Musk's SpaceX to get humans there. Naveen Jain, the founder of Moon Express, has said his start-up is willing to work with Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, in a recent interview.  'It's very complimentary as a matter of fact…Elon will build the rocket and we do the rover. 'Essentially, he lays the cables and we do the last mile,' Mr Jain told CNBC in an interview in Helsinki, Finland. Moon  Express hopes to mine our satellite for materials like platinum-group metals, rare earth metals, helium-3 and moon rocks.  But it now seems the company also wants to be a part of getting humans to the moon.  Mr Jain said within the next ten years, the cost of going to the moon could become as cheap as $10,000 (£7,921). Then, the spacecraft and its cargo could be towed from Low Earth Orbit to the depot at L1 using a solar electric propulsion tug, a spacecraft largely propelled by solar-powered electric thrusters. This would let us triple the payload delivery to Mars.  At present, a human Mars mission is estimated to cost as much as US$100 billion, and will need hundreds of tons of cargo.  Delivering more cargo from Earth to Mars with fewer rocket launches would save billions of dollars and years of time. Building a gas station between Earth and the moon would also reduce costs for missions beyond Mars Building a gas station between Earth and the moon would also reduce costs for missions beyond Mars. NASA is looking for extraterrestrial life on the moons of Saturn and Jupiter. Future spacecraft could carry much more cargo if they could refuel in space – who knows what scientific discoveries sending large exploration vehicles to these moons could enable? By helping us escape both Earth’s gravity and dependence on its resources, a lunar gas station could be the first small step toward the giant leap into making humanity an interplanetary civilization.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 7 shares Most watched News videos Bizarre footage of tattooed King of Thailand wearing a CROP TOP The Day the Dinosaurs Died: BBC releases trailer for new dino show Video of what appears to be Jayson lying handcuffed on the ground Shocking moment a child on a scooter collides with a moving car Watch the trailer for Shut-Ins: Britain's Fattest Woman Theresa May praises NHS staff in wake of cyber attack Adorable moment baby waits for beat to drop so she can dance Police say they've commenced a garage search for Danielle Jones Video purports to show North Korea firing another ballistic missile Theresa May confronted on campaign trail by angry voter The moment a bully picks the wrong fight and gets body slammed Government urged to clarify if cyber attack was preventable Homeland Security adviser warns about 'WannaCry' cyber...

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Interview Interview: Electric airplane startup reveals ambitious plans for the future of air travel Andy Meek @tdnandy May 15th, 2017 at 3:56 PM Share Tweet The Kirkland, Wash.-based electric airplane startup that has been described as a kind of Tesla for the skies — and which came out of stealth in recent weeks — takes its name from “tzunuum,” the Mayan word for hummingbird. Zunum Aero looked to that for inspiration for its name, according to a spokesperson, because it wanted to connote speed, efficiency and sustainability. Those are the guiding principles behind the combine’s lofty ambition: to build a commercial-class hybrid electric aircraft — plus all the underlying systems — and have them in the air by the start of the next decade. Don't Miss: WannaCry: Everything you need to know about the global ransomware attack The plan is for that aircraft to be capable of flights of up to 1,000 miles as a first step towards electric air as a viable regional mass transit alternative to riding high-speed rail or simply driving across a highway. The company — which has raised an undisclosed amount of funding from Boeing and JetBlue Technology Ventures — wants to get its flight capability up to 700 miles at the start, in the early 2020s, then to more than 1,000 miles by 2030. For context, up to 700 miles would encompass a trip from San Francisco to Portland, Ore., or from Atlanta to Washington, D.C. A trip of 1,000 miles would be something like Seattle to Los Angeles or Boston to Jacksonville, Fla. “We aim to test our powertrain prototype within two to three years,” a company spokesperson told BGR. “Zunum’s mid-sized hybrid aircraft are designed to be a gateway to a golden era of regional travel, reversing the 70 year consolidation of air services in the U.S. and around the world. “We’re solving for a vast unaddressed market created by a transport gap, which extends from somewhere over a 100 miles to near a 1,000 miles, where today there’s no high-speed alternative. Highways are slow, and while the air system of airliners and hubs is tremendous for medium-to-long haul travel, its utility is limited on shorter trips.” The company’s leadership includes CEO Ashish Kumar, who’s worked for companies like Microsoft, Google, Dell and McKinsey. Chief engineer Matt Knapp has consulted across major aircraft OEMs, NASA and DARPA, and Zunum’s advanced drives leader Kiruba Haran leads a NASA-funded program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign to develop drives to power electric airliners. Before that, he worked at GE Research leading development of advanced machines for GE industrial businesses. Zunum’s game plan includes a reliance on steering traffic to regional airports. The company wants to route traffic of hubs to those regional airports, in addition to adding conveniences like walk-on, walk-off service that the company says is similar to boarding a bus or train. Its aircraft, powertrain and propulsion, a spokesperson adds, will also be designed for “unmatched economics on regional trips” that translate into 40 percent to 80 percent lower operating costs. “We’re developing the full stack required to power regional electric aircraft as a mass transit mode to large numbers of community and urban airports,” the spokesperson explained. “Zunum’s innovations range from regional electric air networks to rival highways and high-speed rail, to an innovative class of future-proof hybrid-to-electric aircraft and quiet range-optimized powertrain and propulsion technologies to power these. “Between the founders and the advisory board we have direct experience bringing a range of (small aircraft) to market, and with developing electrical systems for electrified flying vehicles with power levels comparable to Zunum’s planned early 2020s aircraft. Zunum has also has been working closely with Boeing HorizonX and JetBlue Technology Ventures for a year, both of whom understand the opportunities and risks of our ‘conservatively aggressive’ approach.” The travel solution the company envisions ultimately bringing to fruition would be something like this. You walk out of your house in San Jose at 7 a.m. for a 9:30 a.m. meeting in Pasadena. You drive to a nearby airfield, walk to the Zunum aircraft with your bags and board your flight. Only a handful of large hubs in the U.S. carry the lion’s share of air traffic, according to Zunum, which motivates countless travelers to drive long distances to catch flights or skip air travel altogether. Zunum says electric aircraft will increasingly step into the breach — all they need by way of support is little more than a GPS flightpath and a quick recharge or swap facility on the tarmac. What’s more, Zunum says its aircraft are hybrids that will only use fuel when they have to, and even less as battery technology gets better, making flying an eco-friendly endeavor.

Sung Wha Kang (RISD) Forty-five years have passed since humans last set foot on an extraterrestrial body. Now, the moon is back at the center of efforts not only to explore space, but to create a permanent, independent space-faring society. Planning expeditions to Earth’s nearest celestial neighbor is no longer just a NASA effort, though the U.S. space agency has plans for a moon-orbiting space station that would serve as a staging ground for Mars missions in the early 2030s. The United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, is planning a lunar fueling station for spacecraft, capable of supporting 1,000 people living in space within 30 years. Billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Robert Bigelow all have companies aiming to deliver people or goods to the moon. Several teams competing for a share of Google’s US$30 million cash prize are planning to launch rovers to the moon. We and 27 other students from around the world recently participated in the 2017 Caltech Space Challenge, proposing designs of what a lunar launch and supply station for deep space missions might look like, and how it would work. The raw materials for rocket fuel Right now all space missions are based on, and launched from, Earth. But Earth’s gravitational pull is strong. To get into orbit, a rocket has to be traveling 11 kilometers a second – 25,000 miles per hour! Any rocket leaving Earth has to carry all the fuel it will ever use to get to its destination and, if needed, back again. That fuel is heavy – and getting it moving at such high speeds takes a lot of energy. If we could refuel in orbit, that launch energy could lift more people or cargo or scientific equipment into orbit. Then the spacecraft could refuel in space, where Earth’s gravity is less powerful. The moon has one-sixth the gravity of Earth, which makes it an attractive alternative base. The moon also has ice, which we already know how to process into a hydrogen-oxygen propellant that we use in many modern rockets. Roving Luna NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite missions have already found substantial amounts of ice in permanently shadowed craters on the moon. Those locations would be tricky to mine because they are colder and offer no sunlight to power roving vehicles. However, we could install big mirrors on the craters’ rims to illuminate solar panels in the permanently shadowed regions. Mining operations on the moon, an artist’s rendering. Sung Wha Kang (RISD) Rovers from Google’s Lunar X Prize competition and NASA’s Lunar Resource Prospector, set to launch in 2020, would also contribute to finding good locations to mine ice. Imagining a moon base Depending on where the best ice reserves are, we might need to build several small robotic moon bases. Each one would mine ice, manufacture liquid propellant and transfer it to passing spacecraft. Our team developed plans to accomplish those tasks with three different types of rovers. Our plans also require a few small robotic shuttles to meet up with nearby deep-space mission vehicles in lunar orbit. An artist’s rendering of lunar rover concepts. Sung Wha Kang (RISD) One rover, which we call the Prospector, would explore the moon and find ice-bearing locations. A second rover, the Constructor, would follow along behind, building a launch pad and packing down roadways to ease movements for the third rover type, the Miners, which actually collect the ice and deliver it to nearby storage tanks and an electrolysis processing plant that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The Constructor would also build a landing pad where the small near-moon transport spacecraft we call Lunar Resupply Shuttles would arrive to collect fuel for delivery as newly launched spacecraft pass by the moon. The shuttles would burn moon-made fuel and would have advanced guidance and navigation systems to travel between lunar bases and their target spacecraft. A gas station in space When enough fuel is being produced, and the shuttle delivery system is tested and reliable, our plan calls for building a gas station in space. The shuttles would deliver ice directly to the orbiting fuel depot, where it would be processed into fuel and where rockets heading to Mars or elsewhere could dock to top up. An artist’s rendering of a fuel depot for refueling deep-space missions. Sung Wha Kang (RISD) The depot would have large solar arrays powering an electrolysis module for melting the ice and then turning the water into fuel, and large fuel tanks to store what’s made. NASA is already working on most of the technology needed for a depot like this, including docking and fuel transfer. We anticipate a working depot could be ready in the early 2030s, just in time for the first human missions to Mars. To be most useful and efficient, the depot should be located in a stable orbit relatively near both the Earth and the moon. The Earth-moon Lagrangian Point 1 (L1) is a point in space about 85 percent of the way from Earth to the moon, where the force of Earth’s gravity would exactly equal the force of the moon’s gravity pulling in the other direction. It’s the perfect pit stop for a spacecraft on its way to Mars or the outer planets. Leaving Earth Our team also found a fuel-efficient way to get spacecraft from Earth orbit to the depot at L1, requiring even less launch fuel and freeing up more lift energy for cargo items. First, the spacecraft would launch from Earth into Low Earth Orbit with an empty propellant tank. An artist’s rendering of a solar electric propulsion tug above an asteroid. NASA Then, the spacecraft and its cargo could be towed from Low Earth Orbit to the depot at L1 using a solar electric propulsion tug, a spacecraft largely propelled by solar-powered electric thrusters. This would let us triple the payload delivery to Mars. At present, a human Mars mission is estimated to cost as much as US$100 billion, and will need hundreds of tons of cargo. Delivering more cargo from Earth to Mars with fewer rocket launches would save billions of dollars and years of time. A base for space exploration Building a gas station between Earth and the moon would also reduce costs for missions beyond Mars. NASA is looking for extraterrestrial life on the moons of Saturn and Jupiter. Future spacecraft could carry much more cargo if they could refuel in space – who knows what scientific discoveries sending large exploration vehicles to these moons could enable? By helping us escape both Earth’s gravity and dependence on its resources, a lunar gas station could be the first small step toward the giant leap into making humanity an interplanetary civilization.

Weighing in at nearly 13,500 pounds (6,123.4 kgs) atop the rocket, the fourth Inmarsat-5 satellite will be the heaviest load lofted by a Falcon 9 yet, Floridatoday.com reported on Sunday. “Inmarsat-5 F4 (I-5 F4) will boost the power of our award-winning Global Xpress network, which has been delivering seamless, high-speed broadband connectivity across the world since December 2015,” the London-based mobile satellite services provider said in a statement. “Once in geostationary orbit, the satellite will provide additional capacity for Global Xpress users on land, at sea and in the air,” Inmarsat said. The satellite, built by Boeing, will be deployed approximately 32 minutes after launch when it will come under the command of the Boeing and Inmarsat satellite operations teams based at the Boeing facility in El Segundo, California. “From here I-5 F4 will be manoeuvred to its geostationary orbit, 35,786km above Earth, where it will deploy its solar arrays and reflectors and undergo intensive payload testing before beginning commercial service,” Inmarsat said.     Print       Email Published: 12 hours ago on May 16, 2017 By: IANS Last Modified: May 16, 2017 @ 12:10 am Filed Under: Science NEXT ARTICLE → NASA, ISRO team up to inspect ‘oldest civilisation’ site in Haryana ← PREVIOUS ARTICLE 3D printed bionic skin could allow robots ‘feel’ About the author IANS View all articles by IANS » LATEST NEWS Framework Agreement: Imkong says ‘trust deficit’ must be bridged Suspected NSCN (R) cadre killed Macron names Edouard Philippe as French PM Cracks appear in demand for Aboi district 17 prisoners shot dead in Papua New Guinea jail break: Reports Special session of 12th NLA on May 27 ‘If triple talaq struck down, then new divorce law will come’ CBI probe demanded into murder of Dimapur businessman in 1997 SEARCH Custom Search Sign up for our newsletter!

Share Tweet Cybersecurity Emerging Technology DOD believes blockchain can boost 3-D printing at the front By Troy K. Schneider May 15, 2017 The U.S. military has long seen the potential of additive manufacturing -- the industrial cousin of 3-D printing that can enable the services to produce mil-spec parts in the field.   And now the Department of Defense believes this disruptive technology can be paired with another -- blockchain -- to address intellectual property concerns.  At a May 12 event hosted by Washington Technology, John Bergin, the business technology officer in DOD's Office of the CIO, pointed to the Navy's aircraft carriers as a prime use case.  What happens, Bergin asked, when an F-18 on that carrier breaks a pin in its landing gear?  "They need a part, but they don’t have the part on the aircraft carrier," he said. "How do I use additive manufacturing to get there, while still respecting Boeing’s intellectual property rights for that pin? Blockchain -- the encrypted and distributed ledger system that makes the Bitcoin cryptocurrency possible -- could be the answer, he suggested.  If DOD's "ecosystem of parts management" can properly incorporate blockchain ledgers, Bergin said, the 3D printers on a carrier could securely log every pin that's produced at sea.  "You can print it, I can pay Boeing for it, and [the Navy] has planes that fly," he said.  "How do I support the warfighter abroad, respecting the intellectual property of the vendors, and do it as a team?  Blockchain is part of that story." Such a system would also streamline supply chains by allowing the Navy, in this example, to get only the pin it needs, rather than ordering a full landing gear assembly.  This would help both the military and its industry partners, he argued:  "Let’s stop buying the assembly, and let’s start making the parts where we need them.  It reduces your inventory that’s idle, and increases our operational capability at the front."   There are security and quality assurance challenges in addition to the intellectual property concerns, Bergin said, but he urged contractors work with DOD on those problems. "This is the opportunity we see for blockchain," he said.  "It’s not about cryptocurrency -- it’s about protecting your IP and enabling the warfighter.  We are very excited about this approach, and we think it’s part of the acquisition front we’re trying to get to."

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Tuesday May 16, 2017 News Regional Focus Larger / SmallerNight Mode Terror in the sky: Police raid home of Malaysian pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah FAIRFAX MEDIA 15 Mar 2014, 3:30 p.m. Investigations continue after revelation's missing plane's tracking device was disabled Terror in the sky: Police raid home of Malaysian pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit POLICE searched the luxury home of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah on Saturday after it was revealed the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 turned back from its scheduled flight path over the South China Sea and flew for more than seven hours with its communication tracking device disabled. The plane’s reversal of direction back across the Malay Peninsula was ‘‘consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane,", Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak told a news conference. "In view of this latest development the Malaysian authorities have refocused their investigation into the crew and passengers on board," he added. Minutes after the Malaysian leader spoke to the media about the latest findings regarding flight MH370, police raided the home of the aircraft's 53-year-old captain, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, for any evidence that he could have been involved in foul play. The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200ER vanished from radar screens a week ago with 239 crew and passengers aboard. According to Malaysia Airlines, Shah joined the airline in 1981 and was certified by Malaysia’s Department of Civil Aviation as a simulator test examiner. He had 18,365 flying hours. On Saturday, a police van with a large contingent of officers inside passed through a security gate at the entrance to the luxury compound where Shah, a father-of-three, lives with his wife Faisa. The family lives in a luxury gated community in Shah Alam, outside Kuala Lumpur. Malaysian media reports quoted colleagues describing Shah as a “superb pilot”, who also served as an examiner, authorised by the Malaysian Civil Aviation Department, to conduct simulator tests for pilots. Police spent two hours inside the home, and left carrying small bags, similar to shopping bags, CNN reported. Soon after, four plain-clothed police officers were reportedly seen at the home of the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27. Hamid, 27, who had 2,763 hours of flying, was last week the focus of media reports he invited two women into the cockpit on a flight from Thailand to Malaysia in 2011, where they posed for photos. According to new data, the Boeing 777 was still flying at 8.11am, seven hours after it disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Radar signals ­recorded by the Malaysian military appear to show the plane climbing to 45,000 feet, which is above the approved altitude, and making a sharp turn to the right not long after it disappeared from ­civilian radar, The New York Times reported. This information further adds to the increasing evidence pointing to a deliberate diversion by an experienced pilot. Mikael Robertsson, a founder of Flightradar24, a global aviation tracking service, toldThe New York Times the way the plane’s communications were shut down pointed to the involvement of someone with considerable aviation expertise and knowledge of the air route, possibly a crew member, willing or unwilling. The Boeing’s transponder was switched off just as the plane passed from Malaysian to Vietnamese air traffic control space, thus making it more likely that the plane’s absence from communications would not arouse attention, Mr. Robertsson told The Times from Sweden. He said pilots were supposed to always be "in contact with air traffic control in some country". “Instead of contacting the Vietnam air traffic control, the transponder signal was turned off, so I think the timing of turning off the signal just after you have left Malaysian air traffic control indicates someone did this on purpose, and he found the perfect moment when he wasn’t in control by Malaysia or Vietnam. He was, like, in no-man’s country.” Dozens of ships and planes are being redirected from the South China Sea to search for the plane thousands of kilometres away from where it vanished in the early hours of March 8. The countries where the plane could have reached are Laos, Thailand, China, Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan as well as the vast Indian Ocean and a body of water in Indonesia known as the Java Sea. The plane could have flown as far as the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, Mr Najib said. The announcement has raised a sliver of hope that those on board could still be alive if the plane landed at an unknown destination. Relatives had been told days ago to expect their loved ones had perished. The father of one passenger, who watched Najib's news conference at a Beijing hotel, told CNN he hoped the plane was hijacked because that gave him hope his son could be alive. "I hope they are alive no matter how small the chance is," he said. Authorities have been unable to confirm the location of the plane when it last made contact with satellites because of the type of data, the Prime Minister told a packed news briefing in Kuala Lumpur late on Saturday. But he did not explain how the plane’s communications could have been switched off and the plane turned around other than by someone with knowledge of flying one of the world’s most sophisticated planes. Mr Najib said despite media reports the plane was hijacked, ‘‘I wish to be very clear: we are still investigating all possibilities as to what caused MH370 to deviate from its original flight path.’’ Earlier in the day News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch tweeted one of the wilder theories about the plane: ‘‘World seems transfixed by 777 disappearance.  Maybe no crash but stolen, effectively hidden, perhaps in Northern Pakistan, like Bin Laden.’’ One of the corridors puts the plane on a passage towards Afghanistan. Mr Najib said that based on new satellite information ‘‘we can say with a high degree of certainty that the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System  was disabled just before the aircraft reached the east coast of peninsula Malaysia." ‘‘Shortly afterwards, near the border between Malaysian and Vietnam air traffic control, the aircraft’s transponder was switched off,’’ he said. Mr Najib said investigators were ‘‘making further calculations which will indicate how far the aircraft may have flown after the last point of contact.’’ But he said authorities in Malaysia and other countries had determined the plane’s last satellite communication was in one of two possible corridors taking in multiple countries. One is a corridor stretching from the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to northern Thailand. The other is a southern corridor stretching approximately from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean, off Australia’s coast. ‘‘The investigation team is working to further refine the information,’’ Mr Najib said. Authorities have called off the search in the South China Sea that involved 43 ships and 58 aircraft from 14 countries and are assessing new search areas. While the media focus has so far been on the so-called 27-year-old ‘‘party pilot’’ Fariq Abdul Hamid, who broke airline rules by inviting two women passengers into the cockpit of a plane in 2011, attention has now swung to the 53 year-old senior pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah. Television journalists in Kuala Lumpur reported that police had raided Mr Zaharie’s home as evidence emerged pointing to piracy or pilot suicide, but officials denied it, saying his background was under the same scrutiny as all the 239 people on board. Malaysia Airlines played down the significance of Mr Zaharie having a flight simulator built into his home using three large computer monitors and other accessories. Asked of its was unusual to have such equipment at home, Malaysia Airlines chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said: ‘‘Everyone is free to do his own hobby.’’ Born in northern Penang state, Mr Zaharie is passionate about aviation, posting Facebook pictures of himself posing with his remote-controlled aircraft, which included a lightweight twin-engine helicopter and an amphibious aircraft. He is a grandfather who played football with neighbourhood youngsters, is known as a good cook and has supported Malaysia’s opposition parties. He had more than 18,000 hours’ flying experience. Fariq Hamid, the son of a high ranking civil servant, was contemplating marriage after just graduating to the cockpit of a Boeing 777. As investigation of the psychological backgrounds and personal lives of those on board continues, none have so far become official suspects in what remains one of the most baffling mysteries in the history of modern aviation. Mr Najib said the new information was based on ‘‘raw satellite data that was obtained from the satellite data service provider. We can confirm that the aircraft shown in the primary radar data flight was MH370.’’ Forensic work was carried out by international aviation agencies and Malaysian authorities. ‘‘Clearly the search for MH370 has entered a new phase,’’ Mr Najib said, reading a prepared statement.

LEAD For CEOs, Why (and How) to Tweet Back at Trump Thanks to Trump, social media savvy is now a key part of the executive toolkit. Here's how to respond when your company is in the Twitter crosshairs. By Ryan Holmes Ryan Holmes is the founder and CEO of Hootsuite. He started the company in 2008 and has helped grow it into the world’s most widely used social relationship platform, with 10-million-plus users, including 800 of the Fortune 1000 companies. @invoker Founder and CEO, Hootsuite@invoker WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Since assuming the presidency, Donald Trump has, if anything, accelerated the pace of his social media assaults. High-profile swings at Nordstrom, Delta and other companies punctuate a relentless critique of media outlets like NBC, The New York Times and CNN and, of course, political opponents. The situation has grown so volatile that companies are now taking out insurance policies in case Trump tweets at them. My advice from the social media front lines for CEOs: save your money ... and learn how to Tweet right back. This counsel applies not just to rants from Donald Trump, of course. Social media savvy is a requisite part of the executive toolkit in 2017. In fact, I feel so strongly about this that I've written a new book to equip leaders with the survival skills needed to respond decisively and forcefully on social media. For leaders, the most effective response starts well before a crisis is on the horizon. If you're coming up with a social strategy at 2 a.m. after one of Trump's late-night rants, in other words, you're late to the party. Here's how to survive and fight back should you find your company in the Twitter crosshairs. Build your social leadership muscles first There's a reason athletes spend the off-season training. In the heat of competition, when the pressure is on, there's little time to deliberate--muscle memory takes over. The same applies to leaders using social media. If your first Tweet is in response to a social media crisis, you're setting yourself up for failure. The stakes are too high ... not to mention you'll have no social following to reach out to. By contrast, leaders who have already embraced social media as a pillar of their communication strategy can react swiftly and confidently. Take Tony Fernandes. The CEO of AirAsia Group has been active on Twitter since 2008, sharing daily updates about his life, his company and his employees. All these social skills were required following the tragic crash of an AirAsia plane. Rather than relying on press releases and spokespeople, Fernandes updated his millions of followers in real-time on recovery efforts, rallying staff, reassuring customers and safeguarding the company's reputation--a marked contrast to the buttoned-up (and highly criticized) approach used by rivals like Malaysia Airlines when faced with similar challenges. To all my staff stay strong.stay focused. Show the world why we have been world's best for 6 years running. Love you all.-- Tony Fernandes (@tonyfernandes) January 4, 2015 A personal attack calls for a personal response For leaders, it can be tempting to "let the company handle it" in the wake of a social media crisis. But a personal attack, the kind that Trump is so fond of, calls for a personal response. The gravitas, authority and humanity of a living, breathing leader carries far more weight than an anonymous Tweet from your customer service account. This kind of "social leadership" represents a marked departure from the classical school of corporate communications, which keeps leaders off-stage, except for highly scripted encounters. But to a Millennial generation steeped in immediacy and authenticity, taking a personal approach on social media speaks volumes. In response to Trump's immigration ban, for instance, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings fired back directly from his own Facebook account, calling the ban "so un-American it pains us all." This post was shared thousands of times and picked up by media outlets around the world: the kind of reaction a tepid update from a corporate account would be unlikely to prompt. Time is of the essence On social media, far more than other communications platforms, speed is everything. In the absence of a response, misinformation can spread at a viral rate, jumping to traditional media outlets where it becomes enshrined as truth. Leaders who intervene early and decisively, however, can shortcut this entire process. Indeed, it's the power of executives to slice through layers of bureaucracy and approvals and react nimbly that gives executive social media much of its power. Company leaders at Boeing, for example, responded on Twitter within a few hours of a threat by Trump to cancel an Air Force One order. They directly rebutted his claim of "out of control" costs, even adding in the hashtag #AirForceOne for good measure. Boeing stock prices fell briefly, before rising again immediately after the response. By building its social muscles and having a crisis plan in place, the company was able to stop a Twitter disaster before it even started. Compare this with the response of rival Lockheed Martin after Trump took to Twitter to lambaste the F-35 fighter jet program. Company leadership was silent on social media, as valuations plunged by up to 5 percent, or $4 billion. The CEO of Boeing says he welcomes Donald Trump's Twitter 'engagement' with US business https://t.co/VWZmkCaukL-- Financial Times (@FT) January 25, 2017 Executive social media is not a silo A CEO's social media account can be a powerful weapon. But it doesn't work in isolation. Surviving and thriving in the face of a Trump (or Trump-like) social media assault requires integrating executive social media into a larger strategy. A quick, agile response from the CEO can defuse even the thorniest of challenges. But the groundwork needs to be laid in advance. And the rest of the company has to rally around the effort. For public and private companies alike, customer impact, legal considerations and investor relations have to be weighed in the balance, not to mention faithfulness to your own corporate values. Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario, for instance, has leveraged her company's social clout to counter global warming skeptics in the Trump administration. Marcario's resistance to Trump on social media is no knee-jerk response. It's a reasoned approach, aligned with business and customer values and supported with the full weight of her company's communication team. As CEO, she's the tip of a razor-sharp spear, launched with authority and confidence. [#KeystoneXL Statement Thread] Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario's statement on the developments of the Keystone XL Pipeline. pic.twitter.com/XW2nc9WXwk-- Patagonia (@patagonia) March 24, 2017 These skills don't develop overnight, however, and they represent a new and largely uncharted piece of the executive toolkit. Not to mention, few leaders have the time to build and sustain a social presence all on their own. I faced these challenges firsthand and was surprised at the lack of resources out there. This is a main reason why I took the time to write The 4 Billion Dollar Tweet on social media leadership--why it's important and how to do it right. To be fair, no company can ever be fully prepared for a personal onslaught from the president. But CEOs who level up their social media skills now are future-proofing their business (and their own career) for ongoing digital transformations changing the workplace. If you can parley with the POTUS, after all, you're in a better position to connect with customers, employees, investors and the nearly 3 billion people around the world who turn to social media to communicate.

On the mission’s first launch attempt, the 23-story rocket rumbled southeast over the Atlantic Ocean at 7:21 p.m. ET with London-based Inmarsat’s fourth Inmarsat-5 satellite. Thirty-two minutes later, the rocket deployed the satellite that on the ground weighed nearly 13,500 pounds and stood taller than a red double-decker bus. “We’ve had good orbits, good separation, all you can ask for today,” SpaceX engineer John Insprucker said on the company’s launch webcast. The mission completed Inmarsat’s $1.6 billion, four-satellite Global Xpress constellation, designed to provide high-speed, global broadband service to mobile users from airplanes and ships to the U.S. military. SpaceX Falcon 9 launch with Inmarsat-5  (Photo: SpaceX) SpaceX did not try to land the rocket's first stage, reserving all its performance to deliver the heavy satellite on its way to an orbit more than 22,300 miles over the equator. The mission marked the “end of the beginning,” Pearce said, for Inmarsat’s new constellation, whose previous three satellites launched on Russian rockets from Kazakhstan. The satellite’s final location has not yet been determined. It is expected to move around, offering services from Europe to India.

The launch was the company’s first with SpaceX, whose lower-cost Falcon 9 rocket — advertised online for $62 million — have won back commercial satellite launches that had all but abandoned the United States until a few years ago. Although launches remain an expensive proposition, Pearce said it was “very welcome to have more competition and to drive down costs a bit.” And, he said, SpaceX is showing that it can handle adversity. The mission was SpaceX’s sixth of 2017, continuing its rebound from a Falcon 9 explosion last September during a launch pad test at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. That was the second failure by a Falcon 9 in just over a year, but SpaceX is back on pace to have its best year ever if it continues launching every two or three weeks as planned.

Launch from Kennedy Space Center is targeted for 7:21 p.m. Monday.  (Photo: Inmarsat) “You see how strong the corporate culture is,” said Pearce. “I think in their recent troubles with the recent launch failures, they’ve dealt with that very openly, constructively, calmly … and that’s very comforting.” The mission for Inmarsat, which has a 200-person office in Palm Bay, Fla., set sail two weeks after a Falcon 9 launched a U.S. intelligence mission from the same pad, a relatively rapid turnaround. SpaceX’s next launch is targeted for June 1 from KSC. A Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon cargo capsule will attempt to deliver supplies to the International Space Station. And later in June, if schedules hold, SpaceX hopes to launch a Bulgarian satellite with a Falcon booster landed and recovered from a mission earlier this year. That would be SpaceX’s second launch of what it calls a “flight proven” rocket, demonstrating reusability that CEO Elon Musk believes over time will dramatically lower launch costs and open the door to the settlement of Mars.

There will be a 49-minute launch window, according to SpaceX with the actual launch expected to take place on Monday night (May 15) at 7:21 p.m. EDT (2321 GMT) from the historic Pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center. London, UK-based Inmarsat's Inmarsat-5 F4 communications satellite weighs in at nearly 13,500 pounds and is the fourth in the series. The satellite was built by Boeing at a cost of around US$220 to US$250 million and will round-out the company's Global Xpress program. Static fire test of Falcon 9 completed on May 11. The launch of Inmarsat-5 Flight 4 from Pad 39A is scheduled for Monday, May 15. SpaceX The satellite will be the heaviest load yet for the Falcon 9 rocket, and it will need every bit of fuel to have the thrust needed to successfully launch the satellite into a Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO). Because of the fuel requirement, the Falcon 9 booster will not be recovered, says SpaceX in a statement. SpaceX CEO, Elon Musk explained the reasoning behind recovering the booster rockets in previous missions, pointing out that one of the company's goals is to make launches cheaper by reusing booster rockets. They have successfully recovered 10 booster rockets since December 2015. SpaceX's Falcon 9 is tuning out to be a real work-horse. SpaceX To give everyone an idea of the size of the behemoth satellite, think larger than a double-decker bus. The 230-foot long rocket will need all its fuel and 1.7 million pounds of liftoff thrust to get the Inmarsat-5 F4 up high enough to reach its orbit over 22,000 miles above the Earth.

Home Astronomy & Space Space Exploration May 15, 2017 Mining the moon for rocket fuel to get us to Mars May 15, 2017 by Gary Li, Danielle Delatte, Jerome Gilleron, Samuel Wald, And Therese Jones, The Conversation Between the Earth and the moon: An artist’s rendering of a refueling depot for deep-space exploration. Credit: Sung Wha Kang (RISD), CC BY-ND Forty-five years have passed since humans last set foot on an extraterrestrial body. Now, the moon is back at the center of efforts not only to explore space, but to create a permanent, independent space-faring society. Planning expeditions to Earth's nearest celestial neighbor is no longer just a NASA effort, though the U.S. space agency has plans for a moon-orbiting space station that would serve as a staging ground for Mars missions in the early 2030s. The United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, is planning a lunar fueling station for spacecraft, capable of supporting 1,000 people living in space within 30 years. Billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Robert Bigelow all have companies aiming to deliver people or goods to the moon. Several teams competing for a share of Google's US$30 million cash prize are planning to launch rovers to the moon. We and 27 other students from around the world recently participated in the 2017 Caltech Space Challenge, proposing designs of what a lunar launch and supply station for deep space missions might look like, and how it would work. The raw materials for rocket fuel Right now all space missions are based on, and launched from, Earth. But Earth's gravitational pull is strong. To get into orbit, a rocket has to be traveling 11 kilometers a second – 25,000 miles per hour! Any rocket leaving Earth has to carry all the fuel it will ever use to get to its destination and, if needed, back again. That fuel is heavy – and getting it moving at such high speeds takes a lot of energy. If we could refuel in orbit, that launch energy could lift more people or cargo or scientific equipment into orbit. Then the spacecraft could refuel in space, where Earth's gravity is less powerful. Mining operations on the moon, an artist’s rendering. Credit: Sung Wha Kang (RISD), CC BY-ND The moon has one-sixth the gravity of Earth, which makes it an attractive alternative base. The moon also has ice, which we already know how to process into a hydrogen-oxygen propellant that we use in many modern rockets. Roving Luna NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite missions have already found substantial amounts of ice in permanently shadowed craters on the moon. Those locations would be tricky to mine because they are colder and offer no sunlight to power roving vehicles. However, we could install big mirrors on the craters' rims to illuminate solar panels in the permanently shadowed regions. Rovers from Google's Lunar X Prize competition and NASA's Lunar Resource Prospector, set to launch in 2020, would also contribute to finding good locations to mine ice. Imagining a moon base Depending on where the best ice reserves are, we might need to build several small robotic moon bases. Each one would mine ice, manufacture liquid propellant and transfer it to passing spacecraft. Our team developed plans to accomplish those tasks with three different types of rovers. Our plans also require a few small robotic shuttles to meet up with nearby deep-space mission vehicles in lunar orbit. An artist’s rendering of lunar rover concepts. Credit: Sung Wha Kang (RISD), CC BY-ND One rover, which we call the Prospector, would explore the moon and find ice-bearing locations. A second rover, the Constructor, would follow along behind, building a launch pad and packing down roadways to ease movements for the third rover type, the Miners, which actually collect the ice and deliver it to nearby storage tanks and an electrolysis processing plant that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The Constructor would also build a landing pad where the small near-moon transport spacecraft we call Lunar Resupply Shuttles would arrive to collect fuel for delivery as newly launched spacecraft pass by the moon. The shuttles would burn moon-made fuel and would have advanced guidance and navigation systems to travel between lunar bases and their target spacecraft. A gas station in space When enough fuel is being produced, and the shuttle delivery system is tested and reliable, our plan calls for building a gas station in space. The shuttles would deliver ice directly to the orbiting fuel depot, where it would be processed into fuel and where rockets heading to Mars or elsewhere could dock to top up. The depot would have large solar arrays powering an electrolysis module for melting the ice and then turning the water into fuel, and large fuel tanks to store what's made. NASA is already working on most of the technology needed for a depot like this, including docking and fuel transfer. We anticipate a working depot could be ready in the early 2030s, just in time for the first human missions to Mars. To be most useful and efficient, the depot should be located in a stable orbit relatively near both the Earth and the moon. The Earth-moon Lagrangian Point 1 (L1) is a point in space about 85 percent of the way from Earth to the moon, where the force of Earth's gravity would exactly equal the force of the moon's gravity pulling in the other direction. It's the perfect pit stop for a spacecraft on its way to Mars or the outer planets. An artist’s rendering of a fuel depot for refueling deep-space missions. Credit: Sung Wha Kang (RISD), CC BY-ND Leaving Earth Our team also found a fuel-efficient way to get spacecraft from Earth orbit to the depot at L1, requiring even less launch fuel and freeing up more lift energy for cargo items. First, the spacecraft would launch from Earth into Low Earth Orbit with an empty propellant tank. Then, the spacecraft and its cargo could be towed from Low Earth Orbit to the depot at L1 using a solar electric propulsion tug, a spacecraft largely propelled by solar-powered electric thrusters. This would let us triple the payload delivery to Mars. At present, a human Mars mission is estimated to cost as much as US$100 billion, and will need hundreds of tons of cargo. Delivering more cargo from Earth to Mars with fewer rocket launches would save billions of dollars and years of time. A base for space exploration Building a gas station between Earth and the moon would also reduce costs for missions beyond Mars. NASA is looking for extraterrestrial life on the moons of Saturn and Jupiter. Future spacecraft could carry much more cargo if they could refuel in space – who knows what scientific discoveries sending large exploration vehicles to these moons could enable? By helping us escape both Earth's gravity and dependence on its resources, a lunar gas station could be the first small step toward the giant leap into making humanity an interplanetary civilization.

It's a concept still has so many unknowns that it might as well be called science fiction. That's what a whole lot of this Moon and Mars talk is. We don't know enough about the Moon to know if producing fuel is even feasible, let alone necessary. The whole gimmick of sending people to Mars defies rational thought because of it being so pointless and a huge waste of resources. Yet people are acting like it has to happen. You can find science fiction stories and Popular Science articles from back in the nineteen-fifties about building Moon bases before the year 2000 that could be republished with new drawings and still seem just as plausible. Any technology that might work on the Moon or Mars needs to be proven on the Earth first. Fix the problems on the Earth first and then use the knowledge to colonize the moon if we must. antialias_physorg 4 / 5 (4) 16 hours ago Not really thrilled at making rocket fuel out of water on the moon. That seems like one of those things that will turn out to be a major waste of extremely precious resources in case we do want to go for a moon habitat in some form in the future. If we want to get fuel into orbit to a 'gas station' manufacture it here and use a railgun. poolerl72 1 / 5 (5) 15 hours ago I cant even believe that this is being considered. Are we really such morons as to not understand that you don't want to change the gravitational mass of the object that allows life to happen on this planet? You don't mine the Moon for fuel. It is imperative that anyone who reads this understands: We can NOT change the gravitational mass of the Moon in ANY WAY. If this is done, it will be one of the biggest scientific blunders of all time, and possibly with globally catastrophic results. We have totally messed up the Earth, so lets roll up our sleeves, and start messing with the Moon. Brilliant. How can smart people be so stupid? TR3 1 / 5 (2) 14 hours ago After the Mars Rover landed many years ago I saw a presentation by one of the engineers that worked on the project. The question "Will man ever set foot on Mars was asked" His reply was NO. Mars and Earth are in opposite orbits - clockwise and counterclockwise. The rocket that carried Rover was launched to take advantage of the two planets travelling towards each other. This provided the shortest travel time from Earth - about two years. After that date, the planets are again moving away from each other. If a team reached Mars after a two year flight, and stayed two weeks, they would then need another two plus years of oxygen, food and fuel. flat_earth 1 / 5 (5) 14 hours ago Outer space vacuum spinning planets gravity orbiting solar systems do not exist. The sun moon and stars are electro magnetic lights that circle above flat motionless earth. The fake space programs are a big financial scam. Don't be fooled by CGI animation photoshop and jibber jabber mumbo jumbo jive talk. ShotmanMaslo 5 / 5 (3) 13 hours ago poolerl72 - Moon has so much mass that any mining is utterly irrelevant and wont affect its orbit at all. I suggest you stop calling people stupid when your mental faculties are insufficient to even realize this basic fact. As for the article, propellant depots and making fuel (or at least oxidizer) in situ is crucial for any sustainable colony. However I agree with snerdguy that this is a technology that should be mastered on Earth first. This is something NASA should do, pushing technological boundaries instead of wasting billions on SLS.. twill 4.5 / 5 (2) 13 hours ago There are other potential fuels beyond ice that are also being explored, e.g. He3. Poolerl72, believing that we could possibly alter the mass of the moon appreciably enough to change its orbit sufficiently to have a measureable effect on earth is ridiculous. Generally speaking, ignorance breeds alarmist's views such as these and only serves to feed baseless conspiracy theories. TR3, more ignorance being spouted off. Fuel use is not constant for the approx. 150-300 earth day one-way flight. Fuel is typically used only for launch, land and small corrections in between. Also, O2 for the trip is typically reclaimed as well as possible, but the Sabatier reaction (or other potentials being explored) may be a viable option too if fuel cells continue to be used. Water, radiation and the challenges of deceleration and landing are bigger obstacles to a Mars trip. andric0n 5 / 5 (2) 13 hours ago snerdguy - "Fix the problems on the Earth first and then use the knowledge to colonize the moon if we must." Why are the two items diametrically opposed? We can't possibly fix problems here while exploring the solar system? Is NASA destined to fix earth-bound problems? poolerl72 - "Are we really such morons as to not understand that you don't want to change the gravitational mass of the object that allows life to happen on this planet?" The gravitational mass of our Moon isn't a constant anyway, did you think it was? Look up "accretion". TR3 - "Mars and Earth are in opposite orbits - clockwise and counterclockwise." Yes - orbital mechanics is a thing that exists, surprised? Of all the things we don't know about our solar system, this one is pretty much under control. andric0n 5 / 5 (2) 13 hours ago Outer space vacuum spinning planets gravity orbiting solar systems do not exist. The sun moon and stars are electro magnetic lights that circle above flat motionless earth. The fake space programs are a big financial scam. Don't be fooled by CGI animation photoshop and jibber jabber mumbo jumbo jive talk. Shh, go back to youtube and infowars. stevehn 5 / 5 (1) 12 hours ago So it is not a good idea to save water for consumption and use nuclear power for propulsion? newpapyrus not rated yet 12 hours ago It's more efficient to simply derive your propellant producing depot from existing cryotank technology. The SLS EUS, for instance, could store up to 125 tonnes of LOX/LH2 propellant and could be deployed to EML1 with a single SLS launch. Retaining its RL-10 engines would also allow the depot to be redeployed to Mars orbit. So no xenon fueled transfer vehicles would be required. The solar array should be configured so that it can also act as a— sunshield— for the cryotanks, minimizing the energy required to reliquefy ullage gases. Water would also be necessary for a crewed interplanetary vehicle to provide air (oxygen), water for drinking and food preparation, and, of course, water for shielding against heavy nuclei and major solar events. Less propellant would be required for an interplanetary mission if the water shielding could be dumped just before the final trajectory burns to enter orbit, replenishing it at another water depot already in Mars orbit. Marcel carbon_unit 5 / 5 (2) 12 hours ago TR3 - All planets (and Pluto too!) and the vast bulk of other objects orbit the Sun in the same direction. As antialias_physorg notes, maybe it doesn't make sense to squander the Moon's ices on rocket fuel. Maybe the ices should be saved for use on the Moon or launches from there? Lunar railguns would probably work great for getting cargo (and even fuel) off of the Moon without "wasting" fuel. An alternative would be to very, very carefully nudge an icy asteroid or comet fragment into the desired orbit and mine it for fuel, water and metals. This feels like the best long term solution. Zzzzzzzz 5 / 5 (2) 12 hours ago Outer space vacuum spinning planets gravity orbiting solar systems do not exist. The sun moon and stars are electro magnetic lights that circle above flat motionless earth. The fake space programs are a big financial scam. Don't be fooled by CGI animation photoshop and jibber jabber mumbo jumbo jive talk. Quite possibly a record - earned my ignore list with the fewest words yet. poolerl72 1 / 5 (2) 11 hours ago I apologize for calling people morons. It just escapes me how we can think taking material away from an orbiting body which causes the tides can seem like no big deal to scientific minded people. The Moon is already receding from us at the rate of about 2 inches a year. Not a big deal at the moment, but this wont remain constant. As it slips out of Earth's gravitational grasp, that trend will rise until it is completely free of us. Yes, this will take a long time. However, if we are removing material from the moon, we change its mass. It's a bad idea. We could influence the rate of departure, OR cause the Earth to pull on the Moon harder, and bring it on an unintended collision with us. Yes, mass changes and I know what accretion is. At least I do now. I looked it up. It does not excuse the intentional disruption of a celestial body for the sake of fuel. Im sorry but this idea is kind of ridiculous. mcrn not rated yet 5 hours ago The primary consumers of a propellant depot at EML-1 would be SpaceX and Blue Origin. By the time an EML- Depot was online, those two rocket companies will only use methane engines. I applaud the effort, but unless you demonstrate a cheap way to make methane from Lunar resources, all is for naught. Lock-Mart/Boeing/ULA will NEVER build a depot without 100% funding from US Government, and that will not happen. Blue Origin has stated is main purpose is to develop off-world, space infrastructure. They will need a lot of Methane, and so will SpaceX plans for Mars colonization. Lex Talonis not rated yet 1 hour ago Why don't they ask Jesus the Jewish Zombie in Low Earth Orbit, to put a magic invisible extension on his orbiting magical invisible space palace, and call it Moon Base Magestica? Anything you ask in his name, it shall be given.

Nine financial institutions from Norway, Denmark, Ireland, Britain, China and Japan are ready to fund the purchases, Fakhrieh Kashan said, declining to mention the names of the interested financers, according to Press TV. He added that a tender had been put out earlier to choose the financer for the purchases, adding that tender documents would be sent out to potential bidders within a month. Back in December, the chairman of Iran Air said the flag carrier had finalized an initial deal with Boeing to purchase 80 passenger planes. He added that the first deliveries are expected in 2018. The agreement envisaged the purchase of 50 twinjet narrow-body Boeing 737 planes and 30 long-range wide-body Boeing 777 aircraft at a total cost of $16.6 billion. During a January 2016 visit to Paris by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Tehran also signed a major contract with Airbus worth about $27 billion to buy 118 planes.

Credit: SpaceX CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will launch a hefty communications satellite into orbit tonight (May 15) for London-based Inmarsat, a new customer for Elon Musk's launch company. Liftoff of the Boeing-built Inmarsat-5 F4 satellite is scheduled for 7:21 p.m. EDT (2321 GMT) from Pad 39A at NASA Kennedy Space Center in Florida. You can watch the launch live here, courtesy of SpaceX's YouTube webcast, beginning at about 7:06 p.m. EDT (2306 GMT). Getting the satellite, which weighs about 13,500 lbs. (6,100 kg), into its intended orbit will not leave the Falcon 9 first-stage with enough fuel to attempt a landing, either on a drone barge or on the ground, SpaceX representatives said. Inmarsat-5 F4 initially was slated to launch aboard SpaceX's larger Falcon Heavy booster, which will use three Falcon 9 first-stages as a core vehicle. The Falcon Heavy is now expected to debut before the end of the year, SpaceX representatives said. The Inmarsat-5 F4 satellite is seen during launch preparations. The satellite is the first to be launched by SpaceX for Inmarsat. Credit: Inmarsat For tonight's launch, the Falcon 9 is expected to deliver Inmarsat-5 F4 into an initial parking orbit from where it can maneuver into an operational perch 22,236 miles (35,785 km) above Earth. The satellite is the fourth and final member of Inmarsat’s $1.6 billion Global Xpress constellation, which provides broadband communications for ships, airplanes and ground stations worldwide. The first three Global Xpress satellites, which launched in December 2013, February 2015 and August 2015 respectively, all flew aboard Russian Proton rockets from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Inmarsat-5 F4, which is Inmarsat's first launch with SpaceX, had been slated to fly last year, but was delayed by the loss of a Falcon 9 rocket and Spacecom’s AMOS-6 communications satellite during a prelaunch engine test on Sept. 1. The accident heavily damaged SpaceX's primary launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, just south of NASA's spaceport. Delays after the accident cost SpaceX a second launch with Inmarsat. In December, Inmarsat switched launch of a satellite for the European Aviation Network and Greece's Hellas-Sat onto an Arianespace Ariane 5 booster that is slated to fly in late June. "Following the delay in SpaceX's launch schedule, Inmarsat and Hellas-Sat took the decision to move the condosat to an Arianespace launch," Inmarsat representatives said in a Dec. 8 press release. SpaceX's original agreement with Inmarsat, announced in July 2014, also included terms for a possible third mission. Inmarsat in December hired Airbus Defence and Space to build the first two mobile communications satellites for Inmarsat’s sixth-generation fleet. Tonight's launch will be the sixth of more than 20 missions planned by SpaceX this year and the 34th flight since the Falcon 9 rocket debuted in June 2010. Follow Irene Klotz on Twitter.

Why the world should be wary of Elon Musk's space race Solar storms trigger sparks, melt soil on Moon: NASA After allocating $20 bn for Nasa, Trump plans to send humans to Mars Forty-five years have passed since humans last set foot on an extraterrestrial body. Now, the moon is back at the center of efforts not only to explore space, but to create a permanent, independent space-faring society. Planning expeditions to Earth’s nearest celestial neighbor is no longer just a NASA effort, though the U.S. space agency has plans for a moon-orbiting space station that would serve as a staging ground for Mars missions in the early 2030s. The United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, is planning a lunar fueling station for spacecraft, capable of supporting 1,000 people living in space within 30 years. Billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Robert Bigelow all have companies aiming to deliver people or goods to the moon. Several teams competing for a share of Google’s US$30 million cash prize are planning to launch rovers to the moon. We and 27 other students from around the world recently participated in the 2017 Caltech Space Challenge, proposing designs of what a lunar launch and supply station for deep space missions might look like, and how it would work. The raw materials for rocket fuel Right now all space missions are based on, and launched from, Earth. But Earth’s gravitational pull is strong. To get into orbit, a rocket has to be traveling 11 kilometers a second – 25,000 miles per hour! Any rocket leaving Earth has to carry all the fuel it will ever use to get to its destination and, if needed, back again. That fuel is heavy – and getting it moving at such high speeds takes a lot of energy. If we could refuel in orbit, that launch energy could lift more people or cargo or scientific equipment into orbit. Then the spacecraft could refuel in space, where Earth’s gravity is less powerful. The moon has one-sixth the gravity of Earth, which makes it an attractive alternative base. The moon also has ice, which we already know how to process into a hydrogen-oxygen propellant that we use in many modern rockets. Roving Luna NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite missions have already found substantial amounts of ice in permanently shadowed craters on the moon. Those locations would be tricky to mine because they are colder and offer no sunlight to power roving vehicles. However, we could install big mirrors on the craters’ rims to illuminate solar panels in the permanently shadowed regions. Mining operations on the moon, an artist’s rendering. Sung Wha Kang (RISD), CC BY-ND Rovers from Google’s Lunar X Prize competition and NASA’s Lunar Resource Prospector, set to launch in 2020, would also contribute to finding good locations to mine ice. Imagining a moon base Depending on where the best ice reserves are, we might need to build several small robotic moon bases. Each one would mine ice, manufacture liquid propellant and transfer it to passing spacecraft. Our team developed plans to accomplish those tasks with three different types of rovers. Our plans also require a few small robotic shuttles to meet up with nearby deep-space mission vehicles in lunar orbit. An artist’s rendering of lunar rover concepts. Sung Wha Kang (RISD), CC BY-ND One rover, which we call the Prospector, would explore the moon and find ice-bearing locations. A second rover, the Constructor, would follow along behind, building a launch pad and packing down roadways to ease movements for the third rover type, the Miners, which actually collect the ice and deliver it to nearby storage tanks and an electrolysis processing plant that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The Constructor would also build a landing pad where the small near-moon transport spacecraft we call Lunar Resupply Shuttles would arrive to collect fuel for delivery as newly launched spacecraft pass by the moon. The shuttles would burn moon-made fuel and would have advanced guidance and navigation systems to travel between lunar bases and their target spacecraft. A gas station in space An artist’s rendering of a fuel depot for refueling deep-space missions. Sung Wha Kang (RISD), CC BY-ND When enough fuel is being produced, and the shuttle delivery system is tested and reliable, our plan calls for building a gas station in space. The shuttles would deliver ice directly to the orbiting fuel depot, where it would be processed into fuel and where rockets heading to Mars or elsewhere could dock to top up. The depot would have large solar arrays powering an electrolysis module for melting the ice and then turning the water into fuel, and large fuel tanks to store what’s made. NASA is already working on most of the technology needed for a depot like this, including docking and fuel transfer. We anticipate a working depot could be ready in the early 2030s, just in time for the first human missions to Mars. To be most useful and efficient, the depot should be located in a stable orbit relatively near both the Earth and the moon. The Earth-moon Lagrangian Point 1 (L1) is a point in space about 85 percent of the way from Earth to the moon, where the force of Earth’s gravity would exactly equal the force of the moon’s gravity pulling in the other direction. It’s the perfect pit stop for a spacecraft on its way to Mars or the outer planets. Leaving Earth Our team also found a fuel-efficient way to get spacecraft from Earth orbit to the depot at L1, requiring even less launch fuel and freeing up more lift energy for cargo items. First, the spacecraft would launch from Earth into Low Earth Orbit with an empty propellant tank. An artist’s rendering of a solar electric propulsion tug above an asteroid. NASA Then, the spacecraft and its cargo could be towed from Low Earth Orbit to the depot at L1 using a solar electric propulsion tug, a spacecraft largely propelled by solar-powered electric thrusters. This would let us triple the payload delivery to Mars. At present, a human Mars mission is estimated to cost as much as US$100 billion, and will need hundreds of tons of cargo. Delivering more cargo from Earth to Mars with fewer rocket launches would save billions of dollars and years of time. A base for space exploration Building a gas station between Earth and the moon would also reduce costs for missions beyond Mars. NASA is looking for extraterrestrial life on the moons of Saturn and Jupiter. Future spacecraft could carry much more cargo if they could refuel in space – who knows what scientific discoveries sending large exploration vehicles to these moons could enable? By helping us escape both Earth’s gravity and dependence on its resources, a lunar gas station could be the first small step toward the giant leap into making humanity an interplanetary civilization.   Gary Li, Ph.D. Candidate in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles; Danielle DeLatte, Ph.D. Student in Aeronautics & Astronautics, University of Tokyo; Jerome Gilleron, Ph.D. Candidate in Aerospace Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology; Samuel Wald, Ph.D. Student in Aeronautics and Astronautics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Therese Jones, Ph.D. Candidate in Public Policy, Pardee RAND Graduate School This article was originally published on The Conversation.

Moon to be at the centre of efforts to create a permanent, independent space-faring society. Forty-five years have passed since humans last set foot on an extraterrestrial body. Now, the moon is back at the center of efforts not only to explore space, but to create a permanent, independent space-faring society. Planning expeditions to Earth’s nearest celestial neighbor is no longer just a NASA effort, though the U.S. space agency has plans for a moon-orbiting space station that would serve as a staging ground for Mars missions in the early 2030s. The United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, is planning a lunar fueling station for spacecraft, capable of supporting 1,000 people living in space within 30 years. Billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Robert Bigelow all have companies aiming to deliver people or goods to the moon. Several teams competing for a share of Google’s US$30 million cash prize are planning to launch rovers to the moon. We and 27 other students from around the world recently participated in the 2017 Caltech Space Challenge, proposing designs of what a lunar launch and supply station for deep space missions might look like, and how it would work. The raw materials for rocket fuel Right now all space missions are based on, and launched from, Earth. But Earth’s gravitational pull is strong. To get into orbit, a rocket has to be traveling 11 kilometers a second – 25,000 miles per hour! Any rocket leaving Earth has to carry all the fuel it will ever use to get to its destination and, if needed, back again. That fuel is heavy – and getting it moving at such high speeds takes a lot of energy. If we could refuel in orbit, that launch energy could lift more people or cargo or scientific equipment into orbit. Then the spacecraft could refuel in space, where Earth’s gravity is less powerful. The moon has one-sixth the gravity of Earth, which makes it an attractive alternative base. The moon also has ice, which we already know how to process into a hydrogen-oxygen propellant that we use in many modern rockets. Roving Luna NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite missions have already found substantial amounts of ice in permanently shadowed craters on the moon. Those locations would be tricky to mine because they are colder and offer no sunlight to power roving vehicles. However, we could install big mirrors on the craters’ rims to illuminate solar panels in the permanently shadowed regions. Mining operations on the moon, an artist’s rendering. Sung Wha Kang (RISD), CC BY-ND Rovers from Google’s Lunar X Prize competition and NASA’s Lunar Resource Prospector, set to launch in 2020, would also contribute to finding good locations to mine ice. Imagining a moon base Depending on where the best ice reserves are, we might need to build several small robotic moon bases. Each one would mine ice, manufacture liquid propellant and transfer it to passing spacecraft. Our team developed plans to accomplish those tasks with three different types of rovers. Our plans also require a few small robotic shuttles to meet up with nearby deep-space mission vehicles in lunar orbit. An artist’s rendering of lunar rover concepts.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman In-Flight Entertainment & Connectivity (IFEC) Market to worth over USD 8.5 billion by 2024 : Global Market Insights Inc. In-Flight Entertainment & Connectivity (IFEC) Market size was valued at over USD 3 billion in 2015 and is expected to reach USD 8.5 billion by 2024, growing at 13.3% CAGR from 2016 to 2024. Need for increasing passenger travel time experience, development of innovative wireless solutions on BYOD (bring your own device) and growing availability of HD contents are anticipated to drive industry demand. The technology includes moving map systems, audio and video entertainment, personal televisions and in-flight movies. Furthermore, audio and video entertainment provides passengers with a wide range of movies, videos and music libraries. Connectivity services include satellite and internal telephony, data communication and Wi-Fi. Request for an in-depth table of contents for this report @ www.gminsights.com/request-toc/upcoming/691 Increasing demand for comfort accompanied by commercial aviation & fleet expansion are expected to fuel in-flight entertainment and connectivity market growth through 2024. Launch of high throughput satellite (HTS) has enabled added connectivity through Ka band for geo-positioning services, media content and several other applications. The rising prominence of digital advertising as well as free Wi-Fi services is predicted to propel in-flight entertainment and connectivity market size in the coming years. For instance, in 2015, Global Eagle Entertainment (GEE) tied up with Fiji Airways for introducing advertising sales and sponsorship spots. In July 2016, Finnair announced to install Wi-Fi for the A330 fleet and selected airbus aircrafts serving long & short-haul routes. The installation of Wi-Fi on its long haul routes is expected to complete by May 2017. Transavia and Qantas airlines are providing Samsung VR to passengers featuring movies, virtual tour of cockpit or virtual flight tracker. Huge investments associated with the technology, stringent regulatory framework by Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), and high installation costs may hamper growth. Demand for advance digital content along with high maintenance associated with installations may pose a challenge to the in-flight entertainment and connectivity market size. In October 2013, FAA allowed the use of PEDs (portable electronic devices) inside flight by following regulatory norms assigned by FCC (Federal Communications Commission). These efforts are expected to strengthen IFEC market growth over the forecast period. In-flight entertainment and connectivity market share can be segmented by product into hardware, connectivity and content. Hardware can be further segregated into portable and non-portable devices. On the basis of content, it can be categorized into movies, TV shows, music, radio and games. Hardware suppliers have been shifting focus towards content service delivery, thereby positioning themselves as system integrators. For instance, hardware vendors such as Panasonic Avionics Corporation have formed a strategic alliance to add international content as a part of their hardware in-flight entertainment and connectivity system package. They have obtained contracts from live television service suppliers to fulfill this purpose. In September 2011, Panasonic unveiled eXW wireless streaming media solution catering to consumer’s preferred demands.

Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin says BE-4 rocket test goes awry, but tests will resume soon Trending: 20 years after Amazon IPO, here’s what a $1,000 investment would be worth today Space & Science Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin says BE-4 rocket test goes awry, but tests will resume soon by Alan Boyle on May 14, 2017 at 6:12 pmMay 15, 2017 at 7:22 am Comments  1 Share  66 Tweet Share  29 Reddit Email GeekWire Cloud Tech Summit tix here! In a photo from March 2017, the BE-4 rocket engine’s powerpack is installed on a stand at Blue Origin’s West Texas proving ground for start transient testing. (Blue Origin Photo) In a rare update, the Blue Origin space venture founded by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos reported that it lost a set of powerpack test hardware for its BE-4 rocket engine over the weekend, but added that such a setback is “not unusual” during development. “That’s why we always set up our development programs to be hardware-rich,” the company tweeted today. “Back into testing soon.” Blue Origin is headquartered in Kent, Wash., but the BE-4 is being tested at its facility in West Texas, on ranchland owned by Bezos. The powerpack is the heart of a rocket engine, pumping fuel and oxidizer to the engine’s combustion chamber. The current round of engine testing is key to the company’s fortunes: Blue Origin is planning to use the BE-4, which is powered by liquefied natural gas, on its own New Glenn orbital-class rocket. Blue Origin already has started lining up satellite customers for the New Glenn. In addition, Boeing is said to be considering a modified version of the BE-4 for its proposed XS-1 military space plane. Most crucially, the BE-4 is the “Plan A” propulsion system for United Launch Alliance’s next-generation Vulcan launch vehicle, which is meant to take the place of ULA’s workhorse Atlas 5 rocket. “Plan B” is Aerojet Rocketdyne’s AR1 engine, which is currently behind the BE-4 in development but completed a critical design review last week. Aerojet says the AR1 will become available in 2019. ULA has said the outcome of Blue Origin’s full-scale BE-4 engine tests will determine whether it goes with Plan A or Plan B, with billions of dollars at stake for the companies concerned. The BE-4 and Aerojet’s kerosene-fueled AR1 are both designed to provide more than 500,000 pounds of thrust, but Blue Origin’s approach is considered riskier because it requires creating a new type of engine. Blue Origin’s advantage is that it’s been working on the technology for several years already, funded primarily by Bezos (with some investment from ULA). Bezos sent out tweets showing off the first fully assembled BE-4 engine in March, and said two more engines were “following close behind.”. Correction for 10 p.m. PT May 14: Aerojet’s engine is the AR1, not the AR-4 (as previously reported).

Now, the moon is back at the center of efforts not only to explore space, but to create a permanent, independent space-faring society. Planning expeditions to Earth’s nearest celestial neighbor is no longer just a NASA effort, though the U.S. space agency has plans for a moon-orbiting space station that would serve as a staging ground for Mars missions in the early 2030s. The United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, is planning a lunar fueling station for spacecraft, capable of supporting 1,000 people living in space within 30 years. Billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Robert Bigelow all have companies aiming to deliver people or goods to the moon. Several teams competing for a share of Google’s US$30 million cash prize are planning to launch rovers to the moon. Latest news videos We and 27 other students from around the world recently participated in the 2017 Caltech Space Challenge, proposing designs of what a lunar launch and supply station for deep space missions might look like, and how it would work. Right now all space missions are based on, and launched from, Earth. But Earth’s gravitational pull is strong. To get into orbit, a rocket has to be traveling 11 kilometers a second – 25,000 miles per hour! Any rocket leaving Earth has to carry all the fuel it will ever use to get to its destination and, if needed, back again. That fuel is heavy – and getting it moving at such high speeds takes a lot of energy. If we could refuel in orbit, that launch energy could lift more people or cargo or scientific equipment into orbit. Then the spacecraft could refuel in space, where Earth’s gravity is less powerful. The moon has one-sixth the gravity of Earth, which makes it an attractive alternative base. The moon also has ice, which we already know how to process into a hydrogen-oxygen propellant that we use in many modern rockets. NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite missions have already found substantial amounts of ice in permanently shadowed craters on the moon. Those locations would be tricky to mine because they are colder and offer no sunlight to power roving vehicles. However, we could install big mirrors on the craters’ rims to illuminate solar panels in the permanently shadowed regions. Rovers from Google’s Lunar X Prize competition and NASA’s Lunar Resource Prospector, set to launch in 2020, would also contribute to finding good locations to mine ice. Depending on where the best ice reserves are, we might need to build several small robotic moon bases. Each one would mine ice, manufacture liquid propellant and transfer it to passing spacecraft. Our team developed plans to accomplish those tasks with three different types of rovers. Our plans also require a few small robotic shuttles to meet up with nearby deep-space mission vehicles in lunar orbit. One rover, which we call the Prospector, would explore the moon and find ice-bearing locations. A second rover, the Constructor, would follow along behind, building a launch pad and packing down roadways to ease movements for the third rover type, the Miners, which actually collect the ice and deliver it to nearby storage tanks and an electrolysis processing plant that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The Constructor would also build a landing pad where the small near-moon transport spacecraft we call Lunar Resupply Shuttles would arrive to collect fuel for delivery as newly launched spacecraft pass by the moon. The shuttles would burn moon-made fuel and would have advanced guidance and navigation systems to travel between lunar bases and their target spacecraft. When enough fuel is being produced, and the shuttle delivery system is tested and reliable, our plan calls for building a gas station in space. The shuttles would deliver ice directly to the orbiting fuel depot, where it would be processed into fuel and where rockets heading to Mars or elsewhere could dock to top up. The depot would have large solar arrays powering an electrolysis module for melting the ice and then turning the water into fuel, and large fuel tanks to store what’s made. NASA is already working on most of the technology needed for a depot like this, including docking and fuel transfer. We anticipate a working depot could be ready in the early 2030s, just in time for the first human missions to Mars. To be most useful and efficient, the depot should be located in a stable orbit relatively near both the Earth and the moon. The Earth-moon Lagrangian Point 1 (L1) is a point in space about 85 percent of the way from Earth to the moon, where the force of Earth’s gravity would exactly equal the force of the moon’s gravity pulling in the other direction. It’s the perfect pit stop for a spacecraft on its way to Mars or the outer planets. Our team also found a fuel-efficient way to get spacecraft from Earth orbit to the depot at L1, requiring even less launch fuel and freeing up more lift energy for cargo items. First, the spacecraft would launch from Earth into Low Earth Orbit with an empty propellant tank. Then, the spacecraft and its cargo could be towed from Low Earth Orbit to the depot at L1 using a solar electric propulsion tug, a spacecraft largely propelled by solar-powered electric thrusters. This would let us triple the payload delivery to Mars. At present, a human Mars mission is estimated to cost as much as US$100 billion, and will need hundreds of tons of cargo. Delivering more cargo from Earth to Mars with fewer rocket launches would save billions of dollars and years of time. Building a gas station between Earth and the moon would also reduce costs for missions beyond Mars. NASA is looking for extraterrestrial life on the moons of Saturn and Jupiter. Future spacecraft could carry much more cargo if they could refuel in space – who knows what scientific discoveries sending large exploration vehicles to these moons could enable? By helping us escape both Earth’s gravity and dependence on its resources, a lunar gas station could be the first small step toward the giant leap into making humanity an interplanetary civilization.

Between the Earth and the moon: An artist’s rendering of a refueling depot for deep-space exploration. Sung Wha Kang (RISD), CC BY-ND Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Forty-five years have passed since humans last set foot on an extraterrestrial body. Now, the moon is back at the center of efforts not only to explore space, but to create a permanent, independent space-faring society. Planning expeditions to Earth’s nearest celestial neighbor is no longer just a NASA effort, though the U.S. space agency has plans for a moon-orbiting space station that would serve as a staging ground for Mars missions in the early 2030s. The United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, is planning a lunar fueling station for spacecraft, capable of supporting 1,000 people living in space within 30 years. Billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Robert Bigelow all have companies aiming to deliver people or goods to the moon. Several teams competing for a share of Google’s US$30 million cash prize are planning to launch rovers to the moon. We and 27 other students from around the world recently participated in the 2017 Caltech Space Challenge, proposing designs of what a lunar launch and supply station for deep space missions might look like, and how it would work. The raw materials for rocket fuel Right now all space missions are based on, and launched from, Earth. But Earth’s gravitational pull is strong. To get into orbit, a rocket has to be traveling 11 kilometers a second – 25,000 miles per hour! Any rocket leaving Earth has to carry all the fuel it will ever use to get to its destination and, if needed, back again. That fuel is heavy – and getting it moving at such high speeds takes a lot of energy. If we could refuel in orbit, that launch energy could lift more people or cargo or scientific equipment into orbit. Then the spacecraft could refuel in space, where Earth’s gravity is less powerful. The moon has one-sixth the gravity of Earth, which makes it an attractive alternative base. The moon also has ice, which we already know how to process into a hydrogen-oxygen propellant that we use in many modern rockets. Roving Luna NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite missions have already found substantial amounts of ice in permanently shadowed craters on the moon. Those locations would be tricky to mine because they are colder and offer no sunlight to power roving vehicles. However, we could install big mirrors on the craters’ rims to illuminate solar panels in the permanently shadowed regions. Mining operations on the moon, an artist’s rendering. Sung Wha Kang (RISD), CC BY-ND Rovers from Google’s Lunar X Prize competition and NASA’s Lunar Resource Prospector, set to launch in 2020, would also contribute to finding good locations to mine ice. Imagining a moon base Depending on where the best ice reserves are, we might need to build several small robotic moon bases. Each one would mine ice, manufacture liquid propellant and transfer it to passing spacecraft. Our team developed plans to accomplish those tasks with three different types of rovers. Our plans also require a few small robotic shuttles to meet up with nearby deep-space mission vehicles in lunar orbit. An artist’s rendering of lunar rover concepts. Sung Wha Kang (RISD), CC BY-ND One rover, which we call the Prospector, would explore the moon and find ice-bearing locations. A second rover, the Constructor, would follow along behind, building a launch pad and packing down roadways to ease movements for the third rover type, the Miners, which actually collect the ice and deliver it to nearby storage tanks and an electrolysis processing plant that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The Constructor would also build a landing pad where the small near-moon transport spacecraft we call Lunar Resupply Shuttles would arrive to collect fuel for delivery as newly launched spacecraft pass by the moon. The shuttles would burn moon-made fuel and would have advanced guidance and navigation systems to travel between lunar bases and their target spacecraft. A gas station in space An artist’s rendering of a fuel depot for refueling deep-space missions. Sung Wha Kang (RISD), CC BY-ND When enough fuel is being produced, and the shuttle delivery system is tested and reliable, our plan calls for building a gas station in space. The shuttles would deliver ice directly to the orbiting fuel depot, where it would be processed into fuel and where rockets heading to Mars or elsewhere could dock to top up. The depot would have large solar arrays powering an electrolysis module for melting the ice and then turning the water into fuel, and large fuel tanks to store what’s made. NASA is already working on most of the technology needed for a depot like this, including docking and fuel transfer. We anticipate a working depot could be ready in the early 2030s, just in time for the first human missions to Mars. To be most useful and efficient, the depot should be located in a stable orbit relatively near both the Earth and the moon. The Earth-moon Lagrangian Point 1 (L1) is a point in space about 85 percent of the way from Earth to the moon, where the force of Earth’s gravity would exactly equal the force of the moon’s gravity pulling in the other direction. It’s the perfect pit stop for a spacecraft on its way to Mars or the outer planets. Leaving Earth Our team also found a fuel-efficient way to get spacecraft from Earth orbit to the depot at L1, requiring even less launch fuel and freeing up more lift energy for cargo items. First, the spacecraft would launch from Earth into Low Earth Orbit with an empty propellant tank. An artist’s rendering of a solar electric propulsion tug above an asteroid. NASA Then, the spacecraft and its cargo could be towed from Low Earth Orbit to the depot at L1 using a solar electric propulsion tug, a spacecraft largely propelled by solar-powered electric thrusters. This would let us triple the payload delivery to Mars. At present, a human Mars mission is estimated to cost as much as US$100 billion, and will need hundreds of tons of cargo. Delivering more cargo from Earth to Mars with fewer rocket launches would save billions of dollars and years of time. A base for space exploration Building a gas station between Earth and the moon would also reduce costs for missions beyond Mars. NASA is looking for extraterrestrial life on the moons of Saturn and Jupiter. Future spacecraft could carry much more cargo if they could refuel in space – who knows what scientific discoveries sending large exploration vehicles to these moons could enable? By helping us escape both Earth’s gravity and dependence on its resources, a lunar gas station could be the first small step toward the giant leap into making humanity an interplanetary civilization.

(AP Photo/John Raoux) By Larry Altman, Daily Breeze and Megan Barnes, Daily Breeze Posted: 05/15/17, 5:19 PM PDT | Updated: 4 hrs ago # Comments SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket from Florida on Monday carrying a commercial communications satellite. Credit SpaceX SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket successfully roared into orbit Monday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to deploy a 13,500-pound communications satellite for London-based Inmarsat, Elon Musk’s latest customer for his Hawthorne aerospace company. The 4:21 p.m. PST liftoff at Cape Canaveral marked SpaceX’s sixth launch in 2017. It was expected to deliver the Inmarsat-5 F4 satellite into space, where it can begin operating more than 22,000 miles above Earth. “It looks like we have a good parking orbit,” principal integration engineer John Insprucker said on the SpaceX webcast of the launch. More than 55,000 watched the broadcast on SpaceX’s YouTube site. Insprucker said the weather proved to be perfect for the launch. A subsequent one-minute engine burn-off to bring the spacecraft into geostationary transfer orbit went “just as planned,” Insprucker said. Although the video feed cut off at the time to deploy the satellite, engineers were overheard confirming the separation was successful. “We’ve had good orbits, good separation — all you can ask for today,” Insprucker said before signing off. Boeing built the satellite in El Segundo. • RELATED: Communications-satellite revolution gets off the ground at SpaceX, Boeing in South Bay SpaceX did not attempt to land Falcon 9’s first stage because of the mission’s fuel requirements to lift the heavy satellite into space. It did not have enough fuel to attempt a landing on a barge or on the ground. Inmarsat-5 F4 is the fourth satellite for the $1.6 billion Global Xpress constellation, the world’s first globally available, high-speed, mobile broadband service for ships, airplanes and ground stations, SpaceX said in a statement. The three previous satellites were launched by a Russian-based company in Kazahkstan.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) (Photo: Joe Raedle, 2017 Getty Images) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST MELBOURNE, Fla. — A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted into a beautiful blue sky over Florida's Atlantic Coast Monday night, hauling a “behemoth” commercial communications satellite from Kennedy Space Center. Weighing in at nearly 13,500 pounds atop the rocket, the fourth Inmarsat-5 satellite was the heaviest load lofted by a Falcon 9 yet. The 230-foot rocket delivered the spacecraft larger than a double-decker bus to an orbit more than 22,000 miles over the equator. As a result, SpaceX did not attempt to land the rocket’s first stage either at Cape Canaveral or at sea, and the Falcon 9 booster was not equipped with landing legs. London-based Inmarsat, which has a Palm Bay, Fla., office with about 200 employees, initially booked the mission on a Falcon Heavy rocket. SpaceX’s heavy-lift launcher could debut later this year, but for schedule reasons the mission was switched to the latest version of the Falcon 9. The Inmarsat-5 Flight 4 satellite, built by Boeing, completes Inmarsat’s four-satellite Global Xpress constellation focused on delivering high-speed broadband data to mobile customers, including commercial aircraft and ships and the U.S. military. Inmarsat CEO Rupert Pearce said earlier that “everyone at Inmarsat, SpaceX and Boeing is really, really pumped about this launch. It’s a very significant one for us at Inmarsat, because we call it the end of the beginning of the Global Xpress era.” © 2017 Florida Today CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Houston Congressman calls for impeachment of President Trump Deputies investigating ATV crash in N.

SpaceX successfully launches its heaviest geostationary orbital payload yet Posted 7 hours ago by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Savari works to bring 5G to connected cars SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket carrying a payload from communications satellite operate Inmarsat, the fourth in a constellation created to provide high-bandwidth broadspeed Internet globally. The payload is the largest ever launched on a Falcon 9, which is why the mission parameters didn’t call for an attempt to recover the first stage of the rocket. The launch was originally slated to be done with one of SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rockets, but the company has yet to bring those into commercial operation. Instead, the Falcon 9’s top payload capacity has been improved to the point where it can handle delivering the Inmarsat satellite to its target geostationary orbit. SpaceX’s launch bring the Boeing-made satellite into operation alongside three previously deployed spacecraft, with the intent of this additional one being to add more load capacity to the existing network, and also to provide some backup options in case one of the other geostationary units encounters a problem. The launch took place at SpaceX’s LC-39A complex at Kennedy in Florida, which SpaceX has leased and repurposed to support Falcon 9 and future Falcon Heavy crewed launches. The rocket successfully completed its initial second stage burn, after which it’ll initiate a second in order to move into the correct place in orbit. Once in position, it’ll deploy its satellite payload. We’ll update this story when they return to broadcasting to let you know if the post-launch mission was a success as well. Update: Total mission success with full satellite deployment achieved. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Hyperloop One Founded 2014 Overview Hyperloop builds incredible pieces of advanced machinery.

The satellite is set to launch Monday evening on SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket. The launch will be live streamed and the countdown and liftoff is scheduled for a 49-minute launch window beginning at 7:21 p.m. EDT Monday, SpaceX said. There, however, a backup launch time scheduled for Tuesday in case of delay. Read: SpaceX And Elon Musk Are Planning To Bring The Internet To Space The rocket was in place early Monday and ready to go for the evening launch. The rocket will deliver the commercial communications satellite called Inmarsat-5 F4 to geostationary orbit, meaning it will be stuck in orbit in one spot and circle the Earth about once a day. It will launch from Cape Canaveral at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the same launch pad from which many of the Apollo missions were launched, 39A. A launch with the Falcon 9 costs $62 million, according to a price list online. The Falcon Heavy costs nearly $30 million more than that and can carry far more depending on how far the material the rocket is launching needs to go. SpaceX will not be landing the first stage of the Falcon 9 for reuse this launch because it would interfere with the needs of the mission, a media release said. The Inmarsat-5 F4 will deploy roughly 32 minutes after launch, the company said. Then it will be under the control of Boeing and Inmarsat teams that will finish positioning it. The satellite is set to expand the reach and power of Inmarsat’s Global Xpress network, “the first high-speed broadband network from a single operator to span the world,” according to Inmarsat’s website. The company aims to bring high-speed broadband access to people on land, at sea and in the air. The “orbit redundancy ” helps strengthen the network and make it more reliable for customers.

She set her sights on breaking a new record: to become the youngest female pilot to complete such a trip. The plan is to make more than 30 stops over five continents, in 18 countries, in 90 days – flying more than 40,000 kms. READ MORE: Woman celebrates 100th birthday by attempting to break 100-metre dash record Story continues below Waiz was born near Kabul, Afghanistan in a refugee camp. In 1987, her and her family fled to Richmond, Calif. to escape their worn-torn country. Growing up, she started having an interest in aviation and started pursuing something that has never been done before. She became the first certified civilian female pilot from Afghanistan. “Every time I open the door to an aircraft, I ask myself, ‘How did a girl with my background become so lucky?’ The truth is, anyone can be me,” she said in a statement. She also became the first person in her family to get a bachelor’s and master’s degree from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. “I believed my future consisted of getting married at a young age and starting a big family. It wasn’t until I found aviation that I started thinking about having a career and going to college.” While Waiz says she looks forward to breaking the record, she hopes to get other young women interested in science, technology, engineering and math. She started a not-for-profit called Dreams Soar to raise scholarship money for women who want to study in those fields. During her trip around the world, Waiz plans on meeting young women along the way and encouraging them to pursue an education in the male-dominant fields. READ MORE: WestJet orders up to 20 Boeing Dreamliners as part of international expansion plan Waiz says she gets her inspiration from Ohio native Jerrie Mock, who became the first woman in 1964 to complete a solo flight around the world. Waiz says Mock broke gender barriers in aviation at a time when few women were pilots. But Mock wasn’t the first woman to try and fly around the globe. Amelia Earhart, an American aviation pioneer, broke many aviation records, including become the first woman to fly over both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. But during during her last flight in 1937, in an attempt to fly across the globe, she lost control of her plane on takeoff. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

The space agency recently completed a major test series on hardware for the upper part of the rocket. The liquid hydrogen tank structural qualification test article is being prepared for shipping to NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama for testing later in 2017. Credits: NASA/MSFC Michoud image: Judy Guidry. The testing is conducted at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The rocket’s core stage engine section is currently on-route to the testing facility for its qualification test series. The engine section is the first of four core stage test articles manufactured and is designed to the specifications needed for launch. These tests put the SLS rocket that much closer to being launched into outer space. In addition to shipping the completed engine structural test article this month, the liquid hydrogen tank structural test article manufacturing is also complete. It is being equipped before heading to Marshall for testing later this year. Finally, the flight intertank structural assembly is also nearly finished and will soon undergo application of thermal protection systems. There have been some challenges along with way, specifically with the liquid oxygen tank test article. During recent manufacturing, the rear or aft dome was inadvertently damaged in pre-weld preparations. This occurred before the dome was welded to the rest of the test article. NASA and Boeing formed independent mishap investigation teams to evaluate the incident. No personnel were injured, and assessments are ongoing to ensure this doesn’t happen again. “Small things from the tiniest screws to each weld matter,” said John Honeycutt, the SLS Program manager at Marshall. “Our engineers are learning as we work with Boeing to tackle challenges from aligning robotic weld machines off by as little as the width of a paperclip to addressing the fact that tiny threads on welding pins affect weld strength. We’re working together to ensure critical flight hardware is handled safely in the factory and as it is moved thousands of miles by ships, trains, and planes.” NASA and Boeing, the agency’s prime contractor for SLS, have done extensive work to develop weld parameters and processes for making the first-of-their-kind large fuel tanks. www.nasa.gov Share Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Tags NASA rocket Testing Related NASA begins constructing the world’s largest rocket NASA tests robotic ice-breaking prototypes for missions to ocean worlds NASA tests Webb Telescope to ensure it can be successfully launched into space Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Apprenticeship wages vary by trade, but according to the Washington State Education and Research Data Center , five years after completing an apprenticeship, median salaries are $69,900. Regardless of the specific wage, apprenticeships usually follow a sliding scale based on journey-level pay rates. Commonly, apprentices will earn 80 percent of journey-level wages in their first year, 85 percent of journey-level wages in their second year, and so forth. To look up prevailing wages by trade and by county, visit the Prevailing Wage page on the Department of Labor and Industries . Some of the wages for journey-level work are impressive. The prevailing wages for electricians in Pierce County, for example, are between $61 and $64 per hour. Apprenticeship is college, and apprentices are valued members of our student body. How does a Bates-affiliated apprenticeship work? Bates partners with seven different joint apprenticeship training committees (JATC) offering nine different apprenticeship programs. Each JATC has its own process for acceptance and its own coordinator. The contacts for these programs can be found on our website . In some cases, there is an entrance examination, which may include both a physical and classroom component. Some apprenticeship programs require that you already have an employer sponsor, while others will help place you in a job. Once you have been accepted into an apprenticeship program, your employer will supervise your on-the-job experience, and you will receive your related supplemental instruction either at Bates Technical College or the JATC training facility. The combination of on-the-job experience and related supplemental instruction is what separates apprenticeship from other work-based training, such as internships. Importantly, the related supplemental instruction is awarded as college credit, which can be applied towards an associate degree in apprenticeship studies. Apprenticeship is not an alternative to college. Apprenticeship is college, and apprentices are valued members of our student body. Who employs apprentices? Most of the joint apprenticeship training committees have longstanding affiliations with employers in their specific trade, and employers range from small businesses to multinational corporations. Aerospace are employed by Boeing, as well as by the numerous, smaller companies that provide specialized parts for Boeing aircraft. Fire fighter apprentices are employed by fire departments throughout the state. Operating engineers are employed by schools, hospitals and other companies with large plant operations. The next time you go out to a restaurant, it’s likely that an apprentice helped build the road that got you there, as well as provided the cut of beef. Who qualifies to become an apprentice? Qualifications vary by apprenticeship, but there may be some fairly stringent physical and/or mental demands. You may also be limited by your own tolerances. Afraid of the sight of blood? The meat cutters apprenticeship might not be the best choice. Fear of heights? You would definitely want to reconsider a career as an iron worker. Still, our apprentices represent all ages, backgrounds and abilities. Some have overcome academic deficiencies and criminal backgrounds. If you are willing to put in the effort, it’s likely you will qualify for one of the apprenticeships we offer. Submitted by Brandon Rogers, Dean of Instruction, South Campus.

(Photo Credit: U.S. Army photo ) VIEW ORIGINAL REDSTONE ARSENAL, Ala. (Oct. 6, 2014) -- The Program Executive Office for Aviation here, has once again pushed the envelope of technology for its family of unmanned aircraft systems. The Gray Eagle and Shadow unmanned aircraft systems, or UAS -- both popular with Soldiers for the reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities they bring to the battlefield -- have proven themselves up to the challenge in a series of manned-unmanned teaming tests with the Army's newest Apache, the AH-64 "E" model, and the One System Remote Video Terminal during the past two months at both Redstone Arsenal and El Mirage Flight Test Facility in California. The successful tests took the two unmanned aircraft systems into the realm of true interoperability between multiple Army aviation systems. While unmanned aircraft systems have been transmitting surveillance video to helicopter pilots via a ground station control system since 2007, the recent tests proved that capabilities have been successfully increased so that Apache helicopter pilots can control the payloads, sensors and flight of unmanned aircraft systems from the cockpit of their helicopter. In addition, the tests proved the capabilities of the latest version of the One System Remote Video Terminal to control the sensors of UAS. "During our test events, we've taken the manned-unmanned capabilities of Shadow and Gray Eagle, and the Apache "E" model to a level where the Apache cannot only receive information but also transmit command and control to the unmanned systems," said Doug Wolfe, interoperability lead, Common Systems Integration, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Project Office, Program Executive Office for Aviation. "We've also tested the use of a One System Remote Video Terminal, where the Soldiers in the fight can use the OSRVT to control the sensors on all unmanned aircraft systems. Right now, the OSRVT allows the receipt of data from different UAS," Wolfe continued. "But the next version will make OSRVT bi-directional so that it cannot only receive from all UAS, but also transmit to all UAS to control their payloads." The Gray Eagle UAS, the largest unmanned aircraft system in the Army's arsenal of weapons, has a mission that includes wide-ranged intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; convoy protection; IED detection and defeater; close air support; target acquisition; communications relay and weapons delivery. It can operate up to 25 hours, flies up to 29,000 feet and can carry multiple payloads, including four Hellfire missiles. The Shadow UAS is used by brigade commanders for reconnaissance, surveillance, targeting and assessment. It can conduct missions up to 125 kilometers away from the ground control stations, and recognize tactical vehicles up to 8,000 feet above the ground at a range of more than 3.5 kilometers, day or night. The Gray Eagle and Shadow are the anchor systems in an Army UAS fleet that also includes the much smaller Puma and Raven UAS, and the Army's first UAS, Hunter. Since 2007, Army aviation has flown more than 5.85 million flight hours in manned-unmanned teaming scenarios, both in training and on the battlefield. Manned-unmanned teaming is possible due to the standardization of video and data transmission systems between ground station control, unmanned aircraft systems and manned platforms. The manned-unmanned network allows manned helicopters to control unmanned aircraft payloads, and the receiving and transmitting of real-time video. "These new capabilities are a force multiplier for infantry and field artillery," Wolfe said. "The experiences we've had with this testing have exceeded my expectations. I am very positive about the results of our testing and the capabilities that will be provided to the war fighter." For about two and a half years, PEO Aviation engineers have been working with its partners in both government and industry to increase manned-unmanned teaming capabilities, said Ricardo Jaramillo, interoperability profile lead for Gray Eagle. "We've had several anomalies along the way that we've had to work through," he said. "And we did work through them so my expectation was that everything would work just as advertised, and it did." Apache helicopter pilots are familiar with flying with UAS in the battle space, said Sean Gilpin, UAS Level IV interoperability lead, Apache Project Office, PEO Aviation. "Our Apache pilots are the human machine interface in manned-unmanned teaming. We have fielded manned-unmanned capabilities with our 'E' model Apache," he said. "Unmanned aircraft help to take away the unknown on the battlefield because they can fly out from the Apache and allow the Apache pilot to see over the horizon. Any additional capabilities we can provide above what we have now will only make it better for our Apache pilots. The response from the field is that Soldiers really like it." Manned-unmanned teaming already brings several assets to the battlefield, including improved air-ground integration, increased operational tempos, rapid development of situations when engaged, increased endurance allowing manned platforms to action real-time intelligence, increased lethality, increased survivability by reducing the unknown about enemy force disposition, persistent surveillance allowing manned aircraft to focus on high payoff targets and reliable combat information in real time. The team of defense contractors supporting the testing included Textron, General Atomics, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. "There's been a lot of teamwork," Wolfe said. "We really came together as a team to pull this off." In addition, the Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center, known as AMRDEC, provided the support needed to test in the Joint Systems Integration Lab at Redstone. "Testing is usually a very long process, because you have to crawl and walk before you can run," Gilpin said. "Starting with both the Apache and the unmanned aircraft on the ground, then with both aircraft in the air, we ran through all the test scenarios to vet out the system, to validate our robust interoperability. AMRDEC's Aviation Engineering Directorate was on-site to critically examine the tests to make sure what we said would happen did happen. "When we put both UAS and Apache in flight, with the ground control station then passing supervised control of the systems over to Apache, we tested the UAS and its sensors in all conditions with different air speeds, altitudes, directions and route plans so that we could see the actual behavior of the UAS and its sensor payloads in flight, and under the control of the Apache in different conditions." Prior to aircraft testing, the team also conducted several tests in the Joint Systems Integration Lab, which included laser tests of the Shadow with the Apache pilot controlling the UAS. "From an operational standpoint, this provides the Apache with another pair of eyes higher in the sky and a third crew member from the Ground Control Station operator," Gilpin said. "Apache can use the Shadow sensors to detect and identify targets of opportunity while still keeping the Apache a safe distance out of harm's way. "Shadow is the scout. Apache is the killer. And together they are a synergistic team of aviation assets that engage targets," Wolfe added. The One System Remote Video Terminal is the force multiplier for ground troops who can receive video from all Army UAS on the battlefield. "Now they will be able to control what they are looking at, providing real-time intelligence to ground commanders," Wolfe said. "It is a total force multiplier that can bring all systems in the battlefield -- the UAS, the OSRVT and the Apache -- together to accomplish the mission. It provides more options and capabilities for situation awareness." The team of engineers said the two months of testing continues the development of a successful Army UAS fleet that provides war fighters with a tactical edge on the battlefield now and in years to come. "We did a number of firsts during these tests," said Jason Gilbert, the software lead for Shadow. "It was the first time the Apache controlled the payload and unmanned aircraft of the Shadow system. It was the first laser testing in the [Joint Systems Integration Lab] with the Apache in control of the lasers on the Shadow. It was the first time we tested the interoperability profiles, and the standards and guidelines for these systems. The tests were a culmination of seven years of all the manned-unmanned teaming work that we've done and that will soon be fielded with the Army." Eventually, the plans include taking manned-unmanned teaming even further with technology that will allow Apache pilots to have full control and fire weapons from the UAS.

The global fiberglass market for aerospace industry to grow at a CAGR of 4.86% during the period 2017-2021. The report, Global Fiberglass Market for Aerospace Industry 2017-2021, has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. One trend in market is implementation of composites in jet engines and aircraft interiors. Since the market for commercial air transport has been growing rapidly, the jet engines used in commercial aircraft account for a huge market value. Therefore, importance is being given to fuel efficiency, weight reduction, and increased performance efficiency of these engines. According to the report, one driver in market is demand for aircraft weight reduction and fuel efficiency. Fiberglass has a high strength-to-weight ratio, providing a weight saving of 20%-50% more than metal alloys. Its specific strength and modulus are higher than many other metallic alloys. Therefore, though fiberglass is lightweight, it provides the necessary strength required in aerospace applications. Fiberglass is used in aircraft to provide strong and lightweight body parts. Boeing, in its 787 Dreamline, used fiberglass as the main material in the airframe. By volume, it had 80% composites. The 787 Dreamline was 20% to 40% lighter in weight than other commercial planes. This low weight has resulted in a cut down in fuel consumption by approximately 40%. Also, Airbus A350XWB uses 53% composites such as fiberglass in airplane parts to reduce weight and fuel consumption.

Timothy Warner attended a 2012 demonstration of the DTEK system at Boeing's Huntington Beach, Calif. manufacturing site along with members of the ChromoLogic and Boeing teams. (Photo Credit: Courtesy Photo) VIEW ORIGINAL ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. -- The Army's initial concept of exploring DNA as a tagging and tracking method has led to the discovery of an optical scanning technology that can identify counterfeit electronic components before they are integrated into Army materiel. Researchers from the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command said the technology provides the capability to identify and track materiel in the absence of external tags or barcodes. This timely discovery will help address a significant challenge within the Army and DoD: the presence of counterfeit electronic components in military equipment. A 2011-2012 investigation by the Senate Armed Services Committee found overwhelming evidence that international counterfeiters are taking old, sub-standard electronic components and altering them to appear as new, brand-name parts that are then integrated into DoD munitions, aircrafts, sensors, and other electronic devices. SASC chairman, Sen. Carl Levin, said the "flood of counterfeit parts, overwhelmingly from China, threatens national security, the safety of our troops, and American jobs." Although the SASC uncovered the sources of many of these counterfeit parts, an ongoing challenge is to consistently and reliably identify these forgeries and prevent their integration into DoD and Army materiel. The SASC released a report in May 2012 emphasizing this challenge by documenting "failures by defense contractors and DoD to report counterfeit parts and gaps in DoD's knowledge of the scope and impact of such parts on defense systems." This investigation led to an amendment, signed by President Obama, to stop the integration of counterfeit electronic parts into DoD systems and to address weaknesses in the supply chain. An Army Research Laboratory-Army Research Office Small Business Innovation Research topic has led to a novel technology that will help address many of the challenges noted in the SASC report. The SBIR topic, conceived by scientists from ARL-ARO and the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center in 2007, called for a study of the properties of DNA to determine if this information-rich natural polymer could be used in a new barcoding system that would provide enhanced security relative to conventional tracking methods. A California-based company, ChromoLogic, LLC, was contracted to explore this SBIR topic. ChromoLogic developed a tag with a biomimetic barcode that can be aligned in the proper order and decoded by an optical reader, akin to how the sequence of a DNA molecule can be read. This biomimetic tag and reader system has robust information-storage capabilities that are unambiguous and readily authenticated, with no reagent or material exchange between the tag and reader. This technology will provide a capability that complements ongoing research led by the Edgewood Chemical and Biological Center, which focuses on embedding DNA in printed barcodes, which can be transferred to a reference test ticket to verify authentic military materiel. Interestingly, as is often true for high-risk, high-payoff research, this project led to an unexpected discovery that may have an even greater impact than was initially conceived. The research team, led by principal investigator Dr. Naresh Menon and project manager Leonard Nelson, discovered that the optical scanning technology developed to decode the biomimetic tag is capable of mapping the intrinsic surface of electronic components, providing a type of fingerprint to distinguish authentic or counterfeit circuits. Nelson stated that when "illegitimate electronic components' surfaces are altered, the counterfeiters do it in a way that is very difficult for human observers to detect…believe it or not, the fake ones look better than the real ones." Given that counterfeit electronic components are forged chiefly by altering their surface layers, this discovery provides a powerful method for screening integrated circuits based on their intrinsic surface patterns, which can be scanned in as little as one second. ChromoLogic has developed this surface-scanning technology into the DTEK system, which provides quantitative optical inspection of integrated circuits. Dr. Stephanie McElhinny, ARL-ARO program manager for the ChromoLogic project, noted that the development and use of this optical scanner for detecting surface fingerprints "is an incredible example that illustrates how research discoveries can guide a project to an outcome that would never have been predicted…and serves as a strong argument for the continued support of high-risk research to enable new Army capabilities." The DTEK system recently began evaluation through multiple electronics manufacturers, and the technology has already been adopted by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Boeing. McElhinny and ARO Military Deputy Lt. Col. Timothy Warner attended a site demonstration of the DTEK system at Boeing's Huntington Beach location in 2012. The ARL-ARO representatives were shown the quality assurance process at Boeing and the role that the DTEK system will play in authenticating circuits for use in DoD contracts. According to Warner, the importance of this technology is evident "when one considers the implications of an illegitimate circuit making its way into Army materiel--it could cause a 10-fold reduction in service life, or worse--it could cause the failure of an aircraft or targeting system while in operation, putting lives at risk." The DTEK system, used as part of a comprehensive counterfeit-mitigation process, may reduce the influx of forgeries into Army materiel and improve the reliability of mission-essential equipment used by the Soldier. The DTEK optical scanning technology is also capable of identifying and tracking materiel in the absence of external tags or barcodes. The research team is working with Picatinny Arsenal and the Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center to develop a hand-held scanner that can be used for covert tracking and management of high-value Army commodities.

By Doug Mohney May 15, 2017 Kennedy Space Center, Florida – Later today, May 15, 2017, SpaceX is scheduled to put an Inmarsat communications satellite into orbit.  Is this a turning point for both companies and the space industry at large? Certainly, SpaceX wants to permanently change the status quo. The Inmarsat-5 F4 satellite is expected to lift off from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida at around 7:21 p.m. EDT. F4 will join three other Ka-band satellites for Inmarsat’s Global Xpress (GX) constellation, offering broadband services around the globe.  Due to the weight of the F4 satellite, SpaceX is going to empty the fuel tanks on the Falcon 9 (F9) first stage to put it into orbit, so a dramatic flyback and landing isn’t in the cards today. Such flights are expected to be a rare exception rather than the rule in the future.  SpaceX has recovered a number of F9 first stages and is starting to recycle the “flight-proven” hardware into service on commercial launches, with the long-term goal of drastically lowering launch costs. Larger satellites such as the Inmarsat-5 will go up on the Falcon Heavy, expected to make its first flight in the fall of this year.  All three of Falcon Heavy’s first stages will fly back for landing and reuse, and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has suggested that it may be possible for its second stage to be recovered and reused as well. Hardware reuse translates into satellite launch moving from unique events into airplane-like operations, with flights taking place on a regular basis.  SpaceX is already starting to ramp up its flight rate and is on a schedule to launch at least once every two weeks through the end of the year. Musk has stated it should be possible to refly a Falcon 9 first stage with minimal refurbishment – essentially gas-and-go – up to 10 times with a F9 first stage capable of up to 100 flights with proper care and maintenance. But what do you do with a fleet of rockets capable of flying at least every week or more?  SpaceX says it wants to put a fleet of thousands of satellites into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to create a massive high-speed broadband network that would compete with existing satellite providers and even traditional fiber, potentially providing service with lower latency.  Building such a network puts SpaceX in competition with its customers – such as Inmarsat.  Company executives point out SpaceX is not unique in getting into the services business.  Airbus has an investment in OneWeb while Boeing is making noises to launch its own service. So long as “conflicts of interest” are managed, there’s not a problem in working with SpaceX or any other company for launching and building satellites if it is also trying to run a services business. The door could also be open for Inmarsat and SpaceX to become partners in the future.  Inmarsat has been briefed in a preliminary way on the technical nature of the SpaceX broadband network, but isn’t convinced the business case closes. Company officials didn’t rule out the prospects of using SpaceX’s network in the future and suggested the possibility of roaming agreements between the services. For now, Inmarsat is sticking with its existing business model of launching its own satellites and owning its own network.  Now that the company has established global coverage with the large Inmarsat-5 GX series satellites with an expected lifetime of 15 years, it can move to launching smaller satellites to add supplemental coverage and services as needed, effectively right-sizing as business grows. The company is very bullish on Ka-band and its ability to offer global broadband services, with airplane connectivity one of its more significant verticals.  If you are flying overseas, there’s a good chance Inmarsat is providing the Internet connection.

Opinion Six-part opinion series Our Dishonest President READ NOW BUSINESS SpaceX successfully launches commercial satellite Inmarsat-5 Flight 4 launch webcast. Inmarsat-5 Flight 4 launch webcast. Samantha MasunagaContact Reporter SpaceX launched a commercial communications satellite Monday afternoon, the sixth launch of the year for the Elon Musk-led company. The Inmarsat-5 F4 satellite took off on a Falcon 9 rocket from Pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center in Florida at about 4:20 p.m. Pacific time. The satellite was deployed about 30 minutes later. Unlike in past launches, SpaceX did not attempt to land the first-stage booster. Getting the unusually large, 13,500-pound satellite to its geostationary orbit burned more fuel than a typical launch on a Falcon 9. The satellite is intended to provide additional high-speed broadband capacity for users of London-based satellite communications firm Inmarsat’s Global Xpress network. It will orbit the Earth from a roughly fixed position above the ground. Inmarsat-5 F4 will provide “in-orbit redundancy” — meaning it could serve as a replacement if any of the network’s existing satellites have problems — as well as provide other future capabilities, Inmarsat Chief Executive Rupert Pearce said in an earnings call this month. The satellite was built in El Segundo by Boeing Co. SpaceX’s last launch was May 1. That time, the Hawthorne space company — whose full name is Space Exploration Technologies Corp. — launched a spy satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office.

Proof: They’ve handily beaten the S&P 500 in the 17 months since the Federal Reserve put the zero-interest-rate era on ice. In just a moment, I’ll show you 2 terrific off-the-radar dividend-growth plays to snap up now—and 2 surprising blue chips you’ll want to keep well away from your nest egg. First, take a look at how the iShares Core Dividend-Growth ETF (DGRO) has performed vs. the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) on a total-return basis since December 16, 2015, the day Janet Yellen raised rates for the first time in nine years. The Dividend-Growth Edge in 1 Chart This is exactly why dividend-growers must hold pride of place in your portfolio: their rising payouts yank in buyers. And when the market takes a swan dive, you get some nice downside protection, as most folks keep a death grip on their favorite dividend growers no matter what. You can see that in DGRO’s climb, which is smoother and steadier than SPY’s. Most first-level investors stop here and pull the trigger on DGRO. Too bad that’s the first step to leaving money on the table—potentially a lot of money. ETFs: Resist the Siren Song After all, why wouldn’t you buy DGRO when the fees are a pittance, at 0.08% of assets, and the portfolio seems nicely spread out across the major sectors, adding a nice margin of safety? An Attractive Portfolio—but Look Deeper Source: iShares Oh, and with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 20.7, DGRO’s portfolio still trades lower than the S&P 500, at 23.8. So what’s not to like? Quite a bit, actually. Let’s take that P/E figure first. Even though DGRO’s overall ratio is less than that of the benchmark index, the fund is still going to hand you some overbought names mixed in with the bargains. That’s a major pitfall of passive investing, as my colleague Michael Foster wrote in an article back in February. Take Microsoft (MSFT) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), two stocks on my “avoid” list right now. Microsoft, DGRO’s No. 2 holding, sports a nosebleed P/E of 30.1 after running up 34% in the past year. The software giant also pays out 65% of its earnings as dividends, which doesn’t mean it’s about to sideswipe us with a dividend cut, but it could weigh down payout growth, especially if earnings take a hit. No. 3 holding Exxon is far worse, with a P/E of 34.4 and a payout ratio of 125%. That’s right—the oil giant is paying more in dividends than it’s earning! Where’s it getting the cash? It’s borrowing it, of course. Take a look at what’s happened to Exxon’s long-term debt in the last four years. Exxon’s Debt Hangover How We’ll Beat the Passive Crowd I’m not saying these two holdings will take down DGRO—not even close. But I am saying that with a bit of research, we can kick out pricey dividend laggards like MSFT and XOM and position ourselves for bigger gains and more income than folks who simply buy a dividend-growth ETF and call it a day. Here are two off-the-radar buys I’ve turned up the “old-fashioned” way, zeroing in on bargain valuations, safe payout ratios, rising earnings and sterling dividend-growth histories. Dividend-Growth Pick #1: Wyndham Worldwide Hotel operator Wyndham Worldwide (WYN) sports a dividend yield of just 2.2%, a number that’s ranged from 1.4% to 3.0% in the last five years. Yield: Ho-Hum to Slightly Less Ho-Hum A 2.2% payout isn’t enough to get your average dividend fan’s heart racing. But focusing solely on current yield is another first-level mistake, because it’s the yield on your original buy that really counts. Here’s what I mean: Let’s say you bought WYN five years ago. Today, thanks to management’s relentless dividend hikes (the quarterly payout’s up 152% in that time), you’d be yielding a nice 4.1%, on your original investment. Better yet, the dividend has pulled Wyndham’s share price up with it! Dividend Spikes, WYN Soars But you wouldn’t know that from the current yield, because the herd has bid up WYN’s share price with each payout hike, keeping the current yield more or less stable (because you calculate yield by dividing the annual dividend into the current price). The stock is up nearly 4% after WYN reported better-than expected first-quarter earnings on April 26. But don’t worry, you still have a window to get in on the next five years of dividend-driven upside: WYN’s payout ratio is an ultra-safe 35%, and its P/E is still a reasonable 15.9, well below Marriott International (MAR), at 37.3, and Hyatt Hotels (H), at 32.1. The kicker? Wyndham CEO Steve Holmes hinted on the latest earnings call that the company may be setting up to spin off its timeshare business. That could be a boon for shareholders: according to a 2012 Credit Suisse study, spinoffs and parents tend to outperform the S&P 500 by a wide margin in the 12 months following a split. Dividend-Growth Pick #2: First American Financial I pounded the table on First American Financial (FAF) on January 9 (it’s up 11.3% since then vs. 5.0% for the S&P 500) and February 17 (FAF: 7.2%; S&P 500: 1.6%). Don’t tap the brakes now, because there’s still value here, and the stage is set for a big dividend hike in August to give the title insurer’s stock an extra kick. How do I know? Because FAF last announced a payout hike in August 2016, and it was the company’s biggest since 2014. FAF’s Dividend: Movin’ on Up History could easily repeat, because First American’s payout ratio is just 40% and its earnings are soaring, giving management more cash to put in our pockets: Housing Surges, FAF’s Profits Soar FAF might seem a strange recommendation as rates rise, as it’s essentially a bet on the housing market. But that still looks like a solid wager, and two more rate hikes this year (which is what futures traders expect) won’t hurt—and could even drive up—near-term demand. In March, existing home sales jumped 4.4%, easily beating the 2.5% economists expected. Inventory is still tight, but rising prices should get more sellers off the fence, while continued job growth keeps buyers in the game. Finally, you can still get in on FAF at a reasonable P/E of 13.3, which helps offset the unpredictability of the housing market. So does FAF’s nice 3.2% dividend yield. Do This and Lock in a Safe 12% a Year—for Life Wyndham is far from the only stock investors are missing because they’re fixating on dividend yield … when dividend growth is the real number to watch. Because as we’ve just seen, dividend growth is the No. 1 predictor of share-price gains. When you combine it with two other factors: a bargain valuation and share buybacks (which cut the share count and boost earnings per share), you get a stock that has little choice but to head skyward! Look what happened with one of my other favorites—Boeing (BA)—which I urged subscribers of my Hidden Yields service to buy a year ago, when it traded at a ridiculously low 12-times free cash flow. Boeing management had already seen the opportunity and was going all-in, buying back Boeing stock left and right—and hiking the dividend as they went. It’s a move I’ve seen savvy managers make time and again: wait for the stock’s valuation to fall way out of line … make some timely buybacks … then hike the dividend to grab the herd’s attention. So did it work? Of course it did.

Share this on WhatsApp This after they pulled over five suspected skelms and found their getaway car loaded with cellphones, laptops and guns. Last Wednesday, cops held a stake-out operation to monitor the movements of a rented silver Renault Sandero. Police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk says the team pounced when they spotted the car speeding on the N1 highway. “The observation team saw a silver Renault Sandero with registration number FS68JCGP speeding on the N1,” he says. “Back-up was called and the vehicle was pulled over on the R300. Inside the vehicle, a 9mm firearm with the serial number filed off, was found, as well as numerous laptops, cellphones and tablets for which the occupants could not give a reasonable explanation of where it came from. “Another Norinco 9mm pistol containing a magazine with five rounds of ammunition was found.” STAKE-OUT: Hired Renault Sandero used for crimes. CREDIT: Supplied The men, aged between 22 and 33, were arrested for the possession of a prohibited firearm and the possession of suspected stolen goods and detained at Kuils River Police Station. “The vehicle, which belongs to a rental company in Boeing Road, Elma Park, Edenvale, was not reported stolen, but was used to commit the crimes,” Van Wyk says. Hours later, it was established that the suspects were linked to an earlier burglary in a shopping centre in Worcester. “The thorough investigation of crime and the bringing of perpetrators before court is crucial in the efforts of the SAPS to ensure convictions. The investigating officer will oppose bail,” Van Wyk added. The suspects will appear in the Kuils Rivier Magistrates’ Court once charged.

Devin Lorenz, 24, led the team as mentor and sponsor and is also a TARC alumnus from the Festus High School TARC team that finished runner up in the 2008 Final Fly-off. “I’m amazed,” he said. “I didn’t even consider this a possibility. We wanted to get them to TARC and make sure they had a good time. It’s just an amazing accomplishment. I’m really proud of the team.”   To achieve victory, the team Rylie Martin, 16, Ashton Croft, 15, Grace Basler, 16, Christopher Carden, 18, Cydney Breler, 18, Timothy Ruesche, 17, Ryan Brown, 17, Ed Bohart, 17, and Joel Marler, 17, had to design and launch a rocket capable of meeting precise engineering standards and mission requirements while protecting a raw egg throughout the flight of the rocket. The top-10 teams divided more than $100,000 in scholarships; the “STEAM-y Rocketry Club” won $20,000 and a trip to the International Rocketry Challenge in June, courtesy of the Raytheon Company.   “Our Team America Rocketry Challenge winners and all the students who competed demonstrated great skill, determination and spirit today,” said Aerospace Industries Association President and CEO David F. Melcher. “We'll be rooting for our champions to keep the international title with the US for the third consecutive year. We're very proud of all the teams that helped make TARC's 15th anniversary a memorable one.” Since 2002, more than 65,000 middle and high school students have experienced hands-on engineering through the award-winning TARC program, developing skills to assist them in careers in STEM and aerospace.   TARC, the aerospace and defense industry's flagship STEM program, is sponsored by the Aerospace Industries Association, the National Association of Rocketry (NAR) and more than 20 industry partners, including the Raytheon Company, the Boeing Company, Lockheed Martin Corporation and Thales USA.   “This is the 12th year that Raytheon has sponsored the Team America Rocketry Challenge, and each year we find the level of individual and collective team commitment to be truly inspiring,” said Thomas A. Kennedy, Raytheon Chairman and CEO. “As the rocket scientists of tomorrow, the young competitors exude an enthusiasm that is every bit as important as their knowledge and use of STEM. Together, you see the promise of leadership for our next-generation workforce and the technology advancements of the future.”   Topical Tags :  Events    Analysis/Reports    Manufacturing    Launch    Systems      Regional Tags :  North America                     FREE SUBSCRIPTION Today's Top News The Heights Dynamic Network Access Technology from Comtech Telecommunications Corp. is Now Available SpaceX Sends Inmarsat-5 Soaring Into Space ...

New Amazon office building to include homeless shelter | Bangkok Post: business News Business Video Photos Opinion Lifestyle Auto Jobs Property Travel Learning Tech More BUSINESS Log in Sign up Web search MENU Search Switch Archive Today's paper DIGITAL VERSION SIGN IN About E-Newspaper Subscribe Report problem Free Trial HOME DELIVERY Business homepage Business news Telecom Finance Tourism & transport Find company & suppliers Exchange rates More World Gold prices IT Auto Property Business > World New Amazon office building to include homeless shelter 15 May 2017 at 10:50 1,553 viewed0 comments WRITER: NEW YORK TIMES A former motel where Amazon.com allowed homeless families to stay in Settle. (The New York Times) - + SEATTLE, Washington -- A year ago, when Amazon.com let a homeless shelter for families move into a former motel it owned, it was viewed as a nice but fleeting gesture. The motel was on a chunk of downtown property where Amazon planned to eventually erect yet another set of sparkling buildings to meet its insatiable need for office space in this city, where it has come to embody both the region’s economic boom and its struggles with affordability. The hotel would be torn down and the shelter kicked out when that time came. Instead, Amazon has decided to let the shelter stay. In an unusual arrangement, the company has agreed to give the shelter, Mary’s Place, a permanent home inside one of the new office buildings for which it will break ground in the autumn. Amazon will give roughly half of the six-storey building to the shelter, providing it with 47,000 square feet (4,366 square metres) of space with private rooms that can hold 65 families, or about 220 people and their pets. The facility, expected to open in early 2020, will have its own entrance and elevators. “I see it as this huge gift because everywhere we go, we end up leaving,” said Marty Hartman, the executive director of Mary’s Place, which runs seven transitional shelters around the Seattle area meant to house families until they can find permanent homes. “You come in and become a fabric of the neighbourhood you’re in, and then you say goodbye. That’s a hard thing for a lot of people to do.” In an interview at the current Mary’s Place site owned by Amazon, which was bustling with families returning to the shelter for the evening, John Schoettler, Amazon’s vice president for global real estate and facilities, said the company would spend “tens of millions of dollars” on the design and construction of the shelter’s portion of the building. Amazon will pay the utilities for Mary’s Place, which will occupy the space rent free, although the organisation will continue to pay its own staff. Schoettler said Amazon originally allowed the shelter to stay in the motel because of the severity of Seattle’s homelessness crisis, which had prompted the city’s mayor to declare a state of emergency in 2015. He said Amazon was impressed by Mary’s Place, and he described its plan to give the shelter a permanent home as an investment in the neighbourhood. In San Francisco, Google, Salesforce.com and others have funded a campaign to find permanent housing for homeless people. But Nan Roman, president of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, a non-profit advocacy group in Washington, DC, said she was unaware of any other private corporation integrating a homeless shelter into its building. “Too often, homelessness gets pushed to the other side of the tracks,” Roman said. “Keeping them as neighbours is nice.” In Seattle, the plan could also help burnish Amazon’s image, which has taken some hits. It has been targeted by anti-gentrification activists, and its high-pressure work culture was the subject of a New York Times investigation two years ago. Amazon has also been bashed for being disengaged from civic life relative to local stalwarts known for their philanthropic giving, like Boeing Co, Microsoft Corp and Starbucks Corp. More recently, that has begun to change, with gifts like Amazon’s $10 million donation for the construction of a new computer science building at the University of Washington. “Its reputation in Seattle has certainly suffered,” said Alan Durning, executive director of Sightline Institute, a non-profit research organisation focused on the Pacific Northwest. “Doing things like this may be in its enlightened self-interest, right on site for the world to see.” Amazon is also a different company from just a few years ago. It has 30,000 employees in the city, making it Seattle’s largest private employer, and it has transformed large swaths of the downtown and South Lake Union neighbourhoods. While the company not long ago consistently lost money, Amazon now regularly turns a profit thanks to its lucrative cloud-computing business, giving it more financial breathing room for activities like philanthropy. Seattle’s homelessness crisis has also worsened, with tent encampments sprouting up by the side of freeways, under bridges and in parks. The surrounding King County area had the third-largest homeless population in the country last year, after New York and Los Angeles, according to an annual report to Congress by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. More than 10,000 people are homeless in the area, with more than 4,000 of them living on the streets, the Seattle/King County Coalition on Homelessness estimated in a report last year. One of the residents of Mary’s Place, Patricia Abbott, a mother of four, said she became homeless after losing her job when her son was injured and she needed to tend to his medical needs. She has been at the facility for six months and learned of Amazon’s support for the organisation at the shelter’s Christmas party when she received an American Girl doll for one of her children from the company. “There’s people out there who really do care,” Abbott said. Schoettler said he proposed the plan to let the shelter remain at a meeting in January of Amazon’s senior leadership, including Jeff Bezos, the company’s chief executive. “It’s permanent,” Schoettler said, pausing for a moment before adding, “Until homelessness is solved.” RECOMMENDED STORIES Top oil producers want supply cuts extended Gold prices stable at B20,200 Resilient Star Alliance sets off on digital voyage Hotel group optimistic on safari bookings in Kenya THAI takes revenue hit from fuel Pruksa joins DHL to cut overhead Next auction for state-held rice called Urban Hospitality plans B400m hotel in Phloenchit Ad outlays continue skid amid cost cuts Most Viewed 101,555 Facebook faces immediate shutdown ... 35,822 Facebook told to remove posts or ... 22,266 Toyota's new SUV C-HR becomes ... 16,080 Ransomware: Once lucky, more on the ... 15,011 AoT won't scrap King Power contract Recent BUSINESS Articles SET up 8.54 to 1,545.96 at midday Thailand's April tourist arrivals up 7% - ministry SET opens down 0.57 to 1,536.85 at opening Do you like the content of this article?

A team of higher authorities of Airport Authority of India (AAI) and other security agencies is expected here within 10 days to finalise the proposal on expansion. Major issue for discussion on the proposal with district administration will be land acquisition and also the alignment of Varanasi-Lucknow four-lane highway. After going through the files on runway expansion in a meeting with the officials of Airport Authority of India (AAI) and National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) on Saturday evening, district magistrate Yogeshwar Ram Mishra said that over 500 acres of land would be required for the expansion of runway. The acquisition of land would be done in two phases. National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has two options. One is to change the alignment of Varanasi-Lucknow highway by diverting it towards Basani from Babatpur. The other is to construct it under the expanded runway. The director of LBS International Airport Anil Kumar Rai said that all the aspects of the proposal of runway expansion are being reviewed. According to AAI officials, the expansion of runway was proposed in Masterplan-2004 of the authority. Due to railway track on the eastern side of the runway, the AAI has the only option to expand the runway towards western side, where Varanasi-Lucknow highway NH-56 exists. The NHAI has already started the project of upgrading this NH-56 to four-lane highway. To expand the runway, the AAI sought 593.77 acres of land at Mangari, Baikunthpur, Karmi, Ghamhapur Karmi, Sagunaha and Pura Raghunathpur villages. Due to protest by the farmers, the proposal was put on backburner before 2012 assembly polls. After formation of Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government at Centre in 2014, the AAI restarted efforts to materialise the project in 2015. During his August 17, 2015 visit to the city, the minister of civil aviation P Ashok Gajapathi Raju had made clear the approach of the Union government that apart from improving connectivity at LBS Airport by increasing facility for air travel on domestic and international routes, the government is also focusing on cargo service here. But AAI officials believe that without expansion of runway, beginning Boeing and cargo flights from this airport is impossible. Before the visit of minister, the AAI had sent a letter to state government on March 27, 2015 through the director civil aviation, UP to seek 593.77 acres of land for the expansion. After that, the district administration sought a report from chief revenue officer and special land acquisition officer (SLO) regarding availability of land for the expansion plan. In reply, the SLO made it clear that it will start the process to acquire land for airport expansion only after getting instructions from the state government. The files of the expansion of runway were then left to bite the dust. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

Save but for an early Thursday sell-off that was eventually wiped out by that day’s close, there was little market action to write home about. And yet this calm in the major averages masked what was still a week full of headlines in the business and political worlds. Snap’s (SNAP) first quarterly earnings report as a public company missed expectations and the stock tanked. Retail names got decimated as Nordstrom (JWN), Macy’s (M), J.C. Penney (JCP), and Kohl’s (KSS) all plummeted after earnings. The XRT ETF which tracks the retail sector lost almost 3% during the week. Meanwhile, the week’s biggest economic data points — retail sales and inflation in April — missed expectations, while consumer confidence topped estimates. And President Donald Trump tweeted. And fired FBI director James Comey. View photos This week, the economic calendar is almost barren, with only a few pieces of housing market data worth noting early on. The political schedule, as always, remains unpredictable, but markets have more or less moved on. Major earnings reports due out this week will still keep the spotlight on retail and the U.S. consumer. Headline reports expected out are from Home Depot (HD), Walmart (WMT), TJ Maxx parent TJX (TJX), The Gap (GPS), Ross Stores (ROST), and Ralph Lauren (RL). Major tech earnings next week include Cisco (CSCO) and salesforce.com (CRM). We noted at the beginning of April that the “Trump trade” had evaporated in markets and that in time investors would return to focusing on things like earnings and economic growth. And here we are. Influential finance writer and CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management Josh Brown went even further in a post published on Friday, however. “There never was a real ‘Trump Trade,'” Brown wrote. “I’m sorry if this is like hearing there’s no Santa Claus.” And as we wrote this week, the idea that a major tax cut will boost economic growth the way the administration hopes is likely misguided anyway. Through time, markets will get excited about lots of things — political shifts, new economic paradigms, wars, etc. Many of these fail to knock stocks off a long-term trajectory of moving higher, usually.

What corporate America is saying We’re almost done with first quarter earnings reports. According to Goldman Sachs’ new quarterly “Beige Book” — styled on the Federal Reserve’s collection of economic anecdotes published under the same name — the U.S. corporate sector during the first quarter saw three major trends get the most commentary from executives: growth, regulation, and labor costs. “Management teams were mixed in their assessment of whether a much-discussed rekindling of animal spirits since the election has led to a tangible increase in demand,” Goldman writes. “Most management teams recognized an improvement in sentiment and growth expectations, but many said they have not yet seen evidence that improving sentiment is translating into increased business activity.” Read More In the first quarter, GDP growth came in at just 0.7%, a disappointing print after the economy grew at its slowest pace in five years in 2016. After the election, we noted that the term “animal spirits,” or a boost in confidence among corporates, was permeating commentary across the business sector. The problem with animal spirits is that until decisions are made to actually invest more money, hire more workers, or buy other businesses, they remain just spirits. Or as executives at AT&T (T) said on their first quarter call, “U.S. business investment as a percent of GDP continues to be low. Growth expectations in the economy have been rising, but we’ve yet to see that translate into economic gains or demand… the near-term view is cautious.” View photos AT&T Inc. CEO Randall StephensonMore The story on regulation was much the same as economic growth: we’re hearing a lot about it, but not sure how much that will mean for business. “We would have expected sometime over the last couple weeks to have gotten clarity,” said Visa executives during their call held in late April. “There was supposed to be clarity no later than the end of March on the next chapter of regulation or guidance in terms of how things would have to go forward. And there hasn’t been, and we’ve been told that it will be delayed likely into early May.” On Friday, the Trump administration announced that the U.S. and China agreed to take steps by mid-July to, among other things, allow more access for U.S. companies to provide credit rating services in China. This deal could help Visa. Other industries, however, did see concrete changes on deregulation, with executives at Boeing (BA) saying, “The overall focus on deregulation and simplifying processes is one that we’ve been a strong proponent for. And the administration has been very engaged across government agencies and with industry to find ideas and ways and opportunities to simplify and streamline. Things like FAA certification processes is one place that we’re seeing some solid progress.” A dominant economic theme over the last couple years has been the increase in wages for U.S. workers. And while wage increases are still disappointing to some economists, corporates are definitely starting to see the effects on their bottom lines, with Goldman writing that a “growing chorus” of corporate executives noted the increase in labor costs during the first quarter. Both American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV) noted higher labor costs, with American executives saying, “Once you start making money, you’ll give more to labor than you did when you were making less money, and they’ll take some of the upside that should go to shareholders… This is getting to a level of compensation across the industry that needed to occur.” View photos Commentary from hospital operator Universal Health Services (UHS), however, perhaps sounds most like what economists looking for signs of inflation would be on the lookout for. “The current expense load does incorporate some investment in solving the labor shortage problem,” the firm said, “meaning in wage increases in certain markets that we’ve had to make to be competitive.” And that’s really what’s at the crux of wage increases: can you maintain competitiveness at your current talent level and rate of turnover, or will it take something else for your firm to be competitive? — Myles Udland is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

They defeated the top 100 teams from across the United States, to win the world's largest rocket contest. Experience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/7941251-aerospace-team-america-rocketry-challenge/ "After we won, most of us weren't sure whether we wanted to scream or run eight miles because that's how much energy we had," said 16-year-old Grace Basler, who was participating in TARC for the first time. Devin Lorenz, 24, led the team as mentor and sponsor and is also a TARC alumnus from the Festus High School TARC team that finished runner up in the 2009 Final Fly-off. "I'm amazed," said Lorenz. "I didn't even consider this a possibility. We wanted to get them to TARC and make sure they had a good time. It's just an amazing accomplishment. I'm really proud of the team." To achieve victory, the team Rylie Martin, 16, Ashton Croft, 15, Grace Basler, 16, Christopher Carden, 18, Cydney Breier, 18, Timothy Ruesche, 17, Ryan Brown, 17, Ed Bohnert, 17, and Joel Marler, 17, had to design and launch a rocket capable of meeting precise engineering standards and mission requirements while protecting a raw egg throughout the flight of the rocket. The top-10 teams divided more than $100,000 in scholarships; the "STEAM-y Rocketry Club" won $20,000 and a trip to the International Rocketry Challenge in June, courtesy of the Raytheon Company. "Our Team America Rocketry Challenge winners and all the students who competed demonstrated great skill, determination and spirit today," said Aerospace Industries Association President and CEO David F. Melcher. "We'll be rooting for our champions to keep the international title with the U.S. for the third consecutive year. We're very proud of all the teams that helped make TARC's 15th anniversary a memorable one." Since 2002, more than 65,000 middle and high school students have experienced hands-on engineering through the award-winning TARC program, developing skills to assist them in careers in STEM and aerospace. TARC, the aerospace and defense industry's flagship STEM program, is sponsored by the Aerospace Industries Association, the National Association of Rocketry (NAR) and more than 20 industry partners, including the Raytheon Company, the Boeing Company, Lockheed Martin Corporation and Thales USA. "This is the 12th year that Raytheon has sponsored the Team America Rocketry Challenge, and each year we find the level of individual and collective team commitment to be truly inspiring," said Thomas A. Kennedy, Raytheon Chairman and CEO. "As the rocket scientists of tomorrow, the young competitors exude an enthusiasm that is every bit as important as their knowledge and use of STEM. Together, you see the promise of leadership for our next-generation workforce and the technology advancements of the future."

It was the sixth of more than 20 missions SpaceX plans to fly this year. Perched on top of the two-stage rocket was the 13,400-lb. (6,100 kilograms) Inmarsat-5 F4 communications satellite, the heaviest spacecraft yet to be delivered by a Falcon booster into a geostationary transfer orbit some 22,300 miles (35,800 km) above Earth. [Photos: SpaceX Launches Inmarsat-5 F4 Satellite] The satellite separated from the Falcon 9's second stage right on time, about 32 minutes after liftoff. "It's been a great afternoon and evening," said SpaceX mission commentator John Insprucker. "All you can ask for today." Getting F4 into its intended orbit emptied the Falcon's fuel tanks, leaving no propellant for the booster's first stage to attempt a landing on either a drone barge or the ground. The Falcon 9 rocket and Inmarsat-5 F4 satellite continue to climb into the Florida skies on May 15, 2017. Credit: SpaceX So far, 10 Falcon 9 first stages have returned intact after launching, including one rocket that has now flown twice. SpaceX plans to launch a second used rocket next month for satellite operator Bulgaria Sat. Inmarsat, which is flying for the first time with SpaceX, had hoped to have its $250 million F4 satellite in orbit last year, but the flight was delayed after a Falcon 9 exploded on the launch pad as it was being fueled for a preflight engine test on Sept. 1. The delay cost SpaceX a second launch contract with London-based Inmarsat, which instead hired European competitor Arianespace for a mission now slated to fly in late June aboard an Ariane 5 rocket. SpaceX, which has now flown the Falcon 9 six times successfully since the launch pad accident, has a backlog of more than 70 missions, worth more than $10 billion. Inmarsat has an option for another future flight with SpaceX. Inmarsat-5 F4 completes the company's four-member, $1.6 billion broadband satellite constellation called Global Xpress, which provides global, mobile communications for airlines, ships, government agencies and other customers. The fifth-generation satellites, which were built by Boeing, provide downlink communication speeds of up to 50 megabits per second and uplink speeds of up to 5 megabits per second for customers on land, at sea or in the air, Inmarsat said in a press release. That speed is about 100 times faster than Inmarsat's previous-generation system provided. Customers for the Global Xpress' inflight Wi-Fi services include Lufthansa Group and Austrian Airlines. The previous three satellites in the network were launched aboard Russian Proton rockets in 2013 and 2015. Follow us @Spacedotcom, Facebook or Google+. Originally published on Space.com.

The new hacking tool also exploits weaknesses in older versions of Microsoft Windows software and was stolen from the US National Security Agency, like the stolen tool that formed the basis of last week’s WannaCry attack. The tool, called EsteemAudit, has been adapted and is now available for criminal use, analysts told the Financial Times. The leak raises the prospect of another wave of cyber attacks. Marcus Hutchins, aka MalwareTech, helped stop the cyber attack that has caused severe disruption to the NHS. Britain’s cyber spies are calling on the skills of bedroom computer whiz kids to battle the ransomware threat which has struck more than 150 countries and crippled parts of the NHS. Amateur cyber security experts and freelance enthusiasts such as the 22-year-old surfer credited with helping stop Friday’s attack are being courted by government intelligence agencies to work alongside their own in-house experts. Security sources told the Telegraph they were working with Marcus Hutchins, who uses the name MalwareTech, and others to try to stop the spread of the WannaCry ransomware attack. Spy agencies such as GCHQ and its offshoot, the National Cyber Security Centre, have a policy of reaching out to leaders in the cyber security field who may be working alone and not necessarily for large companies, or the Government. About | Ransomware One source said: “We work with a lot of different people. Some of those are people that you wouldn’t necessarily expect us, or large organisations, to work with. “Because of the nature of our business, we need to reach out to these bright young things and get their expertise. “We do it a lot because these people understand it more than perhaps some of the older generation. So that’s why we work with the likes of MalwareTech and these people have contacts with the National Cyber Security Centre.” o2amM3YjE6eO5nN7Z2sjOVuOnOjYYDlr Conor McKenna, a computer security expert at the University of Birmingham, said that many of the most gifted people in the field preferred to work alone, or in the private sector, rather than for government. Reaching out to them was “a fantastic way of getting these young individuals who understand the code probably better than most individuals”. He said most computer "hackers" were wrongly portrayed as criminals, when in fact many of them wanted to test their skills against computer systems to expose flaws and weaknesses. A security source said the hackers do not get paid and do not get access to classified information. He said: "They do it for altruism and for the kudos of working with us." Mr Hutchins, from Devon, has been credited with stopping the WannaCry attack from spreading across the globe by accidentally triggering a "kill switch". The self-taught expert who has emerged as the accidental hero of the global cyber attack is understood to have stopped the incident escalating  from a small bedroom in his parents' house. In a blog, he described how he stopped the spread of the virus by purchasing a web domain for £8 and by redirecting it elsewhere. He reportedly shouted "eureka" when he realised he had unintentionally halted to spread of the criminal software. Last night, his mother said she was ''very proud'' of her son and that he was in London “at a meeting”. Meanwhile it emerged that new helicopters, stealth fighters and submarine-hunting patrol planes being purchased by the UK from America could all be vulnerable to cyber attack. The latest report by a Pentagon equipment watchdog found that testing had found Apache helicopters being bought by the British Army have “potentially significant cybersecurity deficiencies”. Boeing P8 maritime patrol planes being bought for the RAF to replace the axed Nimrod fleet, have “a collection of exploitable cybersecurity vulnerabilities”. The Operational Test and Evaluation office of the Pentagon also said that the F-35 stealth fighter’s systems had not been properly tested for cyber attack. A logistics system that automatically connects to the new aircraft to ensure new parts and fuel are ordered when needed, could be hacked, it said. A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said: “The MOD takes cyber security extremely seriously. All equipment and systems are rigorously tested before entering and throughout their service so that vulnerabilities are identified and eliminated.” Share this article Follow Telegraph News Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram View comments If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Please review our commenting policy Follow Telegraph News Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Related Topics Cyber attacks Boeing NHS GCHQ University of Birmingham The Pentagon Ministry of Defence British Army Show more Galleries Gallery 16 May 2017, 7:03am Gallery: Pictures of the Day: 16 May 2017 Gallery 15 May 2017, 5:35pm Gallery: Telegraph cartoons, May 2017 Gallery 15 May 2017, 4:58pm Gallery: Matt cartoons, May 2017  Premium News latest 16 May 2017, 8:00am 'Best clue yet' links North Korea to global cyber attack 16 May 2017, 7:41am Moors Murderer Ian Brady dies aged 79 and takes secret of final victim's burial with him Gallery 16 May 2017, 7:19am Gallery: Little Boy Blue: how much do the cast look like the real Rhys Jones and Sean Mercer? 16 May 2017, 7:18am Little Boy Blue episode 4 review: A powerful climax to Rhys Jones's tragic story 5 16 May 2017, 7:18am Little Boy Blue: What really happened during the trial of Rhys Jones's killer Sean Mercer?

The museum, off Airport Road in Huntsville, is open Wednesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. (Photo Credit: Skip Vaughn, USAG Redstone ) VIEW ORIGINAL REDSTONE ARSENAL, Ala. -- Seventy years ago this Friday, June 6, Harold McMurran was in a landing ship tank with other American Soldiers about to go ashore to liberate France from Nazi occupation. He was a 19-year-old Soldier just shy of his 20th birthday June 10. He recalled the scene from D-Day, June 6, 1944. "I landed on Utah Beach," the New Market resident said. "I went in behind the 4th Infantry. What wave it was, I don't have no idea. They talk about waves; I don't know if anybody knew. They just went in one after the other and they got mixed up going in. "It was sometime around 7 o'clock in the morning. Well, it was a horrible day. I mean it's hard to describe what went on, what you saw and how you felt. I had three modes that I went through. First, I was scared; then I was afraid; then I was numb. It didn't make any difference. "It was bullets flying all around, artillery shells bursting all around. And there were people lying in front of you. Some wounded, some dead. The next bullet may be for you. Have you ever seen the movie 'The Longest Day'? In my estimation, that's the most accurate." McMurran is a native of Dora, which was mainly a coal mining town back then. He was the oldest and lone son of three children of William McMurran, a railroad conductor who got coal from the coal mines. He was a member of the 546th Ordnance Company, a 275-member unit which was supposed to retrieve damaged heavy equipment on D-Day. "I think it took three LSTs (landing ship tanks) to hold us. Mine was the first that went in," he recalled. During the battlefield chaos, when the Germans would aim their weapons on those seeking damaged tanks and other heavy equipment, the unit's mission shifted from Ordnance to infantry. "So we gave up as an Ordnance outfit, we became infantry," McMurran said. That day, McMurran recalled, the Soldiers barely got off the beach because the Germans had hedgerows as barriers. "It took us six weeks to fight through those hedgerows," he said. He and his companions became part of Gen. George Patton's Third Army. During the worst winter he can remember, he fought in the Battle of the Bulge. From Dec. 16, 1944, to Jan. 25, 1945, this was a major German offensive campaign launched through the densely forested Ardennes region of Wallonia in Belgium, France and Luxembourg on the Western Front toward the end of World War II in Europe. "And there was more men incapacitated from frozen feet in the Battle of the Bulge than was wounded by the Germans," he said. He avoided this by keeping dry socks in the waist of his uniform; and when his feet got wet, he'd put on the dry socks. After that fateful battle, his unit was shipped to Marseille, France, a staging point to go to the Pacific to fight the Japanese. But the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki ended the war. "They loaded us on a victory ship 26 December '45," McMurran said, "and shipped us home." He has a battle star from two of WWII's most important battles, D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge, and he recently received the Legion of Honor from the French government. He and his wife of 67 years, Ruth, have three children -- Melisa Dougherty of Phoenix, Arizona, Dian Collins of Jonesboro, Arkansas, and son Scott of Madison -- nine grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration as an air frame and power plant mechanic, he retired from Boeing in 1990 as a tool design engineer. McMurran was asked his thoughts on the 70th anniversary of D-Day. "Well, I have not given it much thought. Except if we hadn't done our job, they'd be a lot of people in a lot worse shape speaking Japanese or German," he said, his voice cracking with emotion. "I don't have much of a message for the ones of us that are left, but I hope that our next generations does not have to do what we had to do."

Bob Marion, the Army's senior aviation acquisition officer, speaks at the Program Executive Office for Aviation's change of charter Jan. 24. (Photo Credit: Program Executive Office for Aviation photo) VIEW ORIGINAL The Program Executive Office for Aviation saw several big changes and accomplishments in the last year, starting with the PEO Aviation change of charter from Maj. Gen. Tim Crosby to Brig. Gen. Bob Marion on Jan. 24. The event was followed by a retirement ceremony for Crosby. Marion was promoted to brigadier general on the same day. Now after a year as the PEO, Marion stresses the importance of stewardship and urges the aviation community to remain steadfast in accomplishing Army aviation's top priorities. Army aviation saw its peak relevance during Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom, proving that it is a critical enabler to ground forces. It has flown nearly 7 million flight hours since the beginning of OIF and OEF, and remains the Army's largest portfolio. "Those dollars that are reflected in the Army aviation portfolio are really reflections on your ability to get to the finish line," Marion said to the aviation community. And so, as the calendar year wraps up, let's take a look at some of the organization's highlights and achievements through the eyes of Army aviation's project management offices. Apache helicopters Team Apache saw several milestones this year starting with the successful completion of the Follow On Test and Evaluation in August at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida with the 1/25thh Aviation Regiment Battalion, the Army's second unit equipped with the E model Apaches. A simultaneous rotation at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, also took place with the same unit that subsequently deployed in the Pacific Theater as part of the Rim of the Pacific exercise. The AH-64E Apache has flown more than 15,000 flight hours and has exceeded expectations in performance and operational readiness rates in theater. Combined with the D model Apaches, the world's most lethal combat helicopter has flown more than 4 million hours. Earlier this year, the project office signed contracts for the third and fourth lots of E-model Apaches, which brought the program to full rate production. To date 89 have been fielded. The Army's program of record remains at 690 aircraft. Apache Project Office also saw leadership change during a change of charter from Lt. Col. Steven Van Riper to Lt. Col. Louis King as the product director for Apache sensors in July. Unmanned aircraft systems UAS Project Office continues to provide stellar unmanned aircraft system support to the war fighters, while surpassing the 2 million flight hour landmark, as well as achieving other critical milestones in 2014. In June, the Shadow RQ-7B, which has surpassed 920,000 flight hours, underwent Follow-On Test and Evaluation testing. A monumental achievement for the Shadow team, it proved out the concept of the onboard Tactical Data Link capabilities for this workhorse of the Army's UAS fleet. In late August, the first ever Family-of-Systems testing was conducted in labs and flight lines in California, Maryland and Alabama. The overall assessment of the testing and the Manned-Unmanned Teaming functionality was very positive from everyone involved. A number of firsts were successfully accomplished during the testing including the first time that an Apache controlled the flight and payload of the Shadow UAS while it was in flight. With the Army's Aviation Restructuring Initiative, the Shadow UAS becomes part of not only the Brigade Combat Teams, but will now be a key combat multiplier in the Combat Aviation Brigades. The team has just fielded Shadow platoons in the first CAB and will continue fielding 2-3 Shadow platoons per month for the next few years. In mid-December, the first ever Ground Based Sense and Avoid radar system was installed at Fort Hood, Texas. Utility Helicopters The Utility Helicopters Project Office celebrated the Army's acceptance of the 300th UH-72A Lakota during a rollout ceremony at Airbus Helicopters production facility in Columbus, Miss. in May. The 300th Lakota aircraft marks a major milestone for the Army, with the program having been consistently executed on time and on budget. Through the ARI, the Army has decided that the UH-72A Lakota will be the Army's training helicopter and will replace the aging TH-67 and OH-58A/C fleet that are obsolete. Also in May, the project office hosted a foreign military sales visit, hosting representatives from 16 countries. The visit originated from the growing interest of the countries to purchase utility aircraft using the FMS program. In June, the Project Office handed over the logbook and keys for three UH-60A Black Hawk aircraft to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation during an aircraft exchange/sale -- also known as the Black Hawk Exchange and Sales Transaction or BEST. It is one of the ways the Army is divesting A model Black Hawks out of the inventory. Additionally, the project office is moving forward with the Army's UH-60V Black Hawk program, which upgrades the L models to have digitized cockpits with electronic displays. The UH-60V will have the feel of an M model, and provides essential operational capability at the most affordable cost, maximizing value to the American taxpayer. It also avoids $1.5 billion in new procurement costs over UH-60L aircraft by leveraging the stable UH-60 RECAP program at the Corpus Christi Army Depot. Cargo helicopters The Cargo Helicopter Project Office is planning a block upgrade strategy to the CH-47F Chinook designed to affordably maintain platform relevance through the planned service life of 2060. A cornerstone of the first block upgrade, known as Block II, is to the rotor blade system -- the Advanced Chinook Rotor Blade -- which will significantly improve the performance of the helicopter in high-hot atmospheric conditions. The PM is also exploring a fuel system modification that improves reliability and allows for 80 additional gallons of fuel. "We're really looking to key in on value propositions where we can," Col. Rob Barrie, project manager for Cargo Helicopters, said. The Army is conducting an analysis to determine the appropriate technologies to carry forward into the Block II program. The project office is seeking approval to enter the acquisition process in early 2015. The Cargo project office successfully auctioned 14 CH-47D Chinooks on the General Services Administration website in 2014. Proceeds from the sales go toward the procurement of new F model Chinooks for the Army. To date, the GSA sales raised $35 million while providing the American taxpayer significant savings to demilitarize those aircraft. Aviation systems 2014 saw the Aviation Systems Project Office working hard to modernize many of the 50-plus products in its portfolio. Since June, the project office began fielding the new Common Aviation Tool System to five Combat Aviation Brigades and two state Army Reserve National Guard units. When fielding is complete in fiscal 2017, all New Aviation Tool System tool kits, which was fielded in the 1990s, will be out of the Army inventory. The project office continues to provide Air Traffic Navigation, Integration, Coordination System Block 6 upgrade training to Air Traffic Control units around the globe; Block 6 incorporates a KG-175 into the ATNAVICS for Information Assurance. The Centralized Aviation Flight Records System began fielding version 4, which incorporates the Individual Aircrew Training Folder into each record. And thanks to an intense testing schedule, the APX-123 transponder earned the Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System, Identification Friend or Foe, Mark XII/XIIA (AIMS) Program Office certification for the AH-64D, AH-64E, UH/HH-60M and A/MH-6M platforms. Consequently the Army was the first service to declare initial operation capability for Mode 5, a full six months sooner than initially planned. Armed scout helicopter As part of the ARI, the Army decided to divest its OH-58D Kiowa Warrior fleet and cancel the associated upgrade programs to repurpose approximately $1.8 billion for critical Army aviation modernization programs and training. The Armed Scout Helicopters Project Office is executing the divestment mission for OH-58D KWs, OH-58A/Cs and the TH-67 training helicopters. After receiving the Execution Order on April 4, the OH-58 KW divestment team immediately began implementing the Army's guidance. Twenty-six KWs from the 6th Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment at Fort Wainwright, Alaska, were identified as the first OH-58Ds to be divested. The next group of 29 KWs were divested from Fort Rucker on Oct. 27. These aircraft are now in non-flyable status undergoing divestment screening at the AMARG, the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group, the storage facility located at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona. Approximately 336 KWs are scheduled to be divested from the Army, which will take roughly five years to complete. Non-standard rotary wing aircraft The Non-Standard Rotary Wing Aircraft Project Office is responsible for the successful procurement, fielding and sustainment of non-standard rotorcraft for DoD and partner nations as directed by OSD in support of Security Force Assistance missions. In the four years since formally being chartered, the project office has delivered 118 new helicopters to Iraq, Afghanistan and other partner nations on schedule and within cost. The project office's successful performance has ensured that all aircraft in which Americans and its allies fly are dependable, airworthy and safe. Although the project office's initial focus was the procurement and sustainment of Mi-17s helicopters, the emphasis has now shifted to partnering with U.S. aviation industry and original equipment manufacturers. By forging and strengthening ties with the U.S. aviation industry, everyone benefits; the buyer (partner nation) receives a government-to-government contract and program management, industry receives increased sales and the Army strengthens its military-to-military ties with the new owner through training opportunities and increased equipment interoperability and ultimately enable strategic goals of the United States. Fixed wing The past year saw several developments within the Fixed Wing Project Office. In July, during a change of charter ceremony, the office welcomed Col. Steve Clark as the new project manager. The Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System Acquisition Category II program of record made great progress during 2014. The fiscal 2014 National Defense Authorization Act directed the Army to leverage existing Quick Reaction Capability aircraft fielded in support of overseas contingency operations and integrate them with the four Boeing built engineering and manufacturing aircraft to achieve the Army's procurement objective of 24 EMARSS aircraft. EMARSS provides the Army with the ability to detect, locate, identify and track surface targets, day or night, in almost any weather condition and provides Soldiers with ISR capabilities with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy. Another aerial ISR POR, Airborne Reconnaissance Low is undergoing modernization by means of aircraft replacement and updated primary mission equipment. The Army will capitalize on the modernization strategy by repurposing existing quick reaction capability aircraft to replace the current legacy fleet. The ARL program of record was validated in March 2013 by the vice chief of staff of the Army as an enduring ISR asset. While these ISR programs are taking shape, an endeavor involving transport aircraft is advancing through the acquisition process with the Fixed Wing Utility Aircraft, a retirement and replacement program for the Army's aging C-12 and C-26 transport aircraft fleet. FUA will provide Army forces commanders flexibility in meeting time-sensitive movements of key personnel. In October, the TRADOC Capabilities Manager-Lift released the Capabilities Production Document for worldwide staffing and is under review. As one program begins its service, the mission ends for others. Fixed Wing Project Office began divesting its C-23, C-20 and legacy RC-12 aircraft. The Guardrail fleet of RC-12s, an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, is also being divested. A total of 12 aircraft were divested in 2014 and another seven will be divested by the end of fiscal 2015. Some of these RC-12s have served the Army since 1978 and are being divested to meet the Army's requirements for the 2020 Aerial ISR Strategy. The complexity of Army aviation and the acquisition community can be challenging, and we must adapt to current fiscal realities. But whatever changes, PEO Aviation's mission remains steadfast. The PEO Aviation workforce will always to continue to execute its primary objective: Reduce the burden on our Soldiers and field the finest Army aviation in the world.

Exhibit at NYC's Intrepid Museum News provided by Insitu, Inc. 15 May, 2017, 07:00 ET Share this article BINGEN, Wash., May 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Among its many pioneering moments, ScanEagle was the first unmanned aircraft to operate from a U.S. Navy Destroyer, the first to perform an FAA-approved commercial beyond visual line of sight flight in the United States' National Airspace System and the first to be flown by students pursuing America's first undergraduate degree in Unmanned Aircraft Systems Operations. Now the aircraft joins an impressive collection of historical artifacts and contemporary objects at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in Manhattan. Drones: Is the Sky the Limit? is a temporary exhibit that tells the story of drones, from the earliest attempts to employ unmanned flying machines to the advanced systems of the 21st century and beyond. In addition to hands-on opportunities to fly drones and experience the thrill of drone racing, visitors will interact with some of the less conventional ways unmanned aircraft are making their mark on pop culture, including the flying lamp shape drone from Cirque du Soleil's short film Sparked. Insitu ScanEagle joins "Drones: Is the Sky the Limit?"- the first major museum exhibition on pilotless aircraft The exhibit also explores the potential for drones in commercial and civil applications including infrastructure surveillance and precision agriculture, as well as conservation and humanitarian efforts. In service with global militaries since 2004, one of ScanEagle's earliest environmental operations took place in 2010, when Insitu collaborated with the Australian Marine Mammal Centre and researchers from Murdoch University to monitor marine mammals off the Australian coast. Since that time, the aircraft has provided aerial surveillance and information for wildfire, railway, wellhead and pipeline monitoring, as well as search and rescue operations and other applications. "At a time when drone technology is advancing faster than ever, we take great pride in the pioneering work Insitu has done to help shape this path," said Ryan M. Hartman, Insitu president and CEO. "We are honored to have ScanEagle included in an exhibit that celebrates the limitless nature of unmanned aviation."   The exhibit runs through December 3, 2017, and is free with museum admission.

This launch is historic coming from the same launch pad as NASA's final shuttle mission nearly six years ago. The rocket is carrying loads of cargo to the International Space Station.  Marco SantanaContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy A rocket launch from the Space Coast on Monday night marked a rare exception for SpaceX when the company sent a 13,400-pound satellite into space for London-based Inmarsat. SpaceX will not try to land and recover the spent booster after it delivers its payload — a satellite for an international broadband service provider. SpaceX SpaceX launches a 13,400-pound satellite into spaced for London-based Inmarsat. SpaceX launches a 13,400-pound satellite into spaced for London-based Inmarsat. (SpaceX) The reasons behind it had to do with the satellite’s weight, which exceeded 13,000 pounds, and the amount of fuel required to propel the vehicle into space. Because a heavier payload headed up, the rocket did not have the required fuel for a landing attempt. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has explained the reasoning during previous missions. The company has become known for its landings, having successfully landed 10 spent boosters since December 2015. The company for the first time relaunched a recycled booster on March 30. The goal is to make launches cheaper as Musk works toward a mission to Mars. The launch was the first for Inmarsat on a SpaceX rocket. The satellite, known as I-5 F4, represents the fourth satellite in the company’s fifth-generation fleet of satellites. Boeing built it in El Segundo, Calif. The launch came from historic Launch Pad 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center.
