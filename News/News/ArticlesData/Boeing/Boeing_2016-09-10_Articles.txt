During the development of the 787 Dreamliner, Boeing encountered countless engineering hurdles. One of which was the decision to build much of the plane out of carbon fibre reinforced plastics and other composite materials instead of the aluminium most commonly used on commercial airliners. While the engineering of the composite airframe may have been a challenge, it's a decision that allowed Boeing to make a major change to its aircraft that could greatly reduce the effect of jet lag on its passengers. REUTERS Boeing 787 Dreamliner airplane forward fuselages made from carbon fiber composite supplied by Toray Industries, are seen inside Kawasaki Heavy Industries' manufacturing plant in 2015. "The Dreamliner has a composite fuselage and that allowed us to pressurise it at whatever altitude we wanted because the material is not as susceptible to fatigue," Blake Emery, director of differentiation strategy for Boeing's commercial aeroplanes, said.

Currently, most airliners have cabin air pressure equivalent to that of an altitude of 8000 ft. For the Dreamliner, Boeing cut that down to 6000 ft. "To lower the cabin altitude, we actually increased the air pressure inside the cabin," Emery added. "It's a bit counter intuitive for most people." Why does air pressure matter to passengers? ARND WIEGMANN/REUTERS The first class seats aboard an Etihad Airways Boeing 787 Dreamliner passenger jet. For most of us, a long flight is usually followed by some combination of symptoms that include headaches, lack of appetite, lack of energy, nausea, and sleeplessness. Ad Feedback All of these afflictions have been conveniently bundled together with a disruption of one's internal body clock to form something we call jet lag. But the reality is that jet lag is far more serious. YUYA SHINO/REUTERS Employees of All Nippon Airways (ANA) queue in front of the company's Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane after its test flight at Haneda airport in Tokyo April 28, 2013 The very symptoms we attribute to jet lag may actually be attributed to acute mountain sickness, which affects individuals exposed to altitudes above 6500 ft. In a study conducted by Oklahoma State University with the help of Boeing, researchers wrote: "Some passengers on long commercial flights experience discomfort characterised by symptoms similar to those of acute mountain sickness. The symptoms are often attributed to factors such as jet lag, prolonged sitting, dehydration, or contamination of cabin air. However, because barometric pressures in aircraft cabins are similar to those at the terrestrial altitudes at which acute mountain sickness occurs, it is possible that some of the symptoms are related to the decreased partial pressure of oxygen and are manifestations of acute mountain sickness." Roberto Olivares Valenzuela LAN Airlines business class Boeing 787 Dreamliner The study found that passengers who go from sea level up to 8000 ft. of altitude saw the oxygen content in their blood fall 4%. Although this didn't trigger full on acute mountain sickness, it did bring on what the study called "increased prevalence of discomfort after three to nine hours" of exposure. "The research showed passengers' bodies reacted at 6000 ft. similar to that at sea level," Emery said. "So we decided to pressurise the Dreamliner at 6000 ft." At 6000 ft, the cabin air is more dense and has a greater level of oxygen saturation. As result, the body does not have to work as hard to oxygenate blood and sustain itself. Boeing / YouTube Take a peak inside Iron Maiden's own Boeing 747 According to Emery, since there isn't a perfect one-to-one correlation between altitude and jet lag, Boeing has taken additional measures to mitigate the symptoms. These measures include an increase in cabin humidity as well as a new air filtration system. Why haven't we had this all along? The Dreamliner won't be the only Boeing jet to have a have a lower cabin altitude. The company's upcoming 777X wide-body mini-jumbo jet will also be pressurised at 6000 ft. However, unlike the composite Dreamliner, the 777X, Boeing's successor to landmark 777, will be primarily made of aluminium. "Aluminium aircraft can be pressurised to 6,000 ft.," Kent Craver, Boeing's commercial aeroplanes regional director of passenger satisfaction, told Business Insider in an interview. "In fact, most business jets are already pressurised to that level." In addition, Airbus is also working to lower the cabin altitude on its next generation of airliners. Aeroplane makers have traditionally avoided lowering the cabin altitude because boosting the air pressure inside the cabin puts greater stress on aluminium air frames. This increases the likelihood of metal fatigue and shortens the service life of the aeroplane. However, Boeing believes it can successfully lower cabin altitude on the 777X without going to a composite body. "We know the 777 fuselage, its structural qualities, and its fatigue margins really well," a Boeing spokesperson told us in an email. "We also understand the requirements of the lower cabin altitude in terms of cycles and pressures on the fuselage. As a result, we can achieve it with a few local reinforcements and change those loads out to accommodate lower cabin altitude." The Boeing 777X is set to enter service in 2019.

We'll find out. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Sep 11, 2016 at 2:13PM ANTONOV'S FLYING BARN -- THE AN-225 MRIYA. IMAGE SOURCE: MIKE FREER VIA WIKIMEDIA COMMONS. "Antonov Aviation Concern" is dead. Long live "the Antonov Company." That was the upshot of our article earlier this year detailing the trials and tribulations of the several subsidiaries of Ukrainian aerospace giant Antonov Aviation -- including the subsidiary that built and still operates the country's gigantic An-225 Mriya flying barn. (Actually, "Mriya" translates as "dream" -- but you've seen the picture. This thing is big.) All together now: How big is it? According to published statistics, the Antonov An-225 Mriya measures 276 feet in length with a 290-foot wingspan. It stands 54 feet tall, can lift 1.4 million pounds (including its own weight), and within its capacious hold has space for 46,000 cubic feet of cargo. It's strong enough to carry an entire Russian Buran-class space shuttle piggybacked atop it -- which in fact, was the purpose for which the An-225 was designed. Or it can carry a 200-ton natural gas generator or wind turbine (among its common uses ), or 33 fully grown African bull elephants  internally. It is, quite simply, the largest and most powerful transport aircraft on the planet -- bigger than Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 747 freighter, or Airbus' (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) gigantic A380 -- and has been so for nearly three decades. And now the An-225 is going back into production. From Ukraine with love Last month, IHS Jane's relayed the news that Antonov had signed a deal to license the designs and technologies needed to build the An-225 to the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AICC), for production within China. (Note: AICC may not be the same company as the "Aviation Industry Corporation of China" that is better known by the acronym "AVIC." Some sources suggest that despite the identical English translations of their names, these are actually two separate businesses.) In any case, whichever company it is acting through, China has agreed to assist Antonov in completing an incomplete An-225, on which production was halted in 2001. First flight on that one is expected to take place in 2019, at which point the population of operable Mriyas in the world will instantly double. Subsequently, production will shift to a new factory in Sichuan Province in China, which will commence churning out brand-new, modernized versions of the plane by the mid-2020s -- and in volume. What it means to investors Preeminent in the pantheon of global planemakers, Boeing's 747-8F transport is currently only the second biggest transport aircraft in the world. Its 138-ton payload capacity, while impressive, is quite simply dwarfed by the 200-ton payload of Antonov's An-225. An Airbus A380 freighter would probably outclass the Boeing 747-8F in both payload capacity and cargo volume -- but there isn't an A380 freighter variant on the market today. And as for Lockheed's C-5M, its payload is arguably comparable to that of Boeing's 747 -- but the C-5M is a purely military bird, which limits both the size of its market and the size of the profits it can generate for Lockheed. That leaves the race for the title of "world's biggest civilian freighter" a contest solely between Boeing and Antonov. To date, it's a contest that Antonov has won handily. But it's also a contest Antonov has only won technically. While the An-225 is certainly much bigger than the B747-4F, it's also been unique -- as in, there's only one An-225 flying, "and they ain't building any more of 'em." That changed last month. In just a few years, Chinese-made An-225s could be circling the globe in ever-increasing numbers, depriving Boeing once and for all of the title of "world's biggest civilian freighter [for all intents and purposes]" -- and depriving Boeing of some of the revenue, and profits, that it might have been able to earn as the maker of the world's most capable freighter jet. Going forward, some of those profits will be going to China, and via licensing fees, to Ukraine as well. Sorry, Boeing. You're officially No. 2.

Conway G. Gittens reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript It's only been a few months since the Boeing 787 Dreamliner flew off the ground after a three-year delay and already there is a concern. Boeing says it discovered a problem with the body of the plane known as the fuselage and is in the process of making repairs. The plane maker says there are no short-term safety concerns. Japan's All Nippon Airways, the first customer to fly the plane, says it has done reviews and the aircraft will fly as normal. But the plane is under scrutiny because it is the world's first commercial airplane made mostly of lightweight carbon composites, which increases fuel efficiency. Main rival Airbus recently had to deal with wing cracks on its A380 superjumbo jet. Boeing was quick to say the repairs will not impact the production schedule for the 787. The company is hoping to ramp up production to 10 a month by the end of next year, in hopes of making up for lost time after that multi-year delay. There are more than 800 orders for the new plane, but Boeing only gets paid with the planes are actually delivered to air carriers, and ready to go up in the air.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Sep 11, 2016 at 8:13AM Get ready to lift off with our annual round-up of the top 10 best-selling military helicopters in the world. Image source: Defenseimagery.mil. Remember our top 10 fighter jet report that ran a couple months back? In it, we looked at the 10 best-selling fighter jets in the world, complete with pretty pictures, fascinating facts, and some deep thoughts about the companies that make the fighter jets themselves. Our follow-up review of the top 10 most popular military transport aircraft came out last week. Today, we'll complete the trifecta and run down the top 10 combat helicopters, as reported in Flightglobal Insight's latest "World Air Forces" report. Why jump from fixed-wings to whirlybirds? Simple. While American-made fighter jets and cargo planes are in high demand around the world, it turns out American-made military helicopters are even more popular. Around the world, four of the top 10 fighter jets are made here in America, and four of the top 10 transports as well. But seven of the world's best-selling military helicopters are made in the USA. Together, they command an astonishing 45% market share around the globe. Which helos are these, who makes them, and what does this all mean for investors? Read on and find out. 10. Aerospatiale SA341 Gazelle -- List price: $220,000 on the resale market British Royal Air Force Gazelle. Image source: Mike Freer via Wikimedia Commons. First introduced in 1973, the French Gazelle hasn't been in production since 1992 -- but there are still a lot of the old birds whirling around. According to Flightglobal's data, 501 Gazelles remain in service around the globe today, making up 3% of the global market for military helicopters. 9. Textron Bell AH-1 Cobra -- List price: $29.9 million  Cobras, Vipers, and Venoms -- oh my! What is it with Marines and snakes? Image source: LCpl. Jeff Sisto for the U.S. Marine Corps. Rising one slot on Flightglobal's top 10 list this year is Textron's (NYSE:TXT) AH-1 Cobra. Including both older models of the attack helicopter and the Marines' latest take -- dubbed the "AH-1Z" Viper -- 566 units are in service around the world today. That's equivalent to a 3% market share worldwide. 8. Textron Bell OH-58 Kiowa -- List price: $13 million   Danger in a small package -- the Bell Kiowa. Image source: SSgt Shane A. Cuomo for the U.S. Army. Once one of the U.S. Army's most popular attack helicopters, the ranks of OH-58 Kiowas are thinning, with 18% fewer units (582) flying this year than last. Global market share has dropped to 3%, and that's just the start. The Army's plans to retire its entire Kiowa fleet are now well under way. Soon, the Kiowa's light attack helicopter mission will be entirely taken over by the Apache (see below). Don't be surprised if next year, the Kiowa falls entirely off the top 10 list. 7. MD Helicopters MD500 -- List price: $3.5 million   MD 500 buyers can do a lot with this little bird. Image source: MD Helicopters. S&P Global Market Intelligence reports that MD Helicopters is privately held -- not publicly traded. The company's versatile MD500 light helicopter serves multiple transport and combat roles in the U.S. (and other) armed forces. Around the world, 675 are in use -- flat against last year -- allowing the MD500 to retain a 3% market share. 6. Boeing CH-47 Chinook -- List price: $29.8 million   Just how big is Boeing's Chinook? Just this big. Image source: Spc. Russell J. Good for the U.S. Army. After dropping briefly in the rankings last year, Boeing's (NYSE:BA) famed CH-47 Chinook caught an updraft in 2016. The number of Chinooks in service inched up 2.5% to 898 this year, growing the Chinook's global market share to 5%. 5. Mil Mi-24 Hind -- List price: $12.5 million  During the Soviet occupation, the Afghans had a saying: "We don't fear the Russians, but we fear their helicopters." The Mi-24 Hind was one reason why. Image source: Jakub Halun via Wikimedia Commons. Russia's most famous helicopter (albeit not its best-selling -- see below) is growing as well. Owing in part to Russia's recent military buildup, 918 Mi-24 Hinds are in service globally today, up 21 from last year. The Hind still commands 5% global market share. 4. Boeing AH-64 Apache -- List price: $35.5 million  Boeing's AH-64 Apache just might be the most feared attack helicopter in the world. Image source: Petty Officer 3rd Class Shawn Hussong for the U.S. Navy. Retaining its fourth-place position for the third year running is Boeing's ever-popular Apache attack helicopter. In service globally today are 1,116 of them, up 33 from last year, and the helicopter has 6% market share. Adding to Boeing's revenue stream is the continuing need to refurbish, upgrade, and remanufacture this huge existing fleet of aircraft. 3. Textron Bell UH-1 Huey -- List price: $25.4 million  The Bell "Huey" has been a staple of the U.S. military since Vietnam. Image source: U.S. Army. Placing third in this race is Textron's venerable UH-1 Huey utility helicopter. A certified Vietnam Vet, Textron has produced more than 16,000 copies of the Huey and its successor aircraft, including the latest model UH-1Y Venom (price indicated above). Four dozen have been retired since Flightglobal's last report came out, leaving just 1,404 in service today. That's still enough to give the Huey 7% market share. 2. Mil Mi-8 Hip -- List price: $3.2 million  Russia's Mil Mi-8 sells well all around the world. For example, this one made it all the way to Mexico. Image source: Photographer's Mate Airman Jeremy L. Grisham for the U.S. Navy. First introduced in 1961, the Mi-8 Hip remains popular to this day. With 2,555 units in service (up nearly 5% from last year), the Hip commands a 13% global market share. That's still 1,027 helicopters behind the market leader, however. Without further ado, then, we bring you the No. 1 best-selling military helicopter in the world... 1. Lockheed Martin Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk -- List price: $17 million  Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk (and its cousins, like this Pave Hawk pictured here) are the best-selling military helicopters in the world. Image source: Staff Sergeant Aaron Allmon II for the U.S. Air Force. For the umpteenth time running, the most popular military helicopter on the planet remains the Sikorsky Black Hawk (and its derivatives). With 3,582 units in service around the world (down slightly from an even 3,600 last year), the Black Hawk and its cousins dominate the world with 18% global market share -- and that share could even grow over time. You see, when Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) acquired Sikorsky from United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) last year, it also acquired Sikorsky's backlog of $15.6 billion in signed deals to acquire new Black Hawks. At an average purchase price of $17 million per chopper, that works out to another 900-plus Black Hawks still waiting to be assembled. If I were a betting man, I think I'd happily place a bet on Lockheed Martin, and Sikorsky, continuing to dominate the global market for military helicopters for years to come. Why investors care about military helicopters So, why is all of this important to investors in the defense industry? It works like this: The more helicopters a company sells, the broader the base over which it can spread research and development costs, and the less it can charge per helo. The lower the cost, the cheaper the helicopter. And the cheaper the helicopter, the easier it is to sell more helicopters, growing market share further, and expanding profit margins. Sikorsky, now owned by Lockheed, has sold more than 4,700 Black Hawk-family helicopters over its history, and amazingly, 76% of these helicopters are still flying today. Flying, and therefore continuing to generate revenue for Lockheed Martin from maintenance, parts, and upgrades. As part of Lockheed Martin's Aeronautics business, it's generating 10.9% operating profit margins, outclassing the 10.1% margin at Textron's Bell unit, and the 7.7% margin at Boeing Military Aircraft as well (all data from S&P Global). It's also worth pointing out that, with Sikorsky now in hand, Lockheed Martin owns the top brand of military helicopter (Black Hawk), the top-selling military transport aircraft (C-130 Hercules), and the best-selling fighter jet (F-16 Falcon) as well. All under one corporate roof. The moral of this story: If you're looking for a pure-play way to invest in the defense industry, you don't have to look any further than Lockheed Martin stock. Did I mention that Sikorsky has won the contract to build the next "Marine One?" If Sikorsky is good enough for the U.S. President, shouldn't it be good for you, too?

Boeing is making a major change to its planes that could end jet lag as we know it Business Insider 9/11/2016 Benjamin Zhang © Provided by Business Insider   During the development of the 787 Dreamliner, Boeing encountered countless engineering hurdles. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 146.01 +0.68 +0.47% One of which was the decision to build much of the plane out of carbon fiber reinforced plastics and other composite materials instead of the aluminum most commonly used on commercial airliners. While the engineering of the composite airframe may have been a challenge, it's a decision that allowed Boeing to make a major change to its aircraft that could greatly reduce the effect of jet lag on its passengers. "The Dreamliner has a composite fuselage and that allowed us to pressurize it at whatever altitude we wanted because the material is not as susceptible to fatigue," Blake Emery, director of differentiation strategy for Boeing's commercial airplanes, told Business Insider in an interview.

The real estate magnate got $4.96 billion in free earned media in the year leading up to the presidential election, according to data from tracking firm mediaQuant. Over the past 12 months, the president-elect received more than $800 million in free earned broadcast media, compared to $666 million for Clinton, and $2.6 billion in free earned online news attention, compared to $1.6 billion for his rival.

For the Dreamliner, Boeing cut that down to 6,000 ft. "To lower the cabin altitude, we actually increased the air pressure inside the cabin," Emery added. "It's a bit counter intuitive for most people." Why does air pressure matter to passengers?© Provided by Business Insider   For most of us, a long flight is usually followed by some combination of symptoms that include headaches, lack of appetite, lack of energy, nausea, and sleeplessness. All of these afflictions have been conveniently bundled together with a disruption of one's internal body clock to form something we call jet lag. But the reality is that jet lag is far more serious. The very symptoms we attribute to jet lag may actually be attributed to acute mountain sickness, which affects individuals exposed to altitudes above 6,500 ft. In a study conducted by Oklahoma State University with the help of Boeing, researchers wrote: "Some passengers on long commercial flights experience discomfort characterized by symptoms similar to those of acute mountain sickness. The symptoms are often attributed to factors such as jet lag, prolonged sitting, dehydration, or contamination of cabin air. However, because barometric pressures in aircraft cabins are similar to those at the terrestrial altitudes at which acute mountain sickness occurs, it is possible that some of the symptoms are related to the decreased partial pressure of oxygen and are manifestations of acute mountain sickness." The study found that passengers who go from sea level up to 8,000 ft. of altitude saw the oxygen content in their blood fall 4%. Although this didn't trigger full on acute mountain sickness, it did bring on what the study called "increased prevalence of discomfort after three to nine hours" of exposure. "The research showed passengers' bodies reacted at 6,000 ft. similar to that at sea level," Emery said. "So we decided to pressurize the Dreamliner at 6,000 ft." At 6,000 ft., the cabin air is more dense and has a greater level of oxygen saturation. As result, the body does not have to work as hard to oxygenate blood and sustain itself. © Provided by Business Insider   According to Emery, since there isn't a perfect one-to-one correlation between altitude and jet lag, Boeing has taken additional measures to mitigate the symptoms. These measures include an increase in cabin humidity as well as a new air filtration system. Why haven't we had this all along? The Dreamliner won't be the only Boeing jet to have a have a lower cabin altitude. The company's upcoming 777X wide-body mini-jumbo jet will also be pressurized at 6,000 ft. However, unlike the composite Dreamliner, the 777X, Boeing's successor to landmark 777, will be primarily made of aluminum. "Aluminum aircraft can be pressurized to 6,000 ft.," Kent Craver, Boeing's commercial airplanes regional director of passenger satisfaction, told Business Insider in an interview. "In fact, most business jets are already pressurized to that level." In addition, Airbus is also working to lower the cabin altitude on its next generation of airliners. Airplane makers have traditionally avoided lowering the cabin altitude because boosting the air pressure inside the cabin puts greater stress on aluminum air frames. This increases the likelihood of metal fatigue and shortens the service life of the airplane. © Provided by Business Insider   However, Boeing believes it can successfully lower cabin altitude on the 777X without going to a composite body. "We know the 777 fuselage, its structural qualities, and its fatigue margins really well," a Boeing spokesperson told us in an email. "We also understand the requirements of the lower cabin altitude in terms of cycles and pressures on the fuselage. As a result, we can achieve it with a few local reinforcements and change those loads out to accommodate lower cabin altitude." The Boeing 777X is set to enter service in 2019.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Sep 10, 2016 at 10:13AM One day soon, United Launch Alliance could be operating a fleet of "trucks" in Earth orbit. Image source: Getty Images. The news is out, and the internet tubes are practically vibrating with excitement: Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) are building a space truck. We actually first told you about this nearly half a year ago. But lately, a lot of other media outlets have discovered the story and begun writing about United Launch Alliance's (ULA, which is Boeing and Lockheed's joint space venture) plan to convert second-stage launch rockets into reusable space vehicles -- "space trucks" that can tool around the solar system under their own power. Naturally, in the perpetual motion machine that is the internet, this revived attention got our attention and inspired us to do a bit more digging into exactly how this will all work. How this will work The first step to understanding how ULA's plan will work is to understand how it won't work. Currently, there are two major paths to get to space: launching with a "disposable" rocket (such as Boeing and Lockheed, Orbital ATK (NYSE:OA), and Airbus' (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) Arianespace all use); or launching with a "reusable" rocket, a la SpaceX. The disposable path requires the construction of a brand-new rocket for each launch, which is discarded to burn up in the atmosphere after launch. It's worked well so far for ULA, which earned $400 million in operating profit last year. The reusable path hopes to produce even more profits -- by shedding costs and recovering launched rockets for later reuse. Focusing on the latter, there are currently three major theories on the best way to make rockets "reusable," with the goal of making space launches inexpensive. The first, pioneered by NASA's Space Shuttle and now being reborn at Airbus, launches a rocket vertically, then lands it back on earth horizontally -- like an airplane. A second approach, practiced by SpaceX (and soon to be imitated by Blue Origin) launches a rocket vertically, then attempts to land the first stage of that rocket vertically upon its own jets. Both of these approaches attempt to recover and reuse only the first stage of a rocket, which comprises about 70% of the total cost of the rocket. Boeing and Lockheed aren't taking either of these approaches with the "space truck" idea. Second verse, similar to the first Instead, ULA's "space truck" plan focuses on a means of reusing a rocket's second stage -- in space. (ULA also hopes to recover its first-stage rockets through a different process. I'll talk more about that in a later article.) ULA's space truck plan goes like this: In 2019, ULA plans to introduce a new launch vehicle called "Vulcan," comprised of a "Next Generation Launch System" first stage and utilizing an existing "Centaur" second stage. Four years later, ULA will replace Centaur with a more powerful second stage called "Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage" -- "ACES," for short. ACES, says ULA, will give Vulcan lift capability similar to that of "today's Delta IV Heavy rocket" (and superior to ULA's Atlas V). Additionally, the ACES second stage will form the basis for ULA's "space truck" project. Featuring a lightweight electrical system, insulated body, and four thrusters for maneuverability, an ACES space truck will function first as an ordinary second-stage rocket, lifting a payload into orbit. Once there, though, ACES will remain in orbit and assume its new role as an off-planet space truck -- accepting replenishment with additional fuel, and perhaps itself refueling other satellites in orbit, "towing" off-course satellites back into their proper orbits, or even shuttling cargo back and forth to the moon. (And if you're thinking at this point that ULA's space truck idea sounds a lot like Orbital ATK's Mission Extension Vehicle (MEV), which is scheduled to begin operations in late 2018, I had that same thought, too.) Like Orbital's MEV, ULA notes that ACES will have the ability to turn off and turn on its engines an "almost unlimited" number of times, allowing it to operate in orbit for "weeks." Indeed, ULA CEO Tony Bruno says that once in orbit, ACES could conceivably continue to operate in space "forever." And with its new capabilities, ACES can earn Boeing and Lockheed additional revenue from the rocket -- which otherwise would have been discarded as a mere used-up second stage. Where's the nearest gas station? Of course, in order for ACES to perform any of these missions -- particularly the turning on and turning off parts -- it will need fuel. But since ACES' fuel is currently located on Earth and needs to be brought up by rocket, doesn't that make orbiting "space trucks" superfluous? Where's the advantage in sending up one ACES rocket, loaded with fuel, only to transfer that fuel to an identical ACES in orbit? Curious to find the answer, I reached out to ULA for an explanation. What they told me was that an ACES designed to operate as a "space truck" would be specially fitted out with an "extended duration kit." Ordinary ACES would launch without such a supplement. And as for the economics of bringing up additional fuel, ULA clarified that this would not necessarily be brought up especially to fuel space trucks (at a current cost of $164 million per refueling mission, plus the cost of the fuel). Rather, a launch designed primarily to put one payload in space (a satellite, for example), if it had excess capacity, might fill out that capacity with extra fuel, sent up at "near zero" marginal cost -- then transferred to a waiting space truck. A far distant future That's the near-term plan. Further out, in the days when ULA envisions "1,000" humans living and working in space 30 years from now, ULA hopes to find more fuel that doesn't need to be lifted off Earth first to be used. Water ice extracted from the moon or asteroids, for example, could be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen and used to refuel ACES space trucks. It's discovering that fuel, and perfecting the space trucks to transport it and burn it, that will really enable the space economy to take off.

 Boeing is making a major change to its planes that could end jet lag as we know it Benjamin Zhang Sep. 10, 2016, 10:13 AM 121,142 facebook linkedin twitter email print A 787 Dreamliner being built for Air India in North Charleston, South Carolina. REUTERS/Randall Hill During the development of the 787 Dreamliner, Boeing encountered countless engineering hurdles. One of which was the decision to build much of the plane out of carbon-fiber reinforced plastics and other composite materials instead of the aluminum most commonly used on commercial airliners. While the engineering of the composite airframe may have been a challenge, it's a decision that allowed Boeing to make a major change to its aircraft that could greatly reduce the effect of jet lag on its passengers. "The Dreamliner has a composite fuselage and that allowed us to pressurize it at whatever altitude we wanted because the material is not as susceptible to fatigue," Blake Emery, director of differentiation strategy for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, told Business Insider in an interview. Currently, most airliners have cabin air pressure equivalent to that of an altitude of 8,000 feet. For the Dreamliner, Boeing cut that down to 6,000 feet. "To lower the cabin altitude, we actually increased the air pressure inside the cabin," Emery added. "It's a bit counterintuitive for most people." Why does air pressure matter to passengers? Boeing 787 cabin without seats. Boeing For most of us, a long flight is usually followed by some combination of symptoms that include headaches, lack of appetite, lack of energy, nausea, and sleeplessness. All of these afflictions have been conveniently bundled together with a disruption of one's internal body clock to form something we call jet lag. But the reality is that jet lag is far more serious. The very symptoms we attribute to jet lag may actually be attributed to acute mountain sickness, which affects individuals exposed to altitudes above 6,500 feet. In a study conducted by Oklahoma State University with the help of Boeing, researchers wrote: "Some passengers on long commercial flights experience discomfort characterized by symptoms similar to those of acute mountain sickness. The symptoms are often attributed to factors such as jet lag, prolonged sitting, dehydration, or contamination of cabin air. However, because barometric pressures in aircraft cabins are similar to those at the terrestrial altitudes at which acute mountain sickness occurs, it is possible that some of the symptoms are related to the decreased partial pressure of oxygen and are manifestations of acute mountain sickness." The study found that passengers who go from sea level up to 8,000 feet of altitude saw the oxygen content in their blood fall 4%. Although this didn't trigger full on acute mountain sickness, it did bring on what the study called "increased prevalence of discomfort after three to nine hours" of exposure. "The research showed passengers' bodies reacted at 6,000 feet similar to that at sea level," Emery said. "So we decided to pressurize the Dreamliner at 6,000 feet." At 6,000 feet, the cabin air is more dense and has a greater level of oxygen saturation. As result, the body does not have to work as hard to oxygenate blood and sustain itself. Boeing 787-8.

The aircraft manufacturer is analysing two potential designs for a plane that is expected to be called the 737 MAX 10 and would be the largest aircraft in the 737 line. Boeing has held recent discussions with airlines and aircraft leasing firms to gauge interest in such a plane, according to a source who spoke on the condition of anonymity and confirmed a Bloomberg News report. Such a plane would address an important gap between the 737 MAX 9, which can transport 200 travellers and the Airbus plane, which holds up to 240 passengers. The A321Neo has given the edge to the European giant in the lucrative market for middle-range planes, with orders running about 1 000 above those for Boeing's 737 line, according to data released by the companies. Boeing spokesperson Doug Alder says, "We continue to look at the higher end of the MAX family," "The needs of our airline customers, as well as the business case, will drive our decision and timing."

It’s emergency managed magnificently— works perfectly—for the 1% You claim an opening for socialism in this anti-communist kingdom? You claim your phones are smart? Are there apps for socialism? Communism? If not, the question in the forest of question marks is: How quickly can we cram for the EXAM? How rapidly can we build on baby steps? How fast can we cut plastic cuffs from our imaginations? How swiftly can we snatch stars through orange netting? How quickly can we recycle shackles into Independent Organizations? How quickly can we come together? How fast can we cast off illusions and light lanterns lanterns of theory, ordering our steps? How swiftly can we blend rivulets of revolt into a river of Revolution; or, forever cower before bloodthirsty bogeymen, bogey-ladies champagne-caviar cycles of fear; granting colored tokens rights to do wrong? 2008-2016 Black dyed-in-the wool corporate war criminal 2016-2024 Woman warmonger, Wall Street operative 2024—2032 “Latino” warlord, creature of the 1% 2032-2040 Asian exponent of the ‘pivot’ 2040-2048 First Openly Gay Commander-in-Chief 2048-2056 First Disabled agent of war profiteers— Then cycles restart; Doubling-up on identities… II.

Steve Heller (TMFTopDown) Sep 10, 2016 at 11:30AM Boeing 737 MAX with LEAP engine. Image source: CFM International. General Electric's (NYSE:GE) aviation segment is off to a strong start this year. During the first six months of 2016, aviation revenue increased 7% year over year to $12.8 billion, while operating profits increased 11% year over year to nearly $1.4 billion. Overall, GE's aviation segment represented 23.4% of GE's industrial revenue and 38.6% of its industrial operating profit during this time, making it the company's most profitable segment by a wide margin. This isn't likely to change in the years ahead, as aviation has a massive backlog to work through and strong expected demand for new passenger aircrafts. What's driving the results? Year to date, services made up 56% of aviation's revenue, while equipment sales made up 44%. During this time, aviation's revenue benefited from higher prices in its commercial engines and spare parts business, increased military spare parts volume, and higher services sales. This was partially offset by lower GEnx engine shipments and military volume outside of spares. Operating profits were driven by an increase in services spending, improved productivity, and higher prices. All told, aviation's year-to-date operating margin increased 80 basis points year over year to 22.5%. By subsegment, commercial engines and services made up the lion's share of GE's aviation revenue, accounting for 74% of the segment's total revenue during the first half of the year. On a unit basis, GE delivered 1,401 commercial engines in the first half, an increase of 5% year over year.

The LEAP engine is the fastest-selling engine in aviation history and succeeds the tried-and-true CFM56. CFM has delivered over 29,500 CFM56s since its introduction. LEAP is 15% more fuel efficient than its predecessor and will be primarily featured on next-generation single-aisle aircraft from Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus.

In other words, delivering LEAPs to customers is a crucial component for GE to recognize revenue sitting in its aviation backlog. Image source: GE. Since the majority of GE's backlog is services-based, aviation's margins are likely to improve, as services tend to command higher margins than equipment orders. These services can range from scheduled maintenance and complete overhauls, to real-time monitoring that tap into the company's digital offerings as a way to reduce unscheduled disruptions. Currently, GE has 35,000 engines in service, but only a small fraction have subscribed to its digital services. By the end of 2020, GE hopes to have more than 44,000 engines flying across the world, giving the company an even greater opportunity to generate incremental services revenue. The view from 38,000 feet GE's aviation segment is benefiting from robust demand for more fuel-efficient aircrafts and the expectation that commercial aviation traffic will grow substantially over the next 20 years. Between 2016 and 2035, Boeing estimates that nearly 40,000 new commercial aircrafts will enter service. Image source: Boeing. As the sole source on Boeing's upcoming 737 MAX and 777X aircrafts, and winning over 50% of Airbus A320neo orders, GE's aviation segment likely has a long tailwind of growth ahead of it.

Steve Heller (TMFTopDown) Sep 10, 2016 at 11:30AM Boeing 737 MAX with LEAP engine. Image source: CFM International. General Electric's (NYSE:GE) aviation segment is off to a strong start this year. During the first six months of 2016, aviation revenue increased 7% year over year to $12.8 billion, while operating profits increased 11% year over year to nearly $1.4 billion. Overall, GE's aviation segment represented 23.4% of GE's industrial revenue and 38.6% of its industrial operating profit during this time, making it the company's most profitable segment by a wide margin. This isn't likely to change in the years ahead, as aviation has a massive backlog to work through and strong expected demand for new passenger aircrafts. What's driving the results? Year to date, services made up 56% of aviation's revenue, while equipment sales made up 44%. During this time, aviation's revenue benefited from higher prices in its commercial engines and spare parts business, increased military spare parts volume, and higher services sales. This was partially offset by lower GEnx engine shipments and military volume outside of spares. Operating profits were driven by an increase in services spending, improved productivity, and higher prices. All told, aviation's year-to-date operating margin increased 80 basis points year over year to 22.5%. By subsegment, commercial engines and services made up the lion's share of GE's aviation revenue, accounting for 74% of the segment's total revenue during the first half of the year. On a unit basis, GE delivered 1,401 commercial engines in the first half, an increase of 5% year over year.

By Jeffrey Lin & Peter W. Singer China Will Resurrect The World's Largest Plane Signs deal to restart Ukrainian An-225 By Jeffrey Lin and P.W. Singer posted Sep 7th, 2016 at 10:15am Antonov An-225 The An-225, which can carry 250 tons of cargo, is the world's heaviest aircraft. China buying and building An-225s would exponentially increase its power projection capabilities not just in Asia, but across the world. On August 30, members of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AICC) and the Antonov Corporation, the leading Ukrainian aviation company, signed an agreement to restart production of the AN-225, the world's largest cargo aircraft. Antonov To Space The An-225's large size was the result of its initial mission to transport the massive Soviet Buran space shuttle, which could weigh up to 105 tons, to launch. Unrealized Soviet planes also intended for the An-225 to launch other reusable space launch systems in mid air. The 640 ton, six engine An-225 is the world's largest aircraft. Measuring at 84 meters in length and a wingspan of over 88 meters, it carries a world record payload of 250 tons (to put this into comparison, it can carry around 300,000 lbs more than the US military's Boeing made C-17). The sole operational An-225 began flying in 1988, initially carrying the Soviet Buran, a 105 ton reusable spaceplane, on its back. It was put into storage after the Soviet collapse, but restored and put into commercial service in 2002. Since then it has been rented out, flying super heavy cargos like gas and wind turbines, as well as military supplies for NATO forces in the Middle East. Ivchenko Progress D-18T The powerful Ivchenko Progress D-18T turbofan, which produces 23 tons of thrust, will also be license produced by China to power domestically built An-225, and possibly other Chinese heavy transport aircraft. The first phase of the agreement between AICC and Antonov will result in the completion and flight of the incomplete second An-225 in 2019. The second stage of the project will involve the complete transfer of technology, including the 23 ton thrust Progress D-18T turbofan engines, to China, for licensed production of a modernized version in Sichuan Province. =GT at China Defense Forum 3325 3325 is the first of China's domestically built Zubr armed hovercraft, commissioned in early 2014. Weighing over 400 tons fully loaded, it can carry three battle tanks or company of armed soldiers. Presaging the An-225 deal, China purchased Ukrainian built Zubrs, as well as domestically building Zubrs at Chinese shipyard under license produciton. Despite China's close relationship with Russia, Ukraine's rival, China has purchased outright and licensed a number of Ukrainian aviation and naval platforms, such as the ex Varyag aircraft carrier, the Zubr hovercraft and the An-178. Antonov itself has also provided design and technical advice for the Chinese ARJ-21 region jetliner and Y-20 heavy transport aircraft. CCTV Forward Sino-Ukrainian Relations The official announcement and signing of the understanding to restart the An-225 production line was given high support by the Chinese government, despite the official Chinese partner, AICC, being relatively undersized compared to the AVIC industrial giant. With the ceremony signed in the Diaoyu state guesthouse in Beijing, and presence of senior government officials, it is clear that there is strong government support for China for this deal. While AICC itself is a relatively small company, it could leverage its government connections to draw heavily on aviation giant AVIC's extensive Sichuan production base. Antonov Waiting for 2019 With much of the fuselage structurally complete, the second An-225 will have its wings, engines and avionics integrated on in the next three years before being handed over to China in 2019. Compared to the first An-225, it has a rear mounted cargo door and single tail, suggesting a greater emphasis on transporting internal cargo, compared to its Buran space shuttle carrying older brother. Finishing the second An-225 by 2019 is an achievable goal, given that the airframe is already 60-70 percent complete. AICC will likely provide the majority of $300 million needed to complete the aircraft. Assuming that the second phase of the deal is completed, a completely Chinese version of the An-225 could begin first flights in the mid 2020s. Ukrainian Internet Belly of the Mriya In addition to carrying space shuttles, the An-225 could carry multiple tanks, such as these four main battle tanks. A Chinese An-225 could not only carry a platoon of China's latest heavy tanks, but also other military cargo like missile launchers and heavy artillery. For China, the An-225 would open whole new frontiers in commercial and military air transportation. A fleet of civilian An-225s could quickly ship heavy and bulky cargoes of massive scale, ranging from construction equipment to consumer goods. For humanitarian purposes, the An-225 could support disaster relief operations, able to fly in not just large amounts of aid, but also by bringing infrastructure like power generation and water treatment that are normally too big for airlift. On the military front, the An-225 would provide China with the kind of large and global lift that not even the US has possessed, except by rental. The plane is large enough to carry helicopters, tanks, artillery and ballistic missiles to anywhere in the world, or even other aircraft like smaller fighter jets. The An-225's unparalleled payload could even make it a space launch platform, or the ultimate mothership for drone operations. In many ways, China's build up of global airlift capabilities mirrors the immense gains it has made in global sealift, investing deeply to reach across the globe in coming year.

Home Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact PIA Misses Revenue Targets by 21% 48Shares FacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsappLinkedinPrint Amin Yusufzai 2 months ago Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has missed revenue target of Rs 54.77 billion budgeted for the first six months (Jan-July) of the current calendar year 2016 by a wide margin of 21 percent and was recorded at Rs 43.19 billion. Revenues Down in 2016 Top PIA officials revealed while briefing the Senate Special Committee on Performance of PIA, the revenue is 6.4 percent lesser than Rs 46.15 billion, collected during the same period last year. The officials stated that the decrease in fares, after decline in oil prices, and tough competition with other airlines caused the decreased revenue. However, not to be mentioned, PIA only reduced fares by 18-19 percent while other competitors reduced prices by about 30-35 percent, said officials when Parliamentarians raised questions and asked for comparisons. Committee’s Instructions to PIA The committee, under Mushahid Ullah’s chairmanship, raised questions on PIA’s financial matters, services, lack of professionalism and directed the management to give due attention towards capacity building of its flight crew, ensuring improved facilities and services to passengers to establish PIA as a strong competitor in the market. The committee was further informed that cash support to PIAC from government of Pakistan during the period, June 2013 to December 2014, is Rs. 20.6 billion. ECC, in its meeting held on December 6, 2014, approved $52 million for induction of 15 aircraft in PIA’s fleet on dry lease. This amount would be injected as equity by the government of Pakistan. PIAC have already received the said amount from GoP. Further approval of GoP guarantees from June, 2013 till now is Rs 28.8 billion against loans obtained by the PIA. PIA Chairman Azam Saigol, while briefing the committee said the government had 91.7 percent shares in the airlines (PIA was converted into a company on April 19, 2016 and being governed under the Companies Ordinance 1984) while public/others’ shares are 4.4 percent and PIA employees Empower Trust shares stand at 3.9 percent. Senator Nauman Wazir directed PIA officials for inquiry into the fire incident in engineering department and fixing responsibility. He said that PIA has been politicized which resulted in its deteriorating conditions. Senator Lt Gen (Retd.) Abdul Qayyum said that Rs 20 million of medicines are being purchased from a specific medical store and directed for sharing details in next meeting. Current PIA Situation He apprised the body that the PIA fleet consisted of 38 aircrafts including 11 A320 Airbuses, five A310 Airbuses, 11 Boeing 777, six ATR 42 and five ATR 72, adding that currently PIA’s permanent staff strength was 14,317. “Employees to per aircraft ratio is 376,” he added. Saigol said efforts were being made to further expand the fleet and hopefully it would be 42 aircrafts by the end of the current financial year and 60 by 2020. He said domestic market shares of PIA had increased from 42 percent to 65 percent during January to May during the last fiscal year. Presently, he said, PIA flights were operating to 49 destinations, including 27 international and 22 domestic. “It has a market share of 24 percent in international and 47 in domestic air travel market during 2015 whereas for 2016, it has been projected at 27 percent and 68 percent respectively,” he added. The chairman said PIA was introducing its premium service brand, titled “PIA Premier”, aimed at restoring the confidence of passengers in the airlines. Initially, he said, PIA launched the service with improved features and facilities at par with leading airlines. The chairman said performance of the national flag-carrier was improving gradually, citing that top companies were now approaching PIA to offer their best aircrafts. When the panel was informed that PIA was answerable to the Security and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, Farhatullah Babar said parliamentarians had the right to exercise their oversight role as the public money was involved in PIA and “It is our responsibility.” He regretted that a foreigner had been appointed as the chief executive officer of PIA, which was tantamount to discouraging its senior management. The PIA management could not satisfy the committee members about financial matters of the company. Mushahid Ullah directed the PIA management to come with full preparation and relevant officers in the next meeting to respond to all queries of the Senators. Answering a query of Mushahid Ullah, the PIA authorities informed the body that they had a plan to operate flights on new international routes including Barcelona, Milan and Bangkok besides increasing flights to New York. PIA officials admitted that it is passing through dire financial state. However, the present government is very keen to make it self-reliant. Efforts are underway to improve the financial health of the Corporation by reducing its losses through various means and modes. Stringent action is being taken against corruption and mismanagement. Improvement in PIA Operations Flight punctuality has increased to 85.6% during 2016. PIAC have recently signed agreements for acquisition of 20 aircraft on dry lease, i.e. thriteen A-320s and five ATRs-72s with prop-turbo, out of which two A-320s and five ATR-72s and 2 Boeing 777s have already joined PIAC’s fleet while the remaining two A-320s will join PIAC fleet very soon. The average age of the fleet has also been reduced to 10 years, which will further reduce to 8 years after grounding of over-20 year old A-310. Additional flights have also been scheduled to increase international operation on viable routes. In this regard, PIA has started twice weekly flights between Dubai and Karachi, daily flights between Dubai- Lahore & Dubai-Islamabad and resumed flights between Dubai-Peshawar. The airline has also been involved in taking various steps in cost reduction and productivity improvement. This includes contract re-negotiations, route rationalization, restructuring by discontinuing loss making routes. PIA has entered into Code Share agreement with Etihad Airlines which has helped in expanding its network. The airline is also in negotiations with other airlines for mutual cooperation which will certainly increase its customer base to a greater extent. Through Code Share, PIA and Etihad benefited with additional 2,000 passengers during last two months (Jul-August 2015) and around 5,000 more reservations/bookings from September 2015 onwards, the officials briefed the committee. 48Shares FacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsappLinkedinPrint Primary Sidebar ProPakistani Viral Stories Pakistan’s Telecom Industry is in Deep Trouble [Part 2] Anti-Virus Software Are Useless, Says Google Security Engineer DebtClock: Every Pakistani is Over Rs. 115k in Debt, Thanks to Government!

View Latest Posts >>> Elon Musk: ‘We Have Not Ruled Out’ That UFO Caused Space X Explosion By Ian Greenhalgh on September 10, 2016 UFO provides convenient distraction [Editor’s note: Of course they have not ruled out the UFO – it provides a very convenient distraction. The more time and effort people put into looking at that UFO or rather, an unidentified blob of blurry pixels, the less time they have to devote to any meaningful research or study of the events. We can take one or two important points from what Musk has had to say however, as Jeff Smith pointed out after studying what Musk and Space-X have said since the ‘incident’: Data shows that the “anomaly” started around the upper stage liquid oxygen tank, and occurred in less than “35 to 55 Milliseconds”. Therefore prior to the anomaly all systems were go up to 8 minutes before main engine test fire. The only thing stored around the upper stage oxygen tank is the rockets lithium batteries and the helium pressurization tanks. There are no telemetry reports of thermal runaway in the lithium batteries or major helium / fuel / oxygen tank leaks. 35 to 55 milliseconds is how long a nuclear reaction would last before thermal expansion would occur. This is why lithium batteries are not allowed on nuclear subs or used in submarine torpedoes. A sufficient thermal runaway triggered in lithium batteries by X-ray exposure will produce a small nuclear reaction that can set off any nearby hydrogen / helium source. Both Lithium and Helium are split into hydrogen gas during the reaction. This section of the rockets body is made out of carbon fiber and not aluminum so it is vulnerable to any high power microwave radiation source. Note 35 to 55 milliseconds is less than 1/25th of a compressed MPEG frame. So the explosion took place in less than 1 video frame. They do not state whether or not all telemetry was lost after that and he does not rule out that the cause was external. This will also set Space-X back at least 1 year because of insurance problems alone. No-one will insure until the cause is found and corrected. This could be simple hostile corporate take over tactics. Boeing and Lockheed cutting out Space-X. So now we have one small piece of data that provides confirmation that a nuclear event took place in the form of the 35-55ms timing. Here is some further explanation from Jeff of the nature of the nuclear event that took place and destroyed the rocket: Helium / deuterium chain reactions. The helium is split into deuterium and hydrogen by the x-rays. It then goes bang once properly ionized. Lithium splits into Helium then Deuterium then Hydrogen etc. It undergoes fission first then fusion kicks in. This is how mother nature stores energy then releases it at a later date. It’s called a “Fission – Fusion” process and not just a “fission” or “fusion” process. It uses both process to work not one. People that know physics or chemistry often miss this process because they are not properly trained in these type of reactions. Only weapons design people usually know this stuff. The helium is used to pressurize the fuel and oxygen tanks so they don’t implode due to vacuum as the fuel is drawn off during flight. Pressure and volume drop so you have to counter pressurize the tanks. Helium is used to prevent cavitation and static charge build-up from occurring in the tanks. Commonly called vapor lock in old cars. Nitrogen was formerly used but it’s heaver and can’t be compressed as densely as helium can. So the nitrogen tanks were bigger and heaver. Helium is used for weight savings and static charge prevention. Of course, there will be those who continue to talk nonsense about UFOs and aliens and perhaps even more esoteric causes; some of them will be paid to do so as part of the psyop to cover the truth, others are just borderline crazy due to their need to believe they have found evidence of aliens interacting with us. Ian] __________ Sputnik Elon Musk: ‘We Have Not Ruled Out’ That UFO Caused Space X Explosion The statement by the vaunted entrepreneur that he couldn’t rule out that UFO hunters were correct that an unidentified object or weapon initiated the explosion has alien enthusiasts out in full force. The frenzied excitement for alien hunters hit new heights on Friday when the innovative wunderkind Elon Musk wrote to a commenter on Twitter that “We have not ruled that [a UFO hitting the Space X Falcon 9 rocket] out” with theories ranging from an attack by foreign defense forces to a laser attack by an alien ship quickly cascading through social media. The statement comes one week after self-proclaimed UFO hunters pointed to video footage from the SpaceX explosion noting that there was a black object barreling near the rocket only seconds before explosion with YouTube viewers quickly dispatching theories that the flying object was a bird or a bug based on the relative speed of the object – over 1,000 MPH – and its appearance behind riggings that ruled out the possibility that it was a bug in the camera lens. The explosion quickly consumed the rocket destroying Facebook’s AMOS-6 internet-beaming satellite and causing unprecedented damage to the launchpad – a fairly unusual incident for a rocket explosion. Musk said the explosion was “really a fast fire” and was unable to point to specific mechanical causes for the failure of the rocket. One Twitter user said that the sound at 54 seconds in a video posted “sounds like a metal joint popping under stress” which Elon Musk said was “most likely true” but also said that “we can’t yet find it on any vehicle sensors” pointing to the possibility of some outside sabotage. “Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation. Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source,” said Musk questioning how the rocket could spontaneously erupt in flames. “Particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off. May come from rocket or something else.” One person suggested that it could be a drone, but opined that if it was a drone it was a particularly fast and circular drone that does not match the description of any known existing defense products. Others opined that whatever the flying vehicle that may have given rise to the explosion, it appears it was a “well planned attack from a competitor.” Although speculation continues to circle around the explosion of the Space X Falcon 9 rockets with the most fascinating theory by far being the potential that space aliens beamed the rocket, many more plausible alternatives exist including a leak of propellant fuel, metal on metal contact sparking just enough initial flame, or a buildup of oxygen. Some commenters are even blaming Vladimir Putin and/or China – which makes maybe less sense than even space aliens. The truth is out there. Related Posts: UFO Proof?

This video now analyzes accelerations (starting at 8’00”), and there are some beautiful surprises !! Silver bullet at 10’30”. This is definitively an automatic vehicle with astonishing performance. Hope you will enjoy ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYK2C-GgI0I Log in to Reply kaho  September 17, 2016 at 7:45 am Great video, Chris! As I began viewing it, there were only 10 viewers listed. And when I finished, about 15 minutes later, there were already 18! That is approximately 30 per hour. I hope the trend continues. I suppose what you have assumed is that the object moves with constant velocity, and that is how you obtain the hidden (hidden because it is the dimension that disappears in the photographic projection) third dimension. Personally I would have used some easy programming language such as Fortran or C. (Or even my plain old calculator). But I think you reach more people by presenting it as a spreadsheet problem, because there are far more people familiar with spreadsheets than with Algol, Fortran, C, Java and what have you. I always wondered a bit about the stuff with «electrogravity». I took a look at a book by author Tex Marrs, called «The Fourth Reich», but had to put it down when he started talking about electrogravity. I suppose, if such is the case, then there exist a hitherto undiscovered coupling between the electromagnetic field and gravity (or rather undisclosed, if Tex Marrs is right). And now your Tesla video is first in line!

Falcon X and The Crackling Geiger Counter – Part 2 https://youtu.be/SM1aLD6m8zc Log in to Reply Peter Paul 1950  September 15, 2016 at 2:39 am kaho, thank you for the seismic graph, though it just goes to prove what can always be registered on such occasions. And yes, that short distortion is really out of this world. I can only compare it to throwing a pebble into a clear lake and observe how the waves distort the reflection on the surface. That kind of ripple or wave effect is clearly visible, and the stretching and compressing in all directions truly makes me wonder. But may I point out that any real image or video editor has these effects as built in utilities to distort in any way imaginable. I don’t know if you are into editing images but it has been in use ever since they have been created. But in this case we are dealing with something completely different. There is no editing involved. By the way the original video was made in Ultra HD and 29,97 fps. Maybe they even 60 fps, but that is what is in use by TV for sporting events like football and racing. As a F1 fan I’ve always loved the mounted cameras that can show the race from all kinds of perspectives. Peter Paul 1950  September 15, 2016 at 3:10 am Which suddenly brings me to the following idea: where was the recording and storing taking place? Inside the camera or was it a wireless connection from the camera to the control building? That would explain the distortion if an EMP event took place. Electrons travel along magnetic fields. Look at the polar lights how they move and even more, look at the SOHO images of the sun itself. The solution must be in the wireless connection. That is state of the art today. The ‘träger frequenz’ was distorted, not the digital images themselves. Did it influence AM or FM? Or both? kaho  September 15, 2016 at 5:31 am Good work Peter Paul ! What I have been thinking all this time, although I did not see any comments mentioning it, is that the explosions scared up the birds, and many of them flew up into the air and quipped warnings to their mates, because birds are always listening for sounds, and are experts at communicating by means of their songs – songs that we humans don’t know the meaning of. We just know that birds often sing beautiful tunes, inspiring our poets and musicians : The language of the birds that only a few inspired ones can understand. I never worked much with audio files. But of course I have looked at some now and then. I think that what you see are are time samples of amplitudes. Microphones have a membrane as essential element, which is made to move back and forth in the same rhythm as the variations in the local air pressure that make up the sound. Most real sounds are composed of several frequencies, and a sound’s frequency spectrum is essentially a Fourier transform over a certain time interval. But my question really is how you managed to synchronize the sound file with the visual images? I recall some comments saying the time lag due to the distance was 12 seconds, others said it was 11. kaho  September 15, 2016 at 5:48 am Peter Paul, There were three independent seismic stations, and their distances from the launch platform were mentioned on one of the sites I visited. Maybe it was on «reddit.com» in one of the discussion groups there (Amos 6). What is not known very exactly is the speed of the seismic surface waves, because it depends on the local geology. What I saw, however, in a NASA publication, was that the ground at Cape Caneveral is mostly sedimentary, but I do not know if that helps much. Anyway, the distances were much less than the 4 km from the launch pad to the camera location. I think it said 0.93 miles (? I don’t recall exactly, so please verify before using). And so it would be really interesting to correlate the sound file you isolated from the video recording, with the seismic data (NB Three different independent stations). Trakkath  September 13, 2016 at 1:10 pm I remember that I had seen in one video about 911 the same ball-shaped kind of drone. Wasn´t it before impact on the second WTC-Tower ? Log in to Reply kaho  September 13, 2016 at 5:54 am Peter Paul, You may be on to something that I do not quite understand. In general, though, it is known from electromagnetic theory, especially from our knowledge of the properties of the magnetic force, that a magnetic field cannot change the speed of charged particles. ( Are you familiar with the equation F = e v x B ? The vector cross product tells us that the force F always acts perpendicular to the velocity vector v of the charged particle, whose charge is e. ) A static magnetic field vector B can only change the *direction* a free charge is moving in, but not the magnitude |v| of the velocity vector v. For a time-varying magnetic field, there is, however, another effect : This is the phenomenon of magnetic induction that causes a so called electromotoric force (emf) that could presumably reverse the flow of electrons in a circuit. But I do not understand how this might change the memory addresses of the photo cells in the CCD chip in such a systematic fashion. And so until this becomes clear, I will stick to my idea that it is a powerful air blast (a blast of wind ) that causes the towers to vibrate, which would be described a a case of ***forced oscillations***. Log in to Reply kaho  September 13, 2016 at 10:38 am Peter Paul, I took a second look, and it now seems as if it is the whole picture that is swaying, not just the towers. So I am now leaning more towards your proposal. But I still do not understand exactly how the effect comes about. What is clear is that the CPU reads the pixels of the CCD cell and transfers their values to memory registers that span several color bytes for each pixel. But it does not read all CCD pixels at the same time. It is also clear that the readings must be clocked. But if the internal camera clock frequency becomes temporarily changed, due to external electromagnetic fields, then it may indeed cause a temporary offset of the storage addresses that label the bytes that are received by and stored in the camera memory. kaho  September 13, 2016 at 11:25 am Here is a demo of image distortion by an external magnetic field applied to a CRT television tube. ( The old-fashioned analog TV tube where the image is created by a moving electron beam ) It shows a similar type of image distortion as in the SpaceX video, as pointed out by Peter Paul. The causes of the distortion are well understood in the case of the analog CRT tube. ( but not so well in the case of a digital video camera ) kaho  September 13, 2016 at 1:26 pm The CR demo was with Walter Levin at MIT U-tube :::::?v=YbzBTdU7iRU::::: ( the url that was lost in the above) Peter Paul 1950  September 13, 2016 at 7:59 pm kaho, I definitly am and thank you for pointing other effect like magnet and tv tube (Braun’sche Röhre), What a magnet does there is nothing else than causing the flow of electrons flowing towards the flourescent screen to be distracted in another direction. That’s not what I’m talking about in our case. You do know what a transformer is and how that works and do know the difference between AC and DC currents? A transformer has a primary and secondary coil of wiring. If you use DC as primary source you will find that it won’t work – except on one single occasion. And that is the very moment you switch on the DC current to flow. On a scope you will see one single peak going steep up and then coming back down to disappear altogether. A transformer only works correctly with alternating current: AC. That is the reason we all have AC provided, in the US it’s 50 Hz whereas here in EU it’s 60 Hz. It’s that famous humming sound of florescent lighting, and that utterly disturbing frequency that can drive a musician crazy when you suddenly get that annoying back coupling from the speakers to the microphone. And why is a transformer shielded and even needs coolant? Why can transformers explode? Peter Paul 1950  September 13, 2016 at 8:17 pm kaho, I am pointing to electromagnetic INDUCTION and pointing at a DC effect and a possible source for that kind of effect. A nuclear explosion as possible source has that effect and is known as EMP apart from all other kinds of radiation – or frequencies for that matter – and can be so strong that it can knock planes out of the sky. How that? The buildup of the magnetic field is one single pulse and can induce electricity in all electric wiring in and kind of device and is a major part of military and civilian concern. All electrical devices have to hardened, that is to have some kind or protective shielding. But the wiring in our homes, in the street and leading to the camera are not protected. An extreme EMP not only produces a current, it produces heat, and any excess of both leads up to a worst case scenario. Microchips are sensitive to both and work only within a certain temperature window. Think of all the satellites in space environment that depend on temperature conditions to even function properly. How does a microchip function at minus 50 degrees celcius – for example a laptop on expedition to the south pole? Peter Paul 1950  September 13, 2016 at 8:39 pm kaho, And I can even go on from there now, because it was Ian who brought up the subject believing that that very first flare on an image is PROOF of a kind of fission-fusion. Let me get into that part of the scene again. Have you ever heard of Frauenhofer’sche lines? How did science first discover the element HELIUM on the sun long before it was discovered here on earth? Through photography. How does science find out how other suns in the universe are composed of? Through photography. And how is that done? By using a prisma to break up light into a spectrum better known as a rainbow from the lowest frequency red to the highest being violett. And every single element has it’s very own fingerprint within those colors and appear as lines at a specific frequency and can thus be identified. Now try to identify the specific line for a specific element on a ccd. Do you think that is possible? What are knowns and what are the unknowns on the video we have have been discussing from the very beginning? The amplitude of the flare? Thats one thing. I haven’t looked into the histogram of the image colors yet and one reason is I still don’t have a pure and uncompressed version of the original footage. I now found out the original at USLaunchReport is 4k in size and runs 29.97. Everything else available on the net is watered down anywhere from 720p downward and distorted. Peter Paul 1950  September 13, 2016 at 9:20 pm kaho, So I hope by now that I have been able to point out some of the basic components and know-how needed to be on the safe side of the assumptions surrounding the initial cause of the explosion. And by that I mean only by looking and analysing a video clip. There are even two parts of the event, the images and the sound track. Let me demonstrate even why the sound track is of so much importance. So I’ll go back to DC first. If EMP is involved then there will inevetably be a distinct induction of electricity in any wiring of the recording systems involved. First: the EMP signal will appear the very exact moment the first explosion occured, that is 12,3 seconds before the sound of the first blast reaches it. The most exposed and vulnerable part of equipment is the MICROPHONE involved. It’s recording does not rely on being cut up into single images, but is a continuous flow of digital information, the smallest part being the frequency level of 42000 Hz, that is CD quality. And what is the frequency range during capturing a video image in the process: lousy 30 Hz. That’s the timeline, that’s the math and the science that goes along with it. kaho  September 14, 2016 at 2:14 am Peter Paul, I posted the link to Walter Lewin’s demo, in order to emphasize, the difference between analog technology and digital technology. The video cameras used now, with their CCD chips work with digital technology, and the frames we were looking at are digital images, represented as files consisting of zeroes and ones, that are stored in digital registers on digital memory chips Of course the underlying technology is still analog where the Kirchhoff circuit rules still rule the day. But the electronic flip-flop cells that store the bits and bytes make sure that the conveyed information has a fundamental digital character. kaho  September 14, 2016 at 2:17 am So the point we agree upon is that a rapid change in magnetic flux density can cause voltages that blow out or damage essential electronic circuitry. But what I do not understand (yet) is how this can cause such systematic changes in the digital information that represents the picture frames, where the image-lines are pushed left and right after a sinusoidal profile. What I would have expected instead, would be a much more chaotic effect. In effect the video recorder seems to be working just fine, except for the systematic vertical misalignments of the horizontal pixel lines. That’s why I wanted to see if a hypothetical EM pulse might have some effect on the little quartz crystal that determines the clock frequency. In the bygone days of analog technology, a magnetically caused distortion of the TV picture is perfectly understandable. But for a digital system? That is the rub. kaho  September 14, 2016 at 2:27 am By the way, did you see the seismic data graphs of the event? The data from three seismic stations were posted on FaceBook. I think you can retrieve the graphs by gugling for «Amos 6 seismic», and also here : h ttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CsBftxaW8AANbB1.jpg:orig Peter Paul 1950  September 14, 2016 at 12:21 pm kaho, thank you very much for your feedback. Even though I do not know who you are, where you are and what your true ambitions might be, I can now read from your words, that you have a deeper understanding concerning the whole matter than the average person and are eager to dive into the unknown depths that is not even quite clear as we go along with comparing the known facts to get to a true solution. To tell you one thing beforehand I have been working nonstop on a video presentation since 01:30 pm last night and now it is 21:00 pm. I hope to be finished with this video in the next few hours and upload it to my channel because it is getting close to 24h that I’ve been sitting in front of my screen. I hope to be able to answer at least a few of your questions that are very relevant and important for a realistic evaluation of the material we both are analyzing. Please take into consideration that I go about my analysis as if the video we are all acquainted with thanks to Ian is to me as if I am looking and investigating into the voice recording of a 747 that has disintegrated before our very eyes. Number of casualties: Unknown. My job: pick up the pieces, the leftovers and report to the oldest tree in the forest what you discovered…. and wait for my upload. kaho  September 14, 2016 at 4:35 pm Peter Paul, It is me who must thank you. For your well made video, as well as your amazing discovery of the distorted video image. BTW If you are in the process of creating a new video about the incident, why don’t you include the image of the seismic signals in your video. It is still there, at the URL I posted yesterday : h t t p s://pbs.twimg.com/media/CsBftxaW8AANbB1.jpg:orig ( If you append “:orig” you will get the jpg in a higher resolution than if you don’t ) I also checked out the URL Chris posted here on VT some days ago. The second of the URL’s he gave has about twice as many images as most of the other versions of the videos that are available. BTW The version I downloaded for my pixel-analysis of the object’s speed isn’t there any more. So it is true that many of these videos do disappear after a while. In my school days I read three books that influenced me. One was the book by James A. Coleman on relativity theory, The other one was the one by Einstein and Infeld «Die Evolution der Physik», and the third one was a translation of «Das Naturbild der heutigen Physik» by Werner Heisenberg. Later on I was also lucky enough to attend a lecture he held just a few years before he was gone. You can still get these books online. I always recommend them. But in these our hectic days very few seem to have time to read books any more. It’s all net based reading now. musicalchemy  September 13, 2016 at 1:24 am Peter Paul 1950, we cannot see light because we are light Log in to Reply Peter Paul 1950  September 13, 2016 at 1:39 am musicalchemy, thanks for the reminder, I’m quite aware of that. Trouble is we have to go beyond the clouds of unknowing to uncover who we are. But to get there you have to climb your mountain. Cheers. Peter Paul 1950  September 12, 2016 at 7:28 pm Let me drop a little tiny bomb here… Ian, may I bring something to your attention that nobody as of yet seems to have noticed or ever mentioned although it’s what I would recognize as the “smoking gun” or rather the “crackling geiger counter”? It is truly not only a “mind bending” indication that something quite unusual occoured in plain sight but is even screaming out loud for a valid explanation. Let me point out that something happened while everyone has been distracted and are starting to run after the birds and the bees and little tin cans that happen to be of more interest than what AMOS had to chip in on information. All you have to do is leave that Phantom Blob fly off to where it was last seen and go 6 more seconds beyond the boom and watch and hear what AMOS has to add to your x-ray theory. https://youtu.be/mjNuE1KfXJs Log in to Reply kaho  September 12, 2016 at 10:35 pm My take is that during that short fraction of a second the video frames show mechanical oscillations of the two towers. Each of the two towers displays a sinusoidal vibratory mode. The phenomenon lasts just a fraction of a second because such vibrations are damped due to internal friction of the material the towers are made from, which I assume is a steel framework. Some years ago I studied transverse wave motion of elastic beams, and the solution of the differential equation included motion of the same sinusoidal shape you can see in this video. But I had not noticed this phenomenon before you pointed it out just now. Thank you very much! But I did – of course – notice the shaking image, which I interpreted as vibrations of the camera. But a shaking camera can of course not explain the brief sinusoidal deformation of the towers. What I notice though, is that in addition to the brief deformation of the towers there is a simultaneous up and down motion of the ground, which is not so easily explained, except as an up and down motion of the camera. But why would the ground under the camera move up and down simultaneously with the whip-like transverse motion of the towers? After all, the towers are removed about 4 km from the camera. This I think might be explainable as the result of a seismic surface wave. Such waves travel maybe 10 times as fast as sound waves in air. Hence they would arrive at the site of the camera only a second or so after the shock that caused them. Ian Greenhalgh  September 12, 2016 at 11:50 pm I’ve forwarded this to Jeff to see what he thinks. Peter Paul 1950  September 13, 2016 at 1:06 am kaho, there are mechanical vibrations through the earthquakes, the pressurizing of the air, the resonating of the shockwaves that cause the camera to shake violently, but not enough to bend these towers. What you see is what we call a glitch in the electronics. Due to an electromagnetic pulse the flow of electrons are either blocked by the incoming magnetic field and act as a resister. The flow in the circuit is pushed back on one side and accelerated on the other. This means the incoming digital line of signals are delayed as the induction wave passes thru. The whole timing based on clocking the optical impulses to be delivered at the right time is distorted. Not the towers are being bent, the digital impulses are being pushed around within the circuit. It’s comparable with a tide or tsunamie forcing itself up a river and then retracting. That happens in all of the exposed microchips and even in the ccd. Since there are literally millions of microcircuits the regular or even flow of electricity doesn’t take place. Peter Paul 1950  September 13, 2016 at 1:26 am In realtime it is hardly noticable because I’ve pointed out that we only see at the rate of 18-20 images per second whereas the screen is shooting 30 images per second at you. The imaging process and display are tuned to their own frequencies that when a magnetic disturbance occurs, that is why there is a stretching and squeezing of the process in all directions. And if any hard radiation is involved then that too knocks off extra electrons causing effects like noise in the image that appear as speckles. And radiation has a nasty clicking sound to it if you’ve ever listened to a geiger counter. But it just so happens that the many acoustic explosions and echos with all their natural harmonies (quint, octave, terz) drown that nasty clicking swoosh that can be faintly heard at 1:19 in the slomo. I’m still trying to filter it with my sound editor to make it more audible if possible. But I need more time for that. So I repeat that not the towers were physically bent, it’s within the electronic that this visible ‘bending’ occurs. Those are electromagnetic fingerprints of an EMP. Period. And I have all the reason in the world to believe that AMOS has an RTG. Thanks for your patience. Raptor  September 12, 2016 at 5:34 am What is the latest on this debacle?

D.) Aliens. Enki vs Enlil. E.) An accident. Peter Paul 1950  September 12, 2016 at 5:25 am Ian, I hope you understand my personal approach to the subject you brought up that I too have a keen interest of what truly might have been the cause of the explosion, but my methodology is to examine and eliminate possible flaws in the line of information presented. Just believing that x-rays are involved because there seems to be visible proof is not enough when one can’t cancel out how things really function. For example we humans see with a speed rate of around 18 images per second. Birds have a rate of up to 200 images per second. The processes involved just to have that ability is difficult to understand in all of it’s complexity and yet we use it without thinking about it. Yet we are so focused on the inventions around us that give us the possibility to capture and store images and sound and send them around the world in seconds. But do we really know and understand how each and every part of equipment involved really works and functions? There are so many different levels of technology reaching outside of our realms of perception that go down to the level of atoms and molecules and make it possible to stretch the imagination into unknown and uncharted universes of life beyond life. Aren’t we just playing with all these ideas and possibilities trying to make sense of it all? A rocket explodes in a blinding moment and now we need more light. You know I have to give you credit for just bringing this information up to the level it now has. Log in to Reply Peter Paul 1950  September 12, 2016 at 5:34 am And to add a more philosophical touch to this great comment section I’d like to chip in these relatively unimportant words: An incredible family named Stein, There’s Gertrud, there’s Ep and there’s Ein Gertrude’s writing is hazy and Ep is plain crazy but nobody understands Ein kaho  September 12, 2016 at 10:34 am I agree with you. Credit goes out to Ian for taking up these odd events, and bringing them up to a level where we can «nachvollziehen» at least some of it. For example he mentioned a process, or an idea, an invention if you like, called Teller-Ulam. Well of course I had heard about Edward Teller, but not Ulam as far as I can recall. Besides, the majority of physics textbooks mention very little, if anything at all, about nuclear explosive devices, and with good reason. Well, they always include some chapters about nuclear reactors, that’s for sure. But for there rest … very little. And that is as it should be, God forbid that such terrors should fall into the wrong hands. But we as humans should pay attention. That’s the best way to to stay clear of trouble. And so now thanks to Ian I became motivated me to look into things I had not paid much attention to before. In particuliar I thought the Wikipedia article «History of the Teller–Ulam design» was worth while, also «Kernwaffentechnik» at the German Wikipedia site, or even the Cardozo Law Review article »fas org / sgp / eprint / cardozo,html». drbhelthi  September 12, 2016 at 1:46 am My concern relates with the quasi-denial of “UFOs”. My initial confirmation of such vehicles derived from the USAF radar facility on Fire Island, Alaska, 1955. An object appeared over the station, hovered at 2,000 ft., then accelerated to 10,000 ft with one sweep of the radar, at the time equalling 3,000 mph. In 1977 a USAF MSG explained to me the hangar on Wright-Patterson USAF base, that was guarded by AP with loaded weapons. Another interest since childhood is adults under the influence of alcohol. When “drunk,” if they can still talk intelligibly, they typically do not lie, although at times with disjointed speech. The following link is a video by a very sober neighbor of a retired, Area 51 employee. When sober, the retired employee revealed nothing about Area 51. After a power outage one night he was drunk and talked, revealing some experiences. The neighbor reveals the expose´ of the drunken, retired Area 51 employee. The neighbor´s presentation appears to be candid and reliable, drawing on my experience. The “propulsion” function of these vehicles is also nicely clarified in a few words by the retired, AREA 51 worker. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx6QMj-yOU4 Log in to Reply Dr. Abu-Bakr Susta  September 12, 2016 at 9:57 am Dr. B: Of course, “UFOs” are real — unless you can identify ALL flying objects. But that’s not it, is it? More to the point: No one at VT is denying or quasi-denying the existence of non-terrestrials. All that Ian & Jeff are saying is that there is a more terrestrial explanation for what happened to the SpaceX rocket. The object that you saw over Alaska in 1955 was probably a German craft or an early German-American craft, based on the research & discoveries of the Germans before, during after WW2. In Operation Paperclip, the German scientists were eventually able to harness the R&D and productive capacity of the U.S. to continue this R&D and production in a secret space program. If or since most if not all “UFOs” are man-made, why couldn’t or wouldn’t the U.S. military “inoculate” Area 51 guys with a sufficient amount of B.S. to go along with whatever truths that they might know? drbhelthi  September 21, 2016 at 7:50 am Dr.A-B: after some re-reads, comparing the first article with the follow-on article and the summary paragraph of this article, your “is it?” seems very appropriate to me. If your conclusion as to who built the majority of UFOs is accurate, you have access to information that I can not access.

Fusion experiment with visible lasers are highly controlled regarding an intensive focal spot in order to produce the high temperatures. When xrays have to penetrate an extremely chaotic plasma they will most likely diverge appart from being strongly absorbed and thus not maintain the needed narrow beamwidth to achieve high temperatures.

May I point out that it is also known among many more that our atmosphere shields us also from all the different rays emitted from the sun, our largest source of energy of all kinds pounding down on us every day. Just think of ultra violet beyond our spectrum of visibility that can cause so much harm to our health when we are exposed to an excess of it. It is said that bees have the ability to ‘see’ it, but can we really prove it to be so? Maybe we just have to believe what is said and written down on paper about the birds and the bees and the flowers that seem to glow in that range of electromagnetic frequencies. But Ian has emphasized x-ray LASER beams that possibly have other physical properties that bypass the shield of atmosphere that we are not truly aware of. The definition of x-ray refers to any kind of radiation that is beyond our human perception. And they are vibrations or frequencies on an infinite scale. When laser was first introduced to the public in the 60s it became the great sensation all over the world. Why? Because of it’s imaginable use as a weapon. Today it is almost a standard tool in the metal industry. A cutting edge tool. Do you realize that we cannot even see light? We only recognize it’s interaction on solid objects.

The four x-intervals then have the lengths -22.98 m, -22.11 m, -21.51 m, -21.24 m. And the resulting speeds (obtained by dividing by 0.04 s) are 574.5 m/s, 552.75 m/s, 537.75 m/s, 531.00 m/s, where the uncertainty is in the fourth digit because positions are accurate to only to maybe a pixel or two. These speed values are finally converted to km/h by multiplying with 3.6, giving the average horizontal speed in each time interval : 2068 km/h, 1990 km/h, 1936 km/h, 1912 km/h.

Yes, acceleration between points gives huge unstable values. I think the result is very sensitive because of the precision. I prefer determine only the average acceleration between entry and exit, and this gives 200 g which is already a lot… kaho  September 11, 2016 at 11:21 am The video I used was a different version from the video you used. The video I downloaded from brightcove (I gave the link earlier), has 25 frames per second. The video you used for your work contained more in-between images. What I did was to stop the VLC player, and then move forward frame by frame by means of the «E»-button. Then I made screen copies of each frame after having activated “full screen”. Hence my images have more pixels than yours (but fewer images). And so 1048 pixels = 70 m is correct the correct value here, because GraphicConverter (by Lemke Soft) allows one to count pixels by means of the rulers. The rulers in GraphicConverter use pixels as unit. And I wrote down the pixel-coordinates very carefully. I took a look at your Youtube video btw. Very nice work. And it would be very nice if you could quote your source for the video. Thank you !

Last item of Video Menu stores a frame into an image without changing resolution. It is also possible in View/Advanced Control to activate a small toolbar where a button directly stores the current frame. My spreadsheet is visible on my fb page. Peter Paul 1950  September 11, 2016 at 12:05 pm Chris, you could be quite right about the true frame rate being 29,97 of an original copy. But your’re not correct about the doubling the frame rate. I already pointed out why on Ian’s previous article here on VT space-xplosion-no-ufos-aliens-or-other-wierdness-involved/ – have a look at my comments there. The timeline steps are one part of the sequence, the other is the duration of a single frame! When you add a still image and set it’s duration to maybe 5 seconds it just happens that it may not end at the sequence mark set by the frame rate. What the codec does is what we call a frame drop, it extends that image till the the next time mark is due and thereby stretching the still image over an existing frame and thereby leaving it unprocessed and ignores it altogether. That’s what saves resources. If you say you have extended the clip to 60 fps up from 30 fps that is not the way it works. In reality you are stretching a single frame by doubling the length of time the image is on the screen. Tipping thru the frames one by one is tipping along the timeline whereas the software will only change the areas of a frame that differ from the previous one. If there is no change nothing is moving. It’s the capturing of the video that counts to get a higher frame rate. kaho  September 11, 2016 at 12:27 pm I did download some Youtube videos a couple of years ago, but of late I have not been able to do it (after they switched to the new html video capability).

Log in to Reply Ian Greenhalgh  September 11, 2016 at 6:44 am It’s not a lens flare caused by visible light, those look quite different. This one is caused by x-rays. Peter Paul 1950  September 11, 2016 at 10:32 am Ian, I understand quite well what your getting at since I learned my original trade at IBM. As a Galvaniser we not only had a phantastic laboratory to work in, we had to go on rotation through the whole production line of producing chips as well. The actual definition of the trade was later turned into Electro-Chemist due to the wide scope of electronics and chemistry. In the major ‘secret’ development departments we were also introduced to some of the most sophisticated equipment in use you can imagine. Even x-rays that were used to radiate through the silicium slices called waffers to check the crystal structure. On the exposed film one could clearly identify the grid structure of the atoms. Since the digital age we have the ccds (charged couple device) that gathers the light instead of on film and they are by nature sensitive to electromagnetic pulses. That’s why they have to be hardened by some protective shield around them. The ccd is nothing else than a microscopic array of photo diodes that react to light and can be produced for different invisible wavelengths. Just look at infrared or ultraviolet beyond our very thin capabilties of visible light. The flare can also have to do with the geometric array of die diodes of the ccd. Peter Paul 1950  September 11, 2016 at 10:50 am And the explosion itself wouldn’t be half as interesting it weren’t for the Phantom Blob everyone’s trying to explain away. I just spent the whole day pushing it around and made a short clip to study just the movement alone. I’ll be posting it on you tube as soon as I get my account set up. kaho  September 11, 2016 at 12:02 pm X-rays are electromagnetic waves, just like the light we can see with our eyes, but of a much shorter wave length. We, as humans are very lucky that air is transparent to EM waves in the visible range, for it allows us to see distant objects. Not necessarily so when it comes to the X-rays. For they are attenuated as they move through air. But the attenuation length depends on their wave length. One also distinguishes between hard X-rays and soft X-rays. The hard ones have a much shorter wavelength than the soft ones. There is a web site (web-docs.gsi.de) where they have set up an «X-Ray attenuation & absorption calculator», where the X-ray photonic energies are expressed in kilo electron Volts (keV), instead of using the wave length. But the thickness of the absorption layer has to be described in millimeters ! I entered first a thousand millimeters corresponding to 1 m, and indeed X-ays did get through as I specified «air» for the material. But then I entered 1000000 mm (6 zeroes) corresponding to 1 kilometer, and almost nothing got through! I tried energies ranging from 10 keV up to a thousand keV. Peter Paul 1950  September 11, 2016 at 1:34 pm kaho, yes you’re quite right about the electromagnetic natur in and around us, but that was Ian’s intention to get feedback with his x-ray vision. Every writer who wants to get attention has to produce at least some kind of meaning to the subject and Falcon 9 just gave him the best opportunity so speak his mind and be sure of an audience And that nasty little blob is giving others a greater chance to chip in with their extraterrestrial views and blues. If these were the days of Chernobyl in 1986 it wouldn’t even be doubted by anyone that could count to three. That was 30 years ago and here in Germany we are still not allowed to collect mushrooms or eat wild boar. Ian wouldn’t have the slightest problem proving his views either. I remember several docus that were revealed many years later. There exist films documenting the evacuation the following days after the explosion. You can clearly see the blobs on those frames of the film that were being hit by hot radiation and were overexposed. That way the proof was conserved over the years and if I recall correctly there could be some copies on you tube. From that one blast we just don’t have that kind of hardcopy that can be presented. A ccd just gets that extra impuls and the diodes go haywire for a few milliseconds but the stream of electrons don’t stay put for further interrogation. I am being exposed to radiation every day since. Peter Paul 1950  September 11, 2016 at 2:08 pm And to add to Chernobyl being so far off in the Ukraine doesn’t mean I’m ignorant of any kind of possabilties. I’m suffering from an underactive thyroid gland and need 200 mg of thyroxide a day. Look at Fukushima and study why people there are having the same problems. It’s major cause appears to be Caesium. Last week exactly the same time Falcon 9 had it’s bad day I was hit by several blasts of x-rays. I was out that evening and had a sudden blackout. The only thing I can hardly remember was that the people there called an ambulance and sometime later I remember talking to a woman who was trying to explain to me she had to make a couple of x-rays of my chest and neck. When I woke up Friday morning it slowly dawned on me that I was lying in a hospital bed. I got my fair share of x-rays for the day and went back home only to discover that here on VT x-rays were flying all around somewhere else. Do you know a safe place where I can take off my tin foil hat and breath some clean fresh air without those blobs flying around head? I’m just recovering from a major heart attack I had on May 30th and where they made some minor adjustments to the flow of body liquids by inserting 6 new stents to the one I already had. So feel with Ian and poor Falcon 9 who just didn’t make it while I’m having the time of my life. Sarcasm? What, me worry? kaho  September 11, 2016 at 3:48 pm Peter, you are right. In fact, I already saw a note explaining that the rectangular array of photo diodes will, under certain circumstances, function as a diffraction grating. This will cause the different wavelengths (colors) to be sent back at different angles, and then you will see different colors like small rainbows. But I do not know the exact details of this. The diffraction gratings I am used to, have light going in on one side, and come out at the other. In the video the flares form a shape like a huge letter X. Hence the number four is important here. Most cameras have 5 or 6 aperture blades, and then you will see 5 or 6 rays (double for odd numbers). But here you see only four. Could that be a typical feature of some of the newer video cameras? Peter Paul 1950  September 12, 2016 at 4:09 am kaho, Yes, you are getting very close to my point of view concerning that flare. In my opinion based on the fact that I had a great deal to do with the production of chips on an every day basis. I have to emphasize that I was then introduced to so much technology that was considered top secret. From the production line to the end product itself silicium chips the whole thing is based on miniaturizing electronics for special purposes. Because we are in the realm of atoms and their electric properties they are extremely vulnerable to static overload. That situation is also known as over exposure. Ian has brought up the subject concerning the flare, that’s fair enough. But to get a better understanding how it was produced you have to bear in mind he is pointing at an emitting source of energy he believes to be there, whereas I am pointing to the receiver of this energy: the ccd chip. The physical phenomena involved for transforming that source are ‘photovoltaic’ and piezoelectricity. The visible product we are all looking at is a realigned array of pixels that are visible to the human eye. The camera is the interface and transformer. Looking at that flare I tend to believe the array on the ccd is not square but hexagonal like a honeycomb. I haven’t measured it out if coincides with 60 degrees yet because I didn’t around to that yet. Peter Paul 1950  September 12, 2016 at 4:28 am keho, Then there is one more thing I tried to point out earlier in this whole debate concerning the ‘FLARE’ and that an X-RAY BURST causes more havoc that would be registered by the microchips involved and that is the SOUND track. I analyzed it quite closely because it is pure CD quality. Where is the electronic CLICK that can be HEARD if it really was an x-ray burst? There is none. Of all the pictures you could present to me I would always want to have the sound track that goes with it. If x-rays were really involved then their also should be a whole array of frequencies that go along with it that would create an electromagnetic pulse in any unprotected equipment in and around the recording devices in use. And that would inevitably cause a clear and audible interruption in the MICROPHONE, the most unprotected instrument out there. So where is the click I ask?

Hope you don’t mind that I enjoyed it and downloaded it for my private and secret archive. But one thing I’d like to ask is, does it really need that dramatic music to make it all that more appealing? Not that the music is disturbing to me – I studied classical music myself along the way and was a teacher for classical guitar for almost twenty years – but it distracted me from some of the essential parts of the math involved. Since I’m also an artist I’m very well acquainted with working kind of slomo – sometimes like 1 fpm or half that speed. In some cases I’ve even made it to up to 5-10 fpd and more. But nowadays it’s more like maybe 1-2 fpy. Here is one of my older galleries if you care to have a look: http://www.geocities.ws/ptacskovics/ If you read further down this comment section I uploaded the frames in question for those who might have trouble extracting them by themselves. For those who didn’t quite understand what I was just pointing at the translation and equation goes like this: fpm = frames per month, fpy = frames per year and fpd = frames per day. Does it sound okay when I mute the music…?

New link is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5yP3KiNs8Q kaho  September 11, 2016 at 1:01 am Thank you for your additional explanations ! One difficulty that ought to be apparent, is that alpha-particles (Helium nuclei) are very stable. One might guess as much, noting the fact that the alpha-particle is one of the typical end product of nuclear reactions. In fact, radioactivity consists mainly of alpha- beta- and gamma-rays. More specifically, one might calculate the mass difference “Delta m” between an alpha-particle and two deuterons. If one then multiplies the mass difference by the speed of light squared (c^2), the famous Einstein formula E = m*c^2 will give the energy a gamma-photon must possess in order to split the alpha-particle into two deuterons. In particular, it is here of interest to calculate the gamma-photon’s frequency and wavelength, in order to get an idea of the scale of things. The equations one uses to find frequency “nu” and wavelength “lambda” are :::: E = h * nu ::::: and ::::: lambda*nu = c ::::: , where h = Planck’s constant and c = the speed of light. Log in to Reply Peter Paul 1950  September 11, 2016 at 12:25 am Ian, very good explanation of your x-ray theory indeed. I think the discussion is needed and welcomed by the open minded to better understand the dots and connections. You may have noticed that I’m focused on that blob fly-by and the 16 frames involved and that thy coincide with the moment of the ignition. Now that I’ve been seeing each and every frame for hours on end it is very obvious that the explosion must have started outside of the rocket. During the explosion you might notice parts flying upwards that can’t possibly have come from the inside of the rocket as the satellite itself remains almost unmoved and topples downward almost 12 sec later. And as it appears hits the ground still in one piece coinciding nicely with the incoming blast. During those seconds there is a large piece of debris flying straight up over the flames between the rocket and it’s tower that consider it a dead giveaway that the fueling system and procedure are the issue. If the containers inside the rocket had of been the initial source of the explosion the following scenario would have looked quite different. There would have been much more debris flying around in all directions and the payload would have dropped off much sooner along the timeline. The sound track is very revealing because you actually hear a whole series of different explosions going off hidden by the fire and that nasty but unavoidable ‘smokescreen’ that tends to surround such mysterious events. Log in to Reply Ian Greenhalgh  September 11, 2016 at 12:52 am One big problem with analysing the available video is that it is all in the MPEG format which does not store every frame. Only a few frames are stored in their entirety and the majority of frame data is in the form of i-frames. The fuelling system could not be the source of the explosion because it wasn’t a molecular explosion but a nuclear one. The white plasma ball proves that. Also, there is very little blast, another giveaway that it was nuclear rather than molecular. The x-shaped lens flare proves the presence of X-rays which again, proves it was a nuclear event.

While Chinese citizens wait for all that to happen, plenty are instead turning to an app called Wi-Fi Skeleton Key that collects credentials for open Wi-Fi hotspots and shares them among users. The upshot is that users of the app can log into millions of hotspots around China, gratis. Which is a nice hack, especially given Chinese hotspots often ask for personal information before they allow connection. So nice a hack, in fact, that local outlet QQ reports that Wi-Fi Skeleton Key has just scored a $52 million VC injection that values the company at a billion bucks.

We'll find out. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Sep 11, 2016 at 2:13PM ANTONOV'S FLYING BARN -- THE AN-225 MRIYA. IMAGE SOURCE: MIKE FREER VIA WIKIMEDIA COMMONS. "Antonov Aviation Concern" is dead. Long live "the Antonov Company." That was the upshot of our article earlier this year detailing the trials and tribulations of the several subsidiaries of Ukrainian aerospace giant Antonov Aviation -- including the subsidiary that built and still operates the country's gigantic An-225 Mriya flying barn. (Actually, "Mriya" translates as "dream" -- but you've seen the picture. This thing is big.) All together now: How big is it? According to published statistics, the Antonov An-225 Mriya measures 276 feet in length with a 290-foot wingspan. It stands 54 feet tall, can lift 1.4 million pounds (including its own weight), and within its capacious hold has space for 46,000 cubic feet of cargo. It's strong enough to carry an entire Russian Buran-class space shuttle piggybacked atop it -- which in fact, was the purpose for which the An-225 was designed. Or it can carry a 200-ton natural gas generator or wind turbine (among its common uses ), or 33 fully grown African bull elephants  internally. It is, quite simply, the largest and most powerful transport aircraft on the planet -- bigger than Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 747 freighter, or Airbus' (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) gigantic A380 -- and has been so for nearly three decades. And now the An-225 is going back into production. From Ukraine with love Last month, IHS Jane's relayed the news that Antonov had signed a deal to license the designs and technologies needed to build the An-225 to the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AICC), for production within China. (Note: AICC may not be the same company as the "Aviation Industry Corporation of China" that is better known by the acronym "AVIC." Some sources suggest that despite the identical English translations of their names, these are actually two separate businesses.) In any case, whichever company it is acting through, China has agreed to assist Antonov in completing an incomplete An-225, on which production was halted in 2001. First flight on that one is expected to take place in 2019, at which point the population of operable Mriyas in the world will instantly double. Subsequently, production will shift to a new factory in Sichuan Province in China, which will commence churning out brand-new, modernized versions of the plane by the mid-2020s -- and in volume. What it means to investors Preeminent in the pantheon of global planemakers, Boeing's 747-8F transport is currently only the second biggest transport aircraft in the world. Its 138-ton payload capacity, while impressive, is quite simply dwarfed by the 200-ton payload of Antonov's An-225. An Airbus A380 freighter would probably outclass the Boeing 747-8F in both payload capacity and cargo volume -- but there isn't an A380 freighter variant on the market today. And as for Lockheed's C-5M, its payload is arguably comparable to that of Boeing's 747 -- but the C-5M is a purely military bird, which limits both the size of its market and the size of the profits it can generate for Lockheed. That leaves the race for the title of "world's biggest civilian freighter" a contest solely between Boeing and Antonov. To date, it's a contest that Antonov has won handily. But it's also a contest Antonov has only won technically. While the An-225 is certainly much bigger than the B747-4F, it's also been unique -- as in, there's only one An-225 flying, "and they ain't building any more of 'em." That changed last month. In just a few years, Chinese-made An-225s could be circling the globe in ever-increasing numbers, depriving Boeing once and for all of the title of "world's biggest civilian freighter [for all intents and purposes]" -- and depriving Boeing of some of the revenue, and profits, that it might have been able to earn as the maker of the world's most capable freighter jet. Going forward, some of those profits will be going to China, and via licensing fees, to Ukraine as well. Sorry, Boeing. You're officially No. 2.

But who will build them? Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Sep 11, 2016 at 10:13AM The Marines believe one day, a laser-armed F-35 will see the light of day. Image source: Lockheed Martin. It's been nearly two years since we first caught wind of a new project, sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), to put laser guns on warplanes. Two years since "the Pentagon's mad scientists department" announced they had hired Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) to develop a means to "counteract the effects of turbulence caused by the protrusion of a turret from an aircraft's fuselage," and permit a fighter jet to fire a laser weapon with precision. Two years later, the U.S. military has still not given up on its dream. Baby steps... Last year, we updated you on the military's decision to begin installation of laser guns on Lockheed Martin AC-130 gunships by 2020. The theory then was that a 200 kilowatt laser canon wouldn't take up much more room than a standard issue M102 howitzer -- which the AC-130 is already equipped with. And the Allison engines  on the AC-130 put out plenty of juice that could power a high-energy laser. And so, with just a little rejiggering, the Air Force thought it should be possible to switch out the howitzer, and replace it with a laser cannon. If that works out well, then the Air Force would see about shrinking the laser down in size, and perhaps putting it aboard a smaller warplane. And now we learn that the  Marine Corps is on board with this plan as well. Followed by a giant leap As website PopularMilitary.com revealed last week, the Marine Corps has plans to install laser weapons on F-35 fighter jets -- indeed, that it is "absolutely" committed to doing so. As with the Air Force, the Marines' initial intention is to mount laser weapons aboard large planes such as the KC-130 (an armed version  of Lockheed's C-130 Hercules, similar to the Air Force's AC-130). But "as soon as we could miniaturize them," says USMC Lt. Gen. Robert Walsh, the Corps would plan to begin installing lasers aboard F-35s, Cobra attack helicopters, and MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft as well. The reason: Economics. Projectile-based weapons -- be they guns, missiles, or cannons -- imply by necessity ordnance to fire from them. That ordnance must be transported to the battlefront (which costs money), loaded aboard a plane (which costs space), and then carried in flight (which costs fuel ... which in turn costs both money and space). In contrast, a laser is powered by the airplane's own engines, and its own fuel load. While that fuel certainly costs money, it's so efficient at creating destructive energy that even today, laser weapons are estimated to cost only about "a dollar-a-shot" to operate. And that's a whole lot cheaper than a missile. What it means to investors So first the Air Force, and now the Marines -- that's two-thirds of the operators of Lockheed's F-35 that are now on record and on board with the idea of arming warplanes with laser guns. (And we already know that the Navy has its own fondness for lasers). But who will be building these weapons for the military, and which companies should you be looking to invest in to profit from the transition from projectile weapons to lasers? Lockheed Martin is the most obvious candidate. Not only is it working on laser weapons for DARPA, it also builds the plane most people are saying will be the first platform to carry them -- the world-famous C-130 Hercules -- as well as the F-35 stealth fighter that the Marines hope will be the vehicle that laser guns eventually end up on. However, you also need to keep an eye on Boeing (NYSE:BA), which ran the Pentagon's last large-scale airborne laser project, and on Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) as well. Both Raytheon and Northrop partnered with Boeing on the Airborne Laser project before its cancellation in 2009.  And then there's Kratos Defense (NASDAQ:KTOS), a small company that's been making a lot of news in the drone space lately -- and also coordinated the Navy's effort to put a laser cannon on one of its warships. Basically, it's hard to name a company in the defense industry today that is not actively researching laser weapons. But the place to start your research is still Lockheed Martin. With a hand in both the development of the laser gun itself, and the platform(s) it will be mounted on, Lockheed is the single company burning this candle at both ends -- in a good way.

ROS LBoard 1 ‘We can’t stop Umno members, who belong to NGOs, taking part’ Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Ukraine envoy gives priority to finding MH17 culprits Bernama | September 11, 2016 Using all possible means, we will bring them to justice even if it takes months, years and even decades, says Ukraine's new ambassador. KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia and Ukraine have cemented an agreement to set up a joint commission to expand cooperation in the military-technical sphere, says Ukraine’s new ambassador to Malaysia, Olexander Nechytaylo. He said that the move was discussed and agreed in a meeting held between Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko with Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein when the president made his maiden visit to Malaysia in August. “The defence cooperation has been an area where both countries have been working together with, for quite sometime now … and with the latest high-level visit, both sides are making the move into a reality,” he told Bernama. The newly appointed ambassador said that the defence ministries of both countries were currently focusing on the preparations to organise the commission’s first meeting and would soon appoint co-chairs from both sides as agreed. In line with the enhanced cooperation, Nechytaylo said that Ukraine was also keen to share with Malaysia its expertise in military equipment and latest aircraft development and technology. The ambassador highlighted that the commission would benefit both countries, pointing out that it was also in line with the Ukrainian government’s policy to intensify interaction with Malaysia in the defence and military sector. Nechytaylo, who presented his credentials to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on July 18, said that he will strive to further deepen Malaysia-Ukraine diplomatic and bilateral relations. “The most important ‘work’ for me now is to keep the relations close in order for us to find the perpetrators responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. Using all possible means, we will bring them to justice even if it takes months, years and even decades,” he said. The Boeing B777 aircraft, which was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur and carrying 298 passengers, including crew, was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014. On people-to-people contact, the ambassador said that he would want to engage and employ both government and private sectors to attract more Ukrainians to Malaysia and vice versa. And as both nations have agreed to expedite the setting up of a joint trade commission to enhance two-way business and trade potentials, the envoy said that his work priority would also be on how to set up initial networks, which could be distinctly extended in creating more businesses and trade agreements. Malaysia, which is currently Ukraine’s top 10 trading partner in the Asia-Pacific region, established diplomatic ties with Ukraine on March 3, 1992 and have since enjoyed friendly and cordial relations.     Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

The star studded side of Sai Walker, Elizabeth Moceiwai, Losalini and Loretta Kotoisuva take on the Fiji men’s team of Arun Kumar, Semesa Naiseruvati, Rajnesh Prasad and Kushal Pillay. The women’s team suffered a 14-10 loss at the hands of Team Fiji Airways Airbus, which comprised of Dan Vinod, Bobby Prasad, David Aitcheson and Sitiveni Tikoisuva during the first round. They bounced back to record two wins in their respective pool games; 20-7 against Fiji Airways Boeing and 19-12 over Lautoka Masters. The Fiji men’s team won their two matches against Lautoka Babaas 18-9, and 14-12 over Geo Tech which was forced to an extra end. Tournament coordinator Tikoisuva said the event would be exciting taking into consideration the depth of the players. “The quarterfinals will be an interesting competition as the pool games ended on a high note. “The competition level has gone up and that shows the development in each player and brings the best of the bowlers to the green.” Other quarterfinals-  Samuela Tui’s Botswana take on Santok Singh’s William and Goslings, Nadi Combat take on Suva Surua while Fiji Airways Airbus meet Geo Tech. The quarterfinals start at 9.30am with the finals in the afternoon.

Tycoon Henry Ford had it moved brick-by-brick to his remarkable Greenfield Village project, near Detroit. The same applies to other sights around the village: the courthouse where Abraham Lincoln practised in Springfield, Illinois; the house from Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania, where Henry John Heinz went from selling bottled horseradish to ketchup fame. Motor city: Part of the collection at the Henry Ford, a museum founded by the car tycoon On its own, Greenfield Village would be one of the best museums in the United States. It’s brilliantly presented and has some seriously high-quality exhibits. But the astonishing thing is that it is a mere side dish to the main course. The Henry Ford is named in honour of the man who founded it, and it is utterly absorbing. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next No pain, no gain on California's mighty Lake Tahoe: Get in a...

Share this article Share 238 shares Some things are to be expected – the section on motoring with lots of old Fords, for example.  But it dives into other things, such as the history of the interstate system, how motels have changed over the years, and also includes a famous neon-lit McDonald’s sign. There’s a collection of presidential cars, including the Ford Lincoln that JFK was riding in when he was assassinated. What’s even more remarkable is that the limo was later revamped with some armour and used by Lyndon B. Johnson. An old McDonald’s sign at the museum is one of the most famous installations at the attraction Henry Ford, pictured at the Indianapolis Speedway in 1932 The aviation section starts with information on how early pilots used railroad tracks as navigational aids and how the first stewardesses were hired after one feisty woman marched into the Boeing offices and suggested the idea. The American history section is superbly presented, with independence, the Civil War and the civil rights movement given enough detail to tell a gripping story, but not too much so that you feel like you’re drowning in the dull bits. The wow-factor objects keep coming, from George Washington’s camp bed to the seat from Ford’s Theatre used by Abraham Lincoln when he was shot.  But most affecting of all is a green and yellow bus. You’re free to saunter on board, and a voice is heard over the speakers.  The voice belongs to Rosa Parks, and she’s explaining why she refused to give up her seat to a white person in Montgomery, Alabama. Heaven knows how they found it, but this is the bus where it happened, starting protests that would lead to the end of racial segregation. Henry Ford may be most famous for his cars, but he has left an astonishing cultural legacy too. TRAVEL FACTS  Combined tickets for the Henry Ford and Greenfield Village, in Dearborn, near Detroit, cost $36.50 (£27) – visit thehenryford.org.  The Dearborn Inn, built by the Ford Motor Co, is a historic landmark in its own right. Rooms cost from $173 (£130) – visit marriott.co.uk.  Delta (delta.com) offers return flights from Heathrow to Detroit from £668.  Read more: The Henry Ford – Museum, Greenfield Village & Rouge Factory Hotel Booking and Reservations | Find Rooms in the UK | Marriott Hotels delta.com Share or comment on this article e-mail 238 shares Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Good pup!

Share via facebook dialog Share via Pinterest Fifteen years after September 11, how much safer are we? Every September 11 anniversary prompts an examination of what has—or hasn’t—happened in the ongoing quest to make air travel safer. And while the U.S. has spent an estimated nearly $100 billion to secure airports and airplanes since the attack, one thing is certain: more needs to be done. Fifteen years ago, right after the attacks, a security manifesto was quickly drawn up to ensure that terrorists would never again be able to commandeer an airliner and turn it into a guided missile, as 19 hijackers succeeded in doing that day. And even before Congress had a chance to act—the law creating the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was passed that November—airlines and airports were rushing to make the most urgent fixes: hardening cockpit doors with bulletproof material, updating no-fly lists, and closing other gaps. While the saga of the TSA, and all its embarrassing lapses and misfires over the years, is well-documented, the fact is, as of this writing, there has been no successful terrorist attack on any U.S. airliner since September 11. (There have been some close calls, like the infamous “underwear bomber” who tried to take down a Northwest Airlines plane with his explosives-laden briefs in 2009.) Most experts agree that the odds of another hijacking are remote. But terrorists adapt, and the threat has shifted to other, less-secure areas of the airport: check-in lobbies, checkpoint entrances, and arrivals areas, as the attacks on airports in Brussels, and Istanbul, have shown. And the downing of a Russian airliner over Egypt last year was a reminder that a bombing remains the most serious in-flight threat. In the U.S., epic waits at checkpoints this past spring caused tens of thousands of passengers to miss flights, and in the process, created long queues—a new weakness that many experts say isn’t being adequately addressed. With this in mind, it’s worth looking back to see what happened to that first blueprint for how to fix airport security, and what it suggests for the future: Protecting the aircraft The clear success has been sealing off the cockpit; since 9/11, pilots remain locked behind impregnable doors for the duration of the flight (with obvious exceptions for restroom breaks, but flight attendants are trained to protect the cockpit during those intervals). The second step was to beef up the air marshal workforce, which had dwindled to a minuscule number of guards—fewer than 100—by 2001. That part has been less successful; the program has reportedly been plagued by low morale and high attrition, although the details of just how many are employed in this job are classified (it’s estimated to be more than 5,000.) Pilots, however, have picked up some of the slack with the “Federal Flight Deck Officer” program, which permits them to carry guns with the proper training. What’s next: Double doors to fully protect the cockpit are under consideration at Airbus and Boeing Separating the “known” travelers A major aim of the post-9/11 overhaul was to harness better intelligence and more sophisticated pre-screening to separate the "known" travelers from those who might warrant more scrutiny. This made a lot of people uncomfortable, as it seemed to put us on the slippery slope to unacceptable profiling techniques. Still, one long-sought goal that eluded officials for years was to create a “known traveler” program that would give expedited treatment to travelers who voluntarily submitted to a background check. The three-year-old TSA PreCheck program has pretty much met that goal; after a slow start, it now has 3.6 million members. But credit for this should really should go to Customs and Border Protection, which got there first with its Global Entry fast-track screening for arriving passengers, which showed the TSA how this could be done without invading people’s privacy. What’s next: To meet its goal of 25 million enrollees, TSA is considering allowing people to enroll in PreCheck online and via smartphone app Federalizing and professionalizing the screener workforce On 9/11, there were fewer than 20,000 airport screeners, many of them poorly-trained, minimum-wage contract workers who were hired by the airlines. Immediately, they became scapegoats for the attacks, and for the apparent ease with which the hijackers were able to board planes with box-cutters. One of the very first responses from the government was to kick the airlines off the security beat, and to put the government in charge—that’s what gave us the TSA. In hindsight, that may have been an overreaction: On 9/11, the box-cutters used for deadly effect were, in fact, legal under the airlines’s own rules, and the computerized pre-screening system in place that day did flag a few of the hijackers for added screening of their bags—but, tragically, the attackers knew all too well how to evade the system. Now, there are around 42,000 screeners, who are federal employees represented by a union. But one thing hasn’t changed: the job is tedious and frustrating at times, and, as various covert tests have shown, screeners continue to miss weapons at a disturbingly high rate. The TSA’s response has been to double down on training and re-training; as of this writing, the jury is still out on the results. What’s next: Some members of Congress are pushing for privatization of the screener workforce, and more airports are likely to take advantage of a pilot program to test this approach Upgrading technology screening for weapons and bombs Before 9/11, most checked luggage, particularly on domestic flights, went straight onto the plane without being scrutinized for explosives; the following year saw the arrival of those mini-van sized detection machines in airport lobbies, and, in one of the biggest investments made to date, airlines and airports spent hundreds of millions to build much faster underground, or “in-line," bag screening systems. But the machinery to screen people has proved more of a challenge: The first generation of highly controversial body-scanning machines had to be scrapped, and while TSA insists the current machines are safe, worries about the health effects of exposure to radiation persist. What’s next: New detection equipment that can better detect liquid explosives and other dangerous materials—meaning the lines would move faster for all us Video Highlights Share this story Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Email Recommended for You Travel Inspiration The 20 Most Beautiful College Campuses in America by Laura Vogel Read Now Follow CNTraveler Get Traveler Delivered Subscribe Give a Gift International Orders Get Our Digital Edition Renew Subscription FAQ Manage Your Subscription Contact Us Subscribe Give a Gift International Orders Get Our Digital Edition Renew Subscription FAQ Manage Your Subscription Contact Us Helpful LinksAdvertise with CNTravelerCNTraveler Media KitReprints & PermissionsSite Map More from Condé NastCondé Nast Traveler UKCondé Nast Traveler SpainCondé Nast StoreCareers at Condé Nast Condé Nast Visit Our Sister SitesAllureArchitectural DigestArs TechnicaBackchannelBon AppétitBrides.comCondé Nast TravelerEpicuriousGlamourGolf DigestGolf WorldGQGQ StylePitchforkSelfTeen VogueThe New YorkerThe SceneVanity FairVogueWWired © 2016 Condé Nast.

A Sept. 1 accident destroyed a SpaceX Falcon rocket and its payload during a test on the launch pad. RED HUBER , FLORIDA TODAY By MARCIA DUNN / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. – SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk is calling last week’s launch pad accident the “most difficult and complex failure” in the company’s 14-year history. After a week of public silence, Musk said via Twitter that the company is still investigating the accident, its second in just 15 months. A massive fireball erupted during a prelaunch test Sept. 1 at the company’s main launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The Falcon rocket and a satellite were destroyed, and the pad was damaged. Ground crews were fueling the Falcon for a brief test-firing of its engines, two days before its scheduled liftoff. The blast rocked the launch pad – which had been cleared of workers for the test-firing – and shook buildings several miles away at NASA’s neighboring Kennedy Space Center. The sound of explosions continued for several minutes and black smoke billowed into the morning sky. Particularly puzzling, according to Musk, is “the quieter bang” heard a few seconds before what he is calling a fireball, not an explosion. He said the bang may have come from the rocket or something else. “Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation,” he said in a tweet. “Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source.” In the immediate aftermath, Musk said the trouble appeared to originate around the upper stage’s oxygen tank. He made no mention of that in his tweets posted early Friday EDT. When pressed for further information Friday, the California-based SpaceX said there was nothing new to share for now. “We are continuing to thoroughly investigate last week’s loss of Falcon 9, with support from the FAA, NASA, the U.S. Air Force and industry experts,” SpaceX spokesman Dex Torricke-Barton said in an email Friday. “Our priority is to safely and reliably return to flight.” The core investigation team consists of about 20 people, more than half of them representing federal agencies and industry. SpaceX’s vice president for flight reliability, Hans Koenigsmann, is heading it up. SpaceX is urging anyone with audio, photos or video of the accident to send the material to report(at)spacex.com for use in the investigation. “Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation,” Musk said on Twitter. “Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years.” A co-founder of PayPal, the 45-year-old Musk also runs Tesla Motors, the electric car maker, and is chairman of SolarCity, a solar energy company. His private space company had been on a roll, with eight launches already accomplished in 2016, two of them space station supply runs for NASA. The company had also, last December, pulled off the world’s first landing of a booster rocket used in an orbital mission, and had been repeating the success. It was planning to use a recycled rocket for an upcoming satellite launch. SpaceX was attempting to catch up on launches following an accident in June 2015 that grounded the Falcon 9 rocket for six months. That accident, two minutes into a delivery mission for the International Space Station, was blamed on a support strut that broke loose inside the upper stage. The issue was said to have been fixed. Now, with more than 70 launches in the wings worth $10 billion, SpaceX said it can rely on its two other launch pads if necessary, one at Kennedy and one in California, once the Falcon rocket is ready to fly again. Both pads are undergoing construction and should be ready soon. Facebook had planned to use the lost satellite – an Israeli-made communications satellite – to expand internet service in Africa. For now, NASA isn’t saying much publicly about the SpaceX mishap. NASA is counting on SpaceX and Boeing to start ferrying astronauts to the space station; even before SpaceX’s Sept. 1 accident, next year’s targeted launch date had been in jeopardy. “Clearly this incident is a setback for SpaceX,” said Dale Skran, the National Space Society’s executive vice president. At the same time, he noted in a statement earlier this week that NASA was wise to hire multiple companies for cargo and crew transport, not only from a competitive standpoint but for backup. At the time of the explosion, NASA’s Osiris-Rex spacecraft was just a mile away, awaiting its own launch to chase down an asteroid. Both NASA and rocket maker United Launch Alliance conducted extra checks to make certain nothing was damaged by the blast before Thursday’s successful liftoff. NASA launch director Tim Dunn was sympathetic and earlier in the week praised SpaceX’s resilience. “It’s nothing that any of us ever want to see,” he said. “However, it is part of our business that has very harsh consequences.” Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular O.C.

After a 10 year old ban on foreign arms sales expired two years ago, the country had hoped that a submarine deal with Australia involving MHI would be their first major arms export agreement, but talks broke down and the $50 billion contract went to China. For a country that is inexperienced with global arms sales, an agreement with the U.S. may be a significantly easier entry point and would show proof of concept to the world's arms buyers. "For Japan, America would be the easiest market to break into," said Steve Rogers, Director of Asset Allocation at Orix Capital Trading in a note to clients. "MHI are the leading defence contractor in the country and are desperate to move forward into the world market now that their restrictions have been lifted," he added. Mitsubishi make arms for the nation's Self Defence Forces (SDF) and are famous for their production of the Zero fighter which saw action in WW2. The firm will be hoping their move into the world market might give it more control over the intellectual property rights of its technology, which are currently under the remit of the SDF. MHI's Defence and Space Systems chief Hisakazu Mizutani said the talks with the U.S. firm are "in early stages but ongoing" and the deal would be overseen by the Japanese MoD. He also hinted that MHI were approached by the U.S. firm regarding the possible partnership to design and build a new armoured personnel carrier containing state of the art technology. MHI have had a close relationship with several American defence contractors for many years and has previously partnered with firms like Boeing and Lockheed Martin for development of the SDF's modern military aircraft. The development of an armoured vehicle would create brand new opportunities for MHI to enter the global stage in an exciting new area. Tanks have long been seen as a dated military vehicle and smaller, lighter and more versatile armoured cars and trucks are considered to be the future of ground warfare. New foreign business could attract buyers to other MHI products such as their gear technology and amphibious lines. # # # Read more Press Releases from Kunio Sumi: Orix Capital Trading - U.S. Stocks Balanced with Energy Down and Biotech Up Orix Capital Trading - Japanese Output Achieves Long Overdue Increase Comment on this story...

After a week of public silence, Musk said via Twitter that the company is still investigating the accident, its second in just 15 months. A massive fireball erupted during a prelaunch test Sept. 1 at the company’s main launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The Falcon rocket and a satellite were destroyed, and the pad was damaged. Ground crews were fueling the Falcon for a brief test-firing of its engines, two days before its scheduled liftoff. The blast rocked the launch pad _ which had been cleared of workers for the test-firing _ and shook buildings several miles away at NASA’s neighboring Kennedy Space Center. The sound of explosions continued for several minutes and black smoke billowed into the morning sky. Particularly puzzling, according to Musk, is “the quieter bang” heard a few seconds before what he is calling a fireball, not an explosion. He said the bang may have come from the rocket or something else.

He made no mention of that in his tweets posted early Friday EDT. When pressed for further information Friday, the California-based SpaceX said there was nothing new to share for now. “We are continuing to thoroughly investigate last week’s loss of Falcon 9, with support from the FAA, NASA, the US Air Force and industry experts,” SpaceX spokesman Dex Torricke-Barton said in an email Friday. “Our priority is to safely and reliably return to flight.” The core investigation team consists of about 20 people, more than half of them representing federal agencies and industry. SpaceX’s vice president for flight reliability, Hans Koenigsmann, is heading it up. SpaceX is urging anyone with audio, photos or video of the accident to send the material to report(at)spacex.com for use in the investigation. “Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation,” Musk said on Twitter. “Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years.” A co-founder of PayPal, the 45-year-old Musk also runs Tesla Motors, the electric car maker, and is chairman of SolarCity, a solar energy company. His private space company had been on a roll, with eight launches already accomplished in 2016, two of them space station supply runs for NASA. The company had also, last December, pulled off the world’s first landing of a booster rocket used in an orbital mission, and had been repeating the success. It was planning to use a recycled rocket for an upcoming satellite launch. SpaceX was attempting to catch up on launches following an accident in June 2015 that grounded the Falcon 9 rocket for six months. That accident, two minutes into a delivery mission for the International Space Station, was blamed on a support strut that broke loose inside the upper stage. The issue was said to have been fixed. Now, with more than 70 launches in the wings worth $10 billion, SpaceX said it can rely on its two other launch pads if necessary, one at Kennedy and one in California, once the Falcon rocket is ready to fly again. Both pads are undergoing construction and should be ready soon. Facebook had planned to use the lost satellite _ an Israeli-made communications satellite _ to expand internet service in Africa. For now, NASA isn’t saying much publicly about the SpaceX mishap. NASA is counting on SpaceX and Boeing to start ferrying astronauts to the space station; even before SpaceX’s Sept. 1 accident, next year’s targeted launch date had been in jeopardy. “Clearly this incident is a setback for SpaceX,” said Dale Skran, the National Space Society’s executive vice president. At the same time, he noted in a statement earlier this week that NASA was wise to hire multiple companies for cargo and crew transport, not only from a competitive standpoint but for backup. At the time of the explosion, NASA’s Osiris-Rex spacecraft was just a mile away, awaiting its own launch to chase down an asteroid. Both NASA and rocket maker United Launch Alliance conducted extra checks to make certain nothing was damaged by the blast before Thursday’s successful liftoff. NASA launch director Tim Dunn was sympathetic and earlier in the week praised SpaceX’s resilience. “It’s nothing that any of us ever want to see,” he said. “However, it is part of our business that has very harsh consequences.” Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaBanks to work normal hours on Saturday, but only senior citizens can exchange old notes IndiaDemonetisation: Misuse of bank account for black money deposit to invite govt action IndiaLong queues outside banks a ‘serious issue’, says SC on demonetisation IndiaDemonetisation: Cash against debit swipe takes off at 700 petrol pumps IndiaNavy rubbishes Pak Navy claim that it stopped Indian submarine from entering waters EntertainmentForce 2 movie review: John Abraham, Sonakshi Sinha film is Bond-Bourne rehash EntertainmentChris Martin parties with Shah Rukh Khan, Sussanne Khan and Sridevi's daughters, see inside pics EntertainmentIt's November 18, Salman Khan's wedding day, see pics EntertainmentIulia Vantur reveals what she had to sacrifice to live in India.

The losses were broad-based, hitting industrials and energy shares especially hard, after Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said in a speech that higher rates were needed to prevent the economy from overheating. A second Fed official, Governor Daniel Tarullo, signaled openness to a rate hike in 2016 in an interview with CNBC. “Given the European Central Bank commentary yesterday as well as some Fed speakers today, it appears more likely that the Fed and the world is closer to lessening the amount of easy money,” said David Levy, portfolio manager at Republic Wealth Advisors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 400 points, or 2.1 percent to 18,085.45. The broad-based S&P 500 shed 2.5 percent to 2,127.81, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 2.5 percent at 5,125.91. US stocks have rallied to records in the last two months after plunging following the June 23 British vote to exit the European Union. But analysts have cautioned that a correction was possible given the importance of central bank-generated liquidity to the stock market gains. Industrial companies Boeing, Caterpillar and General Electric all shed 3 percent or more, while oil giant Chevron fell 2.7 percent and ExxonMobil 2.5 percent. Technology shares were also generally weak, with Apple shedding 2.3 percent, Facebook 2.4 percent and Twitter 3.2 percent. Large banks generally outperformed, with higher rates from the Federal Reserve expected to boost their lending margins. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase shares kept losses to under 1.0 percent. But Wells Fargo slumped 2.4 percent a day after regulators fined the banking giant more than $185 million due to allegations the bank secretly opened millions of fake accounts without customers’ knowledge. General Motors sank 3.9 percent after it issued a recall notice for 4.3 million cars and trucks worldwide due to a dangerous electronic fault that could prevent airbag deployment in an accident.

The company is recalling the new device worldwide after several dozen caught fire. Samsung promises new phones to users after reports of Galaxy Note catching fire The South Korean technology giant issued a statement on its website advising local users to visit the company’s service centres to receive rental phones for temporary use. Samsung plans to provide Galaxy Note 7 devices with new batteries in South Korea starting on September 19. The US Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday warned airline passengers not to turn on or charge Galaxy Note 7s during flights and also not to put the smartphone in checked bags. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 new smartphone is being recalled (Picture: Reuters) Samsung is planning to recall 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 phones worldwide. The FAA also warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing ‘recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung’ about the devices. Man who digitally raped schoolgirl, 14, while another pupil filmed avoids jail It is extremely unusual for the FAA to warn passengers about a specific product. Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the phones after an investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Australian airline companies were among the first to take measures. Qantas has asked passengers not to switch the Note 7 devices on and not to charge them during flights, its spokeswoman Sharna Rhys-Jones said. The devices have been recalled in South Korea (Picture: AP) Media reports said other Australian airlines took a similar step, including Jetstar Airways and Virgin Australia. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. It is one of the most expensive line-ups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users’ eyes to unlock the phone. This baby cheetah and puppy are being raised as BFFs and it’s adorable Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone. The Note 7 is not the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing’s 787 jetliner. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once the overheating starts, it can lead to ‘thermal runaway’ in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but does not always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being put out.
